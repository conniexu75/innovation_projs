https://openalex.org/W2029353650,"HIV-1 sequences were analyzed to estimate the timing of the ancestral sequence of the main group of HIV-1, the strains responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Using parallel supercomputers and assuming a constant rate of evolution, we applied maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods to unprecedented amounts of data for this calculation. We validated our approach by correctly estimating the timing of two historically documented points. Using a comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment, we estimated the date of the last common ancestor of the main group of HIV-1 to be 1931 (1915–41). Analysis of a gag gene alignment, subregions of envelope including additional sequences, and a method that relaxed the assumption of a strict molecular clock also supported these results."

Selective transport is accomplished by direct interaction of the KIF17 tail with a PDZ domain of mLin-10 (Mint1/X11), which is a constituent of a large protein complex including mLin-2 (CASK), mLin-7 (MALS/Velis), and the NR2B subunit. This interaction, specific for a neurotransmitter receptor critically important for plasticity in the postsynaptic terminal, may be a regulatory point for synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2096686163,"The existence of dimers and oligomers for many G protein-coupled receptors has been described by us and others. Since many G protein-coupled receptor subtypes are highly homologous to each other, we examined whether closely related receptors may interact with each other directly and thus have the potential to create novel signaling units. Using μ- and δ-opioid receptors, we show that each receptor expressed individually was pharmacologically distinct and could be visualized following electrophoresis as monomers, homodimers, homotetramers, and higher molecular mass oligomers. When μ- and δ-opioid receptors were coexpressed, the highly selective synthetic agonists for each had reduced potency and altered rank order, whereas endomorphin-1 and Leu-enkephalin had enhanced affinity, suggesting the formation of a novel binding pocket. No heterodimers were visualized in the membranes coexpressing μ- and δ-receptors by the methods available. However, hetero-oligomers were identified by the ability to co-immunoprecipitate μ-receptors with δ-receptors and vice versa using differentially epitope-tagged receptors. In contrast to the individually expressed μ- and δ-receptors, the coexpressed receptors showed insensitivity to pertussis toxin and continued signal transduction, likely due to interaction with a different subtype of G protein. In this study, we provide, for the first time, evidence for the direct interaction of μ- and δ-opioid receptors to form oligomers, with the generation of novel pharmacology and G protein coupling properties."
https://openalex.org/W1910215337,"The Precautionary Principle has become enshrined in international law, and is the basis for European environmental legislation. However, decisions have been controversial, and the principle itself lacks clear definition. A recent commentary by the European Commission offers guidelines for politically transparent application of the principle, while emphasizing the need for careful review of relevant scientific data. Recent precautionary policies for limiting public exposure to radio-frequency energy shows that the principle can be applied in a way that does not conflict with traditional exposure guidelines. Major uncertainties still remain in the standard of proof needed to invoke the principle."
https://openalex.org/W2086482588,"Fasting causes lipolysis in adipose tissue leading to the release of large quantities of free fatty acids into circulation that reach the liver where they are metabolized to generate ketone bodies to serve as fuels for other tissues. Since fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes in the liver are transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), we investigated the role of PPARα in the induction of these enzymes in response to fasting and their relationship to the development of hepatic steatosis in mice deficient in PPARα (PPARα−/−), peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX−/−), and in both PPARα and AOX (double knock-out (DKO)). Fasting for 48–72 h caused profound impairment of fatty acid oxidation in both PPARα−/− and DKO mice, and DKO mice revealed a greater degree of hepatic steatosis when compared with PPARα−/− mice. The absence of PPARα in both PPARα−/− and DKO mice impairs the induction of mitochondrial β-oxidation in liver following fasting which contributes to hypoketonemia and hepatic steatosis. Pronounced steatosis in DKO mouse livers is due to the added deficiency of peroxisomal β-oxidation system in these animals due to the absence of AOX. In mice deficient in AOX alone, the sustained hyperactivation of PPARα and up-regulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation and microsomal ω-oxidation systems as well as the regenerative nature of a majority of hepatocytes containing numerous spontaneously proliferated peroxisomes, which appear refractory to store triglycerides, blunt the steatotic response to fasting. Starvation for 72 h caused a decrease in PPARα hepatic mRNA levels in wild type mice, with no perceptible compensatory increases in PPARγ and PPARδ mRNA levels. PPARγ and PPARδ hepatic mRNA levels were lower in fed PPARα−/− and DKO mice when compared with wild type mice, and fasting caused a slight increase only in PPARγ levels and a decrease in PPARδ levels. Fasting did not change the PPAR isoform levels in AOX−/− mouse liver. These observations point to the critical importance of PPARα in the transcriptional regulatory responses to fasting and in determining the severity of hepatic steatosis.

When glucose availability is low during periods of starvation, the TG stored in adipose tissue are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids (FFA) and mobilized into plasma to reach liver where they play a major role in energy production (1Seitz H.J. Mullerm M.J. Krone E. Tarnowski W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Eaton S. Bartlett K. Pourfarazam M. Biochem.

McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1501-1533Google Scholar). In liver, the influxed fatty acids are oxidized predominantly by the mitochondrial β-oxidation system and to a lesser extent by the peroxisomal β-oxidation, as well as by CYP4A-catalyzed microsomal ω-oxidation pathways (4Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Aoyama T. Hardwick J.P. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. J.

Biophys. 1993; 307: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Partial oxidation of fatty acids by mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation systems in liver leads to the production of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), which then condenses with itself to form ketone bodies. Ketone bodies generated in liver are exported out of the liver to serve as fuels for other tissues such as the skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain during starvation. Thus, alternate use of carbohydrate and fatty acids to produce ATP is well regulated, and this regulatory energy consumption is referred to as “glucose fatty acid cycle” that requires the maintenance of efficient hepatic fatty acid oxidation. It is estimated that in the adult, FFA and their ketone body derivatives provide ∼80% of caloric requirements after 24 h of fasting (7Berk P.D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1607-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fasting causes a more dramatic depletion of carbohydrate energy source in infants and children, and as a consequence they exhibit greater dependence on efficient FFA-dependent ketogenesis during starvation, underscoring the importance of fatty acid oxidation in energy metabolism (8Taroni F. Uziel G. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At present, several genetically determined metabolic defects at the individual enzyme level in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation pathways have been identified, and individuals with these defects remain essentially asymptomatic as far as basal energy metabolism is concerned under normal feeding conditions (8Taroni F. Uziel G. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, during conditions that lead to short term fasting, they manifest severe hypoketotic hypoglycemia, increased plasma FFA, variable degree of hepatic steatosis, and sudden death in early life because of their inability to oxidize FFAs in liver due to enzymatic defects (8Taroni F. Uziel G. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These metabolic diseases have provided valuable insights pertaining to the role of individual enzymes in fatty acid oxidation and energy utilization. It is now well recognized that fasting causes a rapid transcriptional activation of genes encoding mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and microsomal fatty acid oxidation in liver in healthy individuals (9Nagao M. Parimoo B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24114-24124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 583-595Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar). These observations point to the importance also of regulatory step(s) controlling the levels of inducible fatty acid oxidation enzymes. Any defect in the inducibility of these enzymes can also impact on the energy metabolism and degree of hepatic steatosis in response to fasting similar to those encountered with metabolic defects at the enzymatic level. Fatty acid oxidation occurs in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and microsomes, and some of the critical enzymes of these oxidation systems are transcriptionally controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (11Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). PPARs, which derive the designation by virtue of their ability to mediate predictable pleiotropic effects in response to peroxisome proliferators (12Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), consist of three isotypes, namely PPARα, PPARδ (also called PPARβ), and PPARγ which are products of separate genes (11Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar, 13Zhu Y. Alvares K. Huang Q. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferators are structurally diverse agents which, when administered to rats and mice, induce not only a marked peroxisome proliferation and increase in the enzyme proteins of the peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation but also induce changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms (4Hashimoto T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The induction of mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and microsomalCYP4A genes involved in fatty acid oxidation requires the formation of PPARα heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor, and this PPARα·retinoid X receptor complex binds to PPAR response element, a region consisting of a degenerate direct repeat of the canonical AGGTCA sequence separated by 1 base pair (DR1), present in the 5 ′-flanking region of target genes (15Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). The generation of PPARα−/− mice established that PPARα is critical for peroxisome proliferation and the coordinate transcriptional activation of fatty acid oxidation enzymes in liver (16Lee S.-S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westpal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα−/− mice have provided valuable information on the constitutive levels of expression of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes in liver (17Aoyama T.

Mice deficient in peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX−/−) exhibited sustained PPARα hyperfunction presumably caused by accumulation of endogenous ligand(s) due to the impairment of the peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation pathway (21Fan C.-Y.

All experiments were performed using mice ranging in age from 16 to 20 weeks. Starvation was commenced by removing food at 8:00 a.m., and groups of mice were fasted up to 96 h. Control mice were fed ad libitum. After mice were anesthetized, blood was collected in heparinized tubes and centrifuged, and the plasma was frozen until use. Organs were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All animal procedures used in this study were reviewed and preapproved by the Institutional Review Boards for Animal Research of the Northwestern University. For light microscopy, pieces of liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm-thick sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Frozen sections of formalin-fixed liver (5 μm) were stained with Oil Red O and counterstained with Giemsa. For cell proliferation analysis, mice were given bromodeoxyuridine (0.5 mg/ml) in drinking water, and their livers were processed for immunohistochemical localization as described previously (23Qi C.

Histological analysis and image processing were carried out using Leica DMRE microscope equipped with a Spot digital camera. Images were taken at × 20 and 40 magnification and captured at 1315 × 1033 pixels. Montages of images were prepared with the use of Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe, Mountain View, CA).

Equal loading was verified by the intensity of methylene blue-stained 18 S and 28 S RNA or by probing the blots with 18 S RNA probe.

Antisense RNA probes were transcribed in the presence of [32P]UTP (20 mCi/ml, 800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). After transcription, the labeled riboprobes were purified in a 5% TBE/urea polyacrylamide Ready Gel (Bio-Rad). Probes were eluted from the polyacrylamide gel fragments, and their activity was measured in a scintillation counter. Total RNA isolated from liver was hybridized with labeled probes overnight and then digested for 30 min with RNase A/RNase T1 mix at 37 °C. Protected fragments were precipitated and resuspended in 3 μl of gel loading buffer. The samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel 0.4 mm in thickness (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to film or a PhosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at room temperature without intensification. Quantitation was with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Statistical comparisons were made by using Student's t test or two-way analysis of variance. A statistically significant difference was defined asp < 0.05. Since fasting increases the capacity for fatty acid oxidation in liver under normal conditions, we subjected wild type, PPARα−/−, DKO, and AOX−/− mice to fasting for up to 96 h for a comparative analysis of liver morphology. After 48 h starvation, the livers of PPARα−/− and DKO mice were paler compared with those of fasted wild type mice, and this difference in pallor indicative of severe steatosis was grossly exaggerated with prolonged fasting. A representative example of a typical gross appearance of liver of a fed and 66-h fasted DKO mouse is illustrated in Fig.1 A. Comparative histologic appearance of liver of fed and fasted wild type, PPARα−/−, and DKO mice, as revealed by Oil Red O staining (to visualize neutral lipid) of frozen sections, is illustrated in Fig. 1. In fed wild type mice there is no detectable fatty change in hepatocytes other than the presence of Oil Red O-positive droplets in stellate cells (Fig. lB). When fasted for 48–72 h, these wild type mice exhibited subtle steatosis in centrizonal hepatocytes (Fig. 1 C,arrows). As reported elsewhere (22Hashimoto T. Fujita T. Usuda N. Cook W. Qi C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19228-19236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), under fed state, only a few centrilobular hepatocytes in PPARα−/−mice and few scattered periportal hepatocytes in DKO mice revealed fatty change (Fig. 1, D and F). When these mice were fasted for 48–72 h, steatosis was extensive involving the entire liver lobule (Fig. l, E and G). At 48, 66, or 72 h of fasting, the Oil Red O staining clearly showed marked differences in the degree of hepatic steatosis between PPARα−/− and DKO mice in that fatty change appeared more prominent in DKO livers. Oil Red O-stained liver sections of 48–72 h fasted AOX−/− mice revealed fatty change in centrizonal hepatocytes, but a majority of hepatocytes with intense eosinophilic cytoplasm indicative of regeneration did not accumulate fat (Oil Red O stain not illustrated but see hematoxylin and eosin staining pattern in Fig. 2 G). Examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic sections of livers from 66-h fasted wild type, PPARα−/−, and DKO mice demonstrated clear-cut differences in steatosis (Fig. 2,A–C). In wild type animals fasted for 66 or 72 h the fatty change was minimal with few microvesicular lipid droplets (Fig.2 A). In contrast, microvesicular fatty change appeared prominent in PPARα−/− livers (Fig. 2 B), and this change was greatly exaggerated in DKO livers in which many hepatocytes also had macrovesicular lipid droplets (Fig.2 C). When fasted for 96-h, wild type mice exhibited no fatty change, and in fact the liver cells revealed features of cytoplasmic atrophy (Fig. 2 D). On the other hand, the fatty change persisted and progressed predominantly to macrovesicular type in the midzonal and centrilobular areas of liver lobules, while maintaining the microvesicular steatotic pattern in periportal areas of both PPARα−/− and DKO mice (Fig. 2, E andF). The degree of hepatic steatosis appeared slightly more prominent in females during the first 48 h of starvation but with prolonged starvation (66–96 h); the differences in fatty change between males and females were not apparent. We also subjected AOX−/− mice to 48- and 72-h starvation and found that regenerated hepatocytes with eosinophilic cytoplasm are resistant to lipid accumulation, whereas cells already steatotic appeared nearly the same or only slightly more steatotic (Fig. 2 G). In order to demonstrate that the eosinophilic hepatocytes that do not exhibit steatosis in response to fasting are indeed cells that have regenerated and therefore resistant, we administered bromodeoxyuridine for 4 days in drinking water and assessed its incorporation in hepatocyte nuclei by immunoperoxidase staining (Fig. 2 H). During the 4-day labeling period, several hepatocytes have incorporated this precursor indicating DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in cells that are at the interface between steatotic cells and cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm that are resistant to fatty change. In contrast, an occasional cell showed bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in the livers of either fed or starved wild type, PPARα−/−, and DKO mice (Fig. 2 I) indicating minimal cell proliferation.Figure 2Comparative liver morphology as revealed in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A–C (all taken at the same magnification) represent livers of wild type (A), PPARα−/−(B), and DKO (C) mice fasted for 66 h. The inset in B depicts an enlarged version of cells with microvesicular fatty change in PPARα−/− mouse liver. D–F (all taken the same magnification) represent livers of wild type (D), PPARα−/− (E), and DKO (F) mice fasted for 96 h. In D–F the insetsrepresent higher magnification of areas marked withasterisks to show the absence of fatty change in wild type mouse liver starved for 96 h (D), the presence of steatosis in all cells in PPARα−/−(E), and DKO (F) liver. G, liver of AOX−/− mouse starved for 72 h. Note the absence of fatty starvation-induced steatosis in regenerated hepatocytes that contain eosinophilic cytoplasm; hepatocytes in the centrizonal area show microvesicular fatty change similar to that seen in fed state.H, liver of AOX−/− mouse showing a leading edge of hepatocellular proliferation, at the steatotic cell interface, as evidenced by bromodeoxyuridine labeling. No significant liver cell proliferation was noted in wild type, PPAR, and DKO (I) mice. The insets in H and I show immunoperoxidase-stained nuclei representing bromodeoxyuridine labeling in proliferated cells. Eventually all steatotic cells will be replaced by regenerated liver cells in AOX−/− mouse liver.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Plasma glucose levels were not much different among the four groups of mice under fed conditions, and these levels were decreased by about 50% at 48 h of starvation, and similar levels were maintained at 72 h in all groups (Fig. 3 A). Plasma lactate levels in all groups were nearly the same under non-starved conditions, and on fasting gradual decreases in lactate concentrations were observed in all four groups of animals (data not shown). Lactate, together with alanine, serves as a major precursor for gluconeogenesis in liver under starvation. Glycogen in liver, a reservoir of glucose, was largely depleted within 48 h of starvation, and this reduction was sus"

A magnetic superstructure changes the translational symmetry of the surface lattice with respect to the chemical unit cell. It is shown, with the aid of first-principles calculations, that as a result of this, spin-polarized tunneling electrons give rise to an image corresponding to the magnetic superstructure and not to the chemical unit cell. These investigations demonstrate a powerful technique for the understanding of complicated magnetic configurations of nanomagnets and thin films engineered from ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials used for magnetoelectronics."

https://openalex.org/W2069193571,"Through suppressive subtractive hybridization, we identified a new gene whose transcription is induced by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). The gene encodes acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), the cytosolic enzyme that activates acetate so that it can be used for lipid synthesis or for energy generation. ACS genes were isolated previously from yeast, but not from animal cells. Recombinant human ACS was produced by expressing the cloned cDNA transiently in human cells. After purification by nickel chromatography, the 701-amino acid cytosolic enzyme was shown to function as a monomer. The recombinant enzyme produced acetyl-CoA from acetate in a reaction that required ATP. As expected for a gene controlled by SREBPs, ACS mRNA was induced when cultured cells were deprived of sterols and repressed by sterol addition. The pattern of regulation resembled the regulation of enzymes of fatty acid synthesis. ACS mRNA was also elevated in livers of transgenic mice that express dominant-positive versions of all three isoforms of SREBP. We conclude that ACS mRNA, and hence the ability of cells to activate acetate, is regulated by SREBPs in parallel with fatty acid synthesis in animal cells.

The SREBPs differ from other transcription factors because they are synthesized as membrane-bound proteins whose active fragments must be released by proteolysis in order to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. The proteolytic release of the nuclear fragments is controlled by the cholesterol content of the cell; release is rapid when cells are depleted of cholesterol, and it is blocked when cholesterol overaccumulates (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). In tissue culture cells and in livers of transgenic mice, nuclear SREBPs (nSREBPs) increase the levels of mRNAs encoding multiple enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMG-CoA synthase), HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, lanosterol demethylase, and others. In the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, SREBPs increase the mRNAs encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. As a result of these changes, there is a massive increase in the content of unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol in livers of transgenic mice that overexpress either of two nuclear isoforms of SREBP (nSREBP-1a and nSREBP-2) (4Shimano H.

Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to increasing enzymes that participate directly in lipid biosynthesis, the SREBPs increase the mRNA encoding ATP-citrate lyase, which is the major source of the acetyl-CoA that is the ultimate building block for lipid synthesis (6Korn B.S.

The SREBPs also increase the mRNAs for three enzymes that supply the NADPH that is needed for lipogenesis (malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) (8Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we used the technique of suppressive subtractive hybridization to identify additional genes whose mRNAs are regulated by SREBPs. As a source of SREBP-induced mRNAs, we used a genetically engineered cell line, designated N-BP1a cells, that produces graded amounts of nSREBP-1a in response to induction with ponasterone, a type of steroid hormone (9Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We performed a subtractive hybridization designed to identify genes expressed at high levels in cells expressing nSREBP-1a but not in cells lacking nSREBPs. Among the differentially expressed genes, we identified a cDNA encoding a protein that resembles the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), whose cDNA was isolated previously from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10de Virgilio C.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ACS catalyzes the activation of acetate, a reaction that is essential for all of the metabolic pathways that utilize this substance. The reaction requires ATP and proceeds through the formation of an acetyl adenylate (12Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 991-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Webster Jr., L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 4010-4015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACS activity has been studied biochemically in animal cells (14Howard B.V. Howard W.J. Bailey J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 79l2-792lGoogle Scholar), and the enzyme has been partially purified from rat liver (15Imesch E. Rous S. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but the gene has not been cloned, and the molecular structure of the animal cell enzyme is unknown. Here, we provide the first molecular characterization of animal ACS, and we demonstrate that its mRNA is controlled by SREBPs. We obtained anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody from Kodak; anti-Xpress epitope monoclonal antibody, muristerone A, and ponasterone A from Invitrogen; [1,2-14C]acetic acid, sodium salt (112 mCi/mmol) and [2-14C]pyruvic acid, sodium salt (5.5 mCi/mmol), from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.; DEAE-cellulose membrane from Schleicher & Schuell; Gel Filtration Standard from Bio-Rad; ATP (sodium salt) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and coenzyme A (trilithium salt) from Calbiochem. Total RNA was prepared from cell lines using the RNA Stat-60 Kit (Tel-Test, Inc.; Friendswood, TX) and from mouse livers using the RNeasy™ Total RNA Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Delipidated serum (16Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Roche E. Esser V. McGarry J.D.

M19 cells are a mutant line of CHO-K1 cells that is lacking in nuclear SREBPs, due to a deletion in the site 2 protease gene (18Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.-Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). N-BP1a and N-BP2 cells are lines of transfected M19 cells that express graded amounts of nSREBP-1a and nSREBP-2, respectively, under control of an ecdysone-inducible nuclear receptor system (9Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Monolayers of M19, N-BP1a, and N-BP2 cells were set up on day 0 (7–8 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) and cultured in 8–9% CO2 at 37 °C in medium A (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate. On day 2, the monolayers were switched to medium A supplemented with 5% delipidated FCS or 5% lipoprotein-deficient FCS plus muristerone or ponasterone as indicated in the legends. Mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells (ATCC CRL-2026; derived from a mouse hepatoma) and human HTB-38 (ATCC HTB-38; derived from a human adenocarcinoma of the colon) were set up on day 0 (1.5 × 105cells/60-mm dish) and cultured in either 8–9% CO2(Hepa1c1c7 cells) or 5% CO2 (HTB-38 cells) in medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% FCS. Suppressive subtractive hybridization (19Diatchenko L. Lau Y.-F.C. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar) was performed using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA obtained from uninduced M19 cells and also from N-BP1a cells that had been induced for 16 h in medium containing 5% delipidated FCS and 0.8 μm muristerone and isolated as described under “Materials.” Both the uninduced and induced cDNA pools were digested with RsaI. The digested N-BP1a “tester” cDNA was divided into two groups; one group was ligated to the supplied adapter set 1, and the other was ligated to the adaptor set 2R. After separate melting and hybridization of these pools with M19 “driver” cDNA, the two tester pools were annealed and subjected to adapter-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to yield “forward”-subtracted cDNA. The subtraction was also performed using M19 cDNA as “tester” and cDNA from induced N-BP1a cells as “driver” to produce a “reverse”-subtracted cDNA pool. The forward-subtracted cDNA was subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and transformed cells were plated onto LB-agarose medium, generating a subtracted cDNA library. To identify differentially expressed cDNAs, we utilized theCLONTECH PCR-Select Differential Screening Kit. Recombinant colonies were grown in 100-μl LB cultures in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking. We then performed PCR with 1 μl from each culture to produce the recombinant cDNAs. We arrayed the cDNAs on filters and hybridized with32P-labeled probes derived from the forward- and reverse-subtracted cDNA pools after sequential digestion withRsaI, SmaI, and EagI to remove the adapter sequences. Clones that hybridized specifically with the forward-subtracted probes with a signal intensity of >5-fold relative to the reverse-subtracted probes were then sequenced in their entirety. A partial 662-bp cDNA of hamster ACS (an internal RsaI fragment) was identified. A human HeLa cDNA library prepared in the λEXlox vector (20Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) was screened for ACS by PCR using primers ACS1 (5′-CATCTGCTACAATGTGCTGGATCG-3′) and ACS2 (5′-GTGGAGCCACTGGTATACAAGATG-3′) based on the 5′ and 3′ sequences, respectively, of the hamster ACS fragment. The 5′ and 3′ sequences of the full-length cDNA were obtained by PCR using vector-specific and insert-specific primers. The full-length cDNA was amplified from the HeLa cDNA library using primers 5′-GAACTTTACGTGATGGGGCTTCCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGAATCCTAGGTAAAGGTCAGGATCATG-3′ based on 5′- and 3′-specific sequences, respectively. The 2.1-kilobase PCR product was subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO TA cloning vector. The resulting plasmid was designated pTOPO-ACS. Twelve 2.1-kilobase clones from six independent PCRs yielded the same sequence. pCMV-His-ACS encodes a 731-amino acid fusion protein that contains full-length human ACS. It consists of an initiator methionine, six consecutive histidines, an anti-Xpress antibody epitope (DLYDDDDK), and amino acids 2–701 of human ACS. Expression is driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer in the pcDNA 3.1/HisA vector (Invitrogen). pCMV-His-ACS was constructed as follows. PCR primers 5′-ATGGATCCTCGGGCTTCCTGAGGAGCGGGTC-3′ and 5′-ATCGCCATGGTCACTGGATGGTCAGGCAGCG-3′, based on the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of human ACS, respectively, were used in a PCR with 50 ng of pTOPO-ACS plasmid. The resulting PCR product was digested withBamHI–NcoI and ligated into aBamHI–EcoRV-digested pcDNA3.1/HisA vector. The cDNA insert and cloning junctions were sequenced in their entirety. On day 0, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in medium B supplemented with 5% FCS. On day 2, the cells were transfected with pCMV-His-ACS using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA (3 μg/dish) was incubated at room temperature with serum-free medium containing twice the volume of Fugene 6 reagent as the amount of DNA. Sixteen hours after the transfection, the cells were scraped from the dish, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by passage through a 22-gauge needle 20 times in buffer A (60 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 5 mmimidazole (pH 7.5). The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min, after which the supernatant was centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min. The 105 ×g supernatant was loaded onto a 1.5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Inc.) equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A supplemented with 5 mmimidazole (pH 7.5). Chromatography was performed via gravity at a flow rate of ∼100 ml/h. The column was washed with 16 ml of buffer A plus 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) followed by 16 ml of buffer A plus 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). Elution was achieved with a step gradient of imidazole in buffer A (50 mm steps beginning with 50 mm imidazole). The 100 mm imidazole fraction, containing ACS activity, was dialyzed at 4 °C for 12 h against buffer B (60 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, and 150 mm NaCl). This fraction was then concentrated with a Centriprep 30 filter (Amicon, Inc.), mixed with an equal volume of 100% glycerol, and stored in multiple aliquots at −20 °C without loss of activity for at least 2 weeks. cDNA probes for rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (21Chen W.-J.

A cDNA probe for human ACS was prepared by PCR using pCMV-His-ACS as the template and the PCR primers ACS1 and ACS2 described above. A cDNA probe for mouse ACS was prepared by PCR with a mouse liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) as template and the above ACS1 and ACS2 oligonucleotides as primers. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and purified on agarose gels. Total RNA (prepared as described above under “Materials”) was subjected to Northern blot analysis with various cDNA probes (9Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were exposed to X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with DuPont NEN Reflection screens for the indicated time at −80 °C. The resulting bands were quantified by exposure of the filter to a Bioimaging Analyzer with BAS1000 MacBus software (Fuji Medical System, Standish, ME), and the results were normalized to the signal generated from the reference GAPDH or cyclophilin mRNA. ACS activity was determined by a modification of a previously described radiochemical assay (23Huang K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 37: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, each reaction mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 250 μl: 60 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 3 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CoA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.24 mm sodium [14C]acetate (209–221 dpm/pmol), and the indicated amount of recombinant human ACS or cytosolic protein. Following incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of glacial acetic acid, after which a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a DEAE-cellulose membrane. The membrane was washed with a 7:1 ether/formic acid solution to remove [14C]acetate, leaving [14C]acetyl-CoA bound to the membrane. The amount of [14C]acetyl-CoA formed was determined by counting the washed membrane in a scintillation counter. The identity of the product as [14C]acetyl-CoA was confirmed by thin layer chromatography. Intact monolayers of Hepa1c1c7 and HTB-38 cells were incubated with sodium [1,2-14C]acetate or sodium [2-14C]pyruvate as described in the figure legends. Incorporation into lipids was determined by thin layer chromatography as described (17Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S.

The data are expressed as nmol of [14C]acetate or nmol of [14C]pyruvate incorporated into cholesterol or fatty acids per 2 h per mg of cell protein. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously (25Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

For whole cell lysates, protein concentration was measured with a Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). The filters were exposed for the indicated time to X-Omat Blue film (Kodak). To identify novel target genes that are activated by SREBPs in mammalian cells, we used the technique of suppressive subtractive hybridization. The mRNAs were isolated from N-BP1a cells, which produce graded amounts of SREBP-1a in response to ponasterone (9Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

These cells were derived from M19 cells, a line of CHO cells that lack nSREBPs as a result of mutations in the gene that encodes one of the proteases necessary to release the nuclear fragments from cell membranes (18Rawson R.B.

Because of the deficiency of nSREBPs, the M19 cells are unable to synthesize cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids and thus will not grow in culture unless these substances are added to the culture medium. We transfected the M19 cells with cDNAs encoding the nuclear fragments of each of the SREBPs under control of a steroid-responsive promoter that was designed by No et al. (26No D. Yao T.-P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Transcription from this promoter requires the action of a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by ponasterone. To permit such activation, the cells were co-transfected with a cDNA encoding the nuclear receptor under control of a constitutive promoter. We isolated permanent clones of cells that produce graded amounts of each of the nSREBPs in response to graded concentrations of ponasterone in the culture medium (9Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). From the cDNA subtractive screen between uninduced M19 cells and induced N-BP1a cells, we identified 1630 clones. Dot blot analysis confirmed that 173 of these mRNAs were expressed more than 5-fold higher in N-BP1a cells as compared with M19 cells. Of these 173 mRNAs, 50 showed clear cut differential expression when tested by Northern blot analysis of mRNA from uninduced versusponasterone-induced N-BP1a cells. DNA sequence determination revealed that 23 of these 50 clones corresponded to mRNAs that are already known to be induced by SREBP-1a. These included stearoyl-CoA desaturase (10 clones), HMG-CoA synthase (eight clones), LDL receptor (two clones), and lanosterol synthase (three clones). Of the remaining 26 differentially expressed clones, three were derived from a novel mRNA that showed sequence homology to yeast ACS. To confirm that the putative ACS mRNA is activated by SREBPs, we studied N-BP1a cells and N-BP2 cells, which express the nuclear forms of each SREBP under control of ponasterone. We used ponasterone concentrations that induced expression of nSREBP-1a and nSREBP-2 (Fig.1 A). In the same experiment, we performed Northern blot analysis on total RNA extracted from these cells. The filters were probed with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment derived from one of the putative ACS clones that we identified in the differential subtractive hybridization (Fig.1 B). In the absence of nSREBP-1 or nSREBP-2 proteins (lanes 1 and 3), very little of the putative ACS mRNA was detectable (lanes 5 and 7). When nSREBP-1a and nSREBP-2 were induced by ponasterone (lanes 2and 4), the amount of the putative ACS mRNA increased by 3–6-fold (lanes 6 and 8). The SREBP-mediated increase in mRNA for the putative ACS was confirmed in vivo by Northern blot analysis of total RNA obtained from the livers of transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress each of the three nuclear forms of SREBP, i.e.nSREBP-1a, nSREBP-1c, or nSREBP-2 (4Shimano H.

Fig.2 A shows that expression of the ACS homolog mRNA was increased 3.3–7.3-fold in the three SREBP transgenic livers as compared with that in wild-type liver. To determine the tissue distribution of the putative ACS mRNA, we probed a commercially prepared filter containing poly(A+) RNA from various mouse tissues using the same 32P-labeled cDNA fragment that was used in Fig. 1 B. We identified a single species of mRNA (∼3.0 kilobases in length) that was most abundant in the liver and kidney. Lower levels were found in the heart, brain, and testis. The mRNA was not detectable in spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle. The hamster cDNA sequence encoding the putative ACS was used to design primers to clone the full-length human homolog from a HeLa cDNA library (Fig. 3). The resulting human cDNA included an in-frame stop codon 15 nucleotides upstream of the first methionine. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 701 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 78,588 and a predicted isoelectric point of 6.27. A search of DNA data bases revealed genes encoding similar proteins in mouse, yeast, and fruit flies. The sequence of the human protein is 93% identical to that of the mouse, 66% identical to that of Drosophila, and 45% identical to that of S. cerevisiae, the only one of these proteins that has been shown to have ACS activity (11van den Berg M.A. Steensma H.Y.

The coding region of the putative human ACS was cloned into a pCMV mammalian expression vector and introduced into HEK-293 cells by transfection. The vector was designed so that the NH2terminus of the protein contained six consecutive histidines followed by an Xpress epitope tag. The histidines allowed the protein to be purified by nickel column chromatography, and the Xpress tag permitted detection by immunoblotting. Fig.4 A shows a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel containing fractions collected from a nickel column loaded with cytosol from the transfected HEK-293 cells. The fractions eluted with 50 and 100 mm imidazole contained ACS activity as measured by a radiochemical assay. These fractions also contained an 83-kDa band that corresponded to the expected molecular weight of the ACS fusion protein. This band stained with an antibody against the Xpress tag when the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). The nickel column gave a purification of ∼30-fold with a recovery of 14%. We obtained 80 μg of purified human ACS from 19 mg of starting cytosolic protein obtained from 75 dishes of cells. The specific activity of the purified protein was 1.5 × 103 nmol/min/mg. This purified protein was used in the experiments described in Figs.Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7.Figure 5Gel filtration of purified recombinant human ACS.

Angiotensin II increased IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 mRNA by 6.5-, 10.2-, and 2.0-fold, respectively, but did not affect IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, or oncostatin M in cardiac fibroblasts. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that angiotensin II-stimulated conditioned medium from cardiac fibroblasts contained 9.3 ng/ml IL-6 at 24 h, which was 24-fold higher than the control. It phosphorylated gp130 and STAT3 in cardiomyocytes, which was reduced with RX435 (anti-gp130 blocking antibody). It increased [3H]phenylalanine uptake and cell area by 44% and 86% in cardiomyocytes compared with mock medium.

Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Cardiac fibroblasts have been clearly shown to express AT-1 receptors (5Crabos M. Roth M. Hahn A.W. Erne P. J.

Circulation. 1993; 88: 2849-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but the presence of AT-1 receptors on cardiomyocytes remains controversial. AT-1 receptor mRNA levels were found to be markedly higher in cardiac fibroblasts than cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats (8Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Binding experiments using125I-AngII revealed that the specific binding observed on cardiomyocytes was <10% of the specific binding obtained in a comparable number of fibroblasts (8Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is a disparity in distribution of AT-1 receptor between cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, ACE inhibitors or AT-1 receptor antagonists may not only prevent cardiac fibrosis but also cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. These discrepancies may be explained by the potential involvement of a paracrine mechanism between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in the hypertrophic effect of AngII. AngII did not stimulate hypertrophy in pure cardiomyocyte cultures, but did induce an increase in cell size and augmentation of atrial matriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide secretion in co-cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (9Harada M. Itoh H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Ogawa E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).AngII has been reported to stimulate autocrine/paracrine release of other growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, TGF-β1, insulin-like growth factor-1, and endothelin-1 in various cell types (10Gibbons G.H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 11Delafontaine P. Lou H. J. Biol.

Invest. 1993; 92: 395-403Google Scholar) These growth factors may in part indirectly mediate the physiological effects of AngII. In the case of cardiac fibroblasts, AngII has been shown to stimulate TGF-β1 and ET-1 production (13Gray M.O. Long C.S. Kalinyak J.E. Li H.T. Karliner J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Fisher S.A. Absher M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C910-C917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has a major influence on extracellular matrix production, particularly collagen and fibronectin. Simultaneous treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with AngII and neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1 has been shown to reduce type I/III collagen mRNA expression. These data suggested that AngII-induced collagen synthesis might be mediated in part by autocrine/paracrine stimulation by TGF-β1.In rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells and mouse mesangial cells, AngII was shown to increase IL-6 release, and the growth promoting effects of AngII on mesangial cells is at least partially mediated by IL-6 released from mesangial cells (16Moriyama Y.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The IL-6 family cytokines includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M (OSM), and IL-11.This family shares a common co-receptor gp130, and has many similar physiological effects. In the cardiovascular system, all the cytokines of this family have been reported to have a hypertrophic effect on cardiomyocytes, although with different potencies (18Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Among these, CT-1 and LIF have a potent hypertrophic effect on cardiomyocytes. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that AngII induced secretion of IL-6 family cytokines from cardiac fibroblasts, which in turn contributes to cardiac hypertrophy by a paracrine mechanism. Here we report that cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts via the IL-6 family cytokines, mainly LIF and CT-1, plays a critical role in AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.DISCUSSIONThe heart is a syncytium of myocytes and the surrounding support cells, collectively referred to as nonmyocytes, most of which are fibroblasts. Although cardiomyocytes are the most predominant cellular constituent of the heart by mass, cardiac fibroblasts are twice as plentiful as cardiomyocytes. Previous studies revealed that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was stimulated in cultures by increasing numbers of cardiac fibroblasts, and that this effect of cardiac fibroblasts on cardiac hypertrophy could be reproduced by fibroblast-conditioned medium (28Long C.S. Henrich C.J. Simpson P.C. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that cardiac fibroblasts modulate cardiomyocyte growth by production of one or more growth factors (29Long C.S. Hartogensis W.E. Simpson P.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Nishida M. Springhorn J.P. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W J. Clin.

Pharmacol. 1994; 24: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).A number of clinical and experimental studies revealed that ACE inhibitors and AT-1 receptor antagonists were very effective for preventing cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling (32Pfeffer J.M. Pfeffer M.A. Mirsky I Braunwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3310-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 33Baker K.M. Chernin M.I. Wixson S.K. Aceto J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H324-H332PubMed Google Scholar). Since cardiomyocytes only express less than 10% of the number of AT-1 receptors on the cardiac fibroblast, it was difficult to explain why cardiomyocytes respond effectively to ACE inhibitors and AT-1R antagonists in this setting. Recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts plays an important role during the process of AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (8Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Harada et al. (9Harada M. Itoh H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Ogawa E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported that AngII did not stimulate hypertrophy in pure cardiomyocyte culture, but that it induced an increase in cell size and augmentation of atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide secretion in cardiomyocyte-cardiac fibroblast co-culture. This effect of AngII was inhibited by 55% by ET-A receptor antagonist and AngII-stimulation augmented ET-1 secretion in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. Their findings suggested that the hypertrophic effect of AngII was mediated at least partially via an increased secretion of ET-1 from cardiac fibroblasts. The possibility remains that other unknown paracrine factors from cardiac fibroblasts might play a role in this phenomenon.In this study, we showed that AngII induced IL-6, LIF, and CT-1 mRNA expression, and confirmed that it augmented IL-6 protein secretion in cardiac fibroblasts. AngII-CM phosphorylated gp130 and STAT3 and increased [3H]Phe uptake and cell area in cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with RX435 partially inhibited these phosphorylation events and the increase in [3H]Phe uptake and cell area. Preincubation with CT-1 and LIF AS oligonucleotide blocked the up-regulation of CT-1 and LIF mRNA in AngII-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts and attenuated the AngII-CM-induced increase in [3H]Phe uptake. We showed that the IL-6 family of cytokines were another essential autocrine/paracrine factor that mediated AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and that their contribution was as half as that of endothelin-1.A previous report using smooth muscle cells revealed that AngII could significantly increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner (10−10to10−6 mol/liter) (34Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We stimulated the cardiac fibroblasts with AngII at a concentration of 10−7 mol/liter and obtained compelling evidence for AngII-mediated cytokine production. The AngII concentration we used, however, was higher than the accepted in vivo concentration. Sadoshima et al. (2Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Stayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) reported that mechanical stretch causes secretion of AngII from cardiomyocytes to a concentration of 452 ± 56 pmafter 10 min stretch in the stretch-conditioned media, and that these levels were sufficiently high to trigger the hypertrophic response. Yamazaki et al. (36Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zho Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) reported that conditioned media after cardiomyocyte stretch contained approximately 5 × 10−10 mol/liter AngII. However, since these studies used conditioned media, the autocrine/paracrine-secreted AngII may have been diluted, and the concentration of AngII in vivo might be much higher than these values.Although poly(A)+ RNA and ELISA revealed that AngII strongly augmented IL-6 production from cardiac fibroblasts, we supposed that IL-6 might not be a critical paracrine hypertrophic factor for cardiomyocytes. Previous studies had reported that IL-6Rα is not significantly expressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes (37Hirota H. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), while gp130 and LIF receptor-β were abundantly expressed. Although we could not directly show the release data of LIF and CT-1 due to the lack of a radioimmunoassay or ELISA for these murine cytokines, the present paper demonstrated that AS oligonucleotides that specifically blocked CT-1 and LIF expression significantly attenuated AngII-CM-induced [3H]Phe uptake. The inhibitory effect of the combination of AS oligonucleotides to LIF and CT-1 on [3H]Phe uptake corresponded to that of RX435. These findings indicated that both LIF and CT-1 were secreted from AngII-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts, and were critically involved in the conditioned medium-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Very recently, Kuwahara et al. (35Kuwahara K. Saito Y. Harada M. Ishikawa M. Ogawa E. Miyamoto Y. Hamanaka I. Kamitani S. Kajiyama N. Takahashi N. Nakagawa O. Masuda I. Nakao K. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) revealed that CT-1 secreted from cardiac non-myocytes is significantly involved in hypertrophic changes of cardiac myocytes in co-culture, and suggested that CT-1 is an important local regulator in the process of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study demonstrated that, although the basal expression of CT-1 mRNA was higher than that of LIF, AngII-induced increase in mRNA expression of LIF was much higher than that of CT-1. These findings could easily explain the results that the inhibitory effect of the AS oligonucleotides to LIF on [3H]Phe uptake was bigger than those of AS oligonucleotides to CT-1. Based on these findings, we speculated that both CT-1 and LIF might be critical paracrine hypertrophic growth factors released from cardiac fibroblasts in response to AngII, and that the role of LIF in this paracrine process was as strong as or even stronger than that of CT-1.In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first report to show that AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was mediated by the cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts via IL-6 family cytokines, mainly CT-1 and LIF. The discrepancy of the poor existence of AT-1 receptor in cardiomyocytes and the high effectiveness of ACE inhibitors or AT-1R antagonist on cardiac hypertrophy might be easily explained by these cross-talk of the paracrine factors between cardiac fibroblast and cardiomyocytes. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise understanding of paracrine cross-talk between these cells. Both the circulating and local renin-angiotensin system play an important role in the progression of cardiac remodeling (1Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev.

Circulation. 1993; 88: 2849-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but the presence of AT-1 receptors on cardiomyocytes remains controversial. AT-1 receptor mRNA levels were found to be markedly higher in cardiac fibroblasts than cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats (8Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Binding experiments using125I-AngII revealed that the specific binding observed on cardiomyocytes was <10% of the specific binding obtained in a comparable number of fibroblasts (8Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is a disparity in distribution of AT-1 receptor between cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, ACE inhibitors or AT-1 receptor antagonists may not only prevent cardiac fibrosis but also cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. These discrepancies may be explained by the potential involvement of a paracrine mechanism between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts in the hypertrophic effect of AngII. AngII did not stimulate hypertrophy in pure cardiomyocyte cultures, but did induce an increase in cell size and augmentation of atrial matriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide secretion in co-cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (9Harada M. Itoh H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Ogawa E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). AngII has been reported to stimulate autocrine/paracrine release of other growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, TGF-β1, insulin-like growth factor-1, and endothelin-1 in various cell types (10Gibbons G.H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 11Delafontaine P. Lou H. J. Biol.

Invest. 1993; 92: 395-403Google Scholar) These growth factors may in part indirectly mediate the physiological effects of AngII. In the case of cardiac fibroblasts, AngII has been shown to stimulate TGF-β1 and ET-1 production (13Gray M.O. Long C.S. Kalinyak J.E. Li H.T. Karliner J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Fisher S.A. Absher M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C910-C917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has a major influence on extracellular matrix production, particularly collagen and fibronectin. Simultaneous treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with AngII and neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1 has been shown to reduce type I/III collagen mRNA expression. These data suggested that AngII-induced collagen synthesis might be mediated in part by autocrine/paracrine stimulation by TGF-β1. In rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells and mouse mesangial cells, AngII was shown to increase IL-6 release, and the growth promoting effects of AngII on mesangial cells is at least partially mediated by IL-6 released from mesangial cells (16Moriyama Y.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The IL-6 family cytokines includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M (OSM), and IL-11.This family shares a common co-receptor gp130, and has many similar physiological effects. In the cardiovascular system, all the cytokines of this family have been reported to have a hypertrophic effect on cardiomyocytes, although with different potencies (18Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Among these, CT-1 and LIF have a potent hypertrophic effect on cardiomyocytes. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that AngII induced secretion of IL-6 family cytokines from cardiac fibroblasts, which in turn contributes to cardiac hypertrophy by a paracrine mechanism. Here we report that cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts via the IL-6 family cytokines, mainly LIF and CT-1, plays a critical role in AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. DISCUSSIONThe heart is a syncytium of myocytes and the surrounding support cells, collectively referred to as nonmyocytes, most of which are fibroblasts. Although cardiomyocytes are the most predominant cellular constituent of the heart by mass, cardiac fibroblasts are twice as plentiful as cardiomyocytes. Previous studies revealed that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was stimulated in cultures by increasing numbers of cardiac fibroblasts, and that this effect of cardiac fibroblasts on cardiac hypertrophy could be reproduced by fibroblast-conditioned medium (28Long C.S. Henrich C.J. Simpson P.C. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that cardiac fibroblasts modulate cardiomyocyte growth by production of one or more growth factors (29Long C.S. Hartogensis W.E. Simpson P.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Nishida M. Springhorn J.P. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W J. Clin.

Pharmacol. 1994; 24: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).A number of clinical and experimental studies revealed that ACE inhibitors and AT-1 receptor antagonists were very effective for preventing cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling (32Pfeffer J.M. Pfeffer M.A. Mirsky I Braunwald E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3310-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 33Baker K.M. Chernin M.I. Wixson S.K. Aceto J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H324-H332PubMed Google Scholar). Since cardiomyocytes only express less than 10% of the number of AT-1 receptors on the cardiac fibroblast, it was difficult to explain why cardiomyocytes respond effectively to ACE inhibitors and AT-1R antagonists in this setting. Recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts plays an important role during the process of AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (8Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Harada et al. (9Harada M. Itoh H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Ogawa E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported that AngII did not stimulate hypertrophy in pure cardiomyocyte culture, but that it induced an increase in cell size and augmentation of atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide secretion in cardiomyocyte-cardiac fibroblast co-culture. This effect of AngII was inhibited by 55% by ET-A receptor antagonist and AngII-stimulation augmented ET-1 secretion in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. Their findings suggested that the hypertrophic effect of AngII was mediated at least partially via an increased secretion of ET-1 from cardiac fibroblasts. The possibility remains that other unknown paracrine factors from cardiac fibroblasts might play a role in this phenomenon.In this study, we showed that AngII induced IL-6, LIF, and CT-1 mRNA expression, and confirmed that it augmented IL-6 protein secretion in cardiac fibroblasts. AngII-CM phosphorylated gp130 and STAT3 and increased [3H]Phe uptake and cell area in cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with RX435 partially inhibited these phosphorylation events and the increase in [3H]Phe uptake and cell area. Preincubation with CT-1 and LIF AS oligonucleotide blocked the up-regulation of CT-1 and LIF mRNA in AngII-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts and attenuated the AngII-CM-induced increase in [3H]Phe uptake. We showed that the IL-6 family of cytokines were another essential autocrine/paracrine factor that mediated AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and that their contribution was as half as that of endothelin-1.A previous report using smooth muscle cells revealed that AngII could significantly increase the expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner (10−10to10−6 mol/liter) (34Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We stimulated the cardiac fibroblasts with AngII at a concentration of 10−7 mol/liter and obtained compelling evidence for AngII-mediated cytokine production. The AngII concentration we used, however, was higher than the accepted in vivo concentration. Sadoshima et al. (2Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Stayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) reported that mechanical stretch causes secretion of AngII from cardiomyocytes to a concentration of 452 ± 56 pmafter 10 min stretch in the stretch-conditioned media, and that these levels were sufficiently high to trigger the hypertrophic response. Yamazaki et al. (36Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zho Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) reported that conditioned media after cardiomyocyte stretch contained approximately 5 × 10−10 mol/liter AngII. However, since these studies used conditioned media, the autocrine/paracrine-secreted AngII may have been diluted, and the concentration of AngII in vivo might be much higher than these values.Although poly(A)+ RNA and ELISA revealed that AngII strongly augmented IL-6 production from cardiac fibroblasts, we supposed that IL-6 might not be a critical paracrine hypertrophic factor for cardiomyocytes. Previous studies had reported that IL-6Rα is not significantly expressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes (37Hirota H. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), while gp130 and LIF receptor-β were abundantly expressed. Although we could not directly show the release data of LIF and CT-1 due to the lack of a radioimmunoassay or ELISA for these murine cytokines, the present paper demonstrated that AS oligonucleotides that specifically blocked CT-1 and LIF expression significantly attenuated AngII-CM-induced [3H]Phe uptake. The inhibitory effect of the combination of AS oligonucleotides to LIF and CT-1 on [3H]Phe uptake corresponded to that of RX435. These findings indicated that both LIF and CT-1 were secreted from AngII-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts, and were critically involved in the conditioned medium-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Very recently, Kuwahara et al. (35Kuwahara K. Saito Y. Harada M. Ishikawa M. Ogawa E. Miyamoto Y. Hamanaka I. Kamitani S. Kajiyama N. Takahashi N. Nakagawa O. Masuda I. Nakao K. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) revealed that CT-1 secreted from cardiac non-myocytes is significantly involved in hypertrophic changes of cardiac myocytes in co-culture, and suggested that CT-1 is an important local regulator in the process of cardiac hypertrophy. The present study demonstrated that, although the basal expression of CT-1 mRNA was higher than that of LIF, AngII-induced increase in mRNA expression of LIF was much higher than that of CT-1. These findings could easily explain the results that the inhibitory effect of the AS oligonucleotides to LIF on [3H]Phe uptake was bigger than those of AS oligonucleotides to CT-1. Based on these findings, we speculated that both CT-1 and LIF might be critical paracrine hypertrophic growth factors released from cardiac fibroblasts in response to AngII, and that the role of LIF in this paracrine process was as strong as or even stronger than that of CT-1.In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first report to show that AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was mediated by the cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts via IL-6 family cytokines, mainly CT-1 and LIF. The discrepancy of the poor existence of AT-1 receptor in cardiomyocytes and the high effectiveness of ACE inhibitors or AT-1R antagonist on cardiac hypertrophy might be easily explained by these cross-talk of the paracrine factors between cardiac fibroblast and cardiomyocytes.

Here we have investigated the role of Mg2+ cofactor in the guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis processes of the Rho family members, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Differing from Ras and Rab proteins, which require Mg2+ for GDP and GTP binding, the Rho GTPases bind the nucleotides in the presence or absence of Mg2+ similarly, with dissociation constants in the submicromolar concentration. The presence of Mg2+, however, resulted in a marked decrease in the intrinsic dissociation rates of the nucleotides. The catalytic activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) appeared to be negatively regulated by free Mg2+, and GEF binding to Rho GTPase resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity for Mg2+, suggesting that one role of GEF is to displace bound Mg2+ from the Rho proteins. The GDP dissociation rates of the GTPases could be further stimulated by GEF upon removal of bound Mg2+, indicating that the GEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange involves a Mg2+-independent as well as a Mg2+-dependent mechanism. Although Mg2+ is not absolutely required for GTP hydrolysis by the Rho GTPases, the divalent ion apparently participates in the GTPase reaction, since the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates were enhanced 4–10-fold upon binding to Mg2+, andk cat values of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP)-catalyzed reactions were significantly increased when Mg2+ was present. Furthermore, the p50RhoGAP specificity for Cdc42 was lost in the absence of Mg2+ cofactor. These studies directly demonstrate a role of Mg2+ in regulating the kinetics of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and in the GEF- and GAP-catalyzed reactions of Rho family GTPases.

A well established biochemical model depicts them as molecular switches linking extracellular stimuli to the intracellular signaling pathways by cycling between the inactive, GDP-bound state and the active, GTP-bound state (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The GTP binding/GTP hydrolysis cycle of these GTPases serves to turn on and turn off the incoming signals and appears to be under tight regulation by multiple regulatory proteins, among which the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 and the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are responsible for the activation and the deactivation of the Rho GTPases, respectively (15Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1998; 95: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For many Ras superfamily small GTPases, Mg2+ has been shown to be necessary for both guanine nucleotide binding and GTP-hydrolysis. In the presence of Mg2+, Ras exhibits an extremely high binding affinity to the guanine nucleotides with a dissociation constant on the order of subnanomolar concentration (18Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol.

In the cases of Rab3A and related Sec4 GTPases, removal of Mg2+ by EDTA treatment drastically increases the off rate of bound nucleotides and completely abolishes GTPγS binding capability (20Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Kabcenell A.K. Goud B. Northup J.K. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and Rab3A became undetectable when Mg2+cofactor was removed (19John J. Rensland H.

J. 1992; 282: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating that the bivalent ion is absolutely required for GTP hydrolysis in the respective GTPase reactions. In the guanine nucleotide exchange reactions of Ras and ARF, the specific GEFs Sos and ARNO appear to promote the dissociation of GDP in part through destabilizing bound Mg2+ from the respective GTPases (22Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 23Goldberg J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The role of the GEFs in these cases was proposed to stimulate GDP dissociation and to facilitate the formation of a reaction transition state in which the GEFs are tightly bound to the nucleotide-depleted form of the small GTPases (25Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the Rho family GTPases, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, in complex with Mg2+ and guanine nucleotides have been resolved recently (26Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X.

Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Not unlike other small GTP-binding proteins, they utilize the conserved residues in the guanine nucleotide binding core to chelate GDP or GTP, but distinct switch I and switch II residues in the surrounding area of the chelating center are also involved in maintaining the overall conformation. The critical Mg2+-interacting sites appear similar to that of Ras with some unique distinctions. For example, the coordination of Mg2+ in RhoA-GTPγS was found to be identical to that in Ras bound to GMP-PNP (27Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas Rho-GDP seems to employ three water molecules in contrast to four in Ras and an additional hydroxyl of Thr19, carbonyl oxygen of Thr37, and the β-phosphorus oxygen for Mg2+coordination (26Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), due to the conformational differences in the switch I domain. In the Rac1-GMP-PNP structure, residues in the switch I region are disordered (29Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that the nucleotide binding core of Rac1 may adopt a more flexible conformation. The regulatory molecules of Rho GTPases such as RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs, on the other hand, are structurally divergent from other Ras regulator families (14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Although certain key features of action may appear similar (e.g. a conserved arginine residue of RhoGAP is critical for its catalytic function like that in RasGAP (30Bourne H.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), the uniqueness of these regulatory proteins suggests that distinct features for the GTPase-activating and guanine nucleotide exchange reactions are probably involved in the deactivation and activation processes, respectively, for the Rho GTPases. The biochemical properties of guanine nucleotide binding by the Rho family GTPases have not been investigated in detail. Moreover, much remains unknown about the role of Mg2+ in the regulatory interactions of the Rho proteins with their unique sets of GEFs and GAPs. In this study, we provide the first quantitative analysis of the kinetic and equilibrium nucleotide binding properties of three Rho GTPases, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Our results reveal that both the nucleotide binding kinetics and binding affinity of Rho GTPases differ significantly from that of other subfamily members of the Ras superfamily. The Mg2+ cofactor does not affect the nucleotide binding affinity of the Rho proteins per se; rather, it acts solely as a stabilizer for the bound nucleotides by slowing down the off and on rates. We found that RhoGEF plays dual roles in the Rho GTPase activation reaction via a Mg2+-dependent as well as a Mg2+-independent mechanism and that although Mg2+ is not absolutely required for the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP-hydrolysis, it is directly involved in the regulation of the basal GTPase and the GTPase-activating activities. Finally, our studies provide evidence that RhoGEF facilitates guanine nucleotide exchange by destabilizing both bound nucleotide and Mg2+, whereas RhoGAP utilizes the Mg2+ cofactor to achieve high catalytic efficiency and specificity. The radioactive nucleotides [3H]GDP, [γ-32P]GTP, and [35S]GTPγS were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. GDP, GTP, and GTPγS were purchased from Sigma. mantGDP and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) were synthesized as described previously (31Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All chemicals were of the highest quality available, and the water used for buffer preparations was generated by the Milli-Q Academic purification system (Millipore Corp.) with a conductivity resistance of 18.2 megaohms/cm. In order to focus on the G-protein binding core without the complications brought by the flexible carboxyl-terminal ends, recombinant human Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA proteins containing carboxyl-terminal truncation of seven, eight, and eight residues, respectively, were used in the studies as described previously (31Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

The Rho family proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as amino-terminal His6-tagged fusions by using the pET expression system (Novagen). The GAP domain of p50RhoGAP (also known as Cdc42GAP) contains amino acids 205–439 and was expressed in E. colias a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion using the pGEX-KG vector (33Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The GST-Dbl protein and GST-Ha-Ras were generated in a baculovirus system or in E. coli as described previously (34Zheng Y. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Trio N-terminal fragment contains residues 1225–1537, including the intact Dbl homology and Pleckstrin homology domains, and was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein in DE3 strain cells. The N-terminal tagged proteins were purified by glutathione or Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography, and the final purity of all proteins used in the assays was >90% as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In general, the proteins stored in 30% glycerol at −20 °C are stable for up to 2 weeks without activity loss. The protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA assay kit (Pierce), and the effective concentrations of GTPases were measured by using the MESG/phosphorylase system assaying the amount of γPi release after one round of single turnover GTP hydrolysis reaction as described (33Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To remove Mg2+ and nucleotide bound to the Rho GTPases, the purified protein samples (∼100 μm) in buffer A containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 20 mm EDTA were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by centrifugation in a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) at 4000 ×g for 1 h. This typically results in over 10-fold enrichment of the proteins. The treatments of the samples with buffer A and Centricon 10 were repeated three more times, and the samples were subsequently exchanged into buffer B containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT at ∼400 μm concentration. To examine the content of the nucleotide remaining in the protein samples, an aliquot (0.5 ml) of the sample was prepared in a D2O buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT at 1 mm concentration, and the phosphorous contents were determined by 31P NMR measurement as described by Geyer et al. (35Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10308-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) on a Varian INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer. The 31P spectra were recorded at 5 °C at a phosphorus resonance frequency of 202 MHz and were referenced to external 85% H3PO4. Over 15,000 free induction decays were summed after excitation with a 65° pulse using a repetition time of 3 s. In addition, the UV absorption spectra of the EDTA-treated samples were measured at wavelengths between 240 and 300 nm and were compared with that of untreated GTPase samples. To determine the nucleotide binding affinities to Rho GTPases, [3H]GDP or [35S]GTPγS at a specific activity of 6000 cpm/μm was incubated with the respective apo-GTPases at 25 °C for 6 h in buffer B containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT with or without supplement of MgCl2 to the indicated concentrations. The binding reactions were stopped by filtration of the mixtures through nitrocellulose filters, and the radionucleotides remaining bound to the Rho GTPases were quantified by scintillation counting (36Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The dissociation binding constants (K d) of the nucleotide-G protein complex were derived by best fitting the data into a bimolecular binding model. To measure the dissociation rate of guanine nucleotides from Rho GTPases, the apo-GTPases (250 nm) were first complexed with [3H]GDP or [35S]GTPγS in buffer B with or without the supplement of 10 mm MgCl2. After a binding equilibrium was reached (∼60 min), the dissociation reactions were initiated by the addition of 500 μm GDP or GTPγS to the incubation mixtures. At the indicated time intervals, aliquots of the mixtures were withdrawn, and the remaining G-protein-bound radionucleotides were quantified by nitrocellulose filtration. The data were fitted into a single exponential equation to arrive at an apparent dissociation rate constant, k off. The fluorescence measurements were carried out using an SLM-Aminco Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (31Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To monitor the mantGDP fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was set at 360 nm and the emission wavelength at 440 nm. All measurements were performed at 25 °C in buffer B with or without the supplement of the indicated amount of MgCl2. GTP-hydrolysis by the Rho GTPases were measured by the MESG/phosphorylase system, which monitors free γPi release from the bound GTP as described previously (33Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.8-ml solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm MESG, 10 units of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 200 μm GTP, and the indicated amount of Rho proteins was mixed in a 4-mm width, 10-mm path length cuvette. The time courses of absorbance change at 360 nm resulting from the Pi-phosphorylase coupling reaction were recorded on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultraspec III spectrometer. In the cases of GAP-catalyzed reactions, an indicated catalytic amount of p50RhoGAP was included in the reaction buffer. Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using equations derived for Cdc42-, Rac1-, and RhoA-GAP interactions (33Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Zhang B. Chernoff J. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8776-8782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with the program Enzfitter (Elsevier Biosoft). A modified Michaelis-Menten equation was used to derive kinetic parameters for GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis assuming GAP acting as the enzyme catalyst, GTPase-GTP as the substrate, and the GDP-bound GTPase and Pi as the products as described previously (33Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The [3H]GDP/GTP exchange of Cdc42 was measured at 25 or 4 °C as described previously (36Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The exchange reactions were carried out in buffer B with or without the supplement of 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 20 nm purified GST-Dbl. The reactions were terminated at the 5-min time point by nitrocellulose filtration, and the amounts of [3H]GDP remaining bound to Cdc42 were normalized as the percentage of [3H]GDP bound at time 0. For the measurement of the Rac1 exchange reaction, fluorescence emissions at 440 nm of the mantGDP-bound Rac1 were monitored in buffer B with time at various Mg2+ concentrations in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of Trio. The reactions were initiated by the addition of excess free GTP (400 μm) into the reaction mixture. To extract kinetics parameters of the Trio-catalyzed exchange, the initial reaction rates (V 0) were determined at increasing concentrations of Rac1-mantGDP in the presence or absence of Mg2+. The resulting hyperbolic curves were best fitted into a modified Michaelis-Menten equation with a correction term of the intrinsic nucleotide exchange included, V0=Vmax[Rac1­mantGDP]0/(Km+[Rac1­mantGDP]0)+kintrinsic[Rac1­mantGDP]0Equation 1 where V 0 is the initial reaction rate, [Rac1-mantGDP]0 is the total reaction substrate concentration, and k intrinsic is the basal exchange rate of Rac1. k cat is derived byV max/[Trio], with [Trio] representing the GEF concentration present in the reaction. In order to examine the role of Mg2+ in the guanine nucleotide binding process of Rho GTPases, we attempted to generate the metal ion- and nucleotide-free form (apo form) of Rho proteins by using a Centricon-based centrifugation protocol combined with EDTA treatment. This method is similar to what John et al. (19John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have described for apo-Ras generation, in which treatment with 5 mm EDTA followed by a high pressure liquid chromatography isolation step led to the nucleotide- and metal ion-free GTPases while retaining >90% of the GDP binding activities. We found that the Rho proteins, Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1, after repeated treatments by a 60-min centrifugation through Centricon 10 cells following incubations with EDTA in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT), were mostly devoid of bound guanine nucleotide. The removal of bound nucleotide was verified by the measurement of31P NMR spectra of the resulting protein products and by a comparison of the UV absorption spectra of the treated GTPases with the original protein samples. Even after 15,000 free induction decays, little 31P signal was detectable for the EDTA-treated GTPase samples at the phosphorus resonance frequency of 202 MHz, whereas the untreated GTPases showed two resonances corresponding to the α- and β-groups of the bound GDP (data not shown). Furthermore, the UV absorption spectra of the treated proteins displayed a single absorption maximum at 276.0 nm, compared with a 274.1-nm absorption peak and a secondary maximum at 253.0 nm for the original Rho GTPase-GDP complex (data not shown). The Mg2+ content was estimated to be less than 0.01 mol/mol of the treated proteins, assuming that the Mg2+-EDTA complex has a dissociation constant of 1.7 μm at pH 7.6 (19John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins generated in this manner were thus regarded as apo-GTPases and were employed in the following nucleotide binding studies. The nucleotide binding properties of the Rho family GTPases were first examined by incubation of the apo-GTPases with [3H]GDP or [35S]GTPγS at 25 °C in buffer B (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT), which is free of Mg2+. The amounts of nucleotides bound to the apo-GTPases were assessed after 60 min. Interestingly, we observed that in the absence of Mg2+, both [3H]GDP and [35S]GTPγS were able to bind to apo-Rac1 in a saturable fashion with the molar stoichiometry of Rac1/nucleotide at ∼1:0.95 (Fig. 1). A wide range of Mg2+ concentrations in the incubation buffer did not affect the equilibrium binding stoichiometry. Cdc42 and RhoA displayed similar properties in binding to [3H]GDP or [35S]GTPγS in the absence of Mg2+ (data not shown). To confirm the Mg2+-independent nucleotide binding property of the Rho proteins, we carried out a different assay using the fluorescent GDP analog, mantGDP, as a ligand. Fig.2 A shows that the addition of apo-Rac1 to mantGDP in buffer B led to a dose-dependent increase of fluorescence emission, indicating the formation of a Rac1-mantGDP complex under the assay conditions. The mantGDP binding to Rac1 was saturable in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig.2 B), and the presence of excess EDTA (∼1 mm) in the binding assay had no effect on the result (data not shown), again suggesting that Mg2+ cofactor is not required for the nucleotide binding to Rac1. This is in contrast to the previous observations made for other members of Ras superfamily GTPases such as Ras (19John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rab3A (20Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), Sec4p (21Kabcenell A.K. Goud B. Northup J.K. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RalA (39Frech M. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6353-6359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which cases removal of bound Mg2+ by EDTA treatment was found to completely abolish their nucleotide binding capabilities. We conclude that the Rho family GTPases behave differently from other Ras-related molecules in this aspect. To understand the role of Mg2+ in the guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase-activating reactions of the Rho proteins, we first sought to obtain the binding affinities of GDP and GTPγS to Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1 in the absence or presence of MgCl2. Fig. 3 Ashows that the equilibrium binding isotherm of [3H]GDP to Rac1 differed significantly from that of Ha-Ras at the similar assay conditions with 50 nm small G-proteins and 10 mm Mg2+, yielding a dissociation constant (K d) of 0.65 μm ± 0.07 compared with that of Ha-Ras at ≤10 nm by fitting the equilibrium binding data into a bimolecular binding model. The much tighter binding of Ras to [3H]GDP does not allow us to accurately determine the affinity under the assay conditions. Fig. 3, Band C, illustrate the equilibrium binding experiments in which 500 nm apo-Rac1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]GDP or [35S]GTPγS in the presence or absence of 10 mm Mg2+. The derived K d values of GDP and GTPγS binding to Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA are presented in Tables I andII. These values ranged from 0.62 μm (Rac1), 0.59 μm (Cdc42), and 0.48 μm (RhoA) for GDP and 0.24 μm (Rac1), 0.17 μm (Cdc42), and 0.16 μm (RhoA) for GTPγS in the presence of Mg2+ to 0.81 μm(Rac1), 0.73 μm (Cdc42), and 0.65 μm (RhoA) for GDP and 0.77 μm (Rac1), 0.57 μm(Cdc42), and 0.51 μm (RhoA) for GTPγS in the absence of Mg2+.

The amplitudes of acid-induced biphasic responses mediated by co-expressed ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits were much larger (as much as 20-fold) than the currents mediated by the respective homomers, clearly indicating functional association.

Ueno S. Prog. Neurobiol. (NY). 1994; 43: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Detection of acidosis in the periphery by primary sensory neurons plays a physiological role of protection by informing the central nervous system of noxious conditions of inflammation, hypoxia, or tissue damage. Recently, the molecular basis of acid sensing has progressed with the discovery of two types of cation channels directly gated by high concentrations of protons and highly expressed in primary sensory neurons: the vanilloid receptor (VR1) (2Caterina M.J.

Commun. 1998; 246: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Currently three genes and five major transcripts coding for ASIC subunits have been cloned and characterized from mammals. ASIC1a (also named ASIC or BNaC2) subunits are highly enriched in primary sensory neurons of dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia but are also expressed in most brain regions (17Garcia-Anoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and respond to low external pH (pH50 = 6.4) by mediating an amiloride-sensitive and sodium-selective current with fast desensitization kinetics (18Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Rodent ASIC1b (also named ASICβ) corresponds to a splicing variant of ASIC1a with a restricted expression in sensory neurons (19Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). When expressed in heterologous systems, rat ASIC1b subunits assemble in homomeric channels similar to ASIC1a with regard to the functional properties (19Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In an analogous situation to theASIC1 gene, the rodent ASIC2 gene is alternatively spliced to code for two major variants, ASIC2a and 2b, differing in their first 185 and 236 amino-terminal residues, respectively. Neuronal ASIC2a (also named BNaC1, MDEG or BNC1) subunits have a widespread distribution in the nervous system (17Garcia-Anoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Widespread rat ASIC2b (also named MDEG2) subunits show high levels of expression in sensory neurons (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). They do not assemble in pH-sensitive channels by themselves, but they associate with other ASIC partners and change the ion selectivity (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Finally, homomeric ASIC3 receptors (also named DRASIC) respond to low pH applications by a biphasic current with a fast desensitizing phase followed by a late sustained current that might mediate a component of the prolonged pain induced by acidosis (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24De Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Lazdunski M. Waldmann R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite high levels of expression in primary sensory neurons, major differences in the central and peripheral distribution of ASIC3 subunits have been reported between rats and humans (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24De Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Lazdunski M. Waldmann R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Like most ligand-gated ion channels, native ASICs are believed to be heteromeric complexes composed of different subunits assembled around the central conducting pore. Rat ASIC1a and ASIC2a have been shown to interact with ASIC2b in vitro, and the resulting heteromeric channels have slower inactivation kinetics and a lower selectivity for sodium ions than the respective homomeric counterparts (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 26Bassilana F. Champigny G.

Recombinant rat ASIC2b is also able to associate with ASIC3 to mediate a biphasic acid-induced response with a slow and sustained phase that is less selective for sodium ions than that of ASIC3 alone (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The specific amino-terminal sequence of the ASIC2b subunit preceding the first predicted transmembrane domain seems to play a critical role in this modulation of ion selectivity (27Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The set of native heteromeric ASICs could vary between species because of differences in their specific repertoire of ASIC subunit genes and corresponding variants as well as in their regulation of developmental and anatomical patterns of expression. Indeed the ortholog of rodent ASIC2b mRNA has not yet been identified in humans, strongly suggesting that it represents a minor transcript, and ASIC3 shows a widespread distribution in human tissues contrasting with its restricted localization in rat, mainly limited to sensory ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. The present work describes electrophysiological, biochemical, and anatomical evidence for a novel type of heteromeric association between ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits generating gadolinium-sensitive proton-gated channels in humans and rodents. The cDNA coding for human ASIC3 subunit was cloned as previously reported (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rat ASIC3 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from adult trigeminal ganglia reverse-transcribed cDNA using the Expand polymerase mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and gene-specific primers (forward, AGGATGAAACCTCGCTCCGGACT; reverse, GCCTTGTGACGAGGTAACA) based on the published sequence (25Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J.R. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Human ASIC2a in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr François Besnard (Sanofi-Synthelabo, Rueil Malmaison, France). Rat ASIC2a subunit cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR from whole brain random-primed reverse-transcribed cDNA with Expand and the specific primers (forward, CAGTTGCAGAACTGCACAG; reverse, GTGTCAGCAGGCAATCTC) based on the published sequence (17Garcia-Anoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All full-length subunits were then subcloned in pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and validated by functional tests in Xenopusoocytes. Amino-terminal tagging of ASIC subunits with hexahistidine or with EGFP was performed by subcloning corresponding ASIC cDNAs in pcDNA3- His-N (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) vectors, respectively. Carboxyl-terminal tagging of hASIC3 with the FLAG epitope (Sigma) was obtained first by PCR mutagenesis of the native stop codon of hASIC3 into anXhoI site and then by in-frame ligation of the mutated hASIC3 subunit to a XhoI-XbaI FLAG-containing cDNA cassette. In situ hybridization of adult rat brain sections with35S-UTP-labeled riboprobes corresponding to specific protein domains from Ser61 to Met153 and from Ser382 to Pro502 of rat ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits, respectively, was performed as described previously (28Marcinkiewicz M. Nagao T. Day R. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Avoli M. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To document the co-expression of ASIC2a and ASIC3 mRNA in various human tissues, specific oligonucleotide primers were designed and used in a duplex RT-PCR protocol to amplify fragments of 470 and 340 base pairs, respectively, enabling the co-amplification of both messages from a single sample. The reaction was carried out with aTaq and Pwo polymerase mix (Expand, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the reaction mix included 0.5 mm deoxy NTPs, 1 μm forward primer (ASIC2a, TCTTTGCCAACACCTCCACC; ASIC3, AGTGGCCACCTTCCTCTA) and reverse primer (ASIC2a, CTCCTGCCCTTTGAACTTGC; ASIC3, CAGTCCAGCAGCATGTCATC) and 1 ng RT-cDNA template. Cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94 °C, then 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. RT-cDNAs were either purchased from a commercial source (Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels,CLONTECH) or prepared from poly(A)+ RNA (0.5 μg) with the Thermoscript enzyme mix (Life Technologies Inc., Life Sciences). Negative controls contained only water as template. Oocytes surgically removed from adultXenopus laevis were treated for 2 h at room temperature with 1 mg/ml type I collagenase (Sigma) in Barth solution (83 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaOH, 1 mM KC1, 0.82 mM MgSO4·7 H2O, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, pyruvic acid 550 mg/l, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4) under constant agitation. Selected oocytes at stage IV-V were defolliculated manually before nuclear microinjection of 2.5–5 ng of ASIC2a and/or ASIC3 subunits in pcDNA3 vector. Subunits were co-injected at a 1:1 cDNA ratio. After 2–4 days of expression at 19 °C in Barth solution containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1.8 mm CaCl2, currents were recorded in a two-electrode voltage-clamp configuration, using an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments). Currents were acquired and digitized at 500 Hz on a MacIntosh IIci computer with an A/D NB-MIO-16XL interface (National Instruments), and then recorded traces were postfiltered at 100 Hz in Axograph (Axon Instruments). Drugs were prepared in a modified Ringer's solution containing 97 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm acetic acid, 10 mm HEPES (Sigma) brought to pH 7.3 with NaOH. Test solutions were prepared by lowering the pH with HCl and applied to oocytes by constant perfusion (10–12 ml/min) at room temperature. Osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 235 mosM with choline chloride. All currents were measured at their peak. When fast and slow phases were partially superimposed, the amplitude of the fast phases was measured at the inflection point of the shoulder. Dose-response curves were fitted to the Hill sigmoidal equation to calculate pH50 and IC50 values using the Prism 2.0 software package (Graphpad Software). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical comparisons were performed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc test where applicable. Injected oocytes were collected in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted at low speed centrifugation, and homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mm HEPES buffer and 0.3m sucrose, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Membranes from lysates were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C and pelleted at 14000 × g for 5 min. Membrane proteins within supernatants were used for Western blots. Solubilized proteins were incubated with 100 μl of equilibrated anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C under agitation. Then resin beads were washed six times in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Proteins specifically bound to the Ni2+-NTA resin were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, and samples were mixed with 2× SDS-containing loading buffer. Proteins bound to the M2 resin were eluted directly in the loading buffer. Proteins were then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose. Immunostaining was performed either with mouse anti-Xpress peptide monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (Invitrogen) for detection of hexahistidine-Xpress-tagged ASIC subunits or with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (1:5000) (Molecular Probes) for detection of EGFP-tagged ASIC subunits. Washout of unbound primary antibodies was followed by incubation with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunologicals) secondary antibodies (1:2000) for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A robust response to low pH was recorded between 24 and 72 h after nuclear co-injection of rat ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunit cDNAs inXenopus oocytes. Both the maximal amplitude (peak) and the total current induced by application of extracellular pH 4 were significantly larger in oocytes co-injected with ASIC2a and ASIC3 than in oocytes injected with single subunits, when recorded under the same conditions (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, this potentiation could not be explained in amplitude or shape by the algebraic sum of the two types of currents mediated by homomeric ASIC2a and ASIC3 channels. Therefore the observed phenotype was by itself an evidence of functional interaction between these two subunits of proton-gated channels. The association of rat ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits in heteromeric receptors gave rise to a biphasic response with a fast phase followed by a slow and sustained phase typically of larger amplitude. Although there was a significant difference between the fast phases of rat ASIC3 (0.3 ± 0.1 μA) and ASIC2a+3 currents (6.3 ± 1.3 μA, p < 0.05), no potentiation was found when we compared the sum of the fast phases mediated by homomeric rat ASIC2a (3.9 ± 0.9 μA) and ASIC3 to the fast phase of heteromeric rat ASIC2a+3 (p = 0.28) (Fig. 1 B). However, the amplitude of the sustained current mediated by homomeric rat ASIC3 was dramatically increased in the heteromeric response (0.4 ± 0.1 μA versus 8.0 ± 0.9 μA, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1 B). The phenotype of the human homomeric ASIC2a-mediated response to low pH was similar to that of the rat with two kinetics of desensitization (Fig. 2 A). Human ASIC3 receptors responded slowly to low pH and did not desensitize during the 10 s of stimulation. Interestingly, in these series of experiments, we did not record a fast desensitizing phase with the human ASIC3 response as previously reported by de Weille et al. (24De Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Lazdunski M. Waldmann R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Babinski et al. (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Technical variables related to the speed of application of acid solutions could be eliminated because biphasic responses with a fast phase were reproducibly recorded in oocytes injected with rat ASIC3 subunits (Fig.1 A). The biphasic response might be because of the expression of two populations of proton-gated channels. Indeed the differential sensitivity of the two phases to the antagonist amiloride suggests that ASIC3 subunits are able to assemble into fast and slow subtypes of homomeric proton-gated channels with different pharmacological properties. Specific levels of subunit phosphorylation or the translation of endogenous additional channel subunits, for example, could underlie such variability in the expression of biphasic human ASIC3 phenotypes. Nevertheless, a clear potentiation of the response to pH 4 was also recorded in oocytes co-injected with human ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits. In contrast to rat ASIC2a+3, the increased response with the co-expressed human subunits was observed with both the fast (2.4 ± 0.6 μA versus 5.9 ± 0.8 μA, p < 0.01) and the sustained current (0.3 ± 0.03 μA versus 4.1 ± 0.6 μA,p < 0.0001), giving a phenotype that was more distinctly biphasic (Fig. 2 A). Rat and human heteromeric currents reversed at +39.7 ± 0.8 mV and +34.9 ± 1.6 mV for the fast phases respectively, and at +33.1 ± 1.4 mV and +23.2 ± 1.5 mV for three sustained phases, as illustrated in Figs. 1 C and 2 C. Thus, in both species the reversal potential of the two phases was ≥+20 mV, indicating that sodium ions were the main charge carriers of the ASIC2a+3 inward current. This is consistent with the role of the amino-terminal pre-transmembrane region of ASIC2a in the selectivity for sodium ions (27Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus the association of ASIC2a with ASIC3 subunits generates a novel phenotype of non-desensitizing proton-gated channels that are mainly sodium-selective. The small currents recorded in cells injected with ASIC3 alone (see Figs. 1 A and 2 A) suggest that ASIC3 subunits do not assemble favorably into homomeric channelsin vitro. The differences in kinetic properties between rat and human homomeric ASIC3 might be because of specific functional determinants not yet identified, as suggested by the relatively low homology (83% identity) between their primary structures. From this data in Xenopus oocytes, we can also infer that ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits are candidate partners when co-expressedin vivo. Indeed, our results strongly suggest that when ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits are co-expressed, the resulting biphasic currents are mainly mediated by heteromeric channels. However, the actual stoichiometry still remains to be elucidated, and we cannot exclude the possibility that the fast and sustained currents represent two distinct channels with varying composition of ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits. We tested the sensitivity of the response to low extracellular pH mediated by heteromeric ASIC2a+3 receptors. From the dose-response curves from both species shown in Fig.3 A, we could conclude that the fast phase of human ASIC2a+3 (pH50 = 4.6 ± 0.1) is slightly more sensitive to extracellular protons than the fast phase of rat ASIC2a+3 (pH50 = 4.3 ± 0.03) and the sustained phases of both rat and human (rat pH50 = 4.1 ± 0.02, human pH50 = 4.2 ± 0.02). All Hill slopes were found to be >1, indicating that at least two protonations have to occur before activation. Amiloride, a known antagonist for this family of sodium channels, has been shown to inhibit ASIC2a (26Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. deWeille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28819-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) as well as the fast phase of homomeric ASIC3 currents (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24De Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Lazdunski M. Waldmann R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J.R. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) so we challenged the heteromeric ASIC2a+3 receptors with low pH in the presence of 100 μm amiloride (Fig. 3 B). The fast phase of the heteromeric response was significantly inhibited in rat and human ASIC2a+3 (60.3 ± 4.4% versus 45.6 ± 9.1% remaining current). However, the sustained phase was more reduced by amiloride in the human (47.4 ± 8.3%) than in the rat (75.9 ± 3.5%). These pharmacological results are in agreement with the previously reported differential sensitivity of the two phases of homomeric ASIC3 to pH and amiloride (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24De Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Lazdunski M. Waldmann R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), supporting our hypothesis that the slow kinetics and the potentiation of the sustained phase of ASIC2a+3 are mainly conferred by ASIC3. Lanthanides including gadolinium (Gd3+) have been reported to block some types of stretch-activated responses in neurons (29Cunningham J.T. Wachtel R.E. Abboud F.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 2094-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Hamill O.P. McBride D.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar). Because ASIC subunits belong to the same gene family asC.elegans degenerins, which are believed to be mechanoreceptor subunits (5Garcia-Anoveros J. Garcia J.A. Liu J.D. Corey D.P. Neuron. 1998; 6: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Lai C.C. Hong K. Kinnell M. Chalfie M. Driscoll M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Liu J. Schrank B. Waterston R.H. Science. 1996; 273: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the impact of trivalent ions on the activity of homomeric ASIC2a and ASIC3 and heteromeric ASIC2a+3 proton-gated channels. Application (with or without preincubation) of 100 μm Gd3+ with low pH decreased significantly the total response by inhibiting both phases of the current mediated by rat or human ASIC2a+3 (Fig.4 A). To our knowledge, this is the first example of an inhibitory effect of Gd3+ ions on ASIC proton-gated channels. The fast phase of ASIC2a+3 was found to be as sensitive as the slow phase (IC50s = 49.5 ± 13.9 μm versus 50.3 ± 13.1 μm in rat, and 38.8 ± 0.5 μm versus 37.8 ± 1.2 μm in human) (Fig.4 B). Dose-response curves also demonstrated that the Gd3+ inhibition is much more potent on the fast phase of ASIC2a+3 than on the homomeric ASIC2a (IC50 = 49.5 μm versus >1 mm,p < 0.001 in human) (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, for both fast and sustained phases, ASIC3 and ASIC2a+3 receptors seemed to display the same sensitivity to Gd3+, indicating that ASIC3 subunits might be the main determinants of the Gd3+effect on the heteromeric response. Gd3+ inhibition of ASIC3 and ASIC2a+3 might be therefore related to an involvement of ASIC3 subunit-containing channels in the transduction of mechanosensory stimuli in rodents and humans. We tested the biochemical interactions between ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits using immunodetection in Western blot. To co-purify and visualize these two ASIC subunits, we tagged them with hexahistidine-Xpress or EGFP for ASIC2a and with hexahistidine-Xpress or FLAG epitope for ASIC3. The addition of the artificial epitopes created fusion subunits with modified intracellular domains that had the potential to disturb their native functional properties, so we checked their ability to assemble into functional homomeric and heteromeric channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, epitope-tagged ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits correctly assemble into heteromeric channels and respond to extracellular protons as their wild-type counterparts do, with similar kinetics and sensitivity. Thus the addition of the 8-amino acid FLAG peptide, of the 40-amino acid hexahistidine-Xpress polypeptide, or even of the bulky 251-amino acid EGFP tag did not prevent the ASIC subunits from assembling, translocating to the surface of the oocytes, and being activated by low pH. We then purified human ASIC3-containing complexes with either the hexahistidine-binding Ni2+-NTA resin or the FLAG peptide-binding M2 monoclonal antibody resin to check for co-purification of associated ASIC2a partners (Fig. 5 B). A major band of M r = 61.4 ± 2.7 (n = 2) corresponding to the human ASIC2a-His6 subunit co-purified with human ASIC3-FLAG. Similarly, a major band of M r = 91.9 ± 3.1 (n = 4) corresponding to human ASIC2a-EGFP co-purified with ASIC2a-His6 as well as with the ASIC3-FLAG subunits. The validity of the labeling was controlled by the absence of specific signal in oocytes injected with epitope-tagged ASIC2a subunits only (Fig. 5 B). We obtained identical results on association from mammalian human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells transiently co-transfected with these subunits (data not shown). The apparent sizes of ASIC2a-His6 and ASIC2a-EGFP subunits, as well as the difference of M r 30.5 between these two epitope-tagged forms of ASIC2a, were in good correlation with the predicted molecular weights of the corresponding protein constructs. Therefore these experiments of co-purification demonstrate for the first time that ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits can physically associate with high affinity to produce a heteromeric proton-gated channel complex. Because the levels of rat ASIC2a mRNA are very low to undetectable in trigeminal or dorsal root sensory ganglia (22Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), we looked for native co-expression of rat ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits in the rat brain usingin situ hybridization. At the regional level, we detected moderate but significant amounts of both central ASIC2a and ASIC3 mRNA in the cerebellar cortex. Autoradiography at higher cellular resolution on emulsion-dipped sections allowed us to specifically localize these two subunits in the population of Golgi interneurons in the granular layer (Fig. 6 A). Golgi cells are inhibitory interneurons that make γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synapses on the glomeruli of the mossy fibers (31Eccles J.C. Ito M. Szentagothai J. The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine. Springer-Verlag, NY1967Crossref Google Scholar). Thus the expression of ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits make them susceptible to respond to local acidosis by a sustained inhibition of the main input to the cerebellum. Subcellular localization of these channels would help to understand their exact function during normal and pathological activity of the cerebellar network. In human tissues, we relied on RT-PCR analysis to detect the co-expression of ASIC2a and ASIC3 subunits. As illustrated in Fig.6 B, expected RT-PCR products of 470 and 340 base pairs, corresponding to specific regions of ASIC2a and ASIC3 mRNA, respectively, were amplified from several central and peripheral structures where the ASIC3 gene has been previously shown to be transcribed (23Babinski K. Le K.T. Séguéla P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Both subunits were found to be expressed in whole brain, cerebellum, testis, and trigeminal sensory ganglia (Fig.6 B). Low levels of ASIC2a signal were also visible in liver, colon, and ovary. These anatomical data suggest that the ASIC2a+3 subtype of proton receptor might be more widespread in the central nervous system, in sensory ganglia, and in peripheral tissues of human than in rat. Furthermore, the expression of ASIC2a subunits in human sensory ganglia also suggests the presence of homomeric ASIC2a proton-gated channels in sensory neurons. As ASIC2b is the only major variant of the ASIC2 gene in the primary sensory neurons of rat, our data support the idea that the regulation of transcription ofASIC2 is species-specific. Although the exact contribution of ASIC2a+3 receptors to the response of human sensory neurons to low extracellular pH is not yet documented, these differences of distribution could also mean that in humans the heteromeric ASIC2a+3 receptors could correspond to a major sensory subtype, in marked contrast to what has been reported for the rat. Completion of the analysis of the human ASIC2 gene will definitely answer the question about the existence of exon(s) coding for an ASIC2b variant. In any case, we provided evidence that ASIC2a+3 heteromers, likely a major neuronal subtype in humans, will have to be taken into consideration when designing potential therapeutic agents acting on proton-gated channels. The existence of this novel ASIC phenotype illustrates the functional diversity of ion channels involved in the nociceptive response of primary sensory neurons to acidosis.

The ability of a cell to sense and appropriately respond to adverse conditions is determined by an integrated network of intracellular signaling pathways that trigger adaptive and survival responses or mediate events leading to cell death (1Kyriakis J.M.

Environmental stresses as divergent as osmotic shock, ionizing radiation, and nutrient deprivation activate intracellular protein kinase cascades that are generally conserved between metazoans and mammals, culminating in the transcriptional control of specific sets of target genes. The best characterized osmoregulatory signaling pathways have been described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which solute imbalances in the environment are detected by two different receptors, the histidine kinase receptor Sln1 and the four-pass transmembrane receptor Sho1p. The activation of kinase cascades by these receptors leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the HOG11 proline-directed protein kinase (4Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 5Posas F. Takekawa M. Saito H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The HOG1 gene is necessary for the maintenance of osmotic gradients in hyperosmolar environments and allows the proliferation of yeast under osmotic stress (6Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). HOG1 has been shown to phosphorylate various members of the Msn family of transcription factors, resulting in their binding to and transactivation of stress-responsive elements located in the upstream promoter regions of osmotically regulated genes (7Martinez-Pastor M.T.

One class of osmoregulatory genes targeted by HOG1 encode proteins that have osmoprotective functions, such as the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene that is responsible for the accumulation of the yeast osmolyte, glycerol (10Rep M.

In mammalian cells, however, much less is known about the signal transduction pathways that control gene transcription in response to environmental insults. The mammalian homologue of the yeast HOG1 is p38 MAPK, which is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases, has been shown to play a role in transducing stress signals in a variety of cell systems (1Kyriakis J.M.

Activation of p38 MAPK results in the phosphorylation of a variety of targets, a subset of which regulates transcription of stimulus-specific genes (15Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). For example, the p38 MAPK phosphorylation of the ATF2, CHOP, Elk1, MEF2C, and SAP1 transcription factors has been shown to induce their DNA binding and transactivation activity (16Raingeaud J.

A number of protein kinases (such as MAPKAP kinase-2, MAPKAP kinase-3, Mnk-1, PRAK, and RSK-B) have also been shown to be targets of p38 MAPK. These studies suggest the existence of additional hitherto unidentified downstream targets of p38 MAPK signaling that may be responsible for mediating transcription of mammalian osmoregulatory genes (20Waskiewicz A.J.

Although, in some cases, p38 MAPK-initiated phosphorylation events can trigger programmed cell death (26Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

A. 1999; 96: 12016-12020Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the functional connections between the immediate targets of p38 MAPK, its downstream effectors, and the cellular response to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells have yet to be elucidated. Conceivably, important downstream targets of the p38 MAPK stress cascade may themselves be cell-signaling molecules that help trigger and mediate the selectivity of the stress response to environmental cues. We have reported the isolation and characterization of a serine/threonine serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase gene, sgk, by subtractive cloning from a mammary tumor cell cDNA library that is under acute transcriptional control by both serum and glucocorticoids (28Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 29Webster M.K. Goya L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11482-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sgk is approximately 45–55% homologous to Akt/PKB, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and the rat p70S6K/p85S6K. In serum-treated cells, Sgk is phosphorylated and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a cell cycle-dependent manner (30Buse P. Tran S.H. Luther E. Phu P.T. Aponte G.W. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7253-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Sgk enzymatic activity, phosphorylation and subcellular localization is regulated by PI 3-kinase signaling through PDK1, suggesting a possible role for Sgk in a cell survival pathway (31Park J. Leong M.L.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Moreover, the physiological stress hormones, glucocorticoids, stimulatesgk promoter activity through a glucocorticoid response element, and sgk is a transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, a known target of genotoxic stress (28Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 32Maiyar A.C. Huang A.J. Phu P.T. Cha H.H. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for Sgk in the cellular stress response,sgk transcripts have been shown to be elevated in response to ischemic injury of the brain, changes in cell volume, and inflammatory disease and in a screen for transcripts involved in wound repair in fibroblasts (33Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Takagi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Waldegger S. Barth P. Raber G. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, to determine whether transcription of the sgk gene is a component of the stress response in mammalian cells, the hyperosmolar regulation of Sgk was examined in mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that an increase in extracellular solute levels stimulates sgk promoter activity and gene expression through the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. NMuMg nontransformed mouse mammary epithelial cells were originally derived from normal glandular tissue of an adult NAMRU mouse (37Owens R.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 52: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were regularly cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were propagated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 2–3 days. Cell culture reagents such as Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, and trypsin/EDTA were supplied by BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Insulin andd-sorbitol were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Acetyl coenzyme A (200 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. To induce hyperosmotic stress, cells received equal volumes of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (control) or 0.3 msorbitol (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the indicated time. For treatment with the LY294002 PI 3-kinase inhibitor, cells were treated with 50 μm LY294002 for 16 h, half of the cell cultures received serum-free medium with LY294002, and the other half received 0.3 m sorbitol dissolved in serum-free medium containing LY294002. Cells were harvested 24 h later and lysed, and whole cell extracts were analyzed for Sgk protein expression as described below. The construction of the −4.0sgk-CAT plasmid, which contains sgk promoter sequences (−3560 to + 51) cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the vector pBLCAT3, has been described previously (29Webster M.K. Goya L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11482-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various sgk promoter-CAT deletions down to −236 sgk-CAT were generated utilizing the Erase-a-Base system (Promega, Madison, WI) and are further described (32Maiyar A.C. Huang A.J. Phu P.T. Cha H.H. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The −78sgk-CAT was generated as described (38Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the −67 wild type and mutant sgk-CAT vectors, sense and antisense oligonucleotides of the region between −67 and −35 were synthesized as per usual techniques (Microchemical Facility, Cancer Research Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley), and then 800 pmol of each strand were mixed and annealed. The wild type and mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides were then subcloned into the pCAT Basic vector (Promega) containing the region between −35 and +55 of the sgk promoter. The −67 wild type and mutant vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. NMuMg mammary epithelial cells from 60–70% confluent cultures in 100-mm tissue culture plates were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (32Maiyar A.C. Huang A.J. Phu P.T. Cha H.H. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA used in calcium phosphate transfections for CAT assays was held constant at 20 μg, and in appropriate transfections, the total DNA was adjusted to this amount using the empty CAT vector plasmid pBLCAT3 or pCAT Basic. Following transfection for at least 4 h, cells were exposed to a 15% glycerol shock for 3 min at 37 °C. Transfections were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. At 36–40 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested for CAT assays, and the protein content of the cell extracts was estimated with the Bradford procedure (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). A quantitative nonchromatographic assay (40Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar) was used to measure CAT activity in the cell extracts as detailed elsewhere (28Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) NMuMg cells were plated on 10-cm dishes so they were 80–90% confluent on the day of harvest. Cells were scraped on ice using a rubber policeman, washed in 1× PBS, and then pelleted. To each plate, 100 μl of TSM buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mmMgCl2) plus 1 mm dithiothreitol was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and 100 μl of digestion buffer (0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, 0.3m NaCl, 2% SDS) plus 100 μg/ml proteinase K was added. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then extracted two times with 1:1 phenol/chloroform. RNA was precipitated with ethanol overnight at −70 °C, and pellets were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water plus 0.1% SDS. Approximately 10–13 μg of RNA isolated from each sample was separated on a 1.1% agarose/formaldehyde gel run at 3–4 V/cm for approximately 3 h. The RNA was transferred overnight by blotting onto MSI Magnagraph nitrocellulose. The RNA was covalently cross-linked onto the membrane using a Stratagene Stratalinker, and then transfer was confirmed by staining the blot with 0.02% methylene blue dye. The blot was prehybridized for a minimum of 2 h as described previously (28Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The blot was then probed using aSspI/PstI fragment of murine sgkcDNA that was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP random primed labeling (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A total of 10 × 106 cpm/ml of probe in hybridization buffer was added to the blot and allowed to incubate at 42 °C overnight. The blot was washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS twice for a total of 1.5 h at room temperature. The blot was then exposed to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screen for 24 h. Preparation of nuclear extracts from NMuMg mammary cells was based on the method of Dignamet al. (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). The protein contents in the nuclear extracts were determined by the Bradford procedure (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). The sequences of the various oligonucleotides (sense) used for DNA binding studies and cold competition experiments are as follows (mutations indicated in boldface type): sgk −67/−35, 5′-GGTCCCGCCTGCCCCGCCCCCTGGAGGCTC-3′; -67/−35 mutant 1, 5′-TTCGAAGCCTGCCCCGCCCCCTGGAGGCTC-3′; −67/−35 mutant 2, 5′-GGTCCCTTCGAACCCGCCCCCTGGAGGCTC-3′; −67/−35 mutant 3, 5′-GGTCCCGCCTGCTTCGAACCCTGGAGGCTC-3′; −67/−35 mutant 4, 5′-GGTCCCGCCTGCCCCGCCTTCGAAAGGCTC-3′; −67/−35 mutant 5, 5′-GGTCCCGCCTGCCCCGCCCCCTGGTTCGAA-3′. The Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide sequence is 5′-cgatGCCCCGCCCCagtc-3′. The mutant Sp1-binding sequence is 5′-cgatGCCCTTTCCCagtc-3′. The core CGC nucleotides have been changed to TTT, and Sp1 is unable to bind to this sequence (42Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All oligonucleotides were synthesized by a model 394 synthesizer in the Cancer Research Laboratory Microchemical Facility of the University of California, Berkeley. Radiolabeling of 5′-ends of the appropriate oligonucleotides was carried out in the presence of equal amounts (10 pmol) of sense and antisense strands, [α-32P] ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals Inc.), and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by annealing of the labeled strands. The annealing procedure for generating either labeled or unlabeled DNA involved adding 0.1 m NaCl (0.1 volume) to equal amounts of sense and antisense strands, heating for 10 min at 70 °C, and gradually cooling to room temperature. The free unincorporated nucleotides and single-stranded DNA were separated from the end-labeled double-stranded DNA by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gel). The labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was excised and eluted in 400 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) and 40 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 3 h, followed by ethanol precipitation, rinsing in 70% ethanol, and resuspension in TE buffer. The radioactive oligonucleotide probes were stored at −70 °C. The DNA binding reactions (18 μl) contained nuclear extract proteins (7 μg), 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled (approximately 2 × 106 cpm) DNA probe, poly(dI-dC) (2 μg), and 6 μl of 3× binding buffer (21.6% glycerol, 36 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 126 mm KCl, 9 mmMgCl2, 0.9% Nonidet P-40, 180 mmZnCl2, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol) and were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, a 200-fold excess (unless otherwise noted) of the indicated unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was added prior to the addition of radiolabeled DNA probe. In some cases, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C with either 5 μl of specific anti-Sp1 polyclonal antibodies (a generous gift from the R. Tjian laboratory, University of California, Berkeley) or an equal volume (equivalent to 100 ng) of anti-p110 PI 3-kinase polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h before the addition of radiolabeled probes. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 1× gel shift running buffer (25 mm Tris base, 190 mm glycine, 1.3 mm EDTA) at 4 °C, 170 V. The gels were prerun for 0.5–1 h at 4 °C. The protein-DNA complexes in the dried gels were visualized by autoradiography using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hyperfilm. Soluble whole cell extracts (20–50 μg of protein) were electrophoretically resolved on 7.8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was probed with a 1:2500 dilution of affinity-purified anti-Sgk antibody in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 with 1% nonfat dry milk. The goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad) secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. The Western blot was developed by using the Renaissance developing kit (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to x-ray film. Cells were plated onto eight-well LabTek chamber slides and then treated as described (30Buse P. Tran S.H. Luther E. Phu P.T. Aponte G.W. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7253-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The next day, the cells were treated with 0.3 m sorbitol for approximately 4–6 h. Following washes with 1× PBS, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. They were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Affinity-purified anti-Sgk antibody diluted 1:150 in PBS was added to samples and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was added at a dilution of 1:150 in PBS and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with 1× PBS, and coverslips were mounted using Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Results were visualized on a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using Adobe Photoshop 3.0.5 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera. Nonspecific fluorescence was determined by incubation with the secondary antibody alone and shown to be negligible. HEK 293 cells were transfected as described (31Park J. Leong M.L.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and then treated with either serum-free media or 0.3 m sorbitol for 5 min. Cells were placed on ice and extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm NaF, 120 mmNaCl, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 nmmicrocystin (Calbiochem). Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the HA-Sgk protein was immunoprecipitated from 400 μg of cell-free extracts with the anti-HA epitope 12CA5 monoclonal antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and then with lysis buffer and finally with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% β-mercapoethanol). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 60 min at 30 °C in a reaction volume of 50 μl containing 20 μl of immunoprecipitate in kinase buffer, 0.1 mm Sgktide peptide substrate (KKRNRRLSVA), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 1 mm protein kinase A inhibitor (Calbiochem), and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). The kinase reaction was terminated with 0.55 mm EDTA. The 20 μl of the reaction was spotted onto P-81 cation exchanger chromatography paper (Whatman), which was then washed four times in 1% phosphoric acid and dried with acetone. The amount of 32P-labeled Sgktide was quantitated by scintillation counting. Kinase assays performed using endogenous Sgk protein were performed as above except for the following modifications. NMuMg cells treated with either serum-free media or 0.3 m sorbitol for 8 h were harvested and then lysed as described above. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g and precleared with rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 40 min. The Sgk protein was immunoprecipitated from precleared supernatants using affinity-purified anti-Sgk antibodies and protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C. A control set immunoprecipitations employed nonimmune serum. The Sgk-specific transphosphorylation was determined by subtracting the filter-bound radioactivity observed with the nonimmune antibodies from that observed with the Sgk-specific antibodies. To initially test whether sgk gene expression is targeted by the mammalian hyperosmotic stress pathway, the levels of Sgk protein and mRNA were determined in NMuMg (normal murine mammary gland) cells at various times after treatment with 0.3m of the organic osmolyte sorbitol to induce a hyperosmotic stress. Western blot analysis of whole of cell extracts using affinity-purified anti-Sgk polyclonal antibodies (30Buse P. Tran S.H. Luther E. Phu P.T. Aponte G.W. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7253-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) revealed that after an approximately 4-h time lag, sorbitol treatment induced a significant elevation in Sgk protein levels (Fig.1 A). A high level of Sgk protein was still maintained 24 h after the hyperosmotic stress. Northern blot analysis of total cellular mRNA of the same time course using a α-32P-labeled murine sgkcDNA probe demonstrated a striking sorbitol stimulation in expression of the 2.2-kb sgk transcript (Fig.1 B). Consistent with the protein data, sgktranscripts were not detected until 4 h after sorbitol treatment, and sgk mRNA levels continued to accumulate 24 h following treatment. In the absence of sorbitol, the level of Sgk protein and mRNA remained at a low basal level through out the entire time course. To examine whether the sorbitol stimulation of sgk gene expression is a direct response or requires de novo protein synthesis, NMuMg cells were pretreated for 1 h with or without cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), a protein synthesis inhibitor, and then each set of cells was incubated in the presence or absence of 0.3m sorbitol for 24 h. In the cycloheximide-treated cells, protein synthesis was inhibited by greater than 95% without any significant effects on mRNA synthesis (data not shown). Northern blot analysis revealed that pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide had no effect on the"

In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of the Smad7 gene by TGF-β, we cloned and functionally characterized a mouse genomic DNA fragment encompassing the mouse Smad7 proximal promoter. This region was found to contain a CpG island and to be devoid of a classical TATA box. Cloned upstream of a promoter-lacking luciferase reporter gene, this region conferred robust TGF-β-induced transcription. Point mutations in a palindromic Smad binding element, abolished TGF-β inducibility completely. Through the use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we showed the presence of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 in complexes binding to the Smad binding element. Interestingly, we also found that point mutation and/or deletion of binding sites for the transcription factors activator protein-1 and Sp1 led to an attenuation of the basal promoter activity, as well as of the TGF-β-mediated induction of Smad7. Taken together, our data imply that Smads, together with activator protein-1 and Sp1 transcription factors, are essential for efficient Smad7 promoter activity.

They exert their cellular effect by binding to type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, whereby particular intracellular signaling molecules of the Smad family are activated (reviewed in Refs.4Dennler S.

Smads occur as three distinct subclasses: receptor-regulated (R-Smads; Smad2 and Smad3 are TGF-β receptor-regulated Smads, whereas Smad1, -5, and -8 are activated by the bone morphogenetic proteins receptors), common partner (Co-Smads; Smad4) and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads; Smad6 and Smad7). R-Smads are activated by phosphorylation at their C-terminal SS(M/V)S-motifs, whereafter they hetero-oligomerize with the common partner Smad4. The Smad complexes are then translocated to the nucleus where the transcriptional activities of different genes are affected. Smad proteins have in general two large conserved domains, the N-terminal mad homology 1 domain and the C-terminal mad homology 2 domain, which are separated by a less conserved linker region. Within the target gene promoters, Smad3 and/or Smad4 can bind with their respective mad homology 1 domain to specific DNA sequences, called Smad binding elements (SBEs) (4Dennler S. Itoh S.

To date several transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators have been identified to cooperate with Smad molecules in transcriptional activation, such as cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein/p300, forkhead activin signal transducer-1/-2, transcription factor μE3 (TFE-3), PEBP2/core-binding factor A (CBFA), activating transcription factor-2, AP-1, and Sp1 (reviewed in Refs. 8Attisano L.

The mechanisms whereby proteins participate in TGF-β-induced transcription are believed to involve stabilizing transcription factor complexes on the DNA, bridging Smads with the basal transcription machinery and targeting acetyltransferase activity to the promoter regions (reviewed in Refs. 8Attisano L.

In the case of Smad6, an additional level of inhibition exists,i.e. competition for complex formation with Smad4 (13Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Smad7 was found to be rapidly induced by TGF-β in several cell types, as well as in endothelial cells experiencing fluid shear stress (14Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K.

A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The level of transcription is also up-regulated by other signaling pathways as those of the Janus kinase 1/signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 or nuclear factor-κB/RelA, after stimulation with interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-α, respectively (16Ulloa L.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Smad7 is not only a TGF-β-induced antagonist but is also involved in fine tuning the cellular response to TGF-β, by integrating different signaling pathways.In the present report, we have analyzed the mechanism of the Smad7 gene promoter regulation. We show that the promoter contains a methylation-free CpG island and that binding of Smads, as well as AP-1 and Sp1, to specific sequence elements is necessary for efficient basal promoter activity and induction by TGF-β.DISCUSSIONSmad7 has been characterized as an antagonist of TGF-β-initiated signaling (10Hayashi H.

The ability of the Smad7 promoter to respond to TGF-β is therefore believed to play a central role in the negative autoregulation of TGF-β signaling. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the TGF-β-induced expression of the Smad7 gene, we cloned and functionally characterized the mouse Smad7 promoter.Sequencing of a 725-bp region containing the major transcriptional start site (Fig. 1), as defined by Nagarajan and co-workers (18Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), revealed a very high G+C content, reminiscent of CpG islands. These CpG islands are 0.5–5 kilobase in size with a characteristically high G+C content (60–70%) and no suppression of CpG dinucleotide frequency, in sharp contrast to bulk DNA. Initially, CpG islands had been detected as short stretches of DNA, which lack the methyl group in the 5-position of cytosine within the CpG dinucleotide, a fact that is also reflected in their alternative name, methylation-free islands (27Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). CpG islands contain a nucleosome-free region allowing for easy access to transcription factors. They are also devoid of histone H1, whereas the other histones are heavily acetylated. Approximately half of all genes in mouse and humans (40,000 to 50,000 genes) contain CpG islands, comprising mainly housekeeping genes with a broad expression pattern (28Antequera F. Bird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11995-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). However, there are also ∼40% of genes with a tissue-restricted pattern of expression containing CpG islands. Computer analysis of the 725-base pair Smad7 upstream gene sequence indeed predicted a CpG island starting at the DraI site (Fig. 1). Because CpG islands are normally hypomethylated compared with bulk DNA, we tested the methylation status of the Smad7 gene using a method that combines digestion of genomic DNA with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and PCR (29Singer-Sam J. Grant M. LeBon J.M. Okuyama K. Chapman V. Monk M. Riggs A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4987-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the promoter region containing the SBE/AP-1 sites, as well as parts of exon I, qualify as a CpG island (Fig. 2; compare C withA and B). The cluster of multiple Sp1 sites, which we found upstream of the transcriptional start site, is also a characteristic of the CpG islands. In addition to their known function as transcription factors, there is evidence that Sp1 blocks incorrect methylation of CpG islands (30Siegfried Z. Eden S. Mendelsohn M. Feng X. Tsuberi B.Z. Cedar H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Methylation of CpG islands, which goes in hand with gene silencing, occurs naturally only on the inactive X chromosome and in imprinting of one of the parental alleles. Interestingly, a number of tumor suppressor genes have been found to be transcriptionally inactive in cancer because of aberrant CpG island hypermethylation (reviewed in Ref. 31Herman J.G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To predict if Smad7 would be a likely candidate for gene silencing by this type of epigenetic change is not straightforward.In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TGF-β activation of the Smad7 gene, we subcloned a series of 5′-deleted Smad7 upstream promoter regions into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 3). Transient transfection of these constructs lead to the identification of a 27-base pair fragment, which contained a palindromic SBE that was essential for TGF-β response of the Smad7 promoter (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 A; compare 1 with3 and 6). The GTCTAGAC motif of the SBE was initially identified by Zawel et al. (7Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) in a PCR-based screen in search of DNA sequences optimal for Smad binding. The functional relevance of this element in the Smad7 promoter has recently also been investigated by Nagarajan et al. (18Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). They showed that overexpressed, tagged versions of Smad3 and Smad4, in nuclear extracts from cells cotransfected with constitutive active TGF-β type I receptor, are able to associate with the SBE. They also found that mere overexpression of Smad3 in HepG2 cells was able to activate transcription from a Smad7 promoter fragment (18Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate the presence of endogenous Smad2, -3, and -4 in two SBE-protein complexes, which are specifically induced in NIH 3T3 cells, following stimulation with TGF-β (Fig. 4 B). These complexes can be competed by an oligonucleotide corresponding to the wild type SBE sequence but not with one containing a point mutation or by an unrelated probe (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the protein-DNA interaction is specific and sequence dependent.In addition to the observation that Smad protein binding to the intact SBE motif seems to be critical for the TGF-β inducibility of the Smad7 promoter, we provide strong evidence that AP-1 and Sp1 transcription factors are not only essential for basal transcription but also for the efficient TGF-β inducibility of the Smad7 promoter. We found that an AP-1 site, just a few nucleotides downstream of the SBE, bound protein in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 4 C). Using antibodies specifically directed against different AP-1 family members in EMSAs indicated that this protein complex contained c-Fos and c-Jun; possibly the complex also contained Jun-D, because the antibody against Jun-D interfered with the integrity of the DNA protein interaction (Fig. 4 D, lanes 4–6). It is well known that members of the CREB family of transcription factors are able to associate with AP-1 sites (26Masquilier D. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22460-22466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition it had been found that TGF-β induces the phosphorylation of Ser-133 within CREB, which is necessary for its interaction with the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (32Potchinsky M.B. Weston W.M. Lloyd M.R. Greene R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore tested if CREB could be a component of the AP-1 probe-protein complex, but we did not detect any effect of the CREB antibody, even after longer exposure (Fig.4 D, lane 7 and data not shown). We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that other members of the CREB family are involved in the binding of this sequence. We furthermore demonstrate Sp1 interaction to a region containing multiple GC-boxes/Sp1 sites upstream of the major transcriptional start (Fig.4 E).These in vitro data are functionally supported by experiments showing that mutating and/or deleting elements containing binding sites for AP-1 or Sp1 drastically reduce the ability of the Smad7 promoter to respond to TGF-β in luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 5 A). Not only the relative response to TGF-β is affected a significant decrease in basal promoter activity in unstimulated cells is also observed (Fig. 5 A).What could explain the ability of Sp1 and AP-1 to support the TGF-β response? Studies conducted on several different promoters have identified Sp1 sites as major TGF-β-responsive promoter elements (22Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our findings suggest that neither the binding sites for Sp1 alone (Fig. 5 A;10) nor the binding sites for AP-1 and Sp1 together are able to respond to TGF-β stimulation, the latter of which is indicated by point mutation or deletion of the SBE (Fig. 5 A; 3and 6). Significant TGF-β inducibility over basal promoter activity requires the combination of the SBE with at least either AP-1 or Sp1. Overexpression of Sp1 resulted in a more than 6-fold increase of the basal Smad7 promoter (compare Fig. 5B; 1 and Fig. 5A; 1), whereas deletion of the Sp1 region drastically reduced the promoter's response to the Sp1 overexpression (Fig. 5B; 2). Interestingly, overexpression of Sp1 cannot compensate for the mutation of the AP-1 binding site in an otherwise wild type promoter configuration (Fig.5 B; compare 1 and 3), underlining the necessity for both DNA binding elements in the transcriptional regulation of the Smad7 promoter.The role of AP-1 in TGF-β-regulated gene expression was investigated by Zhang and co-workers (38Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that Smad3 directly associated to 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate-responsive gene promoter elements. These 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate-responsive gene promoter elements are in effect AP-1 binding sites, because they could bind to and mediate transcription through c-Jun and c-Fos. It was also shown that c-Jun and Smad3 simultaneously could associate to overlapping sequences in the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate-responsive gene promoter element. This was supported by the observation that following activation by TGF-β, Smad3, and Smad4 can physically interact with c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and c-Fos (38Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R.

A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Other examples showing primary importance of AP-1 conferring TGF-β-induced transcription are the promoters for the TGF-β1 gene itself and the promoter for the plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (40Keeton M.R.

Mutation of the AP-1 site completely abolished any protein binding in vitro (Fig.4 C) and led to a drastic reduction in Smad7 promoter activity (Fig. 5 compare lanes 1 and 7) underscoring the importance of AP-1 for the Smad7 promoter. In summary, our data strongly support a molecular mechanism demanding the cooperation between Smads, Sp1, and AP-1, in mediating a full TGF-β response in the mouse Smad7 promoter. Members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily of peptide growth factors, which include TGF-β isoforms, activin, and bone morphogenetic proteins, play important roles in a broad range of cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, terminal differentiation, and specification of developmental fate (1Roberts A.B.

They exert their cellular effect by binding to type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, whereby particular intracellular signaling molecules of the Smad family are activated (reviewed in Refs.4Dennler S.

Smads occur as three distinct subclasses: receptor-regulated (R-Smads; Smad2 and Smad3 are TGF-β receptor-regulated Smads, whereas Smad1, -5, and -8 are activated by the bone morphogenetic proteins receptors), common partner (Co-Smads; Smad4) and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads; Smad6 and Smad7). R-Smads are activated by phosphorylation at their C-terminal SS(M/V)S-motifs, whereafter they hetero-oligomerize with the common partner Smad4. The Smad complexes are then translocated to the nucleus where the transcriptional activities of different genes are affected. Smad proteins have in general two large conserved domains, the N-terminal mad homology 1 domain and the C-terminal mad homology 2 domain, which are separated by a less conserved linker region. Within the target gene promoters, Smad3 and/or Smad4 can bind with their respective mad homology 1 domain to specific DNA sequences, called Smad binding elements (SBEs) (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 5Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The mad homology 2 domain of Smads displays transcriptional activation activity. To date several transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators have been identified to cooperate with Smad molecules in transcriptional activation, such as cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein/p300, forkhead activin signal transducer-1/-2, transcription factor μE3 (TFE-3), PEBP2/core-binding factor A (CBFA), activating transcription factor-2, AP-1, and Sp1 (reviewed in Refs. 8Attisano L.

Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby proteins participate in TGF-β-induced transcription are believed to involve stabilizing transcription factor complexes on the DNA, bridging Smads with the basal transcription machinery and targeting acetyltransferase activity to the promoter regions (reviewed in Refs. 8Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar and 9ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem.

Smad6 and Smad7 antagonize ligand-initiated signaling by competing with the receptor-regulated Smads for binding to the receptor (10Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

In the case of Smad6, an additional level of inhibition exists,i.e. competition for complex formation with Smad4 (13Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Smad7 was found to be rapidly induced by TGF-β in several cell types, as well as in endothelial cells experiencing fluid shear stress (14Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K.

A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The level of transcription is also up-regulated by other signaling pathways as those of the Janus kinase 1/signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 or nuclear factor-κB/RelA, after stimulation with interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-α, respectively (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 17Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Smad7 is not only a TGF-β-induced antagonist but is also involved in fine tuning the cellular response to TGF-β, by integrating different signaling pathways. In the present report, we have analyzed the mechanism of the Smad7 gene promoter regulation. We show that the promoter contains a methylation-free CpG island and that binding of Smads, as well as AP-1 and Sp1, to specific sequence elements is necessary for efficient basal promoter activity and induction by TGF-β. DISCUSSIONSmad7 has been characterized as an antagonist of TGF-β-initiated signaling (10Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N.

The ability of the Smad7 promoter to respond to TGF-β is therefore believed to play a central role in the negative autoregulation of TGF-β signaling. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the TGF-β-induced expression of the Smad7 gene, we cloned and functionally characterized the mouse Smad7 promoter.Sequencing of a 725-bp region containing the major transcriptional start site (Fig. 1), as defined by Nagarajan and co-workers (18Nagarajan R.P.

These CpG islands are 0.5–5 kilobase in size with a characteristically high G+C content (60–70%) and no suppression of CpG dinucleotide frequency, in sharp contrast to bulk DNA. Initially, CpG islands had been detected as short stretches of DNA, which lack the methyl group in the 5-position of cy"
https://openalex.org/W2056497879,"Simulations show that when low-volume fractions of nanoscale rods are immersed in a binary, phase-separating blend, the rods self-assemble into needle-like, percolating networks. The interconnected network arises through the dynamic interplay of phase-separation between the fluids, through preferential adsorption of the minority component onto the mobile rods, and through rod-rod repulsion. Such cooperative effects provide a means of manipulating the motion of nanoscopic objects and directing their association into supramolecular structures. Increasing the rod concentration beyond the effective percolation threshold drives the system to self-assemble into a lamellar morphology, with layers of wetted rods alternating with layers of the majority-component fluid. This approach can potentially yield organic/inorganic composites that are ordered on nanometer scales and exhibit electrical or structural integrity."

The present studies explored the role of cholesterol-rich domains in maintaining this functional association. The cholesterol-binding agent, filipin, profoundly inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin did not affect forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and did not affect capacitative Ca2+entry. However, cholesterol depletion completely ablated the regulation of adenylyl cyclase by capacitative Ca2+ entry. Repletion of cholesterol restored the sensitivity of adenylyl cyclase to capacitative Ca2+ entry. Adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity and immunoreactivity were extracted into buoyant caveolar fractions with Triton X-100. The presence of adenylyl cyclase in such structures was eliminated by depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol. Altogether, these data lead us to conclude that adenylyl cyclase must occur in cholesterol-rich domains to be susceptible to regulation by capacitative Ca2+ entry.

We have previously shown an absolute requirement for capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE),1 rather than Ca2+ release from stores or ionophore-mediated Ca2+ entry, as the means whereby Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are regulated by Ca2+. This regulation persists whether the cyclases are endogenously or heterologously expressed in non-excitable cells (2Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

These and other data led us to propose that adenylyl cyclases and CCE channels are localized in the same functional domain of the plasma membrane (4Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this functional colocalization is currently unknown. A role for cytoskeletal elements in maintaining the association between CCE sites and Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases was ruled out by disruption of either actin or microtubule filaments, without a consequence for the regulation of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases by CCE (4Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism for this colocalization could be the preferential insertion of these two proteins into cholesterol-rich microdomains within the plasma membrane, such as caveolae. Caveolae, which were first described by Palade and co-workers in the 1950s (8Palade G.E. J. Appl. Phys. 1953; 24: 1424Google Scholar), are flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that are rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar). Caveolae and, in broader terms, detergent-insoluble, glycosphingolipid-enriched domains (DIGs), 2Several terms have been coined to describe cholesterol-rich domains, which are also rich in glycosphingolipids. These characteristics render them Triton-insoluble at 4 °C and buoyant in sucrose gradients. In this paper, the term cholesterol-rich domain includes “rafts,” caveolae, “DIGs” (detergent-insoluble, glycosphingolipid-enriched domain), and “DRMs” (detergent-resistant membranes). 2Several terms have been coined to describe cholesterol-rich domains, which are also rich in glycosphingolipids.

In this paper, the term cholesterol-rich domain includes “rafts,” caveolae, “DIGs” (detergent-insoluble, glycosphingolipid-enriched domain), and “DRMs” (detergent-resistant membranes). have been postulated to provide a platform for the concentration of signaling molecules (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar, 10Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). A number of the components of the cAMP-signaling cascade have been localized to caveolae, including several G-protein-coupled receptors as well as heterotrimeric G-proteins (for review see Ref. 11Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity has also been reported in low density membrane fractions, from both S49 lymphoma and fibroblast cells (12Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Western blotting revealed that heterologously expressed ACIII, ACIV, and ACV in Sf9 cells were also localized to caveolin-enriched membrane fractions (13Schwencke C. Yamamoto M. Okumura S. Toya Y. Kim S.J. Ishikawa Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). In cardiac tissue, ACV was coimmunoprecipitated with caveolin-3 (a resident protein of caveolae) (13Schwencke C. Yamamoto M. Okumura S. Toya Y. Kim S.J. Ishikawa Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin modulated the activity of several of these components, such as the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (14Razani B. Rubin C.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26353-26360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and adenylyl cyclase in a type-specific fashion. For instance, caveolin inhibited ACIII and ACV but did not affect ACII (15Toya Y. Schwencke C. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2025-2031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the ganglioside GM1 (the receptor molecule for the entry into cells of cholera toxin, which ADP-ribosylates G-protein α subunits) in caveolae is a further indication that cAMP signaling may concentrate in these structures (16Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Jobling M.G. Webb H.M. Ruston S. Madara J.L. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The identity of the channel(s) responsible for CCE is not known. Consequently, the subcellular localization of CCE is not directly discernible. However, it is notable that several proteins involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, such as an InsP3 receptor-like molecule and Ca2+-ATPase, are found in caveolae (17Fujimoto T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 7-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fujimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, it has also been shown that agonist-evoked release of intracellular Ca2+ originates near caveolin-rich cell edges (19Isshiki M. Ando J. Korenaga R. Kogo H. Fujimoto T. Fujita T. Kamiya A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5009-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have evaluated the role of caveolae in maintaining the colocalization of CCE sites and the Ca2+-inhibitable ACVI in C6-2B glioma cells. Initial experiments showed that adenylyl cyclase activity was sensitive to cellular treatment with filipin, a cholesterol-binding agent, which suggested a potential localization in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. Electron microscopic analysis revealed morphologically identifiable caveolae along the plasma membrane. Extraction of the cells with the detergent, Triton X-100, followed by density gradient fractionation revealed that a portion of adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity comigrated with caveolin immunostaining in buoyant membrane fractions that were consistent with cholesterol-rich membranes. Adenylyl cyclase activity also occurred in these low density fractions. Depletion of membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) resulted in the retention of both adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity and enzymatic activity in heavier, Triton-soluble fractions. In whole-cell experiments, disruption of caveolae by cholesterol depletion, using MβCD, eliminated the ability of CCE to regulate adenylyl cyclase, without significantly affecting CCE. The regulation of adenylyl cyclase by CCE could be restored by repletion of membrane cholesterol. These results indicate that the functional colocalization of CCE channels and adenylyl cyclase activity in C6-2B cells is heavily dependent on the residence of ACVI in caveolae. Thapsigargin and forskolin were from Calbiochem. [2-3H]Adenine, [3H]cAMP, and [α-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fura-2/AM and pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes, Inc.

C6-2B rat glioma cells were maintained in 13 ml of F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Gemini) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were plated at approximately 70% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes 2 days prior to use. Cellular cholesterol was depleted in attached C6-2B cells by washing twice with PBS, followed by incubation in F-10 media (without serum, plus 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing the indicated MβCD concentration at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and used in either cell fractionation or cAMP accumulation experiments. Cholesterol repletion was performed exactly as described previously (20Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, cholesterol·MβCD complexes were formed by the addition of cholesterol (6 mg dissolved in 80 μl of (2:1) isopropyl alcohol:CHCl3) to a stirred MβCD solution (200 mg dissolved in 2.2 ml of H2O) maintained at 80 °C, until clear. The complexes were then added to serum-free F-10 media to a final concentration of 0.2 mmfor 45 min at 37 °C. Cholesterol was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with coprostanol as internal standard, essentially as described (21Sandhoff R. Brugger B. Jeckel D. Lehmann W.D. Wieland F.T. J.

C6-2B cells on 100-mm dishes were incubated in F-10 medium (90 min at 37 °C) with [2-3H]adenine (20 μCi/dish) to label the ATP pool. The cells were then washed once, detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing EDTA (0.03%), and resuspended in a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 m Tris base. The cell suspension from one 100-mm dish was aliquoted into 12 tubes for cAMP determination. The use of Ca2+-free Krebs buffer in experiments denotes the addition of 0.1 mm EGTA to the nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer. All experiments were carried out at 30 °C in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm), which was preincubated with the cells for 10 min prior to a 1-min assay. Assays were terminated by addition of 10% (w/v final) trichloroacetic acid. Markers were added to monitor the recovery of cAMP and ATP. After pelleting, the [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP contents of the supernatant were quantified as described previously (23Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. Results are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations, unless indicated otherwise. C6-2B cells (10 × 106/ml) were loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) plus 0.02% pluronic acid in F-10 media (without serum, containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) for 25 min at room temperature, as described previously (22Fagan K.A.

The cells were then washed twice with the same media and resuspended at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots (400 μl; 4 × 106 cells) were pelleted, resuspended in nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer, and used for [Ca2+] i measurements in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. Cells were pretreated with EGTA (0.1 mm) followed by the additions of thapsigargin (TG; 100 nm, at 60 s) and [Ca2+] o (300 s), as indicated. The 340/380 nm emission ratios were converted to [Ca2+] using the standard formula (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For morphological observation, cells were grown in plastic culture dishes made of Permanox plastic, then fixed in a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 mNa2HPO4, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2) for 20 min, and extensively washed with PBS. Cells were then post-fixed in 4% OsO4 for 1 h followed by another brief rinse in PBS. Cells were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol solutions (48, 70, 90, 95, and 100% EtoH) and infiltrated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and EPON resin. After a change to fresh, pure resin, dishes containing cells were polymerized at 60 °C in an oven overnight. Small areas of the polymerized wafers were trimmed out with a razor blade and mounted on EPON blanks. Ultrathin sections were obtained from the tissue blocks and were collected on copper mesh grids. Grids were lightly counter-stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and were viewed and photographed with a Philips CM10 electron microscope. Low density, Triton X-100-insoluble membranes were purified from C6-2B glioma cells using a modified protocol as described (25Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, attached cells (six 100-mm tissue culture dishes/condition) were washed with PBS, detached using PBS containing 0.03% EDTA, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold TNE (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmbenzamidine) with or without 1% Triton X-100 and kept on ice for 30 min. Following homogenization (10 strokes with a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer), the sample was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 60% sucrose in TNE and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube containing a 5–30% (4.5 ml of each) discontinuous sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 190,000 × g (39,000 rpm) in an SW-40 rotor (16–18 h, 4 °C). Fractions (10 × 1.2 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient, and the non-solubilized cell pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of TNE. The cell pellet required brief sonication (5 s at 50% power; Fisher Instruments Sonic Dismembrator 60) to resuspend. Following fractionation, 400 μl was taken from each fraction for precipitation of proteins using 2 mmsilicotungstic acid and 5% trichloroacetic acid. Fractions were treated for 1 h on ice, and the resulting pellet was washed three times in acetone and air-dried. The pellet was resuspended in 60 μl of 1% SDS for Western blotting. An additional aliquot of the non-precipitated fraction was used for protein determination using the Pierce BCA assay kit. 10 μl of each precipitated fraction was used for caveolin immunoreactivity determination. Proteins were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked in 3% milk overnight followed by incubation with caveolin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) at a final dilution of 1:2500 in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20) with 1% milk. Signal detection was achieved using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) and film detection. Adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity in the precipitated fractions was determined using a protocol from Caliet al. (26Cali J.J. Parekh R.S. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1089-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Dithiothreitol was added to 20 μl of each fraction at 100 mm final concentration. The samples were heated at 80 °C for 20 min and cooled to room temperature, and fresh N-ethylmaleimide was added to 60 mm. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before addition of warmed loading buffer (150 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, trace bromphenol blue). The entire volume was immediately loaded onto 7.5% acrylamide gels for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, washed in TTBS, and dried. The membrane was rewet and blocked in 10% milk for 2 h followed by incubation with adenylyl cyclase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final dilution of 1:500 in TTBS plus 1% milk. Signal detection was achieved using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) and film detection. Determination of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro was performed as described previously (27Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications. Specifically, aliquots (75 μl) from each gradient fraction were assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of the following components: 12 mmphosphocreatine, 1 unit of creatine kinase, 0.1 mm cAMP, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 50 μmforskolin, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture (final volume, 400 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated with sodium lauryl sulfate (0.5%); [3H]cAMP was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantitated according to the standard Dowex/alumina methodology (28Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Data points are presented as mean activities ± S.D. of duplicate determinations. In order to probe the lipid environment of ACVI, C6-2B cells were treated with the cholesterol-binding agent filipin. Filipin is an invasive sterol-binding agent, which inserts into the membrane and binds cholesterol (29Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Filipin exerted profound inhibitory effects on adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 1). The compound was quite potent, with complete inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity at 10 μg/ml. This finding strongly indicated that perturbation of cholesterol has profound consequences for adenylyl cyclase activity. The potential contribution of cholesterol to the functional colocalization of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases and CCE sites was assessed by cholesterol depletion experiments using MβCD. MβCD is non-invasive and extracts cholesterol via its hydrophobic core (29Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). C6-2B cells were incubated in media without serum containing varying amounts of MβCD at 37 °C. Following this treatment, the cells were washed, and the ability of CCE to inhibit the endogenous ACVI was assessed (Fig.2). Intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted in cells maintained in Ca2+-free Krebs buffer by treatment with thapsigargin (TG). (TG is a sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor that causes the passive release of Ca2+ from the stores by a leak mechanism (30Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). This depletion of the Ca2+ stores primes the cell for CCE upon addition of [Ca2+] o .) Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed over 1 min, upon the addition of forskolin, along with varying [Ca2+] o . 3Forskolin-stimulated activity was chosen since it would be expected that the established presence of hormone receptors and G-proteins in cholesterol-rich domains (see Ref. 11Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar for review) could result in some attenuation of hormone-stimulated activity overlaid on reversal of CCE-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. These two effects could obscure the issue of the importance of the lipid milieu to the regulation of adenylyl cyclase by CCE. Increasing [Ca2+] o resulted in progressive inhibition of the cyclase, which ranged from 20% with 0.5 mm [Ca2+] o to 36% with 2 mm [Ca2+] o (Fig. 2). This graded inhibition of the cyclase mirrored the increasing CCE triggered by increasing [Ca2+] o (4Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MβCD treatment resulted in a complete ablation of CCE-mediated inhibition of the cyclase at all [Ca2+] o , without any effect on forskolin stimulation of activity (Fig. 2). The cellular depletion of cholesterol by MβCD can be reversed by forming a soluble complex of MβCD and cholesterol, which when added to cells, leads to the incorporation of cholesterol into membranes (20Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To ascribe unequivocally the ablation of CCE-mediated inhibition of ACVI to the depletion of cholesterol, the ability of cholesterol repletion to reverse the effect was examined, as introduced by Pike and Miller (20Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) in their studies of EGF-stimulated PtdInsP2 hydrolysis. Following cholesterol depletion, C6-2B cells were incubated in serum-free media containing soluble MβCD·cholesterol complexes prior to cAMP determinations (Fig. 2; see “Experimental Procedures”). Cholesterol repletion reversed the loss of CCE-mediated inhibition seen following cholesterol depletion, resulting in inhibition of cAMP accumulation ranging from 17 to 27% at [Ca2+] o of 0.5 and 2 mm, respectively, which is very similar to control values. In order to verify that MβCD was exerting a significant effect on cholesterol levels, cholesterol content was measured as a function of MβCD treatment by mass spectrometry of methanol extracts (see “Experimental Procedures” (21Sandhoff R. Brugger B. Jeckel D. Lehmann W.D. Wieland F.T. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). With increasing MβCD concentrations, the amount of cholesterol falls to 1.9 μg/100-mm dish at 15 mm MβCD, which represents a 70% decrease from control values (Fig. 3). A possible explanation for the ablation by MβCD of CCE-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase could have been a compromising of CCE. This issue was addressed in experiments with Fura-2-loaded populations of C6-2B cells that had been treated (or not) with MβCD, as in Fig. 2(see “Experimental Procedures”). CCE was stimulated in cells maintained in Ca2+-free Krebs buffer by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores followed by the addition of [Ca2+] o (Fig. 4). The depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by TG (100 nm; 60 s) produced a characteristically modest [Ca2+] i rise (∼60–80 nm) which was slightly smaller and slower in the cholesterol-depleted cells. At 300 s, [Ca2+] o (4 mm) was added, yielding a robust [Ca2+] i rise that was similar between control and MβCD-treated cells. The control and MβCD-treated cells reached peak [Ca2+] i values of ∼550 and 500 nm, respectively. (Note, cAMP accumulation was measured over the 1-min period corresponding to 300–360 s in the Ca2+ trace, where there is no discernible difference between the two conditions; see Fig. 2.) Since MβCD had little effect on either CCE or forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, but substantially reduced the ability of CCE to regulate the cyclase, it seemed reasonable to conclude that, for their functional interaction, the CCE channel and the adenylyl cyclase might be localized within a cholesterol-rich domain. Caveolae are rich in cholesterol as well as sphingolipids and could provide an identifiable, morphological domain for the localization of ACVI (31Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zhang X.L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Caveolae are not found in all cell types. Consequently, electron microscopy was used to determine whether C6-2B cells possess morphological structures resembling caveolae. Caveolae could clearly be seen, as indicated by the invaginations of the plasma membrane (not shown). The diameter of these structures was ∼50–100 nm, which is consistent with previously reported dimensions of caveolae (32Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar, 33Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Additionally, the distribution of invaginated caveolae was irregular along the plasma membrane, consistent with the presumed transient nature of these structures (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7946) Google Scholar). Confirmation of caveolar morphology in these cells stimulated our further investigations of the role of caveolae in maintaining the functional association between CCE sites and adenylyl cyclase. The molecular nature of the CCE channel is not known, and its subcellular localization cannot be determined by immunohistochemistry, for example. However, given that the CCE channel and adenylyl cyclase are functionally colocalized (4Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and that this interaction is susceptible to cholesterol disruption, the localization of ACVI in cholesterol-rich domains could be pursued using ce"
https://openalex.org/W1998767340,"Abstract Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) was first identified as a semaphorin receptor involved in neuron guidance. Subsequent studies demonstrated that NP-1 also binds an isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as several VEGF homologs, suggesting that NP-1 may also function in angiogenesis. Here we report in vitro binding experiments that shed light on the interaction between VEGF165 and NP-1, as well as a previously unknown interaction between NP-1 and one of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR1 or Flt-1. BIAcore analysis demonstrated that, with the extracellular domain (ECD) of NP-1 immobilized at low density, VEGF165 bound with low affinity (K d = 2 μm) and fast kinetics. The interaction was dependent on the heparin-binding domain of VEGF165 and increased the affinity of VEGF165 for its signaling receptor VEGFR2 or kinase insert domain-containing receptor. The affinity of VEGF165 for the NP-1 ECD was greatly enhanced either by increasing the density of immobilized NP-1 (K d = 113 nm) or by the addition of heparin (K d = 25 nm). We attribute these affinity enhancements to avidity effects mediated by the bivalent VEGF165 homodimer or multivalent heparin. We also show that the NP-1 ECD binds with high affinity (K d = 1.8 nm) to domains 3 and 4 of Flt-1 and that this interaction inhibits the binding of NP-1 to VEGF165. Based on these results, we propose that NP-1 acts as a coreceptor for various ligands and that these functions are dependent on the density of NP-1 on the cell membrane. Furthermore, Flt-1 may function as a negative regulator of angiogenesis by competing for NP-1."

The cell docking sites have been mapped to domains D3 and D5H of kininogens; however, the corresponding cellular acceptor sites are not fully established. To characterize the major cell binding sites for kininogens exposed by the endothelial cell line EA.hy926, we digested intact cells with trypsin and other proteases and found a time- and concentration-dependent loss of 125I-labeled high molecular weight kininogen (H-kininogen) binding capacity (up to 82%), indicating that proteins are crucially involved in kininogen cell attachment. Cell surface digestion with heparinases similarly reduced kininogen binding capacity (up to 78%), and the combined action of heparinases and trypsin almost eliminated kininogen binding (up to 85%), suggesting that proteoglycans of the heparan sulfate type are intimately involved. Consistently, inhibitors such asp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside and chlorate interfering with heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthesis reduced the total number of kininogen binding sites in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (up to 67%).

Cloning and over-expression of the major endothelial heparan sulfate-type proteoglycans syndecan-1, syndecan-2, syndecan-4, and glypican in HEK293t cells significantly increased total heparan sulfate at the cell surface and thus the number of kininogen binding sites (up to 3.3-fold). This gain in kininogen binding capacity was completely abolished by treating transfected cells with heparinases. We conclude that heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of endothelial cells provide a platform for the local accumulation of kininogens on the vascular lining.

The nonapeptide bradykinin (BK)1 is released from its precursor, high molecular weight kininogen (H-kininogen, HK), by the action of plasma kallikrein, whereas lysyl-BK (kallidin) is liberated from low molecular weight kininogen (l-kininogen, LK) by tissue kallikrein (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their extremely short half-lives in plasma (<15 s), kinins are thought to operate strictly locally; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the circumscribed release of kinin hormones are rather poorly understood (2Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two major modes of locally acting hormone systems exist. (i) In the paracrine mode, the production, release and action of hormones is limited to a set of neighboring cells. This mode is exemplified by chemokines (3Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (4Kojima T. Katsumi A. Yamazaki T. Muramatsu T. Nagasaka T.

Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). Chemokines are “caught” by the cell surface proteoglycan (PG) layer of their target cells, which restricts their diffusion and eventually delivers them to their cognate receptors on adjacent cells (7Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). (ii) In the endocrine mode, cells produce hormones at sites distant from their target cells, and the effectors are transported to and taken up at their site of action. A combined endo-/paracrine mode is exemplified by the kinin system in which hepatocytes produce and secrete large quantities of prohormones; the total plasma concentration of kininogens approaches 2 μm (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that kininogens and their complexes with plasma prekallikrein or factor XI (8Thompson R.E. Mandle Jr., R. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) associate with the surface of cardiovascular cells such as endothelial cells (9Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), exposing vast numbers (up to 107) of specific “docking” sites to which kininogens bind with high affinity (7–52 nm) in the presence of Zn2+ (9Greengard J.S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4698-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kininogen binding to cellular surfaces does not trigger any of the known intracellular signaling cascades of the acceptor cells; therefore, it has been postulated that cell binding of kininogens serves to accumulate kinin precursors on the surface of their target cells (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herwald H. Dedio J. Kellner R. Loos M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

As yet ill defined stimuli propagate the spatially and temporally controlled liberation of short-lived kinin agonists in proximity to their corresponding receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial or smooth muscle cells.The structural requirements for specific cell binding of kininogens have been explored in some detail, e.g. the kininogen segments docking to cell surfaces were precisely mapped. One site is represented by a sequence of 27 amino acid residues, LDC27, located in domain D3 of the common heavy chain of HK and LK (12Herwald H. Hasan A.A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second cell binding site comprises a sequence of 20 residues, HKH20, located in domain D5H of the unique light chain of HK. This latter segment, forming the major HK cell attachment site, is part of a highly basic region with clusters of histidine, lysine, and glycine residues (13Hasan A.A. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The two sites in D3 and D5H flank the kinin sequence in domain D4, which further modulates the association of HK with cell surfaces (14Hasan A.A. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol.

Unlike the cell attachment sites of kininogens, the corresponding acceptor structures of target cells are still poorly defined. Using affinity isolation techniques and/or antibody competition experiments, six potential HK binding proteins of cardiovascular cells have been characterized: the integrin receptor Mac-1/αMβ2 (15Wachtfogel Y.T.

Med. 1999; 5: 555-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although all of these proteins specifically bind kininogens, they do not share any known sequence motif(s) in their protein portions that may serve as a common binding structure for kininogens. Further, none of the candidate docking proteins can fully account for kininogen cell binding because of cell type-specific expression (Mac-1, glycoprotein-Ib, thrombospondin-1) association with intracellular compartments (p33/gC1qR, cytokeratin-1), and/or low copy number (urokinase receptor (21Mandriota S.J.

Using a combined strategy of enzymatic digestion, metabolic inhibition, and recombinant over-expression, we demonstrate that proteoglycans such as HS-PG account for the vast majority of cell surface-associated kininogen binding sites in vitro and in vivo. Our data point to a novel role of cell surface proteoglycans in the local accumulation of prohormones prior to the controlled release of short-lived peptide hormones at or in proximity to their target cells.DISCUSSIONUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms by which hormone systems finely tune the human body's homeostasis is a major goal of molecular endocrinology. One prototypic peptidergic effector system that has been studied in great detail is the kallikrein-kinin system (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past years, much effort has been put into the identification of cellular docking structures recruiting the kinin precursors from the plasma and assembling the critical components that trigger the release of kinins from kininogens in proximity to their target cells (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herwald H. Dedio J. Kellner R. Loos M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

The salient features of these binding sites are (i) affinity and specificity for kininogens, (ii) abundance, (iii) ubiquity, and (iv) availability on cell surfaces. Six candidate proteins have as yet been identified: the integrin Mac-1/αMβ2 (15Wachtfogel Y.T. De La Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Rick L. Miller M. Schultze R.L. Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. Colman R.W.

Med. 1999; 5: 555-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the candidates meets the full range of criteria defining kininogen acceptors. For instance, the urokinase receptor is present in a limited copy number per cell (<5% of the HK binding sites) and therefore does not fulfill the criterion of abundance (21Mandriota S.J. Seghezzi G. Vassalli J.D. Ferrara N. Wasi S. Mazzieri R. Mignatti P. Pepper M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9709-9716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); Mac-1, thrombospondin-1, and glycoprotein Ib are cell type-specific proteins (36Corbi A.L. Miller L.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which do not meet the criterion of ubiquity; and p33/gC1qR, a component of the mitochondrial matrix (31Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar, 38van den Berg R.H. Prins F. Faber-Krol M.C. Lynch N.J. Schwaeble W. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3909-3916PubMed Google Scholar), and cytokeratin-1, a typical cytoskeletal protein (39Wells M.J. Hatton M.W. Hewlett B. Podor T.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28574-28581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), are unlikely to comply with the criterion of cell surface availability under physiological conditions. Thus, high affinity binding to HK, a feature shared by all candidate proteins, does not necessarily indicate a biologically relevant interaction (31Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar, 38van den Berg R.H. Prins F. Faber-Krol M.C. Lynch N.J. Schwaeble W. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3909-3916PubMed Google Scholar). Given the heterogeneity of the candidate proteins, we felt that components of the cell surface other than proteins might operate in vivo as kininogen acceptors and that a systematic approach could help to determine the nature of the illusive kininogen binding sites. Here, we have used a combined strategy of enzymatic degradation, metabolic inhibition, and recombinant over-expression to identify heparan sulfate-type proteoglycans as the major HK binding sites on the surface of the endothelial cell line EA.hy926.The notion that HS-PG represent cellular docking structures for HK offers intuitive solutions to some of the conundrums associated with putative kininogen binding sites (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the repetitive nature of the HS chain structure of PG can easily account for the huge number of kininogen binding sites that have been reported, e.g. for endothelial cells (9Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 10van Iwaarden F. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4698-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hasan A.A. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus they meet the criterion of abundance. One may envisage that stacks of kininogen molecules are fixed to cell surfaces via the extended HS chains (40Henderson L.M. Figueroa C.D. Müller-Esterl W. Bhoola K.D. Blood. 1994; 84: 474-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the large variation in the number of kininogen binding sites per cell (9Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 10van Iwaarden F. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4698-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may well reflect gross differences in the GAG content of PG expressed by the various cell types (6Bernfield M. Götte M. Woo Park P. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar, 41Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S67-S75PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the apparent ubiquity of kininogen binding sites is easily explained by the fact that most cell surfaces are furnished with a layer of PG-anchored HS (6Bernfield M. Götte M. Woo Park P. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar, 42Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A notable exception to this rule are erythrocytes, which lack a HS shell, and are correspondingly poor binders of kininogens (9Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the association of kininogens with HS-PG may offer a simple mechanism for the local release of kinins close to their site of action (43Meloni F.J. Gustafson E.J. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cell surface HS-PG serve locally to accumulate intact kininogens in proximity to the kinin receptors. A wasteful release of kinins, for instance in the circulatory system, is thereby avoided (note that the molecular ratio of kinins versus kininogens is approximately 10−6 in human plasma). This notion is reminiscent of the well established role of PG as coreceptors for chemokines (3Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and growth factors (44Trusolino L. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1267-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), where they restrict the diffusion of active ligands by tethering them to flexible glycosaminoglycan chains (7Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). By contrast, kininogens are completely inactive on kinin receptors, and proteolytic processing is mandatory for triggering physiological effects.Although our results clearly identify HS-PG as the major cellular docking sites for kininogens, they do not refute the possibility that other PG, such as dermatan and chondroitin sulfate-type proteoglycans, may function as kininogen acceptors. In fact, our preliminary studies indicate that cell surface digestion with chondroitinase ABC or testicular hyaluronidase moderately reduces the kininogen binding capacity of EA.hy926 cells by 10–35%. 2T. Renné, J. Dedio, G. David, and W. Müller-Esterl, unpublished experiments. Thus, HS-PG are probably not the sole docking structures for kininogens, and other PG or even glycoproteins may contribute directly or indirectly. For instance, the binding sites of the reported HK binding proteins (15Wachtfogel Y.T. De La Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Rick L. Miller M. Schultze R.L. Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. Colman R.W. J. Biol.

Roberts T. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1060-1065PubMed Google Scholar), or the HK binding proteins could indirectly dock to cells via HS-type PG; we have not further explored these latter possibilities.We note limitations in our present study in two respects. First, we have focused on endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cells because the bulk of plasma-borne kininogen associates with endothelial cells (9Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 10van Iwaarden F. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4698-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary results indicate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells, known to be rich in HS-PG, utilize the same docking sites as EA.hy926 cells.2 Kininogen biosynthesis has also been reported for the kidney where kininogens associate with epithelial cells lining the renal tubulus system (50Song Q. Wang D.Z. Harley R.A. Chao L. Chao J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F919-F926PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, we find that HEK293t, a renal epithelium-derived cell line, uses HS-PG for kininogen sequestration. However, as most cells express HS-PG on their surfaces (6Bernfield M. Götte M. Woo Park P. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar, 42Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of HS-PG as kininogen docking sites may apply to many different cell types and represent not merely a peculiar phenomenon of engineered cells. Second, we have focused on the major type of human kininogen, i.e.H-kininogen, known to participate in the contact phase system that promotes kinin release on non-endothelial surfaces (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second type of human kininogen, LK, shares the entire heavy chain, including domain D3, with HK but lacks the unique light chain domain of D5H. Our preliminary studies indicate that LK also binds to HS-type GAG in vitro and therefore may use the same docking sitesin vivo. However, differences in the particular interaction mode must exist between the two kininogen types. Likewise, T-kininogen the major acute phase reactant of the rat, which is not present in man, may dock to various cells; we have not experimentally addressed this possibility.The fact that optimum binding of kininogen to GAG requires Zn2+ (this study) and depends on the pH of the medium2 points to a critical role of histidine residues in the protein-carbohydrate association. Recently, the involvement of histidine residues in the binding of histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) to heparin has been demonstrated (51Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Tight binding between HRG and heparin occurs only under acidic pH conditions (<6.5), and the association is markedly enhanced in the presence of transition metal ions such as Zn2+ and Cu2+. This finding may suggest the involvement of protonated histidine side chains (51Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,52Björk I. Olson S.T. Sheffer R.G. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HRG consists of two cystatin domains and a unique His-rich region and is thus classified as a member of the cystatin superfamily, as are the kininogens. As HRG is considered an evolutionary ancestor of the kininogens (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that HK may accommodate HS-type GAG and heparin in a similar fashion as HRG. This notion is supported by the finding that HK efficiently antagonizes the enhancing effects of heparin on thrombin-antithrombin III complex formation (52Björk I. Olson S.T. Sheffer R.G. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The high density of negatively charged groups in heparin and HS-type GAG could explain why the histidine-rich domain D5H is the major cell docking site of HK (13Hasan A.A. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Accordingly, other negatively charged carbohydrates such as dextran sulfates, shown to function as surrogates of the contact phase, provide an ideal in vitroplatform for assembly of the various components of the kinin-generating complex, including kininogens (8Thompson R.E. Mandle Jr., R. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 53Hojima Y. Cochrane C.G. Wiggins R.C. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Blood. 1984; 63: 1453-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, one may postulate that HS-PG represent the biological substratum on the surface of cardiovascular cells, which controls kininogen accumulation and processing (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological stimuli and molecular mechanisms driving kinin liberation on cellular surfaces are presently obscure (54Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Olsen A. Rhen M. Dahlbäck B. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), however, one reasonable candidate trigger is α-granule release from activated platelets, causing a burst of the local Zn2+concentration (55Gorodetsky R.

The intracellular domain of TF lacks homology to other classes of receptors and hence the signaling mechanism is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that factor VIIa (the natural ligand for TF) induces the activation of the Src family members c-Src, Lyn, and Yes, and subsequently phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), followed by stimulation of c-Akt/protein kinase B as well as the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. In turn Rac mediates p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas factor VIIa-induced p42/p44 MAP kinase stimulation required PI3K enzymatic activity but was not inhibited by dominant negative Rac proteins. We propose that this Src family member/PI3K/Rac-dependent signaling pathway is a major mediator of factor VIIa/TF effects in pathophysiology.

In addition, TF is critical for blood vessel development, and TF-deficient mice die as a consequence of abnormalities in this development (2Bugge T.H. Xiao Q. Kombrinck K.W. Flick M.J. Holmback K.

Finally TF appears to be important in tumor progression, although this effect may well be dependent on the angiogenic properties of TF (8Zhang Y. Deng Y. Luther T. Muller M. Ziegler R. Waldherr R.

The molecular mechanisms, however, by which TF/factor VII or TF/factor VIIa interactions exert these effects, remain poorly defined. A first clue as to these mechanisms was provided by Bazan (11Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that TF shows substantial homology with the interferon α/β and γ receptors, and this notion was confirmed by crystallographic studies on TF structure (12Harlos K. Martin D.M. O'Brien D.P. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Polikarpov I. Miller A. Tuddenham E.G. Boys C.W. Nature. 1994; 370: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. de Vos A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10864-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that factor VIIa/TF interaction exerts a variety of cellular changes, including Ca2+ signaling (14Rottingen J.A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Camerer E. Rottingen J.A. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2529-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) (17Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sorensen B.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and changes in gene expression (18Pendurthi U.R. Alok D. Rao L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12598-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hence TF may act as a cellular receptor for factor VII/VIIa, but the molecular details of the subsequent signal transduction as well as how these might relate to the TF action in pathophysiology remain unclear. A group of proteins possibly involved in TF action is the Rho family of small GTPases, which have an important function in directing cell motility and migration (19Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become clear that especially Rac is important for angiogenesis, calcium signaling, leukocyte migration, and the control of inflammation and oncogenesis, which are functions associated with TF signaling. Furthermore, a recent study by Timokhina et al. (20Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that c-Src may act as an upstream regulator of p21 ras, whereas c-Src is a general mediator of signaling of receptors devoid of intrinsic kinase activity like TF. We decided to study, therefore, the role of Rac and the Src-like tyrosine kinases in TF signaling. The results show that TF/factor VIIa interaction stimulates a signaling pathway involving the activation of Src-like family members c-Src, Lyn, and Yes, and subsequently PI3K leading to the stimulation of p42/p44 MAP kinase, c-Akt/PKB, and Rac. In turn, the latter GTPase provokes cytoskeletal reorganization and p38 MAP kinase activation. We propose, that this c-Src-, PI3K-, and p21 rac -dependent signaling pathway is a major mediator of TF effects in pathophysiology. p42/p44 MAP kinase, phosphospecific p42/p44 MAP kinase, Ser473-cAkt/PKB, and p38 MAP kinase antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs. Rac, Fyn, Lyn, Yes, Src, and immobilized SAM68 (Src-Associated inMitosis) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit, and goat-anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from ITK Diagnostics. Phalloidin-TRITC, “COMPLETE” protease inhibitor, forskolin, nordihydroguaretic acid (NDGA), purified factor X, human thrombin, and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma. Plasma-purified factor VIIa and the MEK-inhibitor PD98059 were purchased from Alexis. Recombinant factor VIIa was from Novo Nordisc. The Src-inhibitor PP1 was acquired from Biomol, and recombinant hirudin was obtained through Fluka. A14, Cos, Rat1, and 293 cell lines were cultured according to routine procedures. Expression of RacN17 in stably transfected Rat1 cells was inhibited with 1 μg of tetracycline/ml of medium (21Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. McCormick F.

Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI3K was performed by adding wortmannin to a final concentration of 100 nm (23Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MAP kinase was performed using forskolin in a final concentration of 2 μm (24Marx J. Science. 1993; 262: 988-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or PD98059 in a final concentration of 10 μm (25Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). Rho activation was inhibited by treatment of cells with 20 μm NDGA (21Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). NDGA, wortmannin, forskolin, and PD98059 were added 10 min prior to the experiment. The tyrosine kinases of the Src family were inhibited by adding PP1 to a final concentration of 20 μm 30 min prior to the experiment. Factor VIIa was added in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 10 min. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h. After appropriate incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h and stained with phalloidin-TRITC, diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (1:100) in PBS, supplemented with bovine serum albumin and Triton X-100 for 1 h. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted with glycerol-gelatin, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Rac activation experiments were performed as described by Sander et al. (26Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), with some modifications. A bacterially expressed fusion protein was used, consisting of an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase part and a C-terminal part containing an amino acid sequence matching the Rac-GTP-binding domain of PAK. Bacterial cultures were grown to anA 600 of 0.6 after centrifugation and lysed in PBS containing 100 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100 with freshly added COMPLETE, and fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-agarose. After appropriate stimulation, cell lysates were prepared by scraping in Fish buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 10% glycerol; 1% Nonidet P-40; 100 mm NaCl; 2 mm MgCl2). Per 300 μl of cell lysate, 100 μl of 50% slurry was added, and this was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were isolated and washed extensively and resuspended in 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 4% SDS; 2% β-mercaptoethanol; 20% glycerol, 1 mg of bromphenol blue). Rac and Cdc42 activation was assessed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting employing a Rac antibody and chemiluminescence. Serum-starved A14 cells, grown in 10-cm dishes, were incubated with factor VIIa for various times, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 0.5 ml of a non-denaturing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 50 mm NaCl; 50 mm NaF, 2 mm MgCl2; 1 mm CaCl2; 1% Triton X-100; 100 μm Na3VO4; 1.5 mg/ml COMPLETE). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, and ATP (200 μm) and SAM68 (2 μg/ml) were added. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, SAM68 was immunoprecipitated by incubating the samples with a Sepharose-conjugated polyclonal SAM68 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with PY20. The specificity of the assay for Src-like kinase enzymatic activity was demonstrated by the sensitivity of the assay to the Src-like kinase inhibitor PP1 (not shown). Activation of different Src family members was determined after stimulation for 7.5 min with factor VIIa. Subsequently, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of non-denaturing lysis buffer. After centrifugation, 0.25 ml of the lysate was precleared with 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with 1 μg of Src, Fyn, Lyn, or Yes antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated with 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 1 min at 6000 rpm. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm Na3VO4; 10 mmMgCl2). Subsequently, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 2 μg of SAM68 and 200 μm ATP. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, either in the presence or absence of PP1, and studied using 10% SDS-PAGE and probing with PY20. A14 cells were grown in 12 wells in inositol-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 1% inositol-free fetal calf serum, until 40% confluence. The cells were labeled for 2 days with 10 μCi of [3H]inositol. Subsequently, the cells were serum starved for 4 h and stimulated with factor VIIa. The cells were scraped in 1 ml of methanol at −20 °C, and lipids were extracted by adding 0.5 ml of HCl/H2O (1:50) and 1 ml of chloroform. The chloroform fraction was isolated and vaporized. The remainder was dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol/H2O (72:25:2) and spotted on TLC plates. The TLC plates were run in chloroform/methanol/water (90:70:20) containing 4.3 m NH4OH. A TLC scanner was used to determine the relative amounts of PIP, PIP2, and PIP3. For analysis of PKB, p38 MAP kinase, and p42/p44 MAP kinase activation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and appropriately stimulated, washed with ice-cold PBS, and scraped in 150 μl of 2× sample buffer. 50-μl samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed after immunoblotting, using phosphospecific antibodies. Equal loading was verified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Chemiluminescence was performed and detected as described earlier. Human thrombin or factor VIIa were diluted in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to 1 unit/ml or 10 μg/ml, respectively. The dilutions were either left untreated or preincubated with 4 units/ml hirudin for 10 min. The final volume was brought to 100 μl. 25 μl of chromogenic substrate (Chromogenix) was added, and the reaction was monitored for 5 min at 37 °C, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at A 405. Subsequently, the V max value was determined for all reactions. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the construct 10.3-hTF (kindly provided by Dr. H. ten Cate) containing full-length human tissue factor, using Fugene 6 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Transfections were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Both blood vessel formation and cell migration are regulated by TF and are typically associated with cytoskeletal alteration, and a recent study by Ott et al.(27Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) has shown that TF/factor VIIa interaction results in actin reorganization. To obtain more insight into the effects of TF, we made use of an A14 fibroblast system, because fibroblasts are well known for their constitutive expression of TF (e.g. see Ref. 28Fleck R.A. Rao L.V. Rapaport S.I. Varki N. Thromb. Res. 1990; 59: 421-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, we stimulated A14 cells with human factor VIIa for various time periods and investigated changes in the actin cytoskeleton. In agreement with the observations of Ott et al. (27Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we observed substantial actin stress fiber formation in response to factor VIIa. It is well established, however, that stimulus-induced stress fiber formation may mask other actin reorganization events, like ruffling, lamellipodia, and filopodia (29Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 30Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar), that are more related to cell migration than to stress fiber formation (31Ridley A.J. Allen W.E. Peppelenbosch M. Jones G.E. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 111-123PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we treated cells with NDGA, which impairs the stress fiber-inducing GTPase Rho (22Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Subsequent stimulation with factor VIIa, indeed, revealed the formation of filopodia (Fig. 1,C, E, G, I, K, and L) and both lamellipodia (Fig. 1, D,F, H, J, and K) and membrane ruffles (Fig. 1 L), structures associated with activation of Cdc42 and Rac, respectively. These observations indicate, therefore, that TF/factor VIIa signal transduction involves both Rac- and Cdc42-dependent signaling. We directly tested the effects of factor VIIa addition to fibroblasts on Cdc42 and Rac using the association of p65PAK to Rac and Cdc42. Because p65PAK binds only to the GTP-bound forms of these proteins, such binding represents activation of Rac and Cdc42 (32Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). This type of assay was used successfully to demonstrate Rap1 activation in human neutrophils (33M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Rac activation by Tiam (26Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We observed enhanced levels of activated Cdc42 and Rac in lysates of factor VIIa-stimulated cells. This response was comparable to the response induced by TNFα and insulin, well known activators of Cdc42 and Rac (29Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 34Min W. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3508-3518PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wojciak-Stothard B. Entwistle A. Garg R.

These experiments confirm, therefore, the activation of Rac and Cdc42 by factor VIIa in fibroblasts, as was inferred from the effects on cytoskeletal organization. We also tested the effect of various pharmacological inhibitors on Rac and Cdc42 activation. Importantly, both PP1 and wortmannin, specific inhibitors of Src-like kinases (37Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) and PI3K, respectively (23Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), abolished factor VIIa activation of Cdc42 and Rac (Fig. 2), suggesting that Src-like kinases and PI3K are required for the Cdc42 and Rac activation in response to factor VIIa. The observation that pharmacological inhibitors of Src-like kinases impair factor VIIa-dependent Cdc42 and Rac activation suggests that such kinases participate in TF/factor VIIa signal transduction. Therefore, we directly assessed enzymatic activity of these enzymes using the in vitrophosphorylation of the Src family substrate SAM68 (38Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 39Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) as a readout. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the SAM68-phosphorylating activity is enhanced in lysates obtained from factor VIIa-treated A14 cells, a maximal effect being reached after 7.5 min. These results demonstrate that an Src-like kinase is activated in response to factor VIIa. To assess the nature of the Src family member involved, several of these kinases were immunoprecipitated and subjected to a similar in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3 B, an antibody directed against the c-Src homologue Fyn did immunoprecipitate SAM68-phosphorylating enzymatic activity, but this activity was not enhanced in factor VIIa-treated cells. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of Yes revealed strongly enhanced kinase activity in factor VIIa-treated cells (Fig. 3 B), whereas also c-Src and Lyn showed some increased activity. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by its sensitivity to PP1 (Fig.3 B). We concluded that factor VIIa treatment of cells leads to activation of Yes and to a lesser extent c-Src and Lyn, whereas Fyn is not a target for factor VIIa-dependent signal transduction. Subsequently, we assayed the effects of factor VIIa on phosphoinositide formation. As shown in Fig.4, cellular PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 levels transiently increase after TF/factor VIIa interaction. The specificity of the latter response was demonstrated by its sensitivity to wortmannin (not shown). To confirm PI3K activity, we assessed c-Akt/PKB activation. The latter kinase is a well known downstream target for PI3K and, as shown in Fig.5, factor VIIa strongly enhances the Ser473 phosphorylation of c-Akt/PKB. This activation was sensitive to both the Src family inhibitor (PP1) and wortmannin, suggesting that Src-like kinases act upstream of PI3K in our experimental system. Together these data establish PI3K and c-Akt/PKB as mediators of TF/factor VIIa signaling, downstream of a Src-like kinase.Figure 5Stimulation of c-Akt/PKB by factor VIIa. A, after serum starvation, A14 cells were stimulated with human purified factor VIIa for the indicated times. B, cells were serum-starved (lane 1) and, prior to stimulation with factor VIIa (lane 2), were preincubated with either PP1 (lane 3) or wortmannin (lane 4). Cell lysates were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed using either a phosphospecific Ser473 c-Akt/PKB antibody or an antibody directed against total Akt/PKB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The notion, that an Src-like kinase- and PI3K-dependent signaling pathway mediates the factor VII-induced activation of Rac and further downstream signaling, was confirmed by experiments investigating the phosphorylation state of p38 MAP kinase. Rac is a well known activator of p38 MAP kinase (40Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 41Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) and, as depicted in Fig. 6 A, addition of factor VIIa to cells resulted in increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, comparable to that mediated by insulin, an activator of p38 MAP kinase in many cells (42Haussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. Vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 43Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This increase was sensitive to preincubation with either wortmannin or PP1. Furthermore, in cells expressing the dominant negative RacN17 (30Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar), factor VIIa did not activate p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 6 B), whereas in the Rat1 parental cell line, from which the RacN17 cell line is derived, factor VIIa-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation was readily detected. Another possible Rac target is JNK, and we also assessed possible activation of JNK in our system. However, as shown in Fig. 6 C, JNK is not a target of factor VIIa/TF-mediated signaling. We concluded that the Src/PI3K/Rac-signaling module mediates p38 MAP kinase activation but not JNK activation after exposure of cells to factor VIIa. Addition of factor VIIa to TF-transfected cells was earlier shown to result in activation of p42/42 MAP kinase (17Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sorensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). p42/p44 MAP kinase stimulation by several receptors lacking intrinsic enzymatic activity has been shown to involve Src family members in lymphoid cells (44Jiang A. Craxton A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), although such a role for c-Src family members in non-lymphoid cells remains poorly defined. Therefore, we decided to test whether stimulation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by factor VIIa involved a c-Src-like non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Addition of factor VIIa was capable of mediating a PP1-sensitive p42/p44 MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig.7). Also, wortmannin abolished the factor VIIa-induced p42/p44 MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A); hence, PI3K is required for this activation. Rac, however, is not essential for factor VIIa-induced p42/p44 MAP kinase activation, because in Rac N17-expressing cells stimulation of this kinase is readily observed (Fig. 7 C). We also tested the effect of forskolin treatment (which inhibits c-Raf (24 and references therein)) and PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of the MAP kinase kinase MEK (25Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar)). Both conditions resulted in abrogation of VIIa-dependent MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 7 B). Our data suggest, therefore, a triple function for the c-Src/PI3K signaling module factor VIIa in its effects on cellular physiology: activation of c-Raf and MEK, probably via Ras, to produce phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAP kinase, activation of c-Akt/PKB, and stimulation of Rac for producing cytoskeletal reorganization and p38 MAP kinase activation. To exclude the possibility that the observed activation of the signal transduction components was induced by contamination of our factor VIIa with other coagulation proteins, such as thrombin or factor Xa, we incubated A14 fibroblasts with human thrombin, factor Xa, or human recombinant factor VIIa. As demonstrated in Fig. 8, neither human thrombin (factor IIa) nor factor Xa mimicked plasma-purified factor VIIa p42/p44 MAP kinase activation and recombinant factor VIIa was as active in our assays as was purified factor VIIa. In addition, the effectors of the TF-induced c-Src/PI3K signaling module identified in this study (c-Akt/PKB, p38 MAP kinase, p42/p44 MAP kinase) were not affected by a 30-min preincubation with hirudin at concentrations (25 units/ml) that impaired thrombin-induced p42/p44 MAP stimulation (Fig. 9). Altogether, these data indicate that these signals were specific for factor VIIa/TF interaction and were not caused by interfering contaminants.Figure 9Factor VIIa-dependent p42/p44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and c-Akt/PKB phosphorylation are hirudin-insensitive. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with 25 units/ml hirudin after which cells were subjected to 10 μg/ml factor VIIa for 15 min (A). The subsequently prepared cell lysates were assayed for phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and PKB phosphorylation with phosphospecific antibodies on Western blot. Lane 1 represents the vehicle control, lanes 2 and 4 represent cells pretreated with hirudin, andlanes 3 and 4 represent factor VIIa-stimulated cells. B, to validate the potency of hirudin, cells were again pretreated with hirudin for 30 min and incubated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 5 min. The lysates were probed for phosphorylated MAP kinase with phosphospecific antibodies on Western blot.

The molecular details of the underlying signaling pathways, induced by TF/factor VIIa interaction, are still obscure. Because many of the cellular effects of TF involve cytoskeletal reorganization, we investigated the role of Cdc42 and Rac proteins, both important regulators of actin remodeling (29Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 30Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that addition of factor VIIa to fibroblasts resulted in formation of filopodia and both lamellipodia as well as membrane ruffles, structures that are thought to be highly indicative for Cdc42 and Rac activation, respectively. In agreement, direct activation of both GTPases in response to factor VIIa was observed using an assay relying on the specific interaction of p65PAK with Rac and Cdc42. Interestingly, activation of these GTPases was sensitive to inhibition of Src-like kinases and PI3K, and we investigated the role of these signaling elements in factor VIIa action. We observed activation of the Src-like kinases Yes, Lyn, and c-Src, and we observed stimulation of PI3K. Interestingly, the latter response was sensitive to PP1 and thus Src-like kinases appear to act upstream of PI3K. This suggests that the recently described (c-Kit receptor-induced) signaling pathway involving the sequential activation of c-Src and PI3K leading to the activation of Rac (20Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) also mediates factor VIIa stimulation of the Rac GTPase and that this pathway is also capable of activating Cdc42. A role for PI3K upstream of Rac and Cdc42 is in agreement with the insight that this enzyme is a principal regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (45Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) via the activation of Rac-like proteins (46Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Cooke F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). We hypothesize, therefore, that the effects of factor VIIa on angiogenesis and monocyte migration involve a factor VIIa-dependent stimulation of Rac and Cdc42 and subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization. Furthermore, because Rac and Cdc42 are involved in tumorigenesis (22Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 48Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G.

Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Rac and Cdc42 activation by factor VIIa may be implicated in tumorigenic effects associated with TF. The connection between TF signal transduction and the small GTPases of the Rho family may mediate important aspects of TF action in pathophysiology. Next to cytoskeletal rearrangements, Rac is implicated in the activation of p38 MAP kinase (40Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 41Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). We found enhanced p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation upon factor VIIa stimulation, which was sensitive to RacN17. Hence Rac-mediated p38 MAP kinase functions as an effector for factor VIIa, possibly by linking TF action to inflammation. TF-mediated activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase was first reported by Poulsen et al. (17Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sorensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), using TF-transfected baby hamster kidney cells, a cell type that normally does not express TF. This MAP kinase activation was dependent on MEK and factor VIIa protease activity. In accordance, MAP kinase activation observed in A14 cells was also dependent on MEK activity, whereas the sensitivity of this response forskolin also indicates that c-Raf is involved in MAP kinase stimulation. We observed that PI3K and Src mediated this MAP kinase activation. In addition, the Src-like kinase/PI3K signaling module is responsible for c-Akt/PKB phosphorylation. c-Akt/PKB is a well known downstream target of PI3K (51Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar), and its activation thus further confirms PI3K activation by factor VIIa. Because the Src-like kinase/PI3K signaling module seems essential for stimulation of p42/p44 MAP kinase, the GTPases Rac and Cdc42, and c-Akt/PKB, we propose that this signaling module fulfills a key function in factor VIIa signal transduction. The nature of the Src-like kinase mediating PI3K activation remains obscure. We observed factor VIIa-dependent increased enzymatic activity of Lyn, c-Src, and in particular Yes, whereas Fyn was clearly not activated by factor VIIa. However, Yes, c-Src, and Lyn were all sensitive to PP1 in vitro, and this inhibitor may therefore inhibit activation of these kinases in vivo (although inhibition of Yes by PP1 in vivo has not been reported). Therefore, it remains unclear whether only one or possibly more of these kinases are responsible for the activation of the PI3K/Rac/p38 MAP kinase and the PI3K/p42/p44 MAP kinase modules. Moreover, roles for c-Src, Lyn, and Yes upstream of PI3K have all been reported (52Ibitayo A.I. Tsunoda Y. Nozu F. Owyang C. Bitar K.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G705-G711PubMed Google Scholar, 53Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar, 54Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L.

Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 407-411PubMed Google Scholar), and the nature of the Src-like kinase upstream of PI3K awaits, therefore, further experimentation. Both p42/p44 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase show an initial decrease in phosphorylation during the first 5 min of stimulation with factor VIIa, before an increase in phosphorylation occurs after 10 min. We do not currently know which signal transduction components are responsible for this effect, but it is tempting to speculate that a TF/factor VIIa-activated phosphatase is responsible for this effect. As activation of tyrosine phosphatases is well known to be essential for activation of c-Src-like kinases (58den Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), stimulation of such phosphatases is not entirely unexpected. It would be interesting to determine the identity and the involvement of such phosphatases, and experiments addressing this issue are currently being performed in our laboratory. Recently, Sørensen et al. (59Sørensen B.B. Freskgard P. Nielsen L.S. Rao L.V. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggested the involvement of an additional transmembrane protein, involved in factor VIIa/TF-dependent signaling. Factor VIIa uses TF as a docking site rather than as a receptor, and subsequently, it proteolytically cleaves an as yet unknown protease-activated receptor (PAR). So far, only four PARs have been identified (PAR-1 through PAR-4), and three of them, PAR-1, -3, and -4, are activated by thrombin. This might explain the similarities found between thrombin- and factor VIIa/TF-dependent signaling. We thank Drs. J. Collard and S. van Delft for kindly providing the glutathione S-transferase-PAK construct. Furthermore, we would like to thank Dr. P. H. Reitsma and R. Doornbos for their helpful suggestions."

Transient expression of ARF-1(T31N), a GDP-restrictive mutant, significantly inhibited apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) VLDL production without influencing the biosynthesis of apoB-100 low density lipoproteins or total apoB production (indicating that it inhibited the second step of VLDL assembly) and without altering total protein production or biosynthesis of transferrin, phosphatidylcholine, or triglycerides. These effects were confirmed in stable inducible transfectants. In contrast, expression of an ARF-1 mutant lacking the N-terminal 17 amino acids, which has no myristoylation site and cannot interact with the microsomal membrane, did not affect VLDL assembly. Thus, active ARF-1 is needed for the second step of the process. To further explore these observations, we developed a cell-free system based on the postnuclear supernatant isolated from McA-RH7777 cells. In this system, 10–15% of the apoB-100 pool was converted to VLDL in a time- and temperature-dependent way. The assembly process was highly dependent on a heat-stable factor in the d > 1.21 g/ml infranatant of fetal calf serum; this factor was not present in low density lipoproteins or VLDL. Brefeldin A inhibited VLDL assembly in this system, as did a synthetic peptide (corresponding to N-terminal amino acids 2–17 of ARF-1) that displaces ARF-1 from the membrane. Thus, active ARF-1 is also needed for cell-free assembly of VLDL. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate also inhibited VLDL assembly in this system, indicating that the process requires ongoing hydrolysis of GTP. 1-Butanol, which inhibits the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) and instead gives rise to phosphatidylbutanol, inhibited VLDL assembly, whereas 2-butanol, which does not inhibit PA formation, failed to do so. Thus, phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed formation of PA from phosphatidylcholine is essential for VLDL assembly. In support of this conclusion, exogenous PLD prevented brefeldin A from inhibiting the assembly process.

Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy studies indicate that the core lipids occur as apoB-free “droplets” in the lumen of the secretory pathway (1Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and that the second step involves the fusion of these droplets with the VLDL precursor (for a review, see Ref. 3Olofsson S.-O. Asp L. Borén J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). How these lipid droplets are formed is unknown, but microsomal triglyceride transfer protein appears to be involved (8Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B.

Best known for inhibiting intracellular transport, BFA blocks a guanine nucleotide exchange (GDP for GTP) on ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF-1) (9Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D.

This exchange is important for activation of ARF-1 and for interactions between ARF-1 and other proteins. We hypothesized that ARF-1 has a central role in VLDL assembly. To test this hypothesis, we expressed ARF-1 mutants in McA-RH7777 cells and assessed the effects on VLDL assembly. ARF-1(T31N), a GDP-restrictive mutant, inhibited VLDL assembly in McA-RH7777 cells. To elucidate the pathway between ARF-1 and the VLDL assembly, we developed a cell-free system that can assemble VLDL from full-length apoB-100. VLDL assembly in this system also required active ARF-1. Moreover, the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) and the subsequent production of phosphatidic acid (PA) appeared to be essential for the assembly process.

The final volume of the incubation mixture was 1 ml. After incubation (time and temperature as indicated), the mixture was subjected to deoxycholate/carbonate extraction as described above. VLDL were isolated from the extract by gradient ultracentrifugation. The sample (5 ml) was adjusted to a sucrose concentration of 11%, layered over a 2-ml cushion of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 49% sucrose, and overlaid with 5.5 ml of PBS. The following protease inhibitors were used (final concentrations): leupeptin (0.1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin A (1 mm), N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (5 mm), aprotinin (100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml), and EDTA (0.5 mm). The mixture was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 44,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti 50 rotor for 20 h at 12 °C. The gradient was collected in 1-ml fractions, and apoB-100 was recovered from each fraction by immunoprecipitation. Precipitates from all fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography (14Wettesten M. Boström K. Bondjers G. Jarfeldt M. Norfeldt P.-I. Carrella M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ApoB-100 was present in three well separated fractions: the upper 3 ml of the gradient (d < 1.006 g/ml, corresponding to VLDL), the middle of the gradient (d = 1.006–1.06 g/ml), and the bottom of the gradient (d = 1.06–1.21 g/ml). This distribution of apoB-100 agrees well with our previous results for intact cells (2Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recovery of VLDL with the modified procedure was slightly higher (110 ± 14%; mean ± S.D., n = 4) than that obtained with the original procedure (2Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). McA-RH7777 cells were grown to 80% confluency in 56-cm2 dishes and labeled for 12 h with [3H]myristic acid (25 mCi/ml). After labeling, the cells had reached confluency and were preincubated with oleic acid and BFA as described above. The PNS was isolated and incubated in the basic cell-free system as described above for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1-butanol or 2-butanol. The lipids were extracted (15Olegård R. Svennerholm L. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1970; 59: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the radiolabeled lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography with ethyl acetate/trimethylpentane/acetic acid (9:5:2) as the solvent (16Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Bands corresponding to phosphatidylbutanol were scraped into scintillation vials, 1 ml of cyclohexane was added, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described (17Andersson M. Wettesten M. Borén J. Magnusson A. Sjöberg A. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. The protein concentration was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce). The PNS was fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation in a Beckman vertical rotor as described (18Borén J. Wettesten M.

To explore the role of ARF-1 in VLDL assembly, we studied McA-RH7777 cells transiently expressing GFP ligated to wild-type ARF; ARF-1(T31N), a GDP-restrictive mutant (19Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); or ARF-1(ΔNwt) (20Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a mutant that cannot interact with the microsomal membrane because it lacks the N-terminal 17 amino acids and therefore has no myristoylation site (21Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 22Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence showed that ∼50% of the cells were transfected. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against ARF demonstrated that wild-type ARF-1 and the two mutants were expressed at similar levels (Fig.1 A), which were severalfold higher than endogenous ARF expression levels (not shown). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min and chased for 15 min, and the amount of radioactivity (cellular and secreted) in total apoB-100, in apoB-100 of the VLDL and LDL density fractions, and in transferrin was measured. Expression of ARF-1(T31N) significantly decreased apoB-100 radioactivity in the VLDL fraction compared with wild-type ARF-1, whereas expression of ARF-1(ΔN wt) had no effect (Fig. 1 B). Neither mutant decreased apoB-100 radioactivity in the LDL fraction, and the total amount of radioactivity in apoB-100 and transferrin was the same in cells expressing mutant ARF-1 as in those expressing wild-type ARF-1 (Fig. 1 B). ARF-1(T31N) also inhibited protein secretion, as judged from the decrease in the accumulation of radioactive transferrin in the medium (58.3 ± 17.7% of that obtained with wild-type ARF-1;n = 3), while ARF-1(ΔN wt) did not (97.0 ± 17.0% of wild-type, n = 6). There were no significant differences in the incorporation of radioactivity into total proteins in cells expressing wild-type, T31N, and ΔN wt ARF-1 (not shown). To determine if transfection affected lipid biosynthesis, we pulse-labeled the cells with [3H]glycerol for 120 min and measured the incorporation of radioactivity into triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine. The biosynthesis rates were the same in cells transfected with wild-type, T31N, and ΔN wt ARF-1 (not shown). Thus, ARF-1(T31N) inhibited the formation of bona fide VLDL without affecting the lipidation of apoB-100, the expression of apoB-100 or transferrin, or the total biosynthesis of proteins and lipids in the cell. In the next series of experiments, stable inducible ARF-1(T31N) expression was used, allowing uninduced cells to serve as controls and thereby avoiding cloning artifacts associated with the noninducible stable transfectants. Induction of ARF-1(T31N) expression was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies to the Myc tag (Fig.2 A) and decreased by ∼80% the amount of radioactive apoB-100 VLDL recovered after a 15-min pulse and a 15-min chase (Fig. 2, B and C). Total apoB-100, apoB-100 LDL, and transferrin incorporated similar amounts of radioactivity (Fig. 2 C). The difference in the effect of ARF-1(T31N) on the incorporation of apoB-100 into LDL and VLDL is also illustrated by the ratio of apoB radioactivity in the LDL density region to that in the VLDL density region (after a 15-min pulse and a 15-min chase) (1.09 ± 0.13 and 4.30 ± 0.83 in uninduced and induced cells, respectively; mean ± S.D., n = 4). These results confirm that expression of ARF-1(T31N) inhibits VLDL assembly without giving rise to a general inhibition of the lipidation of apoB-100. The incorporation of radioactivity into total apoB-100 after induction was in the range of that seen for apoB-100 LDL (Fig. 2 C) and transferrin. The recovery of similar amounts of transferrin and total apoB-100 suggests that the loss of total apoB-100 reflect a general influence of the ARF-1 mutant on the secretory pathway. However, part of the decrease in total apoB-100 can be explained by the loss of VLDL. We calculated that the decrease in VLDL apoB-100 seen after the induction of ARF-1(T31N) corresponded to 21.6 ± 12.3% (mean ± S.D., n = 4) of total apoB-100 radioactivity in the uninduced control. The induction of wild type ARF-1 (Fig. 2 D) did not decrease the expression of apoB-100 in the VLDL density fraction, nor did it affect the expression of total apoB-100, apoB-100 in the LDL density fraction, or transferrin. To further address the role of ARF-1 in VLDL assembly, we constructed a cell-free system that carries out the second step of the process. McA-RH7777 cells were incubated with 360 μm oleic acid for 105 min; BFA was added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min. The cells were then pulsed for 30 min with l-[35S]methionine andl-[35S]cysteine in the presence of BFA and oleic acid and chased for 30 min (in the presence of BFA and oleic acid). The PNS obtained after this treatment had a relatively small amount of labeled VLDL; most of the labeled apoB-100 was in denser, high density lipoprotein-like particles. These observations agree with our previous results (4Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The standard cell-free system consisted of this PNS supplemented with 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm methionine, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 units/ml creatine kinase, 3 mg/ml FCS, and 360 μm oleic acid. As shown by the increase in the radioactivity of apoB-100 VLDL during the incubation, 10–15% of the total apoB-100 pool was converted into VLDL in a time-dependent (Fig. 3) and temperature-dependent fashion; during a 30-min incubation, four times more apoB-100 VLDL was formed at 37 °C than on ice (not shown). To determine the density range in which the assembly-competent organelles banded, we subjected the PNS to gradient ultracentrifugation (18Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Thorlin T. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10556-10564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five fractions were recovered from the bottom of the tube. Each fraction was incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) with 100 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmmethionine, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 unit/ml of creatine kinase, 3 mg/ml FCS, and 360 μm oleic acid. Since the subcellular fractions were depleted of cytosol during the centrifugation, 2 mg/ml cytosol was added during this experiment. The distribution of the VLDL assembly activity over the gradient (the total assembly activity in each fraction; mean of two experiments) was 16% in fraction 1, 47% in fraction 2, 28% in fraction 3, 3% in fraction 4, and 0% in fraction 5. Thus, VLDL assembly occurred predominantly in fractions 2 (d = 1.183 g/ml) and 3 (d = 1.149 mg/ml). We previously observed that FCS stimulates VLDL assembly in intact (2Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and permeabilized cells. 2K. Lindberg, C. Claesson, L. Asp, J. Borén, and S.-O. Olofsson, unpublished data. Therefore, we assessed the effects of FCS on VLDL assembly in the cell-free system. Virtually no VLDL were formed in the absence of FCS, indicating that FCS strongly stimulated VLDL production; heating the serum to 95 °C significantly increased VLDL production (Fig.4). The active factor was present in thed > 1.21 g/ml infranatant; neither thed < 1.063 nor the d < 1.006 supernatant stimulated the incorporation of radioactive apoB-100 into VLDL. These observations exclude the possibility that radiolabeled apoB-100 in the microsomes associated with “premade” lipoproteins in the FCS and therefore might appear in the VLDL density range. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (3 mg/ml) failed to stimulate VLDL assembly (data not shown), suggesting that the stimulation is not simply explained by the addition of proteins to the system. These findings suggest that FCS contains a factor that specifically stimulates VLDL assembly. Next, we tested whether ARF-1 is important for VLDL assembly in the cell-free system. First, we investigated the effect of BFA. BFA inhibited the incorporation of radioactive apoB-100 into the VLDL fraction in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.5 A). We also investigated the effects of a synthetic peptide corresponding to N-terminal amino acids 2–17 of ARF-1, which inactivates ARF-1 by displacing it from the membrane. Compared with a “scrambled” peptide containing the same amino acids, the synthetic ARF-1 peptide significantly, and in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited VLDL assembly (Fig. 5,B and C). These results show that ARF-1 is important for the assembly of VLDL in the cell-free system as it was in intact cells. To investigate the role of GTP hydrolysis in the assembly process, we replaced GTP in the basic cell-free system with the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogue GTPγS. At low levels, GTPγS had no inhibiting effect. At concentrations of 100 μm and higher, however, it significantly decreased VLDL assembly (Fig.6). Adding GTP overcame this inhibition (data not shown). These results indicate that the assembly of VLDL is dependent on ongoing hydrolysis of GTP. Failure to detect inhibition at low levels of GTPγS can be explained by the presence of endogenous GTP in the PNS. ARF-1 is important for the activation of PLD (23Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although there is diversity in the promoter structures of pol III-transcribed genes, three classes are responsible for the synthesis of most cellular pol III transcripts, tRNAs, 5 S rRNA, and U6 small nuclear RNA (2Baserga S.J. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 359-381Google Scholar). Each of these represent a gene class that utilizes a characteristic promoter structure and specific set of TFs (3Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 107-126Google Scholar). 5 S rRNA genes comprise class I and contain a principal internal promoter that is recognized by TFIIIA. Class 3 genes utilize upstream TATA elements and in metazoans an upstream element recognized by a distinct multisubunit TF (4Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar). Class 2 genes are represented by tRNA genes, which use an internal promoter comprised of proximal box A and distal box B elements. Distinct subunits of TFIIIC bind to the A box, B box, and terminator element of the class 2 genes and facilitate the assembly of this class of preinitiation complexes (3Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C.

For each gene class, TFIIIB (or related activity) binds just upstream of the start site of transcription, and this in turn serves as the initiation factor proper as it recruits pol III (Refs. 6Kassavetis G.A.

By this approach, a clear difference between S. cerevisiae and human pol III termination signal recognition was demonstrated with S. pombe pol III termination at an intermediate dT(n) length. Another difference supported the idea that S. pombe pol III termination may be mechanistically more similar to human than is S. cerevisiae. Finally, we examined transcription in the presence of α-amanitin, a small toxin that is known to inhibit certain eukaryotic RNA polymerases. This revealed a correlation between the response to a minimal dT(n) signal and sensitivity to α-amanitin by these pols III on the same template and further distinguished the enzymes. A PstI-EcoRI fragment containing thesup3-e gene (35Hottinger H. Pearson D. Yamao F. Gamulin V. Cooley L. Cooper T. Soll D. Mol. Gen.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) and used for polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, and a 0.4-kilobase pair fragment was cloned into the PstI and SacI sites of plasmid pJK148 (37Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence following the mature tRNAUGASer 3′-end in the monomeric tRNAUGASer genes is GAGATCTT(n). The cRT sequence, GAGCTCGGCCAAAAAGGCCGGGCTCGGAAAGGAGGTCTCCGTCACCAGCAGGATTTGAACCAATCAAGACTAGAATACAGGATTGAAGTCTAACTTTTTTTTAGCT, immediately follows the test terminator. Three substitutions were made in tRNAUGASerM as follows: C40T, T46.3C and C47.6T, numbered according to Ref. 31Kohli J. Munz P. Soll D. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 75-96Crossref Google Scholar. One substitution resides in the anticodon stem and one in the variable arm stem, each converting a G:C to a G:U base pair, whereas the third resides in the loop of the extra arm (31Kohli J. Munz P. Soll D. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 75-96Crossref Google Scholar). In the DNA, these substitutions reside between the A and B box promoter elements, in a region that is highly variable, that does not affect the transcription of other tRNA genes (38Hofstetter H. Kressman A. Birnstiel M.L. Cell. 1981; 24: 573-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 39Jaozeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P.

The resulting plasmids of the series, tRNAUGASerM-2T (designated pMSer-2T), tRNAUGASerWT-2T (designated pSer-2T), -3T, -4T, etc. were linearized with NdeI and used to transform yAS50, h(-S), leu1-32, ura4,ade6-704, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) as strain SP1190 (41Connolly T. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After selection for leucine prototrophy, cells were grown in YES. RNA was extracted with guanidinium thiocyanate and acid phenol:chloroform, EtoH-precipitated, electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide-urea, blotted, and probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNAs (42Maraia R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5695-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The tRNAUGASerM probe, 5′-TGCGCGGACAGAGCCCATTAAAT-3′, “MSer-UGA,” is complementary to bases A38-A51 of tRNAUGASerM, present in precursors and mature species. The probe, “5′-mSer,” 5′-CCACTCGGACATAGTGACTTTAGC-3′, is directed to the common 5′-region of mature tRNAsSer (31Kohli J. Munz P. Soll D. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F.

RNA. 1997; 3: 1434-1443PubMed Google Scholar). S. pombe (yAS50) and S. cerevisiae (CG-1945,CLONTECH) extracts used for in vitrotranscription were prepared according to Nichols et al.(45Nichols M. Willis I. Soll D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with the following modifications for S. pombe. After breaking cells with glass beads, the lysate was made 0.6 m NaCl by the slow addition of 5 m NaCl. The extraction buffer contained antipain dihydrochloride (2.5 μg/ml), bestatin (0.35 μg/ml), chymostatin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.4 μg/ml), and Pefabloc SC (0.1 mg/ml), all obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HeLa nuclear extract was prepared by a standard method (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions (25 μl) contained 60 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 0.6 mm CTP, ATP, UTP, 0.05 mm GTP, 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (ICN, Costa Mesa), and 0.5 μl of RNasin (Promega). α-Amanitin was from Sigma. Quantitation was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To investigate the cis elements required for termination, we deleted the tRNAiMet sequence of sup3-eand introduced test terminators consisting of varying lengths of dT residues, T(n), in place of the cryptic inefficient terminator (Fig. 1). Preliminary data suggested that constructs bearing inefficient terminators nonetheless produced functional tRNA, presumably because readthrough transcripts were correctly processed at their 3′-ends (47Adeniyi-Jones S. Romeo P.H. Zasloff M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 48Vnencak-Jones C.L. Wahab S.Z. Zehner Z.E. Holmes W.M. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10817-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (not shown). tRNA structure appears to be a major determinant of recognition by 3′-processing enzymes (50Castano J.G. Tobian J.A. Zasloff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and although certain artificial sequences placed downstream of an inefficient terminator can interfere with 3′-processing, others support processing (47Adeniyi-Jones S. Romeo P.H. Zasloff M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 49Furter R. Snaith M. Gillespie D.E. Hall B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10817-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To ensure that tRNA expression would be dependent on accurate termination, we inserted a sequence downstream of the test terminator to interfere with tRNA formation if pol III was to read through the test terminator. This sequence is referred to as the complementary readthrough (cRT) region and can base pair with the 3′-half of the tRNAUGASer precursor to form an extended duplex that is not recognizable as a tRNA precursor (not shown). These changes do not alter the tRNAUGASersequence or the residues immediately surrounding the 3′-processing site. Upon accurate termination at the T1 test terminator, this gene, designated tRNAUGASerWT, would be expected to produce a nascent precursor of 112 nucleotides (Fig.1). To distinguish tRNAUGASer from its predecessor tRNAUCASer and other tRNAsSer, we introduced three “silent” substitutions (31Kohli J. Munz P. Soll D. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 75-96Crossref Google Scholar) to allow specific detection by Northern blotting. The resulting gene was designated tRNAUGASerM (Fig.1). These substitutions reside between the intron and box B, in a region of tRNA genes that is highly variable, such that they would not be expected to, nor do they, affect transcription (Refs. 31Kohli J. Munz P. Soll D. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 75-96Crossref Google Scholar and 38Hofstetter H. Kressman A. Birnstiel M.L.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 40Murphy M.H. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7695-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholarand data not shown). S. pombe cells carrying the ade6-704 allele accumulate red pigment in limiting adenine but grow as white colonies whenade6-704 is efficiently suppressed by tRNAUGASer (31Kohli J. Munz P. Soll D. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 75-96Crossref Google Scholar). An ade6-704,leu1-32 strain, yAS50, was transformed with tRNAUGASerWT constructs harboring various test terminators in a vector that undergoes homologous integration at the leu1 + locus (37Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies were selected for leucine prototrophy, and the percentage of suppressed colonies was scored. No suppression was observed in cells transformed with the tRNAUGASerWT gene harboring 2 Ts in its terminator (Fig.2 A). This suggested that readthrough transcription beyond the 2T test terminator did not lead to suppression. The tRNAUGASerWT gene bearing a 3T test terminator reproducibly resulted in a significant number of partially suppressed and fewer fully suppressed colonies (Fig. 2 A). The 4T terminator supported more suppression than the 3T terminator but significantly less than 5T or longer T tracts. Suppressor activity from the 5T, 6T, and 7T terminators yielded comparable, near-saturating amounts of suppression. Leucine prototrophs that have lost tRNAUGASerWT upon homologous recombination at the leu1 + locus, as monitored by polymerase chain reaction, typically account for 10–15% of the colonies that yield no suppression in this assay (not shown). Multiple integrated copies can also contribute to color heterogeneity (not shown (37Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Notwithstanding these limitations, since the only variable in the experimental design is the length of the dT tract of the test terminator, the data indicated that a significant and functional increase in termination occurred between 3 Ts and 4 Ts (Fig.2 A). At dT tracts of 5 Ts or longer, suppressor activity appeared saturated. From this we conclude that highly efficient termination appeared to occur at 5 Ts. As noted above, tRNAUGASerM transcripts can be followed in vivo, whereas tRNAUGASerWT are not distinguishable by Northern blotting (not shown). The ability to follow an in vivo phenotype and RNA expression from the same gene prompted us to focus on tRNAUGASerM for the remainder of this study. Suppression was not detected unless the tRNAUGASerM test terminator harbored at least 5 Ts (Fig. 2 B). This gene yielded limited suppressor activity even with an 8T terminator, which, as will be shown below, directs highly efficient termination. Although a minimum of 5 Ts produced efficient suppression, longer T tracts led to only a moderate increase in suppression. These data suggested that the limited activity of the tRNAUGASerM gene was not due to limited termination efficiency and that a large increase in termination occurred between 4T and 5T terminators, with only moderate increases at longer dT tracts. Northern blot analysis of RNAs from cells expressing tRNAUGASerM constructs is shown in Fig. 3 A. Background signal in lanes U and C revealed limited cross-reactivity of our probe with endogenous tRNA species (Fig.3 A). Constructs with 2–4 Ts produced low levels of mature tRNAUGASerM, consistent with their unsuppressed phenotypes, in addition to longer transcripts (indicated as RT, Fig. 3 A). A probe specific for cRT confirmed that the long transcripts represented readthrough beyond the test terminator (not shown; the multiple bands may reflect various conformers of the self-complementary RNA). Constructs with 5 or more Ts produced mostly mature tRNAUGASerM with relatively little RT, consistent with their suppressed phenotype. The size and reactivity with oligonucleotide probes directed to the intron, 5′-leader, and 3′-trailer of the nascent transcript that would be expected from the tRNAUGASerM gene indicated that the band designated by “← Term” (Fig.3 A) corresponds to a unprocessed pre-tRNA whose synthesis was terminated at the test terminator, whereas the bands between this and the mature tRNA are processing intermediates (52Intine, R. V. A., Sakulich, A. L., Koduru, S. B., Huang, Y., Pierstorrf, E., Goodier, J. L., Phan, L., and Maraia, R. J. (2000) Mol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Quantitation revealed that the amount of mature tRNA in the 4T sample was significantly higher than in the 3T, 2T, and control samples, although this nonetheless represented low termination efficiency (not shown). The relatively high ratio of mature tRNA to RT from constructs with 5 or more Ts indicated high termination efficiency (Fig. 3 A). A control probe that detects tRNACUULys(Fig. 3 C) indicated that the difference in tRNAUGASerM levels in the suppressed and unsuppressed cells was significant. We also examined the steady state levels of tRNAsSer that are related to tRNAUGASerM. Fig.3 B shows the blot in Fig. 3 A after stripping and rehybridization with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to an invariant region of three tRNASer sequences as well as tRNAUGASerM using the same conditions for both hybridizations. Quantitation revealed that tRNAUGASerM contributed to the level of total tRNAsSer by ∼50% in these cells and therefore that it accumulated to a level similar to or greater than the tRNAsSer expressed from individual endogenous genes. This indicated that the limited activity of tRNAUGASerM is not due to a deficiency in accumulation but is instead more consistent with a decrease in the specific activity of the mature tRNAUGASerM as a suppressor. The presence of a band representing termination at the test terminator (←Term) was detectable from constructs containing 3 or more dTs but less clear in 2T samples as illustrated in Fig. 3 D. This provided evidence that a small amount of termination indeed occurs at a 3T terminator but not a 2T terminator. We conclude that highly efficient termination occurs at 5 Ts in S. pombe and that tRNAUGASerM is a reporter of pol III termination in vivo only if termination is highly efficient and accurate. After several failed attempts to develop extracts ofS. pombe cells that were active for tRNA transcription using buffers containing 0.15–0.4 m salts, we determined that activity could be obtained by increasing the concentration of salt present during the extraction. 0.6 m NaCl yielded extracts that were active for tRNA transcription. The following criteria indicated that the transcripts were synthesized de novo by pol III as follows: (i) synthesis required the presence of all four NTPs (not shown); (ii) transcript size varied expectedly, depending on the length of the dT tract (below); (iii) transcript production was decreased by tagetitoxin, an inhibitor of pol III (data not shown), and α-amanitin at an intermediate concentration (below). Transcription efficiency was monitored at varying concentrations of KCl and MgCl2 and was found to be optimal at 60 and 10 mm, respectively (not shown), similar to other in vitro pol III systems, including the ones used below. To compare termination on the same template and therefore control for sequence context, transcription complexes were assembled on tRNAUGASerM gene constructs using human,S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe cell extracts as the source of TFs and pol III. We examined tRNAUGASerM genes that differed in the T1 test terminator, the dT tract length of which is indicated by thenumbers above the lanes in Fig.4. In this assay, promoter-initiated transcripts that are not terminated at T1 are extended to the default terminator, T2 (see Fig. 1). Human pol III terminated at 4 Ts with a low but significant amount of transcription to T2 (Fig. 4 A).S. pombe pol III terminated at 5 Ts with a low but significant amount of the T2 transcript produced (Fig. 4 B).S. cerevisiae pol III terminated at 5 Ts but with significantly lower efficiency than S. pombe at 5 Ts (Fig.4, C and D). The bands in the T1 region of the gel are the size expected for termination at the test terminator, T1. Note that the multiple species in the T1 region in Fig. 4 B(and Fig. 4 C) increase as T2 transcripts decrease, suggesting that they are dependent on termination at T1, similar to what was observed in vivo (Fig. 3). Although we have not mapped the ends of these template-dependent species (lanes 5–8, Fig. 4 B), they correspond to the nascent transcript and the processing intermediates identified on Northern blots (Fig. 3 A). This suggested that this extract is competent for pre-tRNA processing as are S. cerevisiaeextracts (45Nichols M. Willis I. Soll D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The lack of intermediates in the HeLa system (Fig.4 A) probably reflects the inhibitory effect of the human La protein on pre-tRNA processing (see Fig. 1C in Ref. 53Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J. Engelke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the T1 and T2 bands was performed and termination efficiency (T e) was calculated according to the formula T e = (T1/T1 + T2) × 100. This revealed that termination by S. cerevisiae pol III was lower at 6 Ts than was S. pombe at 5 Ts (Fig. 4 D). Human andS. pombe pols III terminated with >95% efficiency at 6 Ts, whereas this degree of efficiency was not attained by S. cerevisiae pol III until it encountered 8 Ts (Fig.4 D). We conclude that human pol III is the most sensitive to termination at a minimal dT(n) tract length, whereasS. cerevisiae was the least sensitive, and S. pombe was intermediate. Another distinguishing feature of the termination pattern was reproducibly apparent in these experiments. Although human and S. pombe pol III require 4 and 5 Ts, respectively, for efficient termination, both exhibit a relatively distinct transition thereafter, as revealed by a sharp decline in T2 transcripts at the subsequent longer dT tracts (Fig. 4, A and B). The decline is not as sharp for S. cerevisiae pol III, as the intensity of T2 transcripts instead taper off more gradually (Fig.4 C). Thus, in Fig. 4 C, about half of the amount of T2 that appears in lane 5 is seen in lane 6and about half as much again appears in lane 7, whereas the decline was clearly more sharp for S. pombe (Fig.4 B, quantitation not shown). This is consistent with the idea that termination by S. cerevisiae pol III within a dT(n) tract may be a more of a stochastic process than occurs in the other pol III complexes (24Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A tRNAUGASerM gene bearing a 3T test terminator was used to examine the sensitivity to α-amanitin of the three pols III (Fig.5 A–C). Human pol III was clearly the most sensitive to α-amanitin; S. pombe was less sensitive, and S. cerevisiae was insensitive. Quantitation revealed that S. pombe pol III was ∼50% inhibited by 400 μg/ml α-amanitin (Fig. 5 D) as previously reported for the S. pombe 7SL RNA gene (54Rodicker F. Ossenbuhl F. Michels D. Benecke B.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar) (note that the concentrations used here may not reveal an accurate curve for the human enzyme). Since S. pombe and human pols III are sensitive to α-amanitin and S. cerevisiae is not, inhibition by this toxin provides another criterion that distinguishes these enzymes (55Valenzuela P. Hager G.L. Weinberg F. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have developed a tRNA suppressor gene whose biological function in S. pombe is dependent on accurate and efficient termination by pol III, and we used it to study transcriptional termination in vivo and in vitro. We described for the first time extract derived from S. pombe that is active for faithful tRNA transcription, confirming the results obtainedin vivo and establishing that pol III termination occurs efficiently at 5 Ts in S. pombe. Results obtained on the same templates demonstrated that S. cerevisiae pol III requires a longer dT tract than human or S. pombe pols III for termination and supported the idea that this enzyme terminates more stochastically than vertebrate or S. pombe pols III in a dT tract (24Geiduschek E.P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). During the final stages of this work, after our in vitrotranscription extract was developed, a paper appeared that described transcription of 7SL RNA in a low salt extract of S. pombe(54Rodicker F. Ossenbuhl F. Michels D. Benecke B.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). The authors noted that 7SL RNA synthesis was sensitive to α-amanitin, and they concluded that the enzyme responsible was pol III because tRNA and 5 S rRNA synthesized in nuclei exhibited the same sensitivity. However, since tRNA transcription in vitro was not reported, it is unclear whether the S. pombe low salt extract would be active for tRNA transcription. In this regard, it is interesting to note that an upstream deletion mutant of the S. pombe 7SL RNA gene, slr1, was transcribed efficiently in HeLa extract but not in the S. pombe low salt extract (54Rodicker F. Ossenbuhl F. Michels D. Benecke B.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the internal tRNA-like promoter ofslr1 was recognized by factors in HeLa extract and that a comparable activity was not present in the S. pombe low salt extract. Our results indicate that high salt extraction is a critical determinant in obtaining tRNA transcription activity from S. pombe cells. A conclusion that we wish to draw from our experiments with amanitin is that differential sensitivity to this compound provides clear biochemical evidence of the distinct nature of the pols III examined here. Mutations in eukaryotic RNA polymerases that confer resistance to α-amanitin have been mapped to a highly conserved region of the largest subunits of the RNA polymerases from prokaryotes and eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 28Thuillier V. Brun I. Sentenac A. Werner M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A functional significance of this region was suggested by mutations in the homologous domain ofEscherichia coli RNA polymerase that cause aberrant termination (56Yang X. Price C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23930-23933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 57Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R.

A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the other known molecular effects of α-amanitin is inhibition of RNA 3′-OH cleavage by RNA pol II, an important activity that is common to all multisubunit RNA polymerases (60Johnson T.L. Chamberlin M.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 61Chafin D.R. Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19114-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An additional reason to suspect a possible link between termination signal recognition and α-amanitin sensitivities observed here is that RNA 3′-OH cleavage is important for pol III termination (27Chedin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether α-amanitin would inhibit RNA 3′-OH cleavage and/or termination by pol III. We acknowledge that our approach was modeled in part from a strategy that used tRNA-mediated suppression in S. cerevisiae. In agreement with that study, our results showed that 5 Ts signal inefficient termination by S. cerevisiae pol III in vitro (62Allison D.S. Hall B.D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Also in agreement, termination was inefficient with fewer than 6 Ts in that study, clearly more dTs than required inS. pombe using a comparable suppressor system (Fig.2 A). Termination can be a powerful way to modulate gene expression, and differences in this phase of the transcription cycle may be associated with differential responses to trans-acting factors (Ref. 59Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and references therein). The RNA-binding protein La, which recognizes the 3′ UUU-OH terminus of nascent pol III transcripts, may be a good example of one such factor, as human La has been shown to regulate pol III recycling and associated activities in a terminator-dependent manner in an in vitrosystem (18Fan H. Sakulich A.L. Goodier J.L. Zhang X. Qin J. Maraia R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Goodier J.L. Maraia R.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2147-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily divergent TFIIIC subunits (see Introduction), some of which bind at or near the terminator, may also play a role in termination, as a preparation of human holo-TFIIIC and associated factors have been reported to affect termination and recycling by pol III (22Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other lines of investigation also indicate that pol III termination is a complex multistep process (17Dieci G. Sentenac A.

https://openalex.org/W1502351498,"The black-footed ferret, indigenous to the western United States, was believed to be extinct by the 1970s after a precipitous decline in its main food source, prairie dogs. The accidental discovery of a remnant colony of black-footed ferrets in Wyoming 20 years ago prompted the launch of an ambitious captive breeding program to save this species. As
 Dobson and Lyles
 discuss in a Perspective, the combined efforts of veterinarians, zoologists, ecologists and wild-life managers, not to mention 35 private and government agencies, has resulted in a remarkable comeback for this sleek carnivore. Through aggressive captive breeding programs and prerelease behavioral conditioning, the release of captive ferrets to their original habitats in the Rocky Mountains has resulted in the seeding of four wild breeding colonies. But the ultimate success of this ambitious project will depend on sustaining sufficiently large colonies of prairie dogs that constitute the black-footed ferret9s exclusive prey."

Transgenic mice expressing ORF74 under control of the CD2 promoter develop highly vascularized Kaposi's sarcoma-like tumors. Through targeted mutagenesis we here create three distinct phenotypes of ORF74: a receptor with normal, high constitutive signaling through the phospholipase C pathway but deprived of binding and action of chemokines obtained through deletion of 22 amino acids from the N-terminal extension; an ORF74 with high constitutive activity but with selective elimination of stimulatory regulation by angiogenic chemokines obtained through substitution of basic residues at the extracellular ends of TM-V or TM-VI; and an ORF74 lacking constitutive activity but with preserved ability to be stimulated by agonist chemokines obtained through introduction of an Asp residue on the hydrophobic, presumed membrane-exposed face of TM-II. It is concluded that careful molecular dissection can selectively eliminate either agonist or inverse agonist modulation as well as high constitutive activity of the virally encoded oncogene ORF74 and that these mutant forms presumably can be used in transgenic animals to identify the molecular mechanism of its transforming activity.

These molecules have presumably been obtained by the virus through an ancient act of molecular piracy and are structurally optimized for a particular pharmacological phenotype of benefit to the virus. The proposed functional properties of virally encoded chemokines are multiple. Some act as chemokine antagonists, for example vMIP-II from HHV-8 (8Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G.

In contrast to the viral chemokines, the function of the virally encoded chemokine receptors is not that clear yet. In general these receptors are not required for viral replication in vitro(13Field B.N. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Puplishers, Hagerstown, MD1995Google Scholar). However gene deletion experiments in both mouse and rat cytomegalovirus have shown that, for example the UL33 receptor is essential for targeting and/or replication of the virus in salivary glands (14Davis-Poynter N.J.

In HHV-8 the receptor is known as ORF74, but it is also frequently referred to as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-G-protein-coupled receptor (Fig. 1). A prominent pharmacologic feature of ORF74 from HHV-8 is its high degree of constitutive, ligand-independent signaling through the phospholipase C (19Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol.

Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Furthermore ORF74 has angiogenic properties and its signaling is closely coupled to production and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and to cellular transformation and formation of highly vascularized tumors in SCID mice (21Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In humans, ORF74 is expressed in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions (15Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S.

Recently, transgenic mice expressing the ORF74 receptor under control of the CD2 promoter have been reported to develop highly vascularized Kaposi's sarcoma-like tumors (1Yang Y.T. Chen S.C.

The properties of these chemokines on ORF74 signaling cover the whole pharmacological spectrum: GROα, GROβ and GROγ are agonists, IP-10, stromal cell-derived factor-1α, granulocyte colony stimulating factor-2, and vMIP-II are inverse agonists, whereas the inflammatory CXC chemokines IL-8, neutrophil-activating peptide-2, and epithelial cell-derived activating peptide-78 are neutral ligands, which despite high affinity binding do not affect signaling of the receptor (20Rosenkilde M.M.

Interestingly, the chemokines, which act as agonists on ORF74, are normally angiogenic chemokines in the host, whereas the chemokines that act as inverse agonists are normally angiostatic or angiomodulatory messengers (23Moore B.B.

The present study is aimed at trying to characterize, in the ORF74 receptor from HHV-8, the structural basis for its broad spectrum binding profile of chemokines as well as the structural basis for its high constitutive activity based on knowledge on ligand binding and signaling properties in other 7TM receptors. Thereby, we created specific ORF74 mutants in which certain elements of the pharmacological repertoire have been selectively eliminated; to exploit these mutants in future transgenic studies to identify the molecular mechanism that HHV-8 has exploited in ORF74 to precipitate the different clinical features of Kaposi's sarcoma and other HHV-8-related malignancies. The human chemokines were purchased from R&D systems (epithelial cell-derived activating peptide-78, GROβ, and GROγ) or kindly provided by Kuldeep Neote, Pfizer (IP-10, granulocyte colony stimulating factor-2, and GROα), Timothy N. C. Wells, Serono Pharmaceutical Research Group, Ares-Serono, Geneva (neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and vMIP-II), Mikael Luther, Glaxo Wellcome (Met stromal cell-derived factor-1α), or Thomas P. Boesen at this laboratory (IL-8). The ORF74 (GenBankTM accession number U24275) was cloned from a biopsy taken from a Kaposi's sarcoma skin lesion from an human immunodeficiency virus, type I-infected patient (8Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G. Johnsen A.H. Alouani S. Power C.A. Luttichau H.R. Gerstoft J. Clapham P.R. Clark L.I. Wells T.C. Schwartz T.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Monoiodinated 125I-IL-8,125I-GROα, and myo-[3H]inositol (PT6–271) and Bolton-Hunter reagent for iodination of IP-10 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin was from Bio-Rad. The Bolton-Hunter reagent was dried by a gentle stream of nitrogen for 30–60 min. 5–10 μg of IP-10 was incubated on ice with 1.5 mCi of Bolton-Hunter reagent in a total volume of 50 μl of 0.1 mm Borat buffer, pH 8.5, for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of H2O supplemented with 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid. The iodinated chemokines were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The cDNA encoding the ORF74 receptor was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTEJ-8 (31Johansen T.E. Schøller M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutations were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using either the overlap extension method (32Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) for mutations located internal in the receptor or flanking-extended primers for the N-terminal truncated mutation. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested by the appropriate restriction endonucleases, purified, and cloned in the pTEJ8-ORF74. All experiments were performed using thepfu-polymerase, and mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping followed by DNA sequence analysis using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP on an Alfexpress DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (33Rosenkilde M.M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates one day after transfection. The number of cells seeded/well was determined by the apparent expression efficiency of the individual clones and was aimed at obtaining 5–10% specific binding of the added radioactive ligand. 3 × 105 and 5 × 105 cells/well were used for mutations with eliminated specific binding. Two days after transfection, cells were assayed by competition binding for 3 h at 4 °C using 12 pm125I-IL-8, 125I-GROα, or125I-IP-10 plus unlabeled ligand in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation cells were washed quickly four times in 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 mNaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 0.1 μm unlabeled chemokine. Determinations were made in duplicates. One day after transfection, COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol in 1 ml/well inositol-free Dulbecco's 1885 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Cells were washed twice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and were incubated in 0.8 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence of various concentrations of chemokine. Cells were extracted with 10% ice-cold perchloric acid followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was neutralized with KOH in Hepes buffer, and the generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified on an AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (34Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicates. IC50 and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression, andB max values were calculated using the GraphPad-Prism 2 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). The N-terminal region of the ORF74 receptor is characterized by the occurrence of many acidic residues, whereas multiple basic residues are found at the extracellular ends of TM-V and TM-VI and in extracellular loops 2 and 3 as shown in Fig.1. These two regions were initially targeted for mutagenesis to try to selectively alter the ligand binding without affecting signaling of the virally encoded receptor. Gene dosage experiments showed that deletion of the N-terminal 22 amino acids, including 7 acidic residues (Δ22-N-terminal), did not affect the basal signaling activity of the receptor, i.e. as determined by PI turnover (Fig.2 A). However, neither the agonist GROα nor the inverse agonist IP-10 could affect the high constitutive signaling activity of the mutated receptor (Fig.2 C). A whole panel of human CXC chemokines were tested on the Δ22-N-terminal mutant form of ORF74, but none of them were found to have any influence on its signaling (Fig. 2 F), although several of these chemokines act either as agonists or inverse agonists on the wild type receptor (20Rosenkilde M.M.

The three radioligands,125I-GROα, 125I-IP-10, and125I-IL-8, which all bind with high affinity to the wild type receptor did not show any binding to the Δ22-N-terminal mutation (Table I).Table ICompetition binding for mutations in the ORF74 receptor125I-GROα125I-IL8125I-IP-10B maxratioIC50(n)B maxIC50(n)B maxIC50(n)B maxGROα/IP-10nmfmol/10 5 cellnmfmol/10 5 cellnmfmol/10 5 cellORF74 wt0.10 ± 0.02(11)44 ± 101.5 ± 0.4(5)42 ± 120.61 ± 0.19(13)28 ± 2.91.57Δ22-N-terminalNB(3)NB(3)NB(3)R208H/R212H0.53 ± 0.19(7)4.5 ± 1.9NB(3)0.73 ± 0.10(9)46 ± 6.20.08R278A/R279A0.10 ± 0.05(4)8.3 ± 0.70.88 ± 0.05(3)2.5 ± 0.23.15 ± 1.21(9)170 ± 650.05L91D0.01 ± 0.003(5)0.28 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.17(3)4.4 ± 1.50.32 ± 0.05(4)3.2 ± 0.520.09N92D0.11 ± 0.07(3)13 ± 4.51.2 ± 0.16(6)8.6 ± 1.50.84 ± 0.15(9)16 ± 60.84S93D0.07 ± 0.03(3)14 ± 62.3 ± 0.93(3)12 ± 1.20.72 ± 0.18(2)11 ± 3.041.33L94D0.02 ± 0.002(5)0.74 ± 0.131.2 ± 0.2(4)3.6 ± 0.680.49 ± 0.25(4)4.9 ± 2.50.15Y128S0.08 ± 0.03(4)5.8 ± 1.31.3 ± 0.39(3)33 ± 110.38 ± 0.14(4)4.3 ± 0.921.36V142D0.08 ± 0.03(3)12 ± 2.11.3 ± 0.17(5)11 ± 2.70.38 ± 0.07(3)7.3 ± 2.71.66N92D/V142D0.05 ± 0.01(3)8.6 ± 2.10.61 ± 0.07(6)2.8 ± 0.670.32 ± 0.04(4)4.2 ± 0.751.73V310N0.09 ± 0.01(2)17 ± 1.92.6 ± 0.28(4)49 ± 50.87 ± 0.19(4)22 ± 8.21.30Homologous competition binding in transiently transfected COS-7 cells with three different radioligands, the agonist 125I-GROα, the inverse agonist 125I-IP10, and the neutral ligand125I-IL8.

B max ratio indicates the ratio between B max measured with125I-GROα compared to B max measured with125I-IP-10. NB indicates no specific binding. Based on the observation that IL-8 binding to CXCR2 is highly dependent on the presence of two arginine residues located at the extracellular end of TM-V (35Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hébert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that they are among the few residues shared between CXCR2 and ORF74, we substituted these residues as well as two arginine residues located in the corresponding region at the extracellular end of the neighboring TM-VI in ORF74 (Fig.1). The two arginine-substituted ORF74 mutants, like the wild type receptor, displayed high constitutive signaling as demonstrated both by gene-dosing experiments and by the suppressive effect of the inverse agonist, IP-10 (Fig. 2, A, D, and E). However, GROα, which acts as an agonist on the wild type ORF74, did not stimulate signaling detectably above the high basal level in the arginine-substituted ORF74 mutants (Fig. 2, D andE). This is surprising, because GROα did bind with high, normal affinity, albeit with a diminished B maxvalue, to the mutated receptors (4.5 and 8.3 fmol/105 cells for the TM-V mutant (R208H/R212H)-ORF74 and the TM-VI mutant (R278A/R279A)-ORF74, respectively, versus 44 fmol/105 cells for the wild type receptor, Table I). The binding of the neutral ligand IL-8 was totally eliminated in (R208H/R212H)-ORF74, whereas in (R278A/R279A)-ORF74, IL-8 binding was not affected in respect of affinity (K d = 0.88 nm versus 1.5 nm for wild type receptor) but was severely decreased in respect ofB max (2.5 fmol/105 cells as compared with 42 fmol/105 cells for the wild type ORF74) (Table 1). In contrast, for the inverse agonist, IP-10-increasedB max values were observed in both of the arginine-substituted ORF74 mutants (46 and 170 fmol/105cells for (R208H/R212H]-ORF74 and [R278A/R279A)-ORF74, respectively,versus 28 fmol/105 cells for the wild type receptor) with preserved high affinity IP-10 binding (Table I). A number of residues in the transmembrane segments have been implicated as being important for the signal transduction process in 7TM receptors in general. As shown in Fig. 1, many of these residues have been mutated by the virus in ORF74. In an attempt to localize the structural basis for the high constitutive activity of the virally encoded receptor, we re-introduced “normal” 7TM residues at a number of places in the transmembrane segments of ORF74. Most of the substitutions in the transmembrane segments of ORF74 did not affect the receptor neither in respect of ligand binding nor in respect of constitutive signaling. Thus, in gene dosage experiments the (Y128S)-, (V142D)-, (N92D/V142D)-, and (V310N)-ORF74 mutants all had similar basal activity as compared with wild type ORF74 (Fig.3 A). These mutants were also affected by chemokine ligands in a similar manner as the wild type receptor was as they were unaffected by IL-8, stimulated by GROα, and inhibited by IP-10 (Fig. 3 B). One of the mutants, (Y128S)-ORF74, did show a slightly higher constitutive activity and was affected less by both GROα and IP-10 than the wild type receptor. The competition binding analysis for these mutations also gave results rather similar to those observed in the wild type receptor, although the expression level of (Y128S)-, (V142D)-, and (N92D/V142D)-ORF74 was lower for all tested radioactive ligands (TableI). Further mutational analysis was performed in TM-II. This segment normally holds AspII:10, which is highly important for signaling in 7TMs in general. Asn92 in ORF74 was the most obviously candidate for a mutated AspII:10. However, “reintroduction” of an Asp at this position either alone or in combination with an Asp in position III:25 in the “DRY” motif did not have a major effect on either ligand binding (Table I) or receptor signaling (Fig. 3 and4). We then decided to try to re-introduce an Asp residue at other positions in TM-II around Asn92. Substitution of the other polar residue in this region, Ser93, with an Asp had as little effect on receptor signaling and ligand binding as the substitution of Asn92(Fig. 4 A). Surprisingly, introduction of an Asp residue for either Leu91 or Leu94, both of which would be expected to be facing more or less into the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1), eliminated the high constitutive activity of the ORF74 receptor while preserving its ability to be stimulated by GROα (Fig. 4). Because of the low basal activity, the relative stimulatory effect of GROα was even larger, ∼3-fold, in the (L91D)- and (L94D)-ORF74 constructs as compared with the 2-fold stimulation found in the wild type receptor. Also because of the low basal activity, which was similar to that observed in cells transfected with the empty expression vector, IP-10 was unable to show any inverse agonistic activity in these two mutants (Fig. 4 D). The expression level for the four different Asp mutations in TM-II was relatively similar, between 3.6 and 12 fmol/105 cells, but less than the expression level of the wild type receptor as determined by the B max values using the neutral ligand125I-IL-8 (Table I). Similarly, theB max values for 125I-IP-10 were comparable in this group of mutants, between 3.2 and 16 fmol/105 cells (Table I). In contrast, theB max values for 125I-GROα were very low, 0.28 and 0.74 fmol/105 cells, for the two mutants in which the constitutive activity had been silenced, (L91D)- and (L94D)-ORF74 as compared with the B max for GROα in the (N92D)- and (S93D)-ORF74 and the wild type ORF74, 13, 14, and 44 fmol/105 cells (Table I). Nevertheless, despite the apparent low B max values, GROα was able to efficiently stimulate signaling of the (L91D)- and (L94D)-ORF74 constructs. In the present study three distinct phenotypes of ORF74 are generated through targeted mutagenesis directed toward either presumed ligand binding epitopes in the extracellular domains or toward the seven helical bundle, which is responsible for the signal transduction: 1) a receptor with eliminated ligand binding but with maintained high constitutive activity; 2) a receptor with selective elimination of agonist action, GROα, but with preserved inverse agonist action, IP-10, and also with preserved high constitutive activity; and 3) a receptor with eliminated constitutive activity but with preserved ligand binding and importantly with maintained ability to be stimulated by agonists. The elimination of all chemokine binding through truncation of the N terminus of the receptor is in agreement with the observation that peptide and protein ligands of the 7TM receptors in general often have important interactions with the extracellular segments (36Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Especially in chemokine receptors, ligand-receptor interactions have often been located to their N-terminal segment (37Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 38Farzan M. Choe H. Martin C.A. Sun Y. Gerard N. Sodroski J. Gerard C. J. Biol.

Most significantly, Handel and co-workers (40Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have recently by NMR demonstrated the precise molecular binding mode of a peptide from the N-terminal segment of the CCR2 receptor to a structurally complementary groove on the main agonist for this receptor, MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1). In the case of ORF74, Gershengorn and co-workers (41Ho H.H. Du D. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31327-31332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) recently found in analogy with the observation in the present study that truncation of the N terminus eliminated agonist binding. Importantly, in both studies it was found that the high constitutive activity of the N-terminally truncated ORF74 receptor was similar to that of the wild type receptor (Fig. 2). In an attempt to affect the binding and action of various types of chemokine ligands selectively, we focused on the extracellular ends of TM-V and -VI, because these epitopes are known often to be involved in both agonist and antagonist binding in 7TM receptors (36Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Specifically in CXCR1 and -2, which are the endogenous receptors with ligand binding profiles most similar to that of ORF74, two Arg residues are located at positions V:01 and V:05 facing the main ligand binding crevice and are known to be crucially involved in the binding of IL-8 (35Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hébert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in ORF74, and we find here that substitution of the two Args with His residues in ORF74 also eliminated binding of IL-8, which is a neutral ligand in this virally encoded receptor. However, from a functional point of view this double mutation was even more interesting than expected, because it surprisingly eliminated the action of the agonist chemokine GROα without affecting the binding or action of the inverse agonist chemokine, IP-10 (Fig. 2). GROα still bound to the mutated receptor, albeit with a 5-fold reduced affinity and a 10-fold reduced B max. The inability of the R208H/R212H mutation to be stimulated by GROα cannot be explained simply by the low B max for the agonist, because, for example the L91D and L94D mutants display even lowerB max values for GROα both in total numbers and relative to the B max values for the inverse agonist IP-10 (Table I). Instead, an explanation could be that the double mutation eliminates a ligand-receptor interaction, which although being essential for the binding of the neutral ligand, IL-8, is only of limited importance for the binding of the agonist GROα but is an interaction that is essential for the function of GROα as an agonist. Importantly, the mutated receptor signals with high constitutive activity and this activity can be blocked normally by the inverse agonist peptide IP-10. Thus this mutation provides a unique tool to determine the relative importance of agonist versusinverse agonist regulation of ORF74 activity for the angiogenic property of the virally encoded receptor to be determined, for example in transgenic animals (1Yang Y.T. Chen S.C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M. Sullivan L. Jenh C.H. Narula S.K. Chensue S.W. Lira S.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The virally encoded receptor differs structurally at many positions from the classical 7TM pattern of conserved residues. Based on these differences, a number of substitutions were made in the transmembrane helical bundle to normalize the receptor structurally and thereby try to normalize the high constitutive activity of ORF74. For example, at the intracellular end of TM-III in most 7TM receptors is found the tri-peptide sequence Asp-Arg-Tyr (DRY) of which the Asp and Arg are highly conserved and crucially involved in receptor G-protein interaction and signaling (26Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. Benedetti P. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In ORF74 the Asp in the DRY sequence is substituted with a Val. In the middle of TM-III of ORF74 a large aromatic side chain is located at position III:11 (Tyr128), which in the angiotensin AT1 receptor (28Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J. Warburton P. Donelly D. Ball S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4245-4251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and in the bradykinin receptor (29Marie J. Kock C. Pruneau D. Paquet J.L. Groblewski T. Larguier R. Lombard C. Deslauriers B. Maigret B. Bonnafous J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) creates a receptor phenotype dominated by high constitutive activity. In TM-VII the highly conserved Asn at position VII:16, which normally is believed to be involved in creating an important interhelical hydrogen bond network, is in ORF74 substituted with a Val lacking the ability to form hydrogen bonds. In TM-II the functionally highly important Asp residue is substituted with either an Asn or a Ser residue depending on how the sequence alignment is performed. However, normalization of ORF74 at these positions did not affect the high constitutive signaling of the receptor (Fig. 4). This was most surprising in the case of the DRY sequence, because substitution of the Asp in several cases, one of which is CXCR2, has created highly constitutively active receptors (26Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. Benedetti P. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 42Burger M. Burger J.A. Hoch R.C. Oades Z. Takamori H. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2017-2022PubMed Google Scholar). In the CXCR2 study, it was even argued that this substitution probably was the reason for the high constitutive activity of ORF74 (42Burger M. Burger J.A. Hoch R.C. Oades Z. Takamori H. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2017-2022PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mutation performed here in the ORF74 could not confirm that notion. Thus, the rational approach to normalizing ORF74 signaling was not successful in our hands. Nevertheless, introduction of an Asp residue at either position 91 or position 94 in TM-II surprisingly created the desired phenotype,i.e. low constitutive signaling activity combined with the ability to be stimulated by agonists. Because of the poorly conserved primary structure around TM-II, it was unclear how the sequence of ORF74 was best aligned with the consensus 7TM sequences, which basically only dictates the presence of an Asp residue located at position II:10 in an otherwise rather hydrophobic segment. Most likely it is either the Asn92 or perhaps the Ser93residue that corresponds to the TM-II Asp found in almost all 7TM receptors. However, because the introduction of an Asp at these positions had almost no effect on the basal signaling of ORF74, the neighboring positions were also probed and with a surprisingly positive result (Fig. 1). The L91D and L94D substitutions abolished the constitutive activity, without influencing the surface expression of the receptor more than introduction of Asps at the neighboring positions 92 and 93 did; the latter two mutations were displayed as high basal activity as observed in the wild type receptor. From the helical wheel diagram of TM-II, it is predicted that Leu91and Leu94 are both located on a hydrophobic, presumed membrane-exposed face of this helix (Fig. 1). It is unclear what the structural basis for the effect of these substitutions is. It could be envisioned that introduction of the polar, potentially charged Asp residue in the middle of the hydrophobic face would destabilize the receptor structure. However, how this could lead to diminished basal signaling but preserved responsiveness to the agonist is unclear. It has been suggested that ORF74 through its ligand-independent high constitutive activity should be causatively involved in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma as well as certain types of B-cell lymphomas (19Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 21Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gerhengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Recently it was elegantly shown by Lira and co-workers (1Yang Y.T. Chen S.C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M. Sullivan L. Jenh C.H. Narula S.K. Chensue S.W. Lira S.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that transgenic mice expressing the wild type ORF74 receptor under control of the CD2 promoter develop Kaposi's sarcoma-like lesions. This obviously strongly supports a pathogenic connection between ORF74 from HHV-8 and Kaposi's sarcoma. However, it is still unclear whether it is merely the constitutive activity of the virus-encoded oncogene as such that causes the lesions or whether the carefully evolved control of this activity by angiogenic as well as angiostatic or modulator chemokines is involved in the development of these specially highly vascularized tumors. It should also be noted that Kaposi's sarcoma predominantly develops in immune compromised individuals and that the function of ORF74 in the life circle of HHV-8 may be more subtle in the normal HHV-8-infected individuals. Nevertheless, expression of the various ORF74 mutants with and without high constitutive activity as well as with and without chemokine or selective angiogenic chemokine regulation in transgenic animals should be able to clarify the molecular mechanism exploited by HHV-8 in cell transformation and angiogenesis.

We demonstrated previously that growth hormone (GH) induces tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and association of SIRPα with SHP-2. The GH-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 associates with and tyrosyl-phosphorylates SIRPα1. Here we show that JAK2-SIRPα1 association does not require phosphotyrosines in SIRPα1 or JAK2 or the proline-rich region of SIRPα1. However, when the C-terminal 30 amino acids of SIRPα1 containing the proline-rich region and tyrosine 495 are deleted, tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα1 by JAK2 and association of SHP-2 with SIRPα1 are reduced. GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 is reduced when wild-type SIRPα1 compared with SIRPα1 lacking the four cytoplasmic tyrosines (SIRP 4YF) is expressed in cells, suggesting that SIRPα1 negatively regulates GHR/JAK2 signaling. Consistent with reduced JAK2 activity, overexpression of wild-type SIRPα1 but not SIRP 4YF reduces GH-induced phosphorylation of ERKs 1 and 2, STAT3, and STAT5B.

While the effects of SIRP on signaling by growth factors have been examined, the effects of SIRP on signaling by ligands that bind to members of the cytokine receptor superfamily such as GH receptor (GHR) have not been explored. We have previously demonstrated that GH induces tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and association of SIRPα with SHP-2 in 3T3-F442A cells and that activated JAK2 associates with and tyrosyl-phosphorylates SIRPα1 in COS cells (3Stofega M.R.

The stock of murine 3T3-F442A fibroblasts was kindly provided by H. Green (Harvard University). 3T3-F442A cells and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units of penicillin per ml, 100 μg of streptomycin per ml, 0.25 μg of amphotericin B per ml, 1 mml-glutamine, and 9% calf serum as described previously (17Foster C.M.

Clonal cell lines co-expressing SIRPα1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) or SIRP 4YF and GFP and pooled cell lines co-expressing prk5 and GFP, SIRPα1, and GFP or SIRP 4YF and GFP were created. 3T3-F442A cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of pEGFP-C1 and 12 μg of either prk5, prk5 encoding SIRPα1, or prk5 encoding SIRP 4YF according to the manufacturer's instructions, using Fugene 6 transfection reagent. 48–72 h post-transfection, cells were split and maintained in selection medium containing DMEM, antibiotics,l-glutamine, and 0.8 mg/ml G418 for 1 month. Individual colonies were selected or cells were pooled and the cells sorted by flow cytometry for GFP expression. The top 5% of cells were collected, maintained for 1 month, and subjected to a second round of flow cytometry, in which the top 20% of cells expressing GFP were selected. SIRP expression was determined, and cell lines were selected that expressed either SIRPα1 or SIRP 4YF at levels that were appreciably above the level of expression of endogenous SIRP. Unexpectedly, in the clonal 3T3-F442A cell lines overexpressing SIRPα1 or SIRP 4YF, glycosylation of endogenous GH receptor was impaired (data not shown). Deglycosylation of GHR has been reported to decrease the affinity of GH for its receptor (18Harding P.A. Wang X.Z. Kelder B. Souza S. Okada S. Kopchick J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Szecowka J. Tai L.-R. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); therefore, some decrease in GH-dependent signaling might be expected. However, in the present experiments the high concentration of GH used would be expected to minimize the effect of a decrease in receptor affinity. The glycosylation of GHR in the pooled stable 3T3-F442A cells overexpressing SIRPα1 or SIRP 4YF was normal, but in these cells, expression of exogenous SIRPα1 and SIRP 4YF was unstable, and the expression levels decreased rapidly with time. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, andl-glutamine. Calcium phosphate precipitation (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

The empty prk5 expression vector was used to normalize the total amount of DNA in the transfections. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cell lysates were prepared 48–72 h post-transfection. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, COS cells, or 293T cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Incubation of cells in serum-free medium and with ligand was performed at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4) and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated on ice for 2 h with the indicated antibody. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 137 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and boiled for 5 min in a 4:1 mixture of lysis buffer and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 40% glycerol). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with the indicated antibodies, and visualized by ECL detection system (21Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated, the blots were either directly reprobed with antibody or stripped in 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 55 °C for 40 min and then reprobed. For quantification, autoradiographs were scanned using an Astra 1220S scanner and VistaScan DA software (UMAX). The resulting images were analyzed using Multi-Analyst image analysis software (Bio-Rad). The values were normalized for the amount of protein detected when the blot was reprobed with the appropriate antibody. All bands scanned were within the linear range of the film. Means and S.E. of independent experiments are reported. SIRP mutants were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described by the manufacturer. To create SIRP 3PA, the cDNA for full-length SIRPα1 was mutated to replace prolines with alanines at amino acids 484, 486, and 488. The truncated SIRPα1, SIRP(1–473), was prepared from the cDNA for full-length SIRPα1 by replacing the codon corresponding to methionine 474 with a termination codon. The oligonucleotide primers were (lowercase represents mutations) as follows: 5′-CGGACCCCCAAGCAGgCGGCCgCCAAGgCTGAG CCG TCC-3′ and 5′-GGACGGCTCAGcCTT GGcGGCCGcCTGCTTGG GG CCG-3′ (for SIRP 3PA) and 5′-GCT GAC CTG GAC taG GTC CAC CTC AAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGAGGTGGACctA GTCCAGGTCAGC-3′ (for SIRP(1–473)). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The generation of SIRP 4YF in which the tyrosines at 428, 452, 469, and 495 in full-length SIRPα1 are replaced with phenylalanines has been described previously (1Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that JAK2 associates with and tyrosyl-phosphorylates SIRPα1 (3Stofega M.R. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7112-7117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the nature of the association of SIRPα1 with JAK2, we examined whether the interaction between SIRPα1 and JAK2 was dependent on tyrosyl phosphorylation of either JAK2 or SIRPα1. COS cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding prk5 vector, JAK2, or kinase-inactive JAK2 K/E (in which the critical lysine 882 in the ATP-binding region is replaced with glutamate) alone or in combination with wild-type human SIRPα1 or SIRP 4YF (in which all the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of SIRPα1 have been replaced with phenylalanines). Proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αSIRP and immunoblotted with αJAK2. Wild-type JAK2 associates to an equal extent with SIRPα1 and SIRP 4YF (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that association of JAK2 with SIRPα1 does not require phosphotyrosines in SIRPα1. Similarly, both wild-type SIRPα1 and SIRP 4YF associate to an equal extent with tyrosyl-phosphorylated wild-type JAK2 and unphosphorylated kinase-inactive JAK2 K/E (Fig.1 A, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7), suggesting that the association of SIRPα1 with JAK2 does not require phosphotyrosines in JAK2. Thus the association of SIRPα1 with JAK2 is independent of phosphotyrosines in either JAK2 or SIRPα1. We next determined if these results obtained in COS cells overexpressing JAK2 and SIRPα1 accurately reflect the interactions between SIRP and JAK2 when JAK2 and SIRP are expressed at endogenous levels. Endogenous JAK2 and SIRP have both been shown to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to GH (3Stofega M.R. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7112-7117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C.

Probing the blot with αPY revealed that GH promotes the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRP (Fig. 1 B, lower panel), consistent with earlier studies (3Stofega M.R. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7112-7117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Probing with αJAK2 revealed that JAK2 is constitutively associated with SIRP (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Furthermore, GH did not affect the degree of association. Taken together, the results obtained in COS and 3T3-F442A cells indicate that JAK2 and SIRP are constitutively associated. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 or SIRPα1 does not affect their association with each other or the ability of GH to regulate their association. The SIRPα family members (SIRPα1, -α2, and -α3) contain a proline-rich region in the cytoplasmic domain, spanning amino acids 481–490 (1Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M.

Within this proline-rich region, amino acids 481–488 (PKQP(A/L) PKP) are similar to the amino acids (ILPPVPVP) of the Box B1 region of GH receptor (23O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2134748677,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The exact mechanism by which chronic infection with HBV contributes to onset of HCC is unknown. However, previous studies have implicated the HBV transactivator protein, HBx, in progression of HCC through its ability to bind the human tumor suppressor protein, p53. In this study, we have examined the ability of HBx to modify p53 regulation of the HCC tumor marker gene, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). By utilizing in vitro chromatin assembly of DNA templates prior to transcription analysis, we have demonstrated that HBx functionally disrupts p53-mediated repression of AFP transcription through protein-protein interaction. HBx modification of p53 gene regulation is both tissue-specific and dependent upon the p53 binding element. Our data suggest that the mechanism by which HBx alleviates p53 repression of AFP transcription is through an association with DNA-bound p53, resulting in a loss of p53 interaction with liver-specific transcriptional co-repressors."
https://openalex.org/W1535883711,"The Prnd gene encodes a homolog of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) called doppel (Dpl). Up-regulation of Prnd mRNA in two distinct lines of PrP gene ablated (Prnp 0/0) mice, designatedRcm0 and Ngsk, is associated with death of Purkinje cells. Using recombinant Dpl expressed in Escherichia coli and mouse neuroblastoma cells we demonstrate that wild type (wt) Dpl, like PrPC, adopts a predominantly α-helical conformation, forms intramolecular disulfide bonds, has twoN-linked oligosaccharides, and is presented on the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Dpl protein was detected in testis of wt mice. Using Triton X-114 phase partitioning to enrich for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, Dpl was detected in brain samples from Rcm0 Prnp 0/0mice but was absent in equivalent samples from wt mice and ZrchI Prnp 0/0 mice, indicating that ectopic expression of this protein may cause cerebellar pathology in Rcm0 mice. Biochemical and structural similarities between PrPC and Dpl documented here parallel the observation that ataxic Ngsk Prnp 0/0 mice can be rescued by overexpression of wild-type PrP transgenes, and suggest that cell surface PrPC can antagonize the toxic effect of Dpl expressed in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2033460210,"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, has a large number of mucin molecules on its surface, whose expression is regulated during the life cycle. These mucins are the main acceptors of sialic acid, a monosaccharide that is required by the parasite to infect and survive in the mammalian host. A large mucin-like gene family named TcMUC containing about 500 members has been identified previously in T. cruzi. TcMUC can be divided into two subfamilies according to the presence or absence of tandem repeats in the central region of the genes. In this work, T. cruzi parasites were transfected with one tagged member of each subfamily. Only the product from the gene with repeats was highly O-glycosylated in vivo. The O-linked oligosaccharides consisted mainly of β-d-Galp(1→4)GlcNAc and β-d-Galp(1→4)[β-d-Galp(1→6)]-d-GlcNAc. The same glycosyl moieties were found in endogenous mucins. The mature product was anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol to the plasma membrane and exposed to the medium. Sera from infected mice recognized the recombinant product of one repeats-containing gene thus showing that they are expressed during the infection. TcMUC genes encode a hypervariable region at the N terminus.

Chem. 275, 10218–10227) which do not have variable regions. glycophosphatidylinositol hypervariable glutathioneS-transferase cross-reacting determinant days postinfection polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulse amperometric detection phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylinositol Mucins in vertebrate cells are highly O-glycosylated proteins having relevant roles in protection and in cell-cell interactions. The former function is accomplished mainly by high molecular weight epithelial mucins and the latter by the much smaller endothelial and leukocyte mucins, all of them encoded by a few dozen genes (1Van Klinken B.J.W. Dekker J. Buller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-627PubMed Google Scholar, 2Van Klinken B.J.W. Einerhand A.W.C. Buller H.A. Dekker J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the lower eukaryote Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan agent of Chagas disease, mucins seem to have essential functions and unusual characteristics. The parasite mucins, located on the surface membrane, are the main acceptors of sialic acid transferred from host's glycoconjugates by the trypanosomatid-specific enzymetrans-sialidase (3Schenkman S. Ferguson M.A. Heise N. de Almeida M.L. Mortara R.A. Yoshida N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Surface mucins seem to be involved, after acquiring sialic acid, in the invasion of host cells by the parasite and in the protection against the alternative complement pathway (4Tomlinson S. Raper J.

Both steps are essential for parasite replication and survival in mammals. Mucins from T. cruzi were first isolated with aqueous-phenol and called bands A, B, and C (8Alves M.J.M. Colli W. FEBS Lett. 1975; 52: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9De Lederkremer R.M. Alves M.J. Fonseca G.C. Colli W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 444: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These glycoproteins were strongly labeled after intact parasites were treated with galactose oxidase/NaB3H4, thus proving their surface location (10Zingales B. Martin N.F. de Lederkremer R.M. Colli W. FEBS Lett. 1982; 142: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently, the structure of the O-linked sugars (11Previato J.O. Jones C. Xavier M.T. Wait R. Travassos L.R.

The oligosaccharides are linked through GlcNAc, rather than the GalNAc commonly found in vertebrate mucins. Most of the O-linked GlcNAc residues are substituted with 1–5 galactosyl units. The structures of the O-linked oligosaccharides are conserved between epimastigotes (the form of the parasite present in the insect vector midgut) and metacyclic trypomastigotes (the infective form in the feces of the insect). However, there are some polymorphisms among the strains, the most important one being the presence of galactofuranose in the G strain (12Previato J.O. Jones C. Goncalves L.P. Wait R. Travassos L.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Serrano A.A. Schenkman S. Yoshida N. Mehlert A. Richardson J.M. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol.

Jones C. Xavier M.T. Wait R. Travassos L.R. Parodi A.J. Mendonça-Previato L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7241-7250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The mucins present in these forms of the parasite are glycoproteins of about 35–50 kDa, whereas those in cell culture-derived trypomastigotes are considerably larger (70–200 kDa). The latter molecules have O-linked oligosaccharides terminating with α-Galp residues, epitopes that elicit a lytic antibody response in the human (14Almeida I.C. Ferguson M.A. Schenkman S. Travassos L.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The largest gene family encoding mucin-like genes described so far is present in T. cruzi, showing diversity among and within strains of the parasite (15Di Noia J.M. Pollevick G.D. Xavier M.T. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 500 mucin-like genes per haploid genome have been estimated to be present in this parasite (16Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), all members of a family named TcMUC because their overall structure resembled that of mucin genes in higher eukaryotic cells (17Di Noia J.M. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They all have conserved 5′- and 3′-regions, encoding a predicted signal peptide at the N terminus, and a C-terminal region that includes a putative sequence for a GPI1 anchor. Between the conserved ends, there is a variable central domain that characterizes two subfamilies within the mucin-like gene family. In one of these subfamilies, the central region encodes repetitive motifs with the consensus sequence T8KP2. In the second subfamily, the central domain codes for a region lacking amino acid repeats, which is rich in codons for Thr, Ser, and Pro residues, but which is variant in sequence among the members (16Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because of its organization and amino acid composition, these central regions were predicted to contain the target sites for O-glycosylation (17Di Noia J.M. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This assumption is supported by the facts that a repeats-containing member became highly glycosylated when transfected in Vero cells (15Di Noia J.M. Pollevick G.D. Xavier M.T. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that the synthetic peptide KP2T8KP2 is a good substrate for the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase, which startsO-glycosylation in T. cruzi (18Previato J.O. Sola-Penna M. Agrellos O.A. Jones C. Oeltmann T. Travassos L.R. Mendonça-Previato L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14982-14988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, a direct demonstration that these genes indeed code for the core protein of parasite mucins is still lacking. The small sequence (8–16 amino acids) between the signal peptide and the repeats, likely to code for the mature N terminus of mucins, is highly variable among members of the family (16Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Comparison of this hypervariable (HV) region from 32 cDNA clones showed 22 different variants (16Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A second gene family encoding mucin-type polypeptides (TcSMUG) was recently reported in T. cruzi. It is less complex than TcMUC and does not present any variable region. Several evidences suggest that TcSMUG probably encodes mucins from the insect stages of the parasite (19Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Three main questions about the TcMUC family are addressed in this work. First, do any of the mucin-like gene subfamilies code for parasite mucins, and what is the structure of these glycoproteins? Second, at which stages are the products expressed? Third, are the HV regions present in the mature products, and do they interact with the host immune system? Here we show that a gene representative of those encoding the repetitive T8KP2 central domain resulted in a highly O-glycosylated product, linked to the surface membrane through a GPI anchor. Sera reactivity with recombinant proteins indicates that these kinds of products are expressed during the vertebrate infection and that antibodies from natural and experimental infections can recognize the HV regions. Taken together, these results suggest a structural model for TcMUC-encoded mucins on the surface of the parasite and that the hypervariability in their exposed N terminus is driven by natural selection. Epimastigotes of the T. cruzi RA strain (20Gonzalez Cappa S.M. Bijovsky A.T. Freilij H. Muller L. Katzin A.M. Medicina ( B Aires ). 1981; 41: 119-120PubMed Google Scholar) and the CL-Brener cloned stock (21Zingales B. Pereira M.E. Oliveira R.P. Almeida K.A. Umezawa E.S. Souto R.P. Vargas N.

Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell-derived trypomastigotes, equivalent to the bloodstream forms of the parasite, were obtained by centrifugation from the supernatant of infected Vero cells at day 6–7 postinfection (19Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because sugars might hinder the access of antibodies to protein epitopes of molecules expected to be heavily O-glycosylated like TcMUC products in T. cruzi, a tag made up of the amino acid residues 21–44 of the HCV core protein (23Ishida C. Matsumoto K. Fukada K. Matsushita K. Shiraki H. Maeda Y. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 936-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which lacksN- and O-glycosylation sites, was inserted within the sequence predicted to encode the mature N-terminal region of MUC-CA3 and MUC-RA2 (17Di Noia J.M. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gene fusions were generated by polymerase chain reaction following standard protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and using the oligonucleotides indicated in TableI. The region spanning the repeats and C-terminal domains of MUC-CA3 was amplified using primers MREcoRI and P2 and cloned into pBlueScript KS II+ (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Primers MNREcoRI and P2 were used to do the same with the central and C-terminal domains of MUC-RA2. Oligonucleotides C21–44A and C21–44B were annealed to create a double-strand insert encoding the HCV core epitope that was cloned in-frame with both fragments mentioned above. Finally the corresponding N-terminal regions of MUC-CA3, amplified with primers MRatg and MRBglII, andMUC-RA2, amplified using primers MNRatg and MNRBglII, were added to the corresponding construct in-frame with the tag. These tagged versions of MUC-CA3 and MUC-RA2 were namedMUC-R and MUC-NR, respectively, and subcloned into both the T. cruzi expression vector pRIBOTEX (25Martinez-Calvillo S. Lopez I. Hernandez R.

Epimastigotes of T. cruzi were transformed by electroporation with the Qiagen-purified (QIAGEN Inc, Chatworth, CA) recombinant pRIBOTEX plasmids, using a slight modification of described procedures (26Hariharan S. Ajioka J. Swindle J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The transfected parasites were selected by the pRIBOTEX-encoded G418 resistance using 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Sigma) and used as populations after 40 days of selection. MUC-Rand MUC-NR were transfected into epimastigotes of both RA strain and of CL-Brener clone of T. cruzi. A similar result was obtained when each gene was expressed in both strains of the parasite, although the levels of product expression were very different (results not shown). Transcription of the recombinant genes was analyzed by Northern blot washed at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS as described (19Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol.

Anti-tag is a polyclonal serum raised in rabbit against the purified recombinant 21–44 amino acid residues of HCV core protein (23Ishida C. Matsumoto K. Fukada K. Matsushita K. Shiraki H. Maeda Y. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 936-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expressed in pGEX-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a fusion with the Schistosoma japonicum glutathioneS-transferase (GST). This serum was preadsorbed with GST before use to prevent background signals from T. cruzihomologous enzymes. Anti-cross-reacting determinant (CRD) was obtained from Oxford GlycoSystem, Rosedale, NY. Anti-GST is a polyclonal serum raised in rabbit against purified recombinant GST expressed from the pGEX-1 plasmid vector. Monoclonal antibody 3F5 was a kindly gift from Dr R. Mortara (Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Sera from 10 rabbits infected with different T. cruzistrains and bled at 15, 30, and 60 days postinfection (dpi) were kindly given by Dr. D. Sánchez (Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas, San Martı́n, Argentina). Sera from 12 infected humans in the chronic stage of the disease, as assessed by their differential reactivity against cruzipain and SAPAT. cruzi antigens (27Cazzulo J.J. Frasch A.C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3259-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were used. Mice sera used in TableII were from 42 individuals, each one belonging to any of four different mice strains, infected with one of seven different T. cruzi strains and bled at postinfection times ranging from 8 to 210 days and so being from the chronic or acute stages of the infection (for details, see the Table II legend). Sera used in Table III were obtained from 13 1-month-old Rockland mice infected intraperitoneally with 105 blood trypomastigotes of the Acosta population ofT. cruzi and bled at three different times postinfection. Sera from noninfected individuals were used as controls (four from rabbits, eight from humans, and four from mice).Table IIDetection of TcMUC encoded hypervariable regions by T. cruzi infection seraPositive sera/assayed seraHumanMouseRabbit<60 dpi>60 dpiE130 /120 /167 /210 /10T157 /120 /163 /211 /10T180 /120 /165 /211 /10NCA22 /12ND0 /3NDA panel of sera from humans, mice, and rabbits infected with differentT. cruzi strains and bled at different times postinfection was used.

Conditioned culture medium from transfected T. cruziepimastigotes was clarified for 10 min at 10,000 × gand concentrated 8 times by Polyethylene Glycol 8000 dialysis. Aliquots were immunoprecipitated using a 1/500 dilution of either anti-tag or anti-GST serum and protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.), following standard protocols (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunoconjugates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-tag or anti-CRD serum. In another experiment, equally anti-tag immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1% SDS, by boiling 5 min. The supernatant was treated with 5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 16 h at 37 °C or mock treated as control. Reactions were analyzed with anti-tag by Western blot. The TcMUC repeats-containing geneMUC-M76 (GenBank accession number L20809) was cloned in pGEX-1λT vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting recombinant protein spanned from the HV region to the conserved C terminus fused with GST. Two complementary oligonucleotides having the sequence encoding the HV region from clones EMUCe-13, EMUCt-15, EMUCt-18 (16Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol.

Their deduced amino acid sequences are AAEGGGQKQENT, SEEGKQET, TASGQKAEQDT, and AESVSQNN, respectively. All of the GST fusion proteins were purified identically by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) following manufacturer's instructions. Their purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and they were quantified using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Gel electrophoresis was performed in 7.5 or 12.5% polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.1% SDS (SDS-PAGE). When needed, gels were prepared for fluorography (29Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR-5 films at −70 °C. For Western blot, parasites were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 50 μm E64 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), at 106 parasites/μl, and 5 × 107 epimastigotes were loaded in each lane. After SDS-PAGE, lysates were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Life Technologies, Inc.), reacted with the appropriate sera, and developed with125I-protein A (NEN Life Science Products). 1 μl containing 200 ng of each indicated recombinant protein in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) was spotted on nitrocellulose filters and air dried. Filters were processed as in Western blots using sera from different infected animals diluted 1/100 and 125I-protein A. Recombinant GST-SAPA (30Pastini A.C. Iglesias S.R. Carricarte V.C. Guerin M.E.

The corresponding alditols were prepared by reduction of 0.2 mmol of disaccharide or trisaccharide in 9/1 methanol/water (10 ml) with NaBH4 (2 mm). The mixture was left overnight at room temperature, and the solution was decationized by elution through a column of Bio-Rad AG 50W-X12 (H+ form) resin. The solvent was evaporated, and the boric acid was eliminated by five successive coevaporations with methanol. The purity of the alditol was checked by TLC. For the preparation of the labeled alditols, 100 μg of the sugars was reduced with 500 μCi of NaB3H4 (NEN Life Science Products) in water for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the addition of unlabeled NaBH4 and processing as above. Analysis by TLC and HPAEC-PAD were performed as described (35Salto M.L. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Lima C. de Lederkremer R.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

Lactose transport is affected by the phosphorylation state of HPr through changes in the activity of the LacS protein as well as expression of the lacS gene. To address whether or not CcpA-HPr(Ser-P)-mediated catabolite control is involved, the levels of LacS were determined under conditions in which the cellular phosphorylation state of HPr greatly differed. It appears that HPr(Ser-P) is mainly present in the exponential phase of growth, whereas HPr(His∼P) dominates in the stationary phase. The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) parallels an increase in LacS level, a drop in lactose and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. Because the Kmout for lactose is higher than that for galactose, the lactose transport capacity decreases as lactose concentration decreases and galactose accumulates in the medium. Our data indicate that S. thermophilus compensates for the diminished transport capacity by synthesizing more LacS and phosphorylating the protein, which results in increased transport activity.

Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of carbohydrates is mediated by the general energy coupling proteins Enzyme I and HPr as well as carbohydrate-specific components (IIA and IIB), of which IIB transfers the phosphoryl group to the carbohydrate that is translocated via IIC. The P-enolpyruvate-dependent Enzyme I-mediated phosphorylation of HPr results in the modification of a histidine residue at position 15 (HPr(His∼P), Ref. 2Weigel N. Powers D.A. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14499-14509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this type of phosphorylation, HPr of Gram-positive bacteria can also be phosphorylated on a serine residue (HPr(Ser-P)) in an ATP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed reaction (3Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Hengstenberg W. Saier Jr., M.H. J.

The reverse reaction, the hydrolysis of HPr(Ser-P) is catalyzed by a cytosolic HPr phosphatase, which is stimulated by high concentrations of phosphate (5Deutscher J. Kessler U. Hengstenberg W. J.

Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 791-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the HPr kinases of Streptococcus salivarius andStreptococcus mutans Ingbritt are not stimulated by glycolytic intermediates (10Thevenot T. Brochu D. Vadeboncoeur C. Hamilton I.R. J.

In Gram-positive bacteria, HPr(Ser-P) plays an important role in the regulation of carbon metabolism through allosteric control of transport systems and as effector of the transcription factor CcpA. HPr(Ser-P) is able to form a complex with CcpA, allowing the transcription factor to bind to catabolite responsive elements (cre-sites), sequences present in the promoter region of catabolite-controlled genes and operons in Gram-positive bacteria (12Hueck C.J. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In S. thermophilus lactose transport is mediated by the LacS protein, which catalyzes heterologous exchange of lactose for intracellularly formed galactose as well as proton motive force (Δp)-driven lactose uptake (13Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LacS is a hybrid protein composed of a polytopic membrane domain and a C-terminal hydrophilic domain of about 180 amino acids (14Poolman B. Royer T.J. Mainzer S.E. Schmidt B.F. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 244-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hydrophilic domain is homologous to IIA protein(s) domains of various PTS systems and can be phosphorylated by HPr(His∼P) (15Gunnewijk M.G.W. Postma P.W. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the IIA domain affects the activity of the lactose transport protein (16Poolman B. Knol J. Mollet B. Nieuwenhuis B.

The phosphorylation state of HPr, however, may also be involved in the regulation oflacS expression as the lac promoter region contains a cre element that could be the site of control oflacS and lacZ expression by the CcpA/HPr(Ser-P) complex. To address whether or not CcpA-HPr(Ser-P)-mediated catabolite control plays a role and to obtain further insight into the regulation of lactose transport, we determined the phosphorylation state of HPr at different stages of growth and correlated these with the expression level and phosphorylation state of LacS.

Plasmid pAG3 carries the ptsI gene of B. subtilis under control of the Taq promoter and is fused in frame with a sequence specifying a N-terminal His tag. For induction of gene expression, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the medium (1 mm) after the culture had reached an OD660 of ∼0.7. The cells were harvested after another 4 h of incubation. For large-scale protein purification, the cells were grown in a 15-liter fermentor (Bio Bench ADI 1065; Applicon, Inc.) with pH controlled at 7.0 and oxygen supply at 50% saturation. The following S. thermophilus strains were used: ST11, wild-type strain with the lacS gene on the chromosome; ST11(ΔlacS)/pGKHis and ST11(ΔlacS)/pGKGS8(H552R), strains in which the chromosomal lacS is deleted, and a copy of the gene is present on the plasmid and under control of the lacSpromoter (16Poolman B.

Growth experiments were performed in batch in a 15-liter fermentor with pH controlled at 6.8. Right-side-out membrane vesicles of S. thermophiluswere isolated as described (21Otto R. Lageveen R.G. Veldkamp H. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 733-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mmK-Hepes, pH 7.0, and resuspended to an OD660 of ∼150 in 50 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.0, plus 10 mmMgSO4. The cell wall was digested with 10 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 37 °C under mild shaking. Cells were lysed following the addition of K2SO4 to 155 mm. After 2 min of incubation at 37 °C, the lysate was diluted 2.5 times with 50 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgSO4 plus DNase and RNase (100 μg/ml each) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After 30 min of centrifugation at 48,200 × g (4 °C), the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, and further steps were performed as described previously. Membrane preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen. Purification of HPr and LacS from S. thermophilus and Enzyme I from B. subtilis were performed as described in Ref. 17Gunnewijk M.G.W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34080-34085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. For the purification of LacS, right-side-out membrane vesicles of S. thermophilusST11(ΔlacS)/pGKHis were used that were prepared in K-Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, as described above. Samples of 250 ml were withdrawn from a culture of S. thermophilus, and growth was stopped by addition of chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml). The cellular HPr levels were stabilized by adjusting the pH to 4.5 with 10 m HCl and addition of gramicidin D (40 μm) as described by Vadeboncoeuret al. (22Vadeboncoeur C. Brochu D. Reizer J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (6 min, 10,000 ×g), the cells were resuspended in 20 mmNa-acetate, pH 4.5, to a final protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Cells were ruptured by sonication with an amplitude of 10 μm (5 × 15 s with intervals of 45 s) on ice, and cell debris and membranes were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 280,000 ×g. The different species of HPr were quantified after the proteins were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE; 15% polyacrylamide). The HPr species were visualized by immunodetection, and the relative levels of the different HPr species were determined by densitometry. As HPr(Ser-P) and HPr(His∼P) have identical electrophoretic mobilities on native-PAGE, the two species were discriminated by boiling a fraction of the samples for 3 min prior to electrophoresis. Unlike HPr(Ser-P), HPr(His∼P) is not stable under these conditions and converted into HPr. Phosphorylation of LacS was determined quantitatively by coupling the P-enolpyruvate to pyruvate conversion, resulting from the phosphoryl transfer to Enzyme I, HPr, and LacS, to the reduction of pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (23Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mixtures containing lactate dehydrogenase (0.1 mg/ml), purified Enzyme I from B. subtilis (1 μm) and HPr fromS. thermophilus (5 μm) were incubated for 2 min with purified LacS (≥10 μm) in 50 mmKPi, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm NADH plus 0.05% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 150 μl. The phosphorylation reaction was started by addition of P-enolpyruvate to a final concentration of 1 mm. The oxidation of NADH (ε340NADH = 6.3 × 103 liter mol−1cm−1) was measured at 340 nm and a temperature of 20 °C. Control experiments showed that the P-enolpyruvate concentration was sufficient to keep Enzyme I and HPr in their phosphorylated state, and neither lactate dehydrogenase nor NADH was limiting for the reaction. The presence of 0.05% Triton X-100 in the assay buffer did not affect the activity of either Enzyme I or HPr significantly. The activities of Enzyme I, HPr kinase, and HPr phosphatase activities in cell-free extracts were measured by following the fate of the different species in time. Cell-free extracts were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 10 mm FBP and/or 5 mm ATP, 5 mmP-enolpyruvate, 50 mm Pi, or without any additions (see legend to Fig. 2 for details). The phosphorylation state of HPr was analyzed by native-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) as described above, and the proteins were detected by immunodetection.Figure 3HPr species, level of expression and extent of phosphorylation of LacS in S. thermophilusST11ΔlacS/pGKhis at different stages of growth.

For the analysis of the different HPr species, the medium and the cytosol of the cells were acidified to pH 4.5, directly after sample withdrawal, and cell-free extracts were prepared in 20 mm Na Acetate, pH 4.5, at 4 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Part of the cell-free extracts was boiled for 3 min (indicated by +), and untreated and boiled fractions were loaded onto a native-PAGE gel (15% polyacrylamide, 30 μl of cell-free extract/lane) for electrophoresis. The different HPr species were visualized by immunodetection. The arrows point to the different species of HPr, and the boxes highlight the species after boiling; that is when all the singly phosphorylated species correspond to HPr(Ser-P). For the analysis of the LacS expression levels, the samples were washed with 50 mmK-Hepes, pH7.0, and right-side-out membrane vesicles were prepared. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide, 6 μg of protein/lane) and LacS was visualized by immunodetection. The relative levels of HPr(His∼P) (▪), HPr(Ser-P) (▴), and LacS (▨) are shown in D. The ratio of the HPr species in each sample was determined by comparing the HPr species in the untreated fraction with those in the boiled fraction. Corrections were made for the presence of HPr(Ser-P/His∼P), which converts to HPr(Ser-P) upon boiling. The total HPr level was set to 100% for each fraction. For the determination of the relative level of LacS expression, the intensity of sample 6 was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Stability of HPr species.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Culture supernatant was obtained by rapid filtration of cells on a 0.2-μm filter (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Analysis of the samples before and after treatment with β-galactosidase enabled a distinction between the residual lactose and formed galactose. Immunodetection of LacS was performed with antibodies raised against the IIA domain of LacS (15Gunnewijk M.G.W. Postma P.W. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas antibodies raised against HPr of S. salivarius were used to detect the corresponding protein of S. thermophilus. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), and, subsequently, they were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic blotting. The Western-lightTM chemiluminesence detection kit was used to visualize the proteins (Tropix Inc.). Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The concentration of purified HPr and LacS was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using molar extinction coefficients of 1.4 × 104m−1 cm−1 for HPr and of 7.6 × 104m−1 cm−1 for LacS. For LacS, corrections were made for free and bound Triton X-100 by determining the absorbance at 280 and 290 and using an experimentally determinedA 280/A 290 ratio. Protein concentrations of membrane vesicles or cell-free extracts were determined by the Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) resin was from Qiagen, Inc.; Bio-Beads SM-2 and Bio-Spin columns were from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; S- and DEAE-Sepharose fast flow resins, PD-10 and MonoQ columns (HR 16/10), and Triton X-100 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ultrafiltration cells were from Amicon, Inc.; lactate dehydrogenase from hog muscle was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; sGDH and PQQ were generously provided by Prof. J. A. Duine from the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands; β-galactosidase of E. coli was from Sigma. All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. The relative levels of all HPr species (HPr(Ser-P), HPr(His∼P), HPr(Ser-P/His∼P) and HPr) inS. thermophilus ST11 were determined at different stages of growth. A typical growth experiment of S. thermophilus ST11 in medium with 0.5% lactose is shown in Fig.1 A. The sample identification (1 to 6) denotes the times at which the samples were withdrawn from the culture. To prevent changes in the relative levels of HPr species caused by the activity of Enzyme I, HPr(Ser) kinase, and/or HPr phosphatases, the medium and the cytosol of the cells were acidified instantaneously to pH 4.5 after withdrawal of the samples from the culture. To bring the cytosol to pH 4.5, the ionophore gramicidin D was added together with the acid quench. To test whether or not the levels of the HPr species were arrested under these conditions, the different species of HPr were analyzed in the cell extract at pH 4.5 in the presence or absence of ATP plus FBP, P-enolpyruvate or Pi, the substrates/effectors of HPr(Ser) kinase, Enzyme I, and HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the different HPr species present in S. thermophilusharvested at late exponential stage of growth, that is HPr and the phosphorylated species HPr(His∼P) and HPr(Ser-P), which have identical electrophoretic mobilities in native PAGE gels. Distinction between the two species was made by boiling a fraction of each sample for 3 min before the electrophoresis. Because HPr(His∼P) is heat labile in contrast to HPr(Ser-P), the former species should only be observed in the unboiled sample, whereas HPr(Ser-P) should still be present in the boiled sample. As shown in Fig. 2, the ratio of the two bands (HPr and HPr(His∼P) plus HPr(Ser-P)) was not affected upon addition of ATP plus FBP, P-enolpyruvate, or Pi. The same was true when the samples were boiled before electrophoresis, showing that the HPr/HPr(Ser-P) ratio remained constant under the different incubation conditions (data not shown). This indicates that the HPr-modifying enzymes are inactive at pH 4.5. If, however, the cell extracts were analyzed for these enzymatic activities at pH 7.0, the HPr species were converted to the corresponding phosphorylated or unphosphorylated forms when respectively, ATP plus FBP, P-enolpyruvate, or Pi was added (data not shown). At higher pH, in conclusion, pH 8.5, HPr(Ser-P) was unstable and Enzyme I was still able to phosphorylate HPr. Although HPr(His∼P) of E. coli is known to be acid labile (27Mattoo R.L. Ramji L. Waygood E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), HPr(His∼P) as well as HPr(Ser-P) and HPr(Ser-P/His∼P) of S. thermophilus are stable for at least 1 h when kept at pH 4.5 on ice. Fig. 1 B shows the relative levels of HPr species in cells withdrawn from the growth culture at the indicated time points (the numbering corresponds to the arrows in A). Until the mid-exponential phase of growth, the main phosphorylated species of HPr is HPr(Ser-P) (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). The level of HPr(Ser-P) decreased at later times and an accompanying increase of HPr(His∼P) was observed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 to4). The double phosphorylated form of HPr (HPr(Ser-P/His∼P)) was observed at low levels (maximally 5% of total HPr present). The relative levels of HPr(Ser-P) and HPr(His∼P) are also plotted in Fig. 1 D and a very similar growth dependence as a function of growth was observed in six independent experiments. As the rapid quench method prohibited careful adjustments of the extract volumes to identical protein quantities, the total amount of HPr loaded in each lane was not identical. Control experiments showed that the level of HPr did not change as a function of growth phase. From the experiments with S. thermophilus ST11, we conclude that the transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) already starts in the mid-exponential phase of growth. The relative levels of HPr species were also determined in S. thermophilus ST11ΔlacS/pGKhis, a strain in which thelacS gene is overexpressed by using a low copy number plasmid (Fig. 3). The basal LacS levels in S. thermophilus ST11ΔlacS/pGKhis in the mid-exponential phase of growth are approximately 40-fold higher than in the wild-type ST11 strain. In S. thermophilusST11ΔlacS/pGKhis, the transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) occurred in the late- rather than in the mid-exponential phase of growth (Fig. 3 B; lane 5). Similar results were obtained with S. thermophilusST11ΔlacS/pGKGS8(H552R), a LacS mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by HPr(His∼P) as the active-site histidine is replaced by an arginine (data not shown). Thus, major catabolic changes associated with the transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) are taking place at much later stages in growth when the basal level of LacS expression is (artificially) increased. Next, we investigated whether the LacS expression levels correlated with the presence of HPr(Ser-P) in the cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, and observed in several independent experiments, the level of LacS increased after the culture reached the mid-exponential phase of growth. At stationary phase, the expression level was 11 times higher than the basal LacS level at the early-exponential phase of growth (Fig. 1 D). Consistent with a higher basal level of LacS in S. thermophilusST11ΔlacS/pGKhis, the increase in expression was less than 2-fold when early-exponential and late-exponential or stationary phase were compared (Fig. 3). Importantly, the increase in expression paralleled a decrease in HPr(Ser-P) and occurred at later steps of growth than in the wild-type ST11 strain. Overall, the data from five experiments indicate that the time point of transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) is dependent on the basal level of LacS expression. The final level of LacS in ST11ΔlacS/pGKhis was approximately 7-fold (700% in Fig. 3 A) higher than in ST11 (100% in Fig.1 D). In a previous publication (15Gunnewijk M.G.W. Postma P.W. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the purified IIA domain of LacS could be phosphorylated by HPr(His∼P) from S. thermophilus. As the HPr(His∼P) levels vary with growth, one would expect that the phosphorylation state of LacS differs as well. The phosphorylation state of LacS was measured spectrophotometrically from the formation of pyruvate using lactate dehydrogenase as coupling enzyme. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of P-enolpyruvate resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of Enzyme I and HPr, observed as an absorbance decrease due to NADH oxidation, which was followed by a slow auto-oxidation of NADH that was independent of P-enolpyruvate, Enzyme I, and HPr (data not shown). The phosphoryl transfer from P-enolpyruvate to Enzyme I and HPr occurred within the mixing time of the experiment. When purified LacS was added together with Enzyme I and HPr, the addition of P-enolpyruvate resulted in an additional kinetic component that corresponds to the phosphoryl transfer from HPr(His∼P) to LacS (Fig. 4, lower curve). These data show that phosphorylation of LacS is orders of magnitude slower than that of Enzyme I and HPr, which is consistent with phosphorylation studies on the isolated IIA domain of LacS (15Gunnewijk M.G.W. Postma P.W. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of LacS in S. thermophilusST11ΔlacS/pGKhis was determined for cells that were harvested at different stages of growth. As presented in Table 1, the phosphorylated state of LacS is dominant in the late-exponential phase of growth, whereas at earlier times the largest fraction of the protein was unphosphorylated.Table IPhosphorylation state of LacSSampleOD660Growth PhaseLacS∼P%10.5mid-exponentional2820.7mid-exponentional3061.6early-stationary6871.6late-stationary67Cells of S. thermophilus ST11ΔlacS/pGKhis were grown on 0.5% lactose, and samples were taken as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The phosphorylation status of LacS was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab Cells of S. thermophilus ST11ΔlacS/pGKhis were grown on 0.5% lactose, and samples were taken as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The phosphorylation status of LacS was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4. To determine whether or not substrate limitation of lactose-grown S. thermophilus ST11 is related to the transition in HPr species and the altered expression levels of LacS, the lactose and galactose concentrations were determined during growth. In a previous study, we showed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of lactose-metabolizing S. thermophilus cells, besides lactose only galactose is present in the medium (28Gunnewijk M.G.W. Sulter G. Postma P.W. Poolman B. Molecular Mechanisms of Signaling and Membrane Transport. 101. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg1997: 319-330Google Scholar). The presence of galactose is a direct result of the lactose/galactose exchange mode of transport and the inability ofS. thermophilus to utilize galactose. Both lactose and galactose concentrations were determined in the growth medium at different stages of growth. As shown in Fig.5 A, the lactose concentration decreased and the galactose concentration increased in lactose-growingS. thermophilus ST11 cells, whereas the total sugar concentration remained constant at a concentration of 12.8 ± 0.1 mm. Because the Kmoutfor lactose is rather high and higher than that for galactose (5 mm and 1 mm, respectively; Ref. 29Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33244-33250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the lactose uptake rate will decrease as lactose decreases and galactose accumulates in the medium. Because lactose and galactose interact competitively with LacS protein, one can estimate the transport capacity (V t/V 0) as a function of the external lactose and galactose concentrations: V0Vt=S1S1+Km11+S2Km2Equation 1 in which V 0 is the rate of transport when only lactose is present (maximal activity), whereasV t represents the rate at a given time during growth; S 1 and S 2correspond to the external lactose and galactose concentration, respectively, and Km1 and Km2 correspond to the affinity constants for lactose and galactose. Fig. 5 B shows that the relative transport capacity decreased during growth if one assumes that the expression level of LacS and its activity remain constant. The growth rate, however, is constant up to (120-min time point in Fig. 5 B) where the calculated transport capacity is less than 10%. Within this period the LacS levels and the degree of phosphorylation of the protein increased, indicating that S. thermophilus ST11 is compensating for the reduced transport capacity. The calculated transport capacity corrected for the increase in LacS expression levels during growth is also shown in Fig. 5 B (dotted curve). Notice that phosphorylation of LacS stimulates the transport activity (17Gunnewijk M.G.W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34080-34085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and thereby the transport capacity of the cell, implying that the transport capacity increases even further as growth proceeds. The link between the transport capacity and the LacS expression levels and phosphorylation state of the protein are discussed below. In this paper, we link the level of expression and the extent of phosphorylation of the lactose transport protein of S. thermophilus to the phosphorylation state of HPr. Because the promoter region of the lac operon of S. thermophilus comprises a catabolite repression element, we anticipated a role for HPr(Ser-P) in CcpA-mediated regulation oflacS transcription. The presence of an IIA-like domain at the C terminus of LacS suggested a role for HPr(His∼P)-mediated regulation of the lactose transport activity, for which the evidence is presented in Ref. 17Gunnewijk M.G.W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34080-34085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. Our data show that in S. thermophilus ST11, HPr(Ser-P) is the major phosphorylated HPr species in the exponential phase of growth, whereas HPr(His∼P) dominates in the late exponential and stationary phase. The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) parallels an increase in LacS level, an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of LacS, a drop in lactose, and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. The observation that the phosphorylated forms of HPr (HPr(His∼P) and HPr(Ser-P)) dominate at different stages of growth in S. thermophilus is in agreement with results obtained for S. salivarius andS. mutans (22Vadeboncoeur C. Brochu D. Reizer J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Why do the levels of HPr species vary when the growth of the organisms still proceeds at μmax? In the case of S. thermophilus, lactose metabolism is initiated by the uptake of lactose via LacS, which has a relatively poor affinity for the substrate at the outer surface of the membrane. Moreover, as galactose (the end product of metabolism) accumulates in the medium, the transport capacity decreases even with millimolar concentrations of lactose available. This will at some point during growth be reflected in a reduced glycolytic activity, to which the HPr(Ser-P)/HPr(His∼P) ratio is very sensitive (4Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Hengstenberg W. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Deutscher J. Kessler U. Hengstenberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Reizer J. Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1989; 71: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Deutscher J. Engelman R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 23: 57-162Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A decrease in HPr(Ser-P) concentration will relieve the catabolite repression of thelacS promoter and as a result more LacS is synthesized. At the same time the concentration of HPr(His∼P) increases, resulting in phosphorylation of the LacS protein. In Ref. 17Gunnewijk M.G.W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34080-34085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, we show that this phosphorylation increases the specific exchange activity of the LacS protein. The picture that thus emerges for lactose metabolism is the following (summarized in Fig. 6):S. thermophilus maintains the transport capacity high at relatively adverse lactose/galactose ratios by synthesizing more LacS and stimulating the transport activity. The tuning of lactose transport to the needs of catabolism is mediated by the phosphorylation state of HPr. Some aspects of the scheme (Fig. 6) and the proposed regulation mechanism deserve further explanation. First, the correlation between LacS levels and the concentration of different HPr species is observed in cells with low and high basal levels of LacS. The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) is shifted to later stages of growth when more LacS is present, strongly suggesting that the two parameters are directly linked. Second, both HPr(His∼P) and HPr(Ser-P) are affected by the concentrations of different glycolytic intermediates. The end product of glycolysis, P-enolpyruvate, is a substrate of Enzyme I and in the absence of PTS substrates the HPr(His∼P)/HPr ratio is determined by the P-enolpyruvate/pyruvate ratio. ATP and early glycolytic intermediates are effectors of HPr(Ser) kinase, whereas Pi is an inhibitor. Moreover, HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase is stimulated by Pi and inhibited by ATP (3Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Hengstenberg W. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Deutscher J. Kessler U. Hengstenberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Reizer J. Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1989; 71: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thirdly, the FBP, ATP, Pi, and P-enolpyruvate levels have not been measured in S. thermophilus, but it has been firmly established for lactic acid bacteria that FBP and ATP levels are relatively high in rapidly metabolizing cells, whereas Piand P-enolpyruvate are low under these conditions. These latter compounds become high at the end of the exponential phase of growth and remain high in the stationary phase (8Mason P.W. Carbone D.P. Cushman R.A. Waggoner A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thompson J. Torchia D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 791-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Konings W.N. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 16: 419-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These physiological parameters form the basis for the proposed changes in enzyme activity when the glycolytic activity decreases. Fourth, although FBP is an allosteric activator of the HPr(Ser) kinase of most low GC Gram-positive bacteria (32Saier Jr, M.H. Chauvaux S. Cook G.M. Deutscher J. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Ye J-J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), no such activation was observed for the enzyme of S. thermophilus and S. salivarius (11Brochu D. Vadeboncoeur C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that serine phosphorylation of HPr in cell extracts ofS. thermophilus was stimulated upon addition of ATP, and HPr(Ser-P) dephosphorylation was stimulated by Pi, whereas the presence of FBP had no effect on the activity HPr(Ser-P) kinase (data not shown). We thus propose that the level of HPr(Ser-P) in S. thermophilus is governed by the relative cellular concentrations of ATP and Pi, which are indicators of the energy status of the cells. Therefore, when the lactose transport capacity diminishes, the accompanying decrease in glycolytic activity will result in a drop in ATP and an increase in Piconcentrations, which in turn will decrease the concentration of HPr(Ser-P) as a result of the diminished HPr(Ser-P) kinase activity and the stimulated HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase activity (Fig. 6). Fifth,lacS expression is no longer repressed in aCcpa − mutant of S. thermophilus. 2P. T. C. van den Bogaard, M. Kleerebezem, O. P. Kuipers, and W. M. de Vos, submitted for publication. Sixth, the regulation of lactose uptake involves a fast response affected by phosphorylation of the LacS protein and a slow response, which follows from the relieve of inhibition of transcription by the CcpA/HPr(Ser-P) complex. We conclude that this dual regulation in which the phosphorylated state of HPr has a central role and controls the lactose transport capacity is an important mechanism for S. thermophilus in which to adjust the lactose uptake rate to its metabolic needs.

https://openalex.org/W2009224731,"In order to understand the dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal environment, we investigated the role of Ca(2+), Zn(2+), and ATP on conformational changes of calreticulin. Purified calreticulin was digested with trypsin in the presence or absence of Ca(2+), Zn(2+), and ATP. At low Ca(2+) concentration (<100 micrometer), calreticulin is rapidly and fully degraded by trypsin, indicating that under these conditions the protein is in a highly trypsin-susceptible conformation. Increasing Ca(2+) concentration up to 500 micrometer or 1 mm resulted in protection of the full-length calreticulin and in generation of the 27-kDa fragment highly resistant to trypsin digestion. The 27-kDa protease-resistant core of the protein represented the NH(2)-terminal half of calreticulin and was identified by its reactivity with specific antibodies and by NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Ca(2+)-dependent changes in calreticulin's sensitivity to proteolysis indicate that agonist-induced fluctuation in the free ER luminal Ca(2+) concentration may affect the protein conformation and function. Trypsin digestion of calreticulin in the presence of Zn(2+) resulted in the formation of a 17-kDa central protease-resistant core in the protein corresponding to the central region of the protein, indicating that under these conditions the N- and C-domains of the protein are in an extended conformation. Here we also show that calreticulin is an ATP-binding protein but that it does not contain detectable ATPase activity. Digestion of the protein with trypsin in the presence of Mg(2+)-ATP protects the full-length protein. These results indicate that calreticulin may undergo frequent, ion-induced conformation changes, which may affect its function and its ability to interact with other proteins in the lumen of the ER."

Whereas p16(INK4a) antagonizes the activities of cyclin D-dependent kinases, p19(ARF) activates the p53 transcription factor. Immortalized rodent fibroblast cell lines that lack INK4a/ARF function, ARF alone, or p53 are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of oncogenic Ras and instead continue to proliferate and undergo morphological transformation. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking Cip1 and Kip1 genes encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 were used to further explore the effects of oncogenic Ras on arrest of the cell division cycle. Although early passage primary fibroblast strains that lack both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) fail to assemble cyclin D-dependent kinases, oncogenic Ras retained its ability to induce p19(ARF), but not p16(INK4a), protecting Cip/Kip-null cells from proliferating and undergoing transformation. Under these conditions, Ras did not induce G(1) phase arrest but instead triggered DNA synthesis, abnormal nuclear divisions, failure of cytokinesis, and emergence of polyploid cells. Therefore, in the absence of p16(INK4a), p21(Cip1), and p27(Kip1), oncogenic Ras affects the functions of genes required for completion of the cell cycle."

The lactose/galactose exchange reaction is the most relevant mode of transport as galactose is an end product of metabolism, and this reaction is more rapid than lactose/H+ symport. The LacS of S. thermophilusconsists of a polytopic membrane-embedded translocator domain and a C-terminal hydrophilic IIA-like domain that has been shown to be phosphorylated on His-552 by HPr(His∼P), a general energy coupling protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS, Refs. 1Poolman B.

By entrapping P-enolpyruvate, Enzyme I plus HPr, inside the lumen of membrane vesicles harboring LacS, for substrate levels below the apparent affinity constant (K m) for transport, Δp-driven uptake of lactose is partially inhibited upon phosphorylation of the protein (1Poolman B.

In addition to histidine phosphorylation of HPr by Enzyme I with P-enolpyruvate as phosphoryl donor (3Weigel N. Powers D.A. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14499-14509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HPr in Gram-positive bacteria can also be reversibly phosphorylated on a serine residue, yielding HPr(Ser-P), by a metabolite-activated ATP-dependent protein kinase and a HPr(Ser-P) phosphatase (4Deutscher J. Saier Jr., H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Deutscher J. Kessler U. Hengstenberg W. J.

Moreover, the doubly phosphorylated species, HPr(Ser-P/His∼P), is also found in Gram-positive bacteria. The various species of HPr in S. thermophilus growing on the non-PTS sugar lactose have recently been quantified at different stages of growth (22Gunnewijk M.G.W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HPr(Ser-P) was found to be the dominant phosphorylated species in the exponential phase of growth, whereas HPr(His∼P) dominated in the stationary phase. The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) paralleled the decrease in lactose and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. Because of the decrease in lactose/galactose ratio in the medium, the transport capacity of the cell will decrease as growth proceeds. The apparent decrease in lactose transport capacity, however, is compensated by an increase in LacS expression levels, which is caused by the release of HPr(Ser-P)/CcpA-mediated inhibition of lacS transcription. The increase in HPr(His∼P) at the late-exponential phase of growth paralleled an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of LacS, which could be another means to regulate the transport capacity of the cell. To obtain further insight into the regulation of lactose transport activity upon phosphorylation of LacS, we report here our studies with purified LacS reconstituted into proteoliposomes with the IIA domain facing outwards. To effectively phosphorylate LacS, the native HPr from S. thermophilus was purified and used as a phosphoryl donor. Escherichia coli NM522/pAG3 (7Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M.

Membrane preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen. Cells of S. thermophilusST11(ΔlacS)/pGKHis were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mmMgSO4, following the procedure described under “Isolation of Membranes.” The cytosolic protein fraction was collected after removal of cell debris and membranes (48,200 × g; 4 °C). NaCl was added to a final concentration of 70 mm, and the sample was loaded onto a S-Sepharose column (fast flow) to remove the lysozyme. Both the S- and DEAE-Sepharose columns used hereafter were equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, plus 70 mm NaCl.

After washing with 5 column volumes of the same buffer, proteins were eluted with a 15–80 mmNaCl gradient (240 ml) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. HPr eluted at approximately 55 mm NaCl. Fractions containing HPr were pooled, desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and concentrated to about 5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration in an Amicon cell with an YM1 membrane. Purified HPr samples were stored at −80 °C. Enzyme I from B. subtilis was purified from E. coli NM522/pAG3.

Briefly, right-side-out membrane vesicles (5 mg/ml) of S. thermophilusST11(ΔlacS)/pGKHis were solubilized on ice for 20 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl plus 10% (w/v) glycerol. Further steps were the same as described previously. To obtain proteoliposomes with the IIA domain facing outwards, the reconstitution was performed with Triton X-100-treated preformed liposomes that were composed of E. coli lipids and l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk in a ratio of 3:1 (w/w) (12Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LacS was incorporated into the liposomes at a protein to lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The proteoliposomes were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 2 mm MgSO4 (KPM buffer) with or without 10 mm lactose if not indicated otherwise and frozen in 1-ml aliquots in liquid nitrogen. All transport assays were carried out with mild magnetic stirring at 30 °C. The transport reactions were stopped at different time intervals by dilution of the samples with 2 ml of 100 mm LiCl and rapid filtering on 0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry after dissolving the filters in 2 ml of scintillation fluid (Emulsifier Scintillator Plus™, Packard Inc). Proteoliposomes in KPM plus 10 mm lactose were allowed to thaw slowly at room temperature after which they were extruded through a 400-nm polycarbonate filter to convert the membranes into unilaminar vesicles. Proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation (20 min at 280,000 × g, 15 °C) and resuspended in KPM plus 10 mm lactose to about 1.3 mg/ml LacS. Aliquots of 2-μl (or 1-μl) proteoliposome suspensions (∼1 mg/ml) were diluted into 200 μl of KPM containing 3.6 μm [14C]lactose. When necessary, different concentrations of unlabeled lactose were added to the KPM buffer to increase the external lactose concentration. The components needed to phosphorylate LacS were added to the assay buffer and to the concentrated proteoliposomes 5 min prior to the initiation of the uptake assay as described below. Δp-driven lactose uptake was performed as described by Foucaud and Poolman (13Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were prepared in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mmpotassium acetate (KAc) plus 2 mm MgSO4 as described above. Aliquots of 2-μl proteoliposome suspensions (∼1 mg/ml LacS) were diluted into 200 μl of 120 mm NaPipes, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 μmvalinomycin plus 3.6 μm [14C]lactose and different concentrations of cold lactose. Phosphorylation of membrane-reconstituted LacS protein was effected by incubation of the proteoliposomes (LacS concentration of ∼1 mg/ml, which is ∼14 μm) with Enzyme I purified from B. subtilis (1 μm), HPr purified from S. thermophilus (25 μm) plus P-enolpyruvate (5 mm). For the control experiments, one or more of these components was omitted from the mixture. Incubations were performed in KPM plus 10 mm lactose for lactose counterflow or in 20 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 100 mm KAc plus 2 mm MgSO4 for Δp-driven uptake of lactose. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the proteoliposomes were diluted 100-fold into KPM containing 3.6 μm[14C]lactose (for lactose counterflow) or into 120 mm NaPipes, pH 7.0, 2 mmMgSO4, 1 μm valinomicyn plus 3.6 μm [14C]lactose (for Δp-driven lactose uptake) containing Enzyme I, HPr, and/or P-enolpyruvate at concentrations of 1 μm, 10 μm, and 5 mm, respectively. Adjustments were made for buffer components because of dilution as a result of Enzyme I, HPr, and/or P-enolpyruvate additions. To determine the fraction of LacS with the IIA domain facing outwards, proteoliposomes (1–2 μm) were incubated with 5.3 μm [14C]P-enolpyruvate, 0.6 μm Enzyme I plus 1.7 μm HPr in the presence or absence of 0.5% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-multoside. Following the addition of [14C]P-enolpyruvate, [14C]pyruvate is formed in amounts equivalent to the quantities of Enzyme I, HPr plus LacS. In the absence of DDM, only inside-out reconstituted LacS is phosphorylated, whereas in the presence of DDM all LacS is phosphorylated. The pyruvate burst experiments were carried out in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2 plus 5 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C, and [14C]pyruvate determination and [14C]P-enolpyruvate synthesis were performed as described by Robillard and Blaauw (14Robillard G.T. Blaauw M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5796-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HPr by Enzyme I or HPr(Ser) kinase was carried out as described in Ref. 7Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M. Stulke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar. A typical assay consisted of 3 μg of HPr purified from S. thermophilus in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus 10 mm MgSO4 in a total volume of 20 μl, which was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μg of Enzyme I purified from B. subtilis plus 5 mmP-enolpyruvate or with 0.5 μg of HPr(Ser) kinase purified fromB. subtilis plus 10 mm fructase 1,b-bis phosphate (FBP) and 5 mm ATP. HPr phosphorylation was analyzed by separating the different species of HPr on non-denaturing PAGE (15% polyacrylamide), and the proteins were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of gels were performed as described previously (2Gunnewijk M.G.W. Postma P.W. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of purified HPr and LacS was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using molar extinction coefficients of 1.4 × 104m−1 cm−1 for HPr and of 7.6 × 104m−1 cm−1 for LacS. In the case of LacS, corrections were made for free and bound Triton X-100 by determining the absorbance at 280 and 290 and using experimentally determinedA 280/A 290 ratios for the protein in Triton X-100 or free detergent. Protein concentrations of membrane vesicles, Enzyme I and HPr(Ser) kinase were determined by the Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Analysis of amino acid composition was performed on an Applied Biosystems 476A sequencer by the Biotechnology Laboratory (N.A.P.S.), University of British Columbia, Canada. d-[glucose-1-14C]Lactose (2.11 TBq/mol) was obtained from the radiochemical center, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom. Ni2+-NTA resin was from Qiagen, Inc.; Bio-Beads SM-2 and Bio-Spin columns were from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; S- and DEAE-Sepharose fast flow resins, PD-10 and MonoQ columns (HR 16/10), and Triton X-100 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein concentration was performed in concentration cells and centricons from Amicon, Inc.; total E. coli lipids and egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. To study P-enolpyruvate-dependent Enzyme I/HPr-mediated regulation of the lactose transport protein of S. thermophilus, Enzyme I of B. subtilis and HPr and LacS of S. thermophilus were purified to homogeneity (Fig.1 A). Enzyme I and LacS were purified by metal affinity chromatography whereas HPr was purified by a combination of anion and cation exchange chromatography. The yield of HPr was 1.1 mg of protein from 1 liter of S. thermophilusharvested at an OD660 of 2. The N terminus of purified HPr from S. thermophilus was analyzed, and the sequence of the first 51 amino acids was determined:1MASKDFHIVAETGIHARPATLLVQTASKFASDITLEYKGKAVNLKSIMGVM51. This amino acid sequence is identical to the N-terminal sequence of HPr from Streptococcas mutans and S. salivarius except for the glutamate residue at position 36, which is variable among HPr proteins purified from Gram-positive bacteria (15Dashper S.G Kirszbaum L. Huq L.N. Riley P.F. Reynolds E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 16Vadeboncoeur C. Konishi Y. Dumas F. Gauthier L. Frenette M. Biochimie (Paris ). 1991; 73: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The predicted Enzyme I and HPr(Ser) kinase phosphorylation sites, His-15 and Ser-46, are both present in the HPr protein fromS. thermophilus. As anticipated and shown in Fig.1 B, purified HPr was phosphorylated by Enzyme I in the presence of P-enolpyruvate (lane 2) and by HPr(Ser) kinase in the presence of ATP (lane 3). Phosphorylation of both the histidine residue and the serine residue (HPr(Ser-P)(His∼P)) was observed when P-enolpyruvate/Enzyme I and ATP/HPr(Ser) kinase were present together (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The purification procedure yielded two forms of HPr, HPr-1 and HPr-2, which had different mobilities in Tris-containing non-denaturing PAGE gels, and both were phosphorylated by Enzyme I as well by HPr(Ser) kinase (Fig. 1 B). HPr-1 was separated from HPr-2 as the two HPr forms eluted from the Mono-Q column at different NaCl concentrations, that is about 50 and 60 mm, respectively (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of both HPr forms revealed that HPr-1 differed from HPr-2 by the absence of the N-terminal methionine residue. The physiological relevance of this N-terminal methionine cleavage of HPr is unclear as the functional properties (degree of phosphorylation in growing cells, kinetics of phosphorylation) of HPr-1 and HPr-2 were identical (data not shown). The ratio of HPr-1/HPr-2 inS. thermophilus growing exponentially on lactose was 3.4 and decreased to 3.0 in stationary phase cells. When the cells were grown on the PTS sugar sucrose, the ratio of HPr-1/HPr-2 was 2.2 irrespective of the phase of growth. Pyruvate-burst experiments were used to evaluate whether or not membrane-reconstituted LacS was phosphorylated by HPr(His∼P).The previously established unidirectional reconstitution of the LacS protein in liposomes (10Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Knol J. Sjollema K. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16410-16415Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was confirmed by the pyruvate-burst assay (data not shown). In fact, the amount of [14C]pyruvate produced was maximal and not significantly different in the presence or absence of detergent. This shows that >95% of all LacS molecules are incorporated with the IIA domain facing outwards and are phosphorylated by HPr(His∼P). The effect of phosphorylation on the activity of LacS protein was studied for both lactose counterflow and lactose/H+ symport modes of transport. For counterflow activity, the proteoliposomes were equilibrated with 10 mm lactose and diluted into a buffer with tracer amounts of radiolabeled lactose. This resulted in a rapid and transient accumulation of [14C]lactose, of which the kinetics of uptake over the first 4 min is shown (Fig.2 A). When the proteoliposomes were pre-incubated with P-enolpyruvate, HPr, or a combination of these components, the lactose uptake via LacS was similar to that of control samples. On the contrary, when LacS was pre-incubated with P-enolpyruvate and Enzyme I plus HPr, a condition that results in phosphorylation of the transport protein, the lactose uptake via LacS was increased by approximately 3-fold. These data indicate that HPr(His∼P)-mediated phosphorylation of LacS stimulates the counterflow activity of LacS. The apparent stimulation of LacS counterflow activity was studied in more detail by analyzing the transport reaction as a function of the external lactose concentration (Fig. 2 B). The initial rates of lactose uptake were measured under conditions where LacS was phosphorylated or not phosphorylated. The maximal uptake rate (V max) was increased by a factor of 2, whereas the affinity constant for transport was somewhat lower when LacS was in the phosphorylated state. The effect of phosphorylation on the Δp-driven lactose uptake was studied in proteoliposomes in which an artificial membrane potential was generated by means of a valinomycin-mediated K+ diffusion potential and a pH gradient was generated by an outward-directed acetate diffusion gradient. LacS was phosphorylated by pre-incubation of the proteoliposomes with P-enolpyruvate, Enzyme I plus HPr. The control sample contained only P-enolpyruvate (unphosphorylated LacS). The corresponding compounds were also present in the buffer in which the transport reaction was assayed. Fig.3 shows the initial lactose uptake rates at different lactose concentrations for both conditions. Upon phosphorylation of LacS, the Δp-driven lactose uptake rate at low lactose concentrations was somewhat decreased, which is in agreement with earlier findings (1Poolman B. Knol J. Mollet B. Nieuwenhuis B. Sulter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The V max of uptake was similar for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated LacS. The data indicate that HPr(His∼P)-mediated phosphorylation of LacS results in a 2-fold increase in the apparent affinity constant (Kmapp) for Δp-driven lactose transport. In this study, we report on the regulation of the lactose transport protein of S. thermophilus through HPr(His∼P)-mediated phosphorylation. The regulation was studiedin vitro using purified Enzyme I and HPr and proteoliposomes in which the LacS protein was present in the inside-out orientation. This in vitro membrane system is most suitable for our studies as phosphorylation of LacS could easily be manipulated by the addition of P-enolpyruvate, Enzyme I, and/or HPr to the outside medium. As the proteoliposomes are well sealed and maintain ion-gradients over long periods of time, it was possible to measure accurately Δp-driven lactose uptake as well as lactose counterflow. Kinetic analysis of the two transport modes showed that theV max of lactose counterflow was increased by a factor of 2 upon phosphorylation of LacS, whereas the apparent inhibition of Δp-driven uptake appears to be because of an increase of the affinity constant (K m) for uptake. The latter data are consistent with earlier observations in which Δp-driven lactose uptake was studied in hybrid membrane vesicles in which P-enolpyruvate, Enzyme I, plus HPr were present internally and externally and in which a proton motive force was generated by oxidation of cytochrome c via cytochrome coxidase. These experiments were carried out at low lactose concentrations (6 μm) that are far below theK m of transport. As the hybrid membrane vesicles are relatively leaky, it was at that time not possible to perform kinetic analysis of artificial ion gradients driven uptake or counterflow type of transport. These studies have now become possible through development of a more defined and well sealed proteoliposomal system. How can one explain the different effects of LacS phosphorylation on Δp-driven uptake and counterflow activity? According to the kinetic model for lactose transport via LacS (13Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Poolman B. Knol J. Lolkema J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12995-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), lactose counterflow (or exchange) proceeds via binding and release of ligands (lactose and H+) at the inner and outer surface of the membrane, and reorientation of the binding sites via the ternary complex (C:L:H); steps 2 and 2′ in Fig. 4 B. The reorientation of the loaded binding sites is rate-determining under conditions of lactose counterflow (or exchange, Ref. 17Poolman B. Knol J. Lolkema J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12995-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Δp-driven lactose uptake (Fig. 4 A) proceeds via ligand binding at the outer surface (step 1), reorientation of the binding site (step 2), release of ligands at the inner surface (steps 3 and 4), and reorientation of the unloaded binding site (step 5). This latter step is much slower than the reorientation of the ternary complex (step 2) in the counterflow reaction, and consequently lactose counterflow (or exchange) transport is faster than Δp-driven uptake. We now propose that phosphorylation affects the rate constants for the reorientation of the ternary complex, which is rate-determining for counterflow but not for Δp-driven uptake. This step is accelerated upon phosphorylation and, as a result, the counterflow activity is increased. Phosphorylation of LacS has no effect on theV max of Δp-driven uptake as this rate is largely controlled by the reorientation of the unloaded binding site of LacS (Fig. 4, step 5). At this point it is not possible to assign the K m shift to a particular step(s) in the catalytic cycle. Finally, we emphasize that the counterflow transport reported here is equivalent to lactose/galactose exchange in vivo and that this reaction and not the Δp-driven uptake is most relevant in lactose (glycolysing)-metabolizing cells of S. thermophilus. We thus conclude that HPr(His∼P)-mediated phosphorylation of LacS evokes maximal activity of the lactose transport protein in vivo by increasing theV max of the lactose/galactose exchange reaction. In this work, we also report on the presence and purification of two forms of HPr in S. thermophilus. Both HPr forms have similar biochemical properties with respect to phosphorylation by Enzyme I or HPr(Ser-P) kinase and their ability to phosphorylate LacS. HPr-1 differed from HPr-2 by the absence of the N-terminal methionine residue, and HPr-1 was the dominant form when S. thermophilus ST11(ΔlacS)/pGKhis cells were grown on lactose. The presence of different forms of HPr has thus far only been reported for species that belong to the Streptococcus orLactococcus genus (18Vadeboncoeur C. Res. Microbiol. 1995; 146: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ye et al. (19Ye J.J. Reizer J. Cui X. Saier Jr., J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3484-3492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the lactose/H+and glucose/H+ symporters of Lactococcus brevisare regulated by allosteric interaction with HPr(Ser-P). We also tested whether or not the LacS protein was affected by HPr(Ser-P). Up to 5 times excess of HPr(Ser-P) over LacS did not have a specific effect on counterflow activity or Δp-driven uptake. Also the HPr(S46D) mutant that mimics HPr(Ser-P) because of its negative charge at residue 46 did not affect the Δp-driven lactose uptake. 2B. Poolman and J. Reizer, unpublished results. In addition, we tested whether purified IIALacS or purified LacS in the detergent-solubilized state and immobilized to a Ni2+-NTA resin was able to specifically retard the migration of HPr or HPr(Ser-P). Despite the testing of various experimental parameters, we never observed any interaction between IIA or LacS and HPr or HPr(Ser-P). 3M. G. W. Gunnewijk and B. Poolman, unpublished results. We thus have no indication whether the LacS protein is regulated allosterically by HPr(Ser-P). In E. coli the lactose/H+ symport protein (LacY) is regulated by IIAGlc protein. Allosteric interaction of the unphosphorylated form of IIAGlc resulted in an inhibition of lactose uptake, whereas phosphorylated IIAGlcdid not interact with LacY (23Osumi T. Saier Jr., M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Nelson S.O. Wright J.K. Postma P.W. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hoischen C. Levin J. Pitaknarongphorn S. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6082-6086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies have to establish whether it is the phosphorylated form of IIALacSthat stimulates or the unphosphorylated IIALacS that inhibits the translocation reaction mediated by the carrier domain of the LacS protein. Overall, the data indicate that HPr must be in the histidine-phosphorylated state for maximal activity of the lactose transport system of S. thermophilus. This condition is met in cells at the late-exponential and stationary phase of growth (22Gunnewijk M.G.W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34073-34079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P) parallels a decrease in lactose and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. Because the Kmout for lactose is higher than that for galactose (21Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33244-33250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the lactose transport capacity will decrease as lactose decreases and galactose accumulates in the medium. As depicted in Fig. 5, we propose that when lactose uptake becomes limiting for growth, S. thermophilus increases the concentration of the LacS protein by relieving HPr(Ser-P)/CcpA-mediated catabolite repression oflacS transcription, and increasing the activity of the LacS protein by HPr(His∼P)-mediated phosphorylation. The regulation is such that lacS transcription and LacS activity are maximal when the concentration of HPr(Ser-P) is low and HPr(His∼P) is high. This dual regulation causes the lactose transport capacity of S. thermophilus to become attenuated when physiological conditions result in a shift from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His∼P). We thank J.

They are ubiquitously distributed on the surface of most cells and in the extracellular matrix, playing a pivotal role in the assembly and structural integrity of connective tissues (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-271Crossref Google Scholar). GAG are increasingly implicated as important regulators of many biological processes such as cell adhesion and differentiation, cytokine action, and modulation of enzyme catalysis, owing their activities to interactions with various components of cell surfaces and extracellular matrices through specific saccharide sequences (for review, see Refs. 2Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 3Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Since GAG structures vary considerably during normal embryonic development, growth, and aging, in a tissue-specific manner, GAG chain synthesis is thought to be strictly regulated. In addition, GAG chains vary in size and in number during pathological conditions, leading to the alteration of the structural and functional properties of the tissues. GAG chains consist of repeating disaccharide units containing hexosamine and hexuronic acid (or in the case of keratan sulfate, galactose). The biosynthesis of hexuronic acid-containing GAG is initiated by the formation of a common carbohydrate sequence, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-, bound to specific serine residues in the core protein to form the so-called GAG-protein linkage region (1Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing, New York1980: 267-271Crossref Google Scholar). This structure serves as a primer for chain elongation to form either [-4GlcAβ1,4GlcNAcα1-] n , the core polymer in heparan sulfate/heparin, or [-4GlcAβ1,3GalNAcβ1-] n in chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Subsequent modifications of GAG chains by O-sulfation on different positions and by C5-epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid generate a bewildering complexity encoding considerable biological information. Several enzymes involved in the processing of GAG chains have been purified and cloned, such as GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (5Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) andO-sulfotransferases (6Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban B. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the structure and function of the glucuronosyltransferases that are responsible for the assembly of GAG chains. The final biosynthetic step of the common linkage region is catalyzed by a β1,3-glucuronosyltransferase termed GlcAT-I that transfers a glucuronosyl moiety from UDP-glucuronic acid onto the nonreducing end of the second galactose of the trisaccharide primer. Thus, this enzyme plays a gating role in the overall synthesis of hexuronic-GAG chains. Furthermore, Bai et al. (7Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Salimath et al. (8Salimath P.V. Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9164-9168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using synthetic β-d-xyloside precursors added to cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, showed that once glucuronic acid is transferred to the nascent chain, the intermediate product is efficiently consumed by downstream enzymes in the pathway, suggesting that at least in these cells, GlcAT-I may be rate-limiting. A putative involvement of GlcAT-I in the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate epitope HNK1 (human natural killer cell carbohydrate antigen-1, 3OSO3GlcAβ1,3Gal-R) has also been proposed (9Tone Y.

However, attempts to purify GlcAT-I to homogeneity have not been successful due to low concentrations and to the difficulty in solubilizing the enzyme. Recent cloning experiments have yielded human (14Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka O. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

The GlcAT-I sequence is highly homologous with GlcAT-P cDNA coding for a brain enzyme responsible for the formation of HNK-1 determinants (15Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Subfractionation studies of microsomal membranes of chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage indicated that GlcAT-I activity is associated with Golgi network (12Sugumaran S. Katsman M. Silbert J.E. Biochem J. 1998; 329: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Computer-based secondary structure prediction indicates that GlcAT-I shares the common topology of type II membrane proteins, consisting of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a single signal-anchor/transmembrane segment, and a stem region followed by a large luminal C-terminal catalytic domain, characteristic of many other Golgi glycosyltransferases cloned to date. In addition, data base searches allowed to define some general features of the Galβ1,3-glucuronosyltransferase family, in particular the presence of four highly conserved motifs (I–IV) located in the luminal domain of the enzymes (15Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Substrate specificity studies showed that GlcAT-I is selective for substrates that resemble the linkage region trisaccharide, namely Galβ1,3Gal-terminated oligosaccharides. Although the functional expression of human (9Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Imiya K. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Kitagawa H.

To provide further insight into the structure and function of GlcAT-I, we generated a powerful expression system for the expression of wild-type, truncated, and mutant forms of the enzyme in the methyltrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), taking advantage of the absence of endogenous Galβ1,3-glucuronosyltransferase activity in this host cell. Our results provide evidence that either the native membrane-bound or the secreted form of GlcAT-I is organized as functionally active disulfide-bonded dimers. Furthermore, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was combined with chemical modification and cross-linking studies to investigate the putative role of cysteine residues in dimer formation and/or in the catalytic activity of GlcAT-I. Bacterial and yeast culture media were from Difco. Protein assay reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad. T4 DNA ligase and competent Escherichia coli JM109 cells were purchased from Promega (Charbonnières, France). The P. pastoris yeast expression system was from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Restriction enzymes, Vent DNA polymerase, and peptide N-glycosidase F were provided by New England Biolabs (Hitchin, United Kingdom). Uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronic acid (sodium salt) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Galβ1-S-3Gal (Gal-Gal), d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (saccharonolactone), β-glucuronidase (bovine liver), methanol, anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated immunoglobulins, and the sulfhydryl reagent N-phenylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma. Trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, glycine, and dimethyl sulfoxide were provided by Merck, and acetonitrile was from BDH (Poole, UK). The cross-linking reagent 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH) was from Pierce. The human GlcAT-I sequence was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a liver cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using a sense primer (5′-CCATGAAGCTGAAGCTGAAGAACGTGTTTCT-3′) together with an antisense primer (5′-CCATCACACCTCAATTGCTGGGTCTGA-3′) corresponding to the 5′-end and 3′-end of the coding region of GlcAT-I described by Kitagawa et al. (14Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka O. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The PCR was carried out using Vent DNA polymerase, and the PCR fragment was subloned into the SmaI site of pGEM-3Z and then sequenced on both strands. The cDNA sequence obtained was 100% identical to that previously described by Kitagawa et al. (14Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka O. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For the heterologous expression of human GlcAT-I in P. pastoris, the full-length cDNA sequence was modified by PCR to include an EcoRI site and a Kozak consensus sequence at the 5′-end and a XbaI site at the 3′-end, using appropriate oligonucleotides. The modified cDNA was then subcloned into theEcoRI–XbaI sites of the yeast expression vector pPICZB to produce pPICZ-GlcAT-I. A construct coding for GlcAT-I lacking the predicted N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (GlcAT-IΔNT; see Fig. 1) was obtained by PCR amplification using a sense primer containing an EcoRI site, a Kozak sequence and nucleotides 22–45 of the GlcAT-I coding region and an antisense primer comprising a XbaI site, a stop codon, and nucleotides 1005–989 (coding for the last six amino acids of the C-terminus of GlcAT-I). The PCR fragment was subcloned into theEcoRI–XbaI sites of pPICZB to generate pPICZ-GlcAT-IΔNT. A construct for the secretion of the human GlcAT-I in the culture medium of P. pastoris was designed by the fusion of the yeast prepro-α-factor secretion leader peptide (N-terminal signal peptide and proregion sequence) with the sequence coding for GlcAT-I lacking the predicted N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain (GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD; see Fig.1) by simple overlapping ends PCR (16Tolov A.A. Shabarova Z.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3983-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sequence coding for the yeast α-factor secretion signal was amplified using pPIC9 vector (Invitrogen) as template and a sense primer containing anEcoRI site, a Kozak consensus sequence, and nucleotides 1–23 of α-factor coding region together with an antisense chimeric primer corresponding to nucleotides 93–76 of GlcAT-I followed by nucleotides 255–238 of α-factor (corresponding to the last six amino acid residues of the prepro-α-factor secretion leader peptide). The sequence coding for GlcAT-I lacking 25 N-terminal amino acids (GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD) was amplified using a sense primer containing nucleotides 76–96 together with an antisense primer comprising a XbaI site, a stop codon, and nucleotides 1005–989 of GlcAT-I. The chimeric sequence coding for the yeast prepro-α-factor secretion leader peptide fused to GlcAT-I deleted from the N-terminal signal anchor region (25 amino acid residues) was then obtained by PCR amplification using the two PCR products generated above as template and a sense primer coding for the N-terminus of the α-factor secretion signal together with an antisense primer corresponding to the coding sequence for the last six amino acids of GlcAT-I. This PCR fragment was finally ligated into theEcoRI–XbaI sites of pPICZB to yield pPICZ-αF-GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD. Cys33 and Cys301 were replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-round PCR-based method as follows. Two separate PCRs were performed using Vent DNA polymerase. The first reaction was realized using a sense primer containing anEcoRI site, a Kozak consensus sequence, and nucleotides 1–18 of the GlcAT-I coding region with an antisense primer introducing the chosen mutation, in which the codon TGT was changed to GCT for Cys33 and TGC was changed to GCC for Cys301. The second PCR was performed with a sense primer complementary to the antisense primer introducing the mutation together with an antisense primer comprising a XbaI site, a stop codon, and nucleotides 1005–989 of GlcAT-I. After purification from agarose, the two PCR fragments were hybridized via the overlapping regions from the sense and antisense primers introducing the mutation and then used as template for the amplification of the full-length GlcAT-I coding region. For each mutation, the resulting PCR fragment was purified from agarose and subcloned into the SmaI site of pGEM-3Z. The recombinant vectors were then digested byEcoRI–XbaI, and the fragment obtained corresponding to each mutation was individually subcloned intoEcoRI–XbaI sites of pPICZB yeast expression vector to generate pPICZ-GlcAT-I-C33A and pPICZ-GlcAT-I-C301A. All mutant clones were screened for Taq-introduced errors by dideoxysequencing (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52215) Google Scholar). pPICZ-GlcAT-I, pPICZ-GlcAT-IΔNT, pPICZ-αF-GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD, pPICZ-GlcAT-I-C33A, and pPICZ-GlcAT-I-C301A were individually transformed into P. pastoris SMD 1168 (Invitrogen) by the lithium chloride method according to the recommendations of the supplier. Transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml of Zeocin. The cells were grown in BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base and 1% (v/v) glycerol). Expression was induced in a BMGM medium (BMGY with 1% (v/v) glycerol replaced by 2% (v/v) methanol) and carried out for 48 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (215 rpm). Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 10 min and further analyzed as described below. In the case of yeast cells transformed by pPICZ-αF-GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD, secretion of the recombinant protein was analyzed in the culture medium after sedimentation of yeast cells as above and precipitation of the proteins by trichloroacetic acid (25% (v/v)) or ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation. Subcellular fractionation of yeast cell extracts was performed as described previously (18Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, after harvesting, cells were washed once and suspended in cold breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were then broken by vortexing with glass beads. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were then pelleted from the supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in sucrose-Hepes buffer (0.25m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and the supernatant is referred to as the cytosolic fraction. For the analysis of N-linked glycosylation, proteins were denatured in 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min and then incubated with peptide N-glycosidase F in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and containing Complete MiniTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 2 h, according to the recommendations of the supplier (New England Biolabs). Peptide N-glycosidase F digestion was also performed under native conditions without prior heating in denaturating buffer, at 37 °C for 2 h as above except that Nonidet P-40 was omitted. Protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211571) Google Scholar). An anti-GlcAT-I antibody was raised in rabbits against the conserved peptide 301CTRVLWHTRTEKPK315 in the motif IV of Galβ1,3-glucuronosyltransferases. Proteins from various fractions of recombinant yeast cells and from the culture media were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using the newly generated polyclonal antibody (1:1000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies, as described previously (18Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,21Pillot T. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S.

Activity of recombinant human GlcAT-I was evaluated using Gal-Gal as acceptor substrate. Reaction conditions were optimized in terms of time, protein concentration, divalent ions, and incubation pH. Standard incubations were performed in 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with 10 mm MnCl2, 10–50 μg of membrane protein, or 10 μg of protein from ammonium sulfate fractionation from yeast culture medium, 2 mm Gal-Gal, 5 mmsaccharonolactone, and 2 mm UDP-glucuronic acid, in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by placing the tube in ice and adding 10 μl of 6 n HCl. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation, and the reaction product was then analyzed by HPLC after chromophore labeling by reductive amination as described previously (22Wang W.T. Le Donne N.C. Ackerman B. Sweely C.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of reagent mixture (consisting of 1 nmol of aniline, 35 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride, 40 μl of acetic acid, and 350 μl of methanol) were added to 100 μl of the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 80 °C. After cooling, 500 μl of water were added, and noncoupled aniline was extracted with chloroform. The labeled water-soluble product was analyzed by HPLC on a reverse phase C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 4 μm, Waters, Milford, MA) at a detection wavelength of 280 nm according to an adapted method (23Pless D. Gouze J.N. Senay C., V., B. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 588-595PubMed Google Scholar). The mobile phase was composed of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.015% (v/v) formic acid, and 0.03% (v/v) triethylamine in water (apparent pH 4.0) and used at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Control assays in which either the donor substrate UDP-glucuronic acid or the acceptor substrate Gal-Gal was omitted were simultaneously run under the same conditions. The addition of a glucuronic residue on the nonreducing end of Gal-Gal was verified by the susceptibility of the product to hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase from bovine liver. β-Glucuronidase (200 μl, 1200 units) dissolved in 200 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) was added to 100 μl of the medium after a 60-min incubation without saccharonolactone. The reaction was conducted for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Apparent kinetic parameters (K m ,V max) were determined using linear least-squares regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots of initial velocityversus Gal-Gal concentration (0–2 mm) at a constant concentration of UDP-glucuronic (2 mm) or of the initial velocity versus UDP-glucuronic acid concentration (0–2 mm) at a constant concentration of Gal-Gal (2 mm). For N-phenylmaleimide inhibition studies, microsomal membranes from yeast cells expressing wild-type or mutant GlcAT-I were incubated in the presence of an increasing concentration of cysteine-directed reagent (0–20 mm) for various periods of time at 37 °C. The mixture was then diluted 10-fold in the incubation buffer, and the reaction was started by adding UDP-glucuronic acid and Gal-Gal as described above. Reduction of disulfide bridges was performed by incubation of microsomal membranes from yeast cells expressing wild-type or mutant GlcAT-I and secreted GlcAT-I recovered from the culture medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation with increasing concentrations of DTT (0–25 mm) for 30 min on ice. The enzymatic assays were then performed as described above. BMH was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the solution (50 mm) was added to 50 μl of microsomal (50 μg) or secreted proteins (20 μg) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose to give a concentration of 0.02–1 mm BMH as described (24Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7154-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was carried out at room temperature for 60 min and quenched by the addition of the same volume of sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. 20–30 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-GlcAT-I antibodies. An expression vector directing the synthesis of the full-length GlcAT-I polypeptide in the yeast P. pastoris was constructed. In addition, we designed a mutant lacking the sevenN-terminal amino acids constituting the cytoplamic tail of the protein in order to analyze a possible influence of this positively charged peptide on the membrane association and orientation of GlcAT-I (see Fig. 1). Finally, a soluble form of GlcAT-I was produced by the fusion of the GlcAT-I sequence coding for the polypeptide lacking the 25 N-terminal amino acids (corresponding to the predicted cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain) with the yeast cleavable prepro-α-factor leader (Fig. 1). The resultant recombinant plasmids (pPICZ-GlcAT-I, pPICZ-GlcAT-IΔNT, and pPICZ-αF-GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD) were individually transformed into the methyltrophic yeast P. pastoris. Upon methanol induction, expression of the full-length and truncated GlcAT-I polypeptides was successfully achieved. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts showed that recombinant GlcAT-I and GlcAT-IΔNT migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a polypeptide band of approximately 43 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes a and b). Subfractionation experiments showed that, as expected, full-length GlcAT-I was associated with membrane-enriched fraction of recombinant yeast cells, whereas no polypeptide was detected in the supernatant from 100,000 × g centrifugation (Fig. 2, lanes d and c, respectively). Interestingly, GlcAT-IΔNT exhibited the same distribution upon subfractionation (Fig. 2,lanes g and f, respectively), suggesting that the deletion of the predicted N-terminal cytoplasmic tail did not compromise membrane targeting and association of GlcAT-I protein. The apparent molecular mass of GlcAT-I and GlcAT-IΔNT was reduced to approximately 39 kDa after N-glycanase treatment (Fig. 2, compare lane e with lane d andlane h with lane g), indicating that the one potential N-linked glycosylation site located in theC-terminal part of the protein is utilized, in agreement with previous experiments performed on a protein A-GlcAT-I fusion protein (9Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Imiya K. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the deglycosylated protein (about 39 kDa) was in agreement with the expected molecular mass of 37.08 kDa, calculated from the predicted primary sequence. Furthermore, the N-glycosylation of the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant strongly suggested that this truncated polypeptide was translocated and had achieved an “N in/C out” orientation, as the wild-type protein. The construct pPICZ-αF-GlcAT-IΔNT/TMD, encoding GlcAT-I lacking the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain, efficiently directed the synthesis and secretion of a soluble form of the enzyme into the culture medium of recombinant yeast cells, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, lane i). The apparent molecular mass of the secreted form (about 41 kDa) was, as expected, slightly lower than that of the wild-type protein, was compatible with the deletion of the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain (Fig. 2, compare lane i with lane d). Interestingly, upon treatment by N-glycosidase F, the mobility of the secreted polypeptide was increased of about 4 kDa (lane j), thus indicating that it was glycosylated to a similar extent to the wild-type protein and that no hyperglycosylation occurred during the secretion pathway.

Cyclin D1 protein expression is regulated by mitogens, and its assembly with the cyclin-dependent kinases induces phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb, a critical step in G(1) to S phase cell cycle progression contributing to the proliferative responses. In the present study, we found that in CHO-AT(1A) cells, Ang II induced a rapid and reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of various intracellular proteins including the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Ang II also induced cyclin D1 protein expression in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK)-dependent manner. Using a pharmacological and a co-transfection approach, we found that p21(ras), Raf-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and also the catalytic activity of SHP-2 and its Src homology 2 domains are required for cyclin D1 promoter/reporter gene activation by Ang II through the regulation of MAPK/ERK activity. Our findings suggest for the first time that SHP-2 could play an important role in the regulation of a gene involved in the control of cell cycle progression resulting from stimulation of a G protein-coupled receptor independently of epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation."

Although the FPR activates proteins that are implicated in actin reorganization such as Rho GTPases and PI 3-kinase, the sequence of events initiated at the FPR and leading to the actin cytoskeleton is not well understood (5Benard V.

PI 3-kinase activity is induced during leukocyte motility by GPCR and tyrosine kinase receptors. At least four catalytic subunits of PI 3-kinase have been described in mammalian tissues, including p110α, β, γ, and δ. The class Ia subunits (p110α, β, and δ) form a heterodimer complex with the adaptor molecules p85, p55, and p50 (α or β isoforms) (8Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Unlike the class Ia PI 3-kinases, class Ib p110γ forms a heterodimer with the adaptor protein p101 and is directly activated by Gβγ subunits (9Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, p110γ and p110δ expression is restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin.Recent studies involving selective inhibition of specific isoforms using antibodies suggest the mammalian isoforms are not redundant in their regulatory effects on cellular responses (8Vanhaesebroeck B.

In these studies, p110β/δ isoforms were found to mediate cytoskeletal changes leading to polarization and migration in the macrophage cell line Bac1.2F5, whereas p110α appeared to mediate effects on cell survival and proliferation.

This finding suggests that class Ia PI 3-kinase isoforms can also be activated by GPCR.Because leukocytes are very difficult to manipulate, the use of nonleukocyte cells to study the pathways involved in fMLP stimulation of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements may provide valuable models in delineating those pathways. We initiated a study utilizing porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells microinjected with cDNA expressing the FPR and various cDNA constructs encoding constitutively active or dominant negative proteins that have been previously shown to play a role in actin cytoskeletal signaling pathways. With this approach we were able to determine the sequence of events from the FPR to the actin cytoskeleton and to identify a link between the FPR, Gβγ subunits, and class Ia PI 3-kinases leading to Rac-induced actin reorganization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMicroinjections and Immunofluorescence MicroscopyMicroinjections and immunofluorescence microscopy were carried out as described previously (15Symons M.

PAE cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on coverslips. Expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged FPR and/or various tagged cDNAs known to be involved in G protein receptor-coupled pathways were diluted to a concentration of 50 ng/ml in injection buffer (5 mm potassium glutamate, 130 mm KCl) and microinjected into the nucleus of >100 subconfluent PAE cells. Injected cells were incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS, incubated for 5–8 min in 2.3 μm fMLP in PBS, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated in the presence of primary anti-tag monoclonal antibodies for 60 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. To visualize F-actin cells were incubated with Texas red-conjugated phalloidin. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss Axiophot with appropriate filters for fluorescence detection.Treatment with InhibitorsPertussis Toxin TreatmentCells were microinjected with expression vectors encoding the FPR as described above. Approximately 2 h prior to fMLP stimulation cells were treated with PTX ranging in concentration from 0 to 10 μg/ml. Following treatment with PTX cells were stimulated with fMLP, fixed, and processed as described.Treatment with Tyrosine Kinase InhibitorsPAE cells were microinjected with expression vectors encoding the FPR as described above. Approximately 2 h prior to fMLP stimulation a 10 mm stock of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD 166285 in Me2SO was diluted into growth medium at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 μm. Following the 2-h incubation, cells were stimulated with fMLP, fixed, and processed as described. For Genistein inhibition studies, coverslips were washed once with PBS at approximately 4 h post injection. A 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO was diluted into PBS at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm. Cells were treated for 10 min followed by direct addition of fMLP for 8 min. Fixation and processing was as described. Control cells were treated with Me2SO alone.Wortmannin TreatmentCells were microinjected with an expression vector encoding the FPR as described and incubated for 4–6 h. Coverslips were then washed with PBS, and the cells were treated for 10 min with concentrations of Wortmannin ranging from 10 to 200 nm. fMLP was added in the presence of Wortmannin for 8 min, followed by fixation and processing as described.Western BlotsPAE cell lysates were made from semi-confluent cultures of PAE cells by lysis in TG lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, Roche Molecular Biochemicals inhibitor mixture tablet). Cell lysates from Jurkat T-cells, WI-38, and activated and unactivated HL-60 cells were also prepared as controls. Lysates were clarified by spinning for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were mixed with SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated in 8% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels at 100 V. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry blotting method. Blots were probed with an affinity purified anti-porcine rabbit polyclonal antibody to PI 3-kinase γ (1:2000 dilution), reacted with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/20,000 dilution), and detected with the ECL luminescence system.Eukaryotic Expression Vectors and ReagentsA plasmid encoding the human FPR was provided by Dr. N.

All DNA for microinjection was prepared using Qiagen maxiprep purification protocols. N-Formyl peptide receptors (FPR)1 are seven-transmembrane-domain rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) commonly found in phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes (1Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). These receptors play a key role in classical leukocyte chemoattraction leading to leukocyte migration from the blood to sites of inflammation. In phagocytes, the chemoattractantN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) activates the FPR to stimulate diverse biological processes including chemotaxis, transcriptional activation, and actin reorganization (2Panaro M.A. Mitolo V. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1999; 21: 397-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the FPR is pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive, indicating that the FPR most likely couples with Gi subunits of G proteins (3Suzuki T. Hazeki O. Hazeki K. Ui M. Katada T. Biochim. Biophys.

This property permits the use of GFP in a wide range of applications (1Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar). The 238-residue protein consists of a long, regular β barrel formed from eleven β strands, the first and sixth of which align in parallel orientation; the others are antiparallel. A single α helix passes through the center of the barrel (Fig. 1 A). The fluorescent chromophore is covalently attached to the protein at the center of the helix inside the barrel, shielded from solvent within the hydrophobic core of the β barrel (2Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments demonstrate that residues serine 65, tyrosine 66, and glycine 67 cyclize autocatalytically and oxidize to form the chromophore (3Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). GFP emits its characteristic fluorescence when it is properly folded. Only soluble protein is fluorescent. GFP isolated from the inclusion body fraction of Escherichia coli cell lysates is nonfluorescent but can be refolded in vitro to generate the fluorophore (2Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A.

It has been suggested that GFP aggregates in inclusion bodies prior to productive folding (7Reid B.G. Flynn G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6786-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). GFP variants have been selected for increased cellular fluorescence without altering the chromophore environment. These same variants reduce the fraction of protein localizing to inclusion bodies when expressed in E. coli relative to wild-type GFP (8Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S.

Positions of mutations that increase cellular fluorescence map to loops and to both centrally directed and surface-exposed β strand positions on the structure. Because formation of mature GFP can be directly detected in cells, GFP provides an ideal system in which to study β sheet protein folding in the cellular milieu. The folding of β sheets is not well understood. Here, we focus on cross-strand pairings between the parallel strands on the solvent-exposed β barrel of GFP. We propose that interactions on the surface of β sheets modulate the stability of β sheets. Statistical analyses of cross-strand residue pairings in proteins of known structure (13Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M.G. Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Hutchinson E.G. Sessions R.B. Thornton J.M. Woolfson D.N.

Proteins. 1998; 32: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) distinctively demonstrate non-random pairing; moreover preferences depend on the type of cross-strand site. Antiparallel β sheets have two types of sites, one in which the backbones of both residues hydrogen-bond to one another and one in which backbone hydrogen-bonding groups are directed away from the cross-strand residue. The arrangement is different in parallel β sheets. There is only one type of pairing, but the two residues in the pair are not equivalent. One residue, at the hydrogen-bonding (HB) site, hydrogen-bonds to the backbone groups on both sides of its cross-strand residue, at the non-hydrogen-bonding (nonHB) site. Experimentally, it has been shown that amino acid side-chains interact across β strands in measurably favorable and unfavorable combinations (16Smith C. Regan L. Science. 1995; 270: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Merkel J.S. Regan L. Folding & Design. 1998; 3: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Merkel J.S. Sturtevant J.M. Regan L.

We propose cross-strand pairings in which both side chains can adopt their lowest energy side-chain conformation are favorable in β sheets. Energetically unfavored pairings result when one or both residues of the pair adopt higher energy side-chain conformations, a consequence of steric constraints of the particular cross-strand site (18Merkel J.S. Sturtevant J.M. Regan L. Structure. 1999; 7: 1333-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the type of site and the side-chain conformational preference influence favorable and unfavorable pairings in β sheets. In sum, all of the above studies demonstrate that cross-strand pairings modulate the stability of proteins and suggest favorable pairings for particular types of cross-strand sites. To identify cross-strand pairings in parallel sheets that facilitate correct strand register and protein folding in a cellular environment, we introduced a library of pairings into GFP at two positions. We investigated a subset of these cross-strand pairings in vivoand in vitro to demonstrate the structural integrity of these mutants by several spectroscopic methods. By following the intrinsic fluorescence of native protein, we have observed the slow protein folding process within cells and variations present among selected mutants. These findings agree with in vitroobservations from the purified variants. We propose a model for strand alignment in parallel β sheets, a problem highlighted by the nonconsecutive association of component β strands. The GFP background chosen for this study incorporated the following mutations relative to the wild-type GFP isolated from jellyfish: three amino acid substitutions (F99S, M153T, V163A) identified through a selection experiment for the phenotype, which improves the yield of soluble fluorescent protein in E. coli (9Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), an historical polymerase chain reaction-induced mutation, Q80R (5Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar), and the K238N mutation at the unstructured C terminus (20Palm G.J. Zdanov A. Gaitanaris G.A. Stauber R. Pavlakis G.N. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). All other positions are identical to wild-type. The variant containing these 5 mutations serves as “wild-type” in this study. Host site substitutions (L15T, D19T, S30A, E32A, E111A, V120T, E124T) were designed to create the environment around the cross-strand guest positions 17 and 122 in GFP (Fig. 1 B) and were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using standard protocols. DNA encoding a polyhistidine tag upstream of the initiation methionine was cloned between the NheI site in the gene and an upstream NdeI site on the pET11a plasmid (Novagen). Randomized oligonucleotide primers were used to generate the library of cross-strand pairings allowing all nucleotides at the first two positions and cytosine, guanine, and thymine at the third position for codon 17, thus eliminating two of three termination codons while maintaining the potential for all residues to be encoded. The primer for codon 122 had equimolar mixtures of all nucleotides at all three codon positions. Protein expression results from background induction in BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) in the absence of induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 6-ml starter cultures of freshly transformed cells in LB medium in culture tubes were grown for 4–5 h at 25–28 °C. All 6 ml of this inoculum was used per liter of growth medium. Growth continued for 60 h total at 25–28 °C with 200 rpm shaking speed. Cell pellets from growth cultures of 1–3 liters were lysed by sonication in 40–50 ml 20 mmTris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl. Lysate was centrifuged at 13 krpm, 4 °C for at least 30 min, and the supernatant was decanted for further purification. Purification with TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl at room temperature. Protein was eluted in two sequential 4-ml volumes of buffer with 250–500 mmimidazole. Nucleic acids (and imidazole) were removed in a final purification step by gel filtration chromatography, using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined by the aromatic residue UV-vis absorption of acid-denatured protein at 280 nm (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the mean of triplicate measurements. The estimated error is ±5%. All purified protein samples were measured in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl. UV-vis measurements were performed on a Hewlett Packard 845X UV-visible Chemstation on 10 μm protein samples. CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer (Aviv Instruments). Far-UV CD spectra were acquired from 190–260 nm with 0.5 nm sampling. Spectra were recorded on 30 μm protein samples in a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the photomultiplier tube set at 700 V. For in vivo measurements, excitation (5.0 nm slit width) was set at 397 nm, and emission (2.5 nm slit width) was monitored from 410–700 (value reported for 509 nm). In vitro measurements were performed on 100 μm protein with both excitation and emission slit widths set to 5 nm and photomultiplier tube voltage set at 700 V. Excitation and emission of the chromophore was measured at 397 and 550 nm (so that the minor excitation peak at 475 nm could be resolved), respectively. Freshly transformed E. coli cells were used to inoculate 3-ml cultures of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Culture tubes were incubated at 25–28 °C with 200 rpm agitation for 60 h because of the slow folding/maturation time of some of the mutants. A 100-μl aliquot was taken from the culture and centrifuged in an Eppendorf tube at 13 krpm for 2 min. LB medium was pipetted off. This step removes any extracellular GFP in the medium resulting from cell death or leaking from cells as observed in some E. colistrains. At the same time, removing the medium eliminates background fluorescence from LB so that fluorescence measurements report only intracellular GFP levels. 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with final concentrations of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H20, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4 (∼pH 7.3) (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley … Sons, New York1992Google Scholar) was added to the tube, and cells were resuspended and frozen at −20 °C until measurement. For experiments in which samples were taken every 2 h during a time course, 100 μl of starter culture (A600 at 2) was used to inoculate 6 ml of LB medium(with ampicillin) in a culture tube. 100-μl aliquots were taken and prepared as described above. 100 nm protein was equilibrated in 100 mm citrate buffer over a pH range of 1.8 to 8.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT at room temperature for 16 h. Both chromophore fluorescence and aromatic residue fluorescence were measured by emission at 509 nm from excitation at 397 nm and 280 nm, respectively. Prior to refolding, protein was fully unfolded in 100 mm citrate (pH 1.93) and 100 mm NaCl with DTT present. This mixture was then diluted 107.5-fold to a final buffer of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. At this pH, all GFP variants are fully folded (Fig. 4 A). Because there are 11 prolines in GFP, one of which is a cis-proline in the native structure (P89), unfolding was carried out immediately before refolding experiments. Refolding was monitored by chromophore fluorescence at 509 nm. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Refolding spectra fit single exponential growth curves with an R of 0.99 or better. The quality of the fit was lower when the data were fit to higher exponentials. Protein unfolding was monitored by loss of chromophore fluorescence at 509 nm. Protein was diluted 250-fold from pH 8.0 into 1 ml of 100 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.35), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT to a final protein concentration of 100 nm. At this pH, all GFP variants are fully unfolded (Fig. 4 A). All measurements were performed in triplicate. 70–80% of this transition occurs within the dead time of manual mixing techniques (within 12 s). Unfolding curves were fit by a single exponential rate with an R of 0.98 or better. Higher exponentials decreased the quality of the fit. We created a double guest site across the two parallel β strands on the solvent-exposed face of the β barrel of GFP and minimized possible interactions between the guest residues and the surrounding side chains on the protein surface (Fig. 1 B), in accordance with previous β sheet host-guest studies (16Smith C. Regan L. Science. 1995; 270: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Merkel J.S. Regan L.

Nature. 1994; 371: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). None of the residues on the two parallel β strands of GFP has been identified by other studies to alter the folding properties or the chromophore environment of the protein. Positions in the center of the first and sixth strands sample a homogeneous β sheet environment and minimize turn effects. The 17HB122nonHB double-guest site was chosen because it best represents the solvent accessibilities of all types of β sheets (both barrel and sheet arrangements). The host site with alanine residues at both guest site positions (E17A, R122A) constitutes the reference state for this study, Ala17–Ala122 (Fig. 1 B). Ala17–Ala122 was expressed in E. coli cells, and the fluorescence was compared with wild-type. Both types of colonies fluoresce after shifting the cells to room temperature for approximately 1 day, consistent with previous observations regarding the thermosensitivity of GFP (25Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Oka M. Nomaguchi K. Kohno K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cellular fluorescence of cells expressing Ala17–Ala122has the same absorption and emission spectra as wild-type, indicating that substitutions on the protein surface creating the host-guest site maintains the tertiary environment of the buried chromophore in GFP. Having created an environment on the surface of GFP without altering the structure of folded protein, we incorporated a library of amino acid pairings at the two guest positions in GFP and monitored the fluorescence of intact E. coli cells. Substitution of all amino acids at both guest positions (17 and 122) was achieved by ligating inserts encoding residues 2–138 (including both guest site positions) from cassette mutagenesis using degenerate oligonucleotide primers into a pET11a vector containing the remaining residues of the GFP gene. TransformedE. coli differed in the intensity of green fluorescence on a Petri dish when grown at 37 °C and transferred to room temperature for at least 24 h. Approximately half of the 200 colonies were nonfluorescent. Qualitatively, 10% of the colonies were less fluorescent than Ala17–Ala122, 20% were equivalent to Ala17–Ala122, and a final 20% were more fluorescent than Ala17–Ala122, displaying nearly wild-type fluorescence. No colonies fluoresced as brightly as wild-type GFP, suggesting that seven of nine substitutions introduced to create the host-guest site result in decreased fluorescence. The genes of GFP variants were sequenced to determine the identity of guest site residues and to eliminate clones from the study that have a mutation at any site on the gene. Observed differences in fluorescence may result from protein expression, protein solubility, or protein stability. The fluorescence properties of intact cells expressing different GFP variants were compared. All cells gave the characteristic GFP excitation and emission profiles confirming the maintenance of chromophore environment (Fig.2 A). One explanation for fluorescence differences among GFP variants is the amount of soluble, folded protein in cells, despite comparable levels of total protein expression (Fig. 2 B). GFP was prominent in all of the lysates, and the level of GFP expression was comparable. Hence, fluorescence differences do not result from large differences in protein expression. Based on whole cell fluorescence, the GFP variants displayed between 10 and 60% of wild-type fluorescence (TableI). The highest fluorescing colonies have predominantly polar and charged residues at the guest sites. Hydrophobic, aromatic, and β-branched residues, which have high β sheet propensities, are not observed frequently, except for threonine, which is found at both guest positions and in a number of different pairings. The observed amino acid pairings at the solvent-exposed site indicate a preference for polar and charged residues, which may enhance the solubility of GFP. Hydrophobic residues are also observed among the best pairings (alanine, isoleucine, valine) including the hydrophobic pair, Leu17–Val122, suggesting that solubility is not the sole determinant of favored pairings. GFP is a much larger protein than other peptides or proteins in which cross-strand pairings have been studied (16Smith C. Regan L. Science. 1995; 270: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Merkel J.S. Regan L.

Therefore, residues unfavorable for β sheet formation substituted into a protein may destabilize GFP to a lesser extent than a smaller protein, which may further account for the diversity of amino acids seen at the guest sites.Table IRelative whole cell fluorescence of cross-strand pairs in GFPResidue pair (17HB122nonHB)Relative whole cell fluorescence (% wild-type GFP)Wild-type (ER)100RT57AT49ER49NV43AR42SR42MT41QH40AI40NR40TT40LV38AC36AN35NI35RI33RN32MR32RV31RY28SH28QL26QS26EH26ED25WH25KH25RH23MS23MQ22WR12AA12GH11 Open table in a new tab Cross-strand pairings capable of a number of possible types of side-chain interactions include Thr17–Thr122, in which threonine residues may hydrogen-bond to one another or to nearby host-site residues, possible cation-π (26Ma J.C.

Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3342) Google Scholar) interacting pairs (Lys17–His122, Arg17–His122, Arg17–Tyr122, and Trp17–Arg122), a π-π pair (Trp17–His122), and a salt-bridge, Glu17–Arg122. Pairs of residues with complementary polarity (Glu17–His122, Met17–Arg122, Arg17–Ser122, Arg17–Thr122) were selected. Rare codon usage at positions 17 or 122 did not significantly influence overall protein expression as several of the most fluorescent clones contained rare codon sequences. Cross-strand pairings at two positions on GFP dramatically alter the magnitude of intracellular fluorescence. A few representative clones were chosen for further characterization based on the diverse chemical natures of their cross-strand pairings. Glu17–Arg122 was chosen to assess the effect of host-site substitutions in GFP (wild-type contains Glu17–Arg122 but is surrounded by the naturally occurring residues) because it contains a salt bridge. Other highly fluorescing colonies chosen include the polar pair, Thr17–Thr122, and the hydrophobic pair, Leu17–Val122. In the middle of the whole cell fluorescence scale, Arg17–Tyr122, a possible cation-π pair was chosen. The glycine-containing pair, Gly17–His122, was chosen to represent a poorly fluorescing clone. These variants were compared with wild-type and Ala17–Ala122. Cultures were inoculated with equal amounts of cells, and there were no differences in E. coli growth rates for cultures expressing different GFP variants (Fig. 3 A). Fluorescence measurements showed pronounced variation in final fluorescence levels depending on the cross-strand pair (Fig. 3 B). Scaled relatively (Fig. 3 C), the variation in the rate at which fluorescence appears among mutants is clear. GFP matures slowly, and fluorescence from cultures grown at room temperature peaks at 24 h for wild-type and between 30 and 48 h for the variants. The variants with the highest final fluorescence (Glu17–Arg122, Thr17–Thr122) mature more quickly than that with intermediate fluorescence (Arg17–Tyr122) and the poorly fluorescing variant, Ala17–Ala122. The fluorescence for all variants, which does not appear to be caused by cell death, decreases at the longest time points as the optical density of the samples plateaus at 40 h and does not further decrease even at the longest time points (Fig. 3 A). The fluorescence decrease may arise from protein degradation at long culture times. Both the final fluorescence level and the rate of fluorescence vary in cells depending on the residues paired across parallel β strands on the surface of GFP. The fluorescence properties of soluble protein purified from E. coli cells expressing GFP cross-strand variants were determined as a sensitive probe of chromophore environment. The excitation and emission profiles of the variants are identical. The major emission peak at 509 nm and shoulder at 540 nm confirm that the wild-type environment around the chromophore is maintained in all of the cross-strand variants. The fluorescence of the single intrinsic tryptophan at position 57, investigated by excitation at 294 nm, results in a large emission peak at 509 nm with a shoulder at 540 nm, the signature of the chromophore fluorescence. The structure of GFP shows the tryptophan to lie 11 Å above the chromophore within the β barrel, and tryptophan emission is absorbed by the nearby chromophore, consistent with previous findings (27van Thor J.J. Pierik A.J. Nugteren-Roodzant I. Xie A. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16915-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The fluorescences of GFP variants are indistinguishable from one another in response to tryptophan absorption, providing further evidence for structural conservation within the protein core. The absorption spectra of these variants in the ultraviolet and visible region are superimposable. The peak at 280 nm corresponds to aromatic residues in the protein. The chromophore absorption peaks at 397 and 475 nm are also prominent features in the spectrum. The CD spectrum in the far-UV region is indicative of a β-sheet protein with a minimum at 217 nm. Fluorescence, absorption, and CD spectroscopies indicate that the wild-type chromophore site, aromatic residue environments, and overall backbone structure are preserved in the cross-strand variants. The variant proteins are spectroscopically indistinguishable from wild-type. Differences in the rate of fluorescence acquisition among selected GFP variants within cells may reflect differences in the folding rates of GFP. Therefore, we examined the kinetics of refolding and unfolding of the purified proteins. The chromophore is covalently bound to the native protein. By performing refolding studies, in vitro measurements isolate the folding event from chromophore maturation. Furthermore, the possible effects of cellular components that affect folding (e.g. chaperones) are eliminated. GFP has been shown to reversibly refold after either acid- or alkali-induced denaturation (28Bokman S.H. Ward W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 1372-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Ward W.W. Bokman S.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4535-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the selected GFP variants display reversible folding behavior under these conditions. Fig. 4 A shows the equilibrium denaturation of the acid-induced unfolding transition for wild-type and selected GFP variants. The denaturation is cooperative. Loss of fluorescence followed by chromophore or tryptophan absorption has the same pH profile. We compared the rates of refolding and unfolding of purified GFP mutants at conditions where all variants can be completely refolded or unfolded, respectively. Representative traces for each variant of refolding (Fig. 4 B) and unfolding (Fig.4 C) followed by chromophore fluorescence fit to a single exponential. The refolding rate constants of purified variants (TableII) correlate with in vivomeasurements and vary nearly an order of magnitude among the mutants. The unfolding spectra display small differences among wild-type GFP and selected variants and therefore have similar unfolding rates (TableII).Table IIRefolding and unfolding rate constants of selected GFP variantsVariantRefolding rate constantaRefolding was performed on protein denatured at pH 1.93, which was diluted 110-fold into 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT.Unfolding rate constantbUnfolding was performed on protein by 250-fold dilution into 100 mm citrate (pH 4.35), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT.

Open table in a new tab Refolding and unfolding rate constants were used to calculate relative stability differences (ΔΔGu) between the double-alanine reference mutant, Ala17–Ala122, and selected variants for the acid-induced unfolding transition (TableIII). For this calculation, we assume that the large variation in refolding rate constants accounts for the majority of the stability differences, and the small range of the unfolding rate constants is conserved throughout the pH range. Cross-strand pairings modulate the stabilities of the variants within 1 kcal mol−1, and the charged pair, Glu17–Arg122 is the most stabilizing, consistent with previous studies investigating cross-strand pairings in β sheet proteins (16Smith C. Regan L. Science. 1995; 270: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Merkel J.S. Regan L.

The relative stabilities of mutants result from both the intrinsic β-sheet propensities of residues at the two guest sites and the effects of cross-strand interactions between the two guest residues. Between parallel β strands on the solvent-exposed barrel of GFP, cross-strand pairings modulate both the protein stability and the folding rate, without strongly affecting the unfolding rate.Table IIIΔΔGu of the unfolding transition between A17A122 and selected GFP variantsVariantΔΔGu25 °Ckcal mol−1Glu17-Arg1221.05 ± 0.06Thr17-Thr1221.01 ± 0.06Leu17-Val1220.91 ± 0.06Arg17-Tyr1220.5 ± 0.1Gly17-His122−0.1 ± 0.2Ala17-Ala1220 ± 0.2ΔΔGu25 °C was calculated using the equation ΔΔGu = −RTln(kfAA/kuAA ×kuXY/kfXY). kf is the folding rate constant, and ku is the unfolding rate constant (Table II).

Chromophore maturation is proposed to be the last stage in the protein folding pathway of GFP (7Reid B.G. Flynn G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6786-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), occurring subsequent to protein folding. By studying a library of GFP mutants with different residue pairings across the parallel β strands, we observe differences in total cellular fluorescence. Despite differences in the magnitude of fluorescence among GFP variants in vivo, similarity by fluorescence, absorption, and CD spectroscopies in vitro suggests that the amount of mature protein differs in cells and not the structure of variant proteins. Hence, intracellular fluorescence monitors the soluble fraction of GFP expressed within cells. Total protein expression is comparable (Fig. 2 B); thus mutants have different ratios of protein localizing to soluble and inclusion-body fractions. In vitro refolding experiments measure dramatic differences in the folding rate among GFP variants and suggest that faster folding rates within cells expressing GFP allow for greater total fluorescence. The fraction of the protein molecules that fold early are protected from aggregation and are capable of forming the fluorophore. Furthermore, we demonstrate that substitutions at two cross-strand positions can have a dramatic effect on the folding rate of a protein in vitro, which correlates with protein maturation within cells. Combining thermodynamic and kinetic data, we analyze how cross-strand pairings affect the formation of fluorescent native protein from the “unfolded” state. However, we cannot distinguish between an unfolded state of the protein and an intermediate fromin vivo or in vitro results. The differences in folding rates suggest that favorable pairings destabilize the unfolded state. In the simplest possible model, a destabilization of the unfolded state without changes in the transition state or folded state accounts for both the increase in stability and the faster folding rates of favorable cross-strand pairs. Disulfide bonds present in protein variants of T4 lysozyme have been shown to destabilize the unfolded state by reducing the entropy of the unfolded state (30Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Levitt M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Matsumura M. Signor G. Matthews B.W.

This effect is magnified in examples where disulfides restrict longer loops. Another example of a decrease in entropy destabilizing the unfolded state is observed in protein variants with glycine replacements to any other residue or replacements of any residue by the more constrained proline (33Matthews B.W. Nicholson H. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6663-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 34Nicholson H. Tronrud D.E. Becktel W.J. Matthews B.W. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hence, a destabilization in the unfolded state due to loss of entropy can account both for the stability and the folding rate differences in GFP observed for favorable cross-strand pairings between parallel β strands relative to Ala17–Ala122. A more complex model includes the contributions of favorable pairings in stabilizing the folded state. Both destabilizing the unfolded state and stabilizing the folded state were seen in favorable single substitutions in the B1 domain of IgG-binding protein G (35Smith C.K. Bu Z. Anderson K.S. Sturtevant J.M. Engelman D.M. Regan L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2009-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because unfolding rates are relatively conserved among variants, it is possible that cross-strand interactions, which stabilize the folded state, are also present in the transition state, reducing its energy by a similar magnitude in both states. These stabilizations conserve the height of the unfolding barrier yet lower the folding barrier. Stability increases in favorable pairings are influenced by destabilization in the unfolded state and favorable interactions present in the folded state. Alternatively, interactions that stabilize both the transition state and the folded state without affecting the stability of the unfolded state could also account for the observed results. We have selected variants at two cross-strand sites between the parallel β strands on the solvent-exposed β barrel of GFP. Neither mutations at these two positions nor mutations at the closest surrounding residues alter the wild-type spectral features of the covalently bound fluorophore in the core of the protein. Residue pairings at the cross-strand site alter the total fluorescence insideE. coli cells, which correlates with the rate of fluorescence acquisition from mature GFP. Proteins with favorable cross-strand pairings fold more quickly than those with less favorable pairings to achieve a higher final fluorescence. Unfavorable pairings result in unfolded or partially folded protein aggregates before becoming fluorescent. The in vivo folding rates correlate with those observed in vitro from studies with purified proteins. We propose that correct β-strand register between nonlocal sequences in β sheet proteins results from energetically preferred pairings, which fold more quickly than less preferred pairings. Conversely, arrangements with incorrect β strand alignments are less stable and fold slowly. Thus, the native strand alignment, having the kinetic and thermodynamic advantage, forms in preference to non-native strand alignments to specify correct register between β strands."

A stoichiometric amount of protein has been shown to convert a substrate of suitable sequence to the Z form, as demonstrated by a characteristic change in the CD spectrum of the DNA. Now we show that Zab can bind not only to isolated Z-forming d(CG) n sequences but also to d(CG) n embedded in B-DNA. The binding of Zab to such sequences results in a complex including Z-DNA, B-DNA, and two B-Z junctions. In this complex, the d(CG) n sequence, but not the flanking region, is in the Z conformation. The presence of Z-DNA was detected by cleavage with a Z-DNA specific nuclease, by undermethylation using Z-DNA sensitive SssI methylase, and by circular dichroism. It is possible that Zab binds to B-DNA with low affinity and flips any favorable sequence into Z-DNA, resulting in a high affinity complex. Alternatively, Zab may capture Z-DNA that exists transiently in solution. The binding of Zab to potential as well as established Z-DNA segments suggests that the range of biological substrates might be wider than previously thought."

Troponin T isoform diversity is marked by a developmentally regulated acidic to basic switch that may modulate muscle contractility. We previously reported that transgenic expression of fast skeletal muscle TnT altered the cooperativity of cardiac muscle. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the binding of acidic TnT to troponin I is weaker than that of basic TnT. However, affinity chromatography experiments showed that Tm bound to acidic TnT with a greater affinity than to basic TnT, consistent with the significantly higher maximal binding of acidic TnT to Tm in solid phase binding assays. Competition and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the binding of TnT to Tm was cooperative in the absence of F-actin. The cooperativity between TnT molecules for Tm binding can be initiated by the conserved COOH-terminal T2 fragment of TnT. This indicates that the interaction of TnT with Tm induces a conformational change in Tm, promoting interaction of TnT with adjacent Tm dimers.

As a result of tissue-specific regulation by alternative RNA splicing, cardiac and fast skeletal muscle TnT isoform switches are observed during mammalian and avian development (9Cooper T.A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This developmental expression pattern can be classified by the predicted physical properties of the TnT isoforms expressed (15Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Specifically, fetal and neonatal TnT isoforms are higher M risoforms when compared with those expressed in adult striated muscles. Protein and cDNA sequencing have shown that the NH2-terminal variable region of TnT is abundant with acidic amino acid residues. Nonetheless, the NH2-terminal domains of high M r fetal and neonatal TnT isoforms have relatively acidic isoelectric points (pI) in comparison with adult TnT isoforms. The high to low M r, acidic to basic developmental TnT isoform switch is conserved among species and may reflect the role of TnT isoforms in the functional adaptation of developing striated muscles. Cardiac (18Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and slow skeletal muscle (19Jin J.-P.

Jin J.-P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for TnT isoforms in the functional diversity of muscle fiber types. The regulation of muscle regulatory protein isoforms is not restricted to TnT because TnI and Tm show muscle specific and developmental control of gene expression (20Koppe R.I. Hallauer P.L.

This suggests that expression of the muscle thin filament protein genes is coordinated. The importance of the TnT structure-function relationship to muscle contractility is further demonstrated by changes in cardiac TnT isoform expression during diabetes (23Akella A.B. Ding X.L. Cheng R. Gulati J. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and heart failure (24Anderson P.A. Greig A. Mark T.A. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Ungerleider R.M. Allen P.D. Kay B.K. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, differences in TnT isoform expression are able to alter the sensitivity and the cooperativity of the force response to Ca2+ (25Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 520 (a): 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this respect, TnT isoform expression may be important in the etiological or compensatory mechanism involved in compromised contractility of cardiac muscle. Therefore, understanding the interaction of acidic and basic TnT isoforms with other thin filament proteins is important in deciphering the role of TnT in Ca2+ regulation of striated muscle contraction. In the present study, we have investigated the functional properties of high M r acidic versus lowM r basic TnT isoforms. Interestingly, acidic and basic TnT show differential interactions with Tm isoforms and TnI. In addition, the binding of TnT to Tm is cooperative in the absence of F-actin, an effect that is induced by the binding of the COOH-terminal domain of TnT to Tm. Taken together, the data imply that TnT isoforms and their interactions with Tm play important roles in the physiology of muscle contraction. The anti-TnT monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3E4 and 6B8 (27Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were used to specifically detect acidic and basic fast skeletal muscle TnT isoforms. The relative affinities of the mAbs to acidic and basic TnT were demonstrated by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Chicken TnT was diluted to 5 μg/ml in Buffer A (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm TCEP) and was coated overnight (100 μl/well, 4 °C) onto triplicate wells of microtiter plates (Falcon 3915). Control wells were coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The wells were then washed once in Buffer A with 0.05% Tween 20 (Buffer T) and blocked at room temperature for 90 min using Buffer T containing 1% BSA. Following blocking, the wells were washed three times in Buffer T and incubated with serial dilutions of mAb 3E4 or 6B8 in Buffer T with 0.1% BSA for 90 min at room temperature. For antibody incubations, TCEP was omitted. The bound mAbs were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin second antibody and the H2O2 and 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) substrate reaction as described previously (28Ogut O. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16581-16590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Troponin T and TnI were prepared from fresh chicken skeletal muscles using a protocol developed by Dr. L. B. Smillie (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). As demonstrated previously (29Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), adult chicken breast muscle exclusively expresses high M r acidic fast skeletal muscle TnT whereas the gastrocnemius muscle exclusively expresses low M r basic fast skeletal muscle TnT. Therefore, the two muscle types were used to purify acidic and basic TnT isoforms, respectively. Following homogenization and extraction of fresh muscle with 50 mm KCl to remove soluble proteins, troponin and Tm were extracted with 0.75 mLiCl2 at pH 4.5. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.5 (20 min) and then lowered to pH 4.5 (20 min) to precipitate Tm. Troponin in the supernatant was then fractionated by (NH4)2SO4 at 35–65% saturation, and the precipitate was dialyzed against 0.01 N HCl until conductivity was less than 2 millisiemens/cm. Following dialysis, the pH of the solution was raised to pH 4, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (the precipitate contained TnC). Solid urea and sodium acetate were added to the supernatant to 6 m and 0.01m, respectively, and the TnT/TnI mixture was fractionated by CM52-cation exchange chromatography at pH 4. The column was developed with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. The TnT and TnI peaks were identified by 180:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide 14% SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialyzed against 0.01% formic acid to remove urea and salt, and lyophilized. To further purify TnT and TnI to homogeneity, the lyophilized powders were dissolved in 6 murea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for fractionation by DE52-anion exchange chromatography. Pure TnT and TnI eluted from the columns were dialyzed against 0.01% formic acid and lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and buffers included 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inhibit proteases and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol as a reducing agent. The preparation and purity of the chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT NH2-terminal fragment N165 (TnT-(1-165)) was previously demonstrated (28Ogut O. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16581-16590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The chymotryptic T2 fragment of rabbit fast skeletal muscle TnT (30Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. L. B. Smillie. Tropomyosins were purified according to the protocol described by Smillie (31Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A mixed population of α/β-Tm was isolated from chicken gastrocnemius muscle whereas α/α-Tm was purified from chicken breast muscle (25Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After homogenization and extraction as above, the 0.75 m LiCl2 extracts of chicken breast or gastrocnemius muscles were lowered to pH 4.5 for isoelectric precipitation of Tm. The precipitated Tm was resolubilized in 1m KCl, pH 7, for 30 min and precipitated again by decreasing the pH to 4.5. The isoelectric precipitation and resolubilization were repeated four times followed by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation to collect the 50–60% saturation pellet. The purified Tm was dialyzed extensively against double-distilled H2O and lyophilized. All steps were performed at 4 °C and included phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and β-mercaptoethanol as indicated above. The ratios of α- to β-Tm in the preparations were determined by densitometry of SDS-PAGE-resolved Tm isoform bands using NIH Image 1.61 software. Purity of the protein preparations was assessed by 29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with TnT, TnI, or Tm antibodies to assure no cross-contamination or proteolytic degradation products in the samples. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements and SDS-PAGE analyses against controls of known concentrations. The following extinction coefficients and molecular weights were used: acidic fast skeletal muscle TnT, E 280 = 0.44 (1 mg/ml),M r = 33,000; basic fast skeletal muscle TnT,E 280 = 0.44 (1 mg/ml), M r= 29,000; chicken fast skeletal muscle TnI, E 280= 0.52 (1 mg/ml), M r = 21,000; chicken α/α- or α/β-Tm, E 280 = 0.44 (1 mg/ml),M r = 66,000 (32Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative binding strengths of acidic and basic TnT to α/β-Tm were determined using affinity chromatography. Purified chicken α/β-Tm was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 11 mg of protein per 0.5 ml of gel during coupling. A 0.5-ml column was packed and equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm TCEP. Acidic and basic chicken fast TnT (1.5 nmol each) were dissolved as a mixture in 10 ml of the equilibration buffer (final TnT concentration of 0.3 μm) and loaded onto the column at a flow rate of ∼0.2 ml/min. The column was washed with three volumes of the equilibration buffer and eluted by a gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl in the equilibration buffer (20-ml total volume, 0.5-ml fractions). All steps were carried out at room temperature. The fractions were resolved by 180:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide 14% SDS-PAGE gel and silver stained to determine the high M r acidic and lowM r basic TnT peaks. For silver staining, the resolved SDS-PAGE gel was shaken for 20 min in 20 volumes of 50% methanol, 12% trichloroacetic acid, 2% CuCl2, followed by 10 min in 10% ethanol, 5% acetic acid and then 10 min in 0.01% KMnO4. The gel was then shaken in 10% ethanol, 5% acetic acid for 10 min, in 10% ethanol for 10 min, and in double-distilled H2O for 10 min and then incubated in 0.1% AgNO3 for 10 min. Following incubation in AgNO3, the gel was rinsed in double-distilled H2O for 30 s, shaken in 10% K2CO3 for 60 s, and then incubated in 0.01% formaldehyde, 2% K2CO3 until the protein bands were clearly visible. The gel was then briefly incubated in 10% methanol, 5% acetic acid and photographed. To study the high affinity interactions of TnT isoforms with TnI or Tm, we used a solid phase protein binding assay (29Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chicken TnI, α/α- or α/β-Tm, or BSA were separately dissolved to 5 μg/ml in Buffer A and coated overnight (100 μl/well, 4 °C) onto triplicate wells of microtiter plates (Falcon 3915). The plates were then washed with Buffer T and blocked for 90 min at room temperature with Buffer T containing 1% BSA. Following three washes with Buffer T, the plates were incubated with serial dilutions of acidic or basic fast TnT in Buffer T with 0.1% BSA for 90 min at room temperature. The bound TnT was detected by mAb 3E4 (1:2000 dilution) using the ELISA procedure described above. The results are presented as the average ± S.D. The binding curves of TnT to Tm and TnI were well fit by single exponentials. The fits were used to determine the concentration of TnT required for 50% maximal binding. Differences in the concentration of TnT required to achieve 50% maximal binding were deemed significant ifp < 0.05 by Student's t test. The competition and cooperativity between acidic and basic TnT for Tm binding was monitored by TnT isoform-specific antibodies. We developed a solid phase ELISA method where the binding of acidic fast TnT to immobilized Tm was selectively detected by mAb 6B8 (see Fig.2 B) in the presence of basic fast TnT or bovine cardiac TnT. Briefly, following coating of Tm isoforms or BSA in Buffer A (5 μg/ml), the plates were blocked with Buffer T with 1% BSA. The immobilized Tm was incubated with TnT mixtures (in Buffer T, 0.1% BSA) wherein the concentration of acidic TnT remained constant (25 nm), but the concentration of basic or bovine cardiac TnT was titrated from 0 to 2.5 μm. Following incubation of Tm with TnT for 1.5 h, the binding of acidic TnT to Tm was determined by mAb 6B8 (1:2000 dilution). The detection of the bound antibody and color development was done as detailed above. The interaction of TnT isoforms with immobilized TnI was also analyzed using the same ELISA protocol. To determine the effect of the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of TnT on the cooperative binding of full-length TnT to Tm, the NH2-terminal N165 fragment of chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT (Ref. 28Ogut O. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16581-16590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, equivalent to the chymotryptic fragment T1 (7Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and the COOH-terminal T2 fragment of rabbit skeletal muscle TnT were used in serial dilutions as the competing TnT species. For these experiments, mAb 3E4 (1:2000) was used to selectively detect bound full-length acidic TnT. This mAb does not cross-react to fragment N165 or the T2 fragment (27Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ELISA titration results are presented as the average ± S.D. The competition-cooperativity curves were fit manually. We measured the competition of TnT isoforms for Tm binding by co-immunoprecipitation. In these assays, the concentration of chicken acidic fast skeletal muscle TnT and chicken breast muscle α/α-Tm dimers were fixed at 0.1 μm and 0.05 μm, respectively. An increasing concentration of bovine cardiac TnT (0–0.1 μm) was used as a competitor of the acidic fast skeletal muscle TnT for α/α-Tm binding. The TnT/Tm mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20. Following the initial incubation, anti-Tm mAb CH1 was added (∼3 μg) and was allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-bound TnT-Tm complexes were precipitated by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 35 min at room temperature. Following a brief centrifugation at 8000 × g to pellet the beads, excess buffer was removed with a 27-gauge needle. The beads were washed with 100 volumes of the incubation buffer, excess liquid was removed, and the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were heated at 80 °C for 3 min and resolved by 180:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide 14% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining and analyzed by densitometry as described above. Chicken breast muscle expresses exclusively acidic TnT and mainly the α-isoform of Tm whereas chicken gastrocnemius muscle expresses basic TnT and α/β-Tm (25Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These muscles provide convenient sources for the purification of the protein isoforms. The TnT and Tm isoforms purified from these muscles are shown in Fig. 1. Chicken fast skeletal muscle TnI purified from the adult skeletal muscles was pooled together. The proteins are free of degradation but more importantly are free of other thin filament proteins as demonstrated by Western blotting using specific mAbs (Fig. 1). By densitometry, the ratio of α- to β-Tm was 9.71:1 for the α/α-Tm preparation and 1.15:1 for the α/β-Tm preparation. Indirect ELISA was done to determine the relative affinity of mAbs 3E4 and 6B8 toward the two classes of purified chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT. Both acidic and basic TnT were identified by 3E4 without significant differences in the titration curves (Fig.2 A). Because 3E4 detects TnT isoforms with equal relative affinity, it was suitable for comparing the interaction of acidic and basic TnT with TnI and Tm. In contrast, indirect ELISA titration showed that mAb 6B8 was highly selective for acidic TnT over basic TnT (Fig. 2 B). The two antibodies allow for either comparable (mAb 3E4) or selective (mAb 6B8) detection of chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT isoforms. Affinity chromatography was used to determine the relative binding affinity of acidic and basic TnT to Tm. As shown by the chromatographic profile (Fig. 3), both acidic and basic TnT bound specifically to the α/β-Tm affinity column with overlapping elution profiles. However, elution of basic TnT (peak at 312–325 mm NaCl) from the column slightly preceded acidic TnT (peak at 337–350 mm NaCl), suggesting that the relative binding affinity of acidic TnT for α/β-Tm was higher. Solid phase protein binding assay was also used to monitor the interactions between acidic or basic TnT isoforms with α/α- or α/β-Tm dimers. In this independent assay, the relative affinities of TnT isoforms for Tm isoforms, as defined by the TnT concentration required for 50% maximal binding, were not significantly different (Fig. 4; TableI). However, the saturation level of the binding curves between acidic TnT and Tm isoforms was significantly higher than for basic TnT (p < 0.05). The maximal binding of TnT to α/β-Tm was higher than binding to α/α-Tm. This occurred in the absence of statistically significant differences in the relative binding affinities as reflected by the TnT concentrations required for 50% maximal binding (Table I). With affinity chromatography, the initial TnT-Tm binding was saturated, and the affinity was compared through a salt gradient elution under non-equilibrium conditions. In contrast, the solid phase ELISA binding experiments measured the K d of the initial binding at equilibrium, which determined the shape of the titration curve and the concentration needed for 50% maximal binding. In addition, the absolute value of the binding curve was obtained after washing under non-equilibrium conditions, which appeared to be a more sensitive measurement of the binding affinity similar to that determined by the elution profile from an affinity column.Table IThe concentration of TnT required for 50% maximal binding to TnI or TmAcidic TnTBasic TnTμmα/α-Tm0.083 ± 0.0470.109 ± 0.014α/β-Tm0.128 ± 0.0210.076 ± 0.030TnI0.068 ± 0.0190.095 ± 0.009 Open table in a new tab Using the solid phase binding assay, the relative affinity of acidic or basic TnT for fast skeletal muscle TnI was determined. The titration curves for TnI binding (Fig. 5) demonstrate that the maximal binding of basic TnT to TnI was significantly higher than the binding of acidic TnT to TnI (p < 0.05). Similar to the Tnt-Tm interactions (Fig.4), no statistical difference in the relative affinities of the TnT isoforms for TnI was detected by the concentrations of TnT required to achieve 50% maximal binding (Table I). Troponin T isoform competition assays were performed to further characterize the different binding strengths of TnT isoforms to Tm. Instead of a simple competition between the two TnT isoforms, the results showed cooperativity between TnT isoforms for Tm binding. The initial increase of the concentration of basic TnT did not produce a competitive effect on the binding of acidic TnT. In contrast, between 25.0 and 75.0 nm total TnT in the assay (with molar ratios of basic/acidic TnT between 0 and 2), the binding of acidic TnT to α/α− and α/β-Tm was significantly increased (Fig.6). These results indicate that the binding of basic TnT to Tm promoted the binding of acidic TnT to Tm by a cooperative effect in the absence of F-actin. As expected, the binding of acidic TnT to Tm rapidly decreased at higher molar ratios of basic to acidic TnT, reflecting effective competition by the excess basic TnT. In similar competition experiments analyzing the binding of TnT isoforms to immobilized TnI, no such cooperative effect was observed. Increasing concentrations of basic TnT effectively competed with acidic TnT for TnI binding (Fig. 7). The competition experiments were done with two concentrations of TnI during coating (1 and 5 μg/ml) to ensure that the coating density of TnI was not responsible for the absence of cooperativity. Basic TnT competed more effectively with acidic TnT for TnI binding when 1 μg/ml TnI was used during coating versus 5 μg/ml. Unlike the cooperativity seen between TnT isoforms for Tm binding (Fig. 6), the interaction of TnT isoforms with TnI was strictly competitive. The cooperativity between TnT isoforms for Tm binding was independently shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Using a constant concentration of acidic chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT (0.1 μm), Fig.8 A shows that increasing concentrations of up to 0.025 μm bovine cardiac TnT promoted cooperative binding of the fast skeletal muscle TnT to Tm. This resulted in an increase in the apparent affinity of fast skeletal muscle TnT for Tm. As the concentration of bovine cardiac TnT was further increased (0.025–0.1 μm), the fast skeletal muscle TnT was effectively competed from binding Tm. The cooperative Tm binding between cardiac and fast skeletal muscle TnT was also seen in the solid phase protein binding experiment (Fig. 8 B), similar to the cooperativity observed between the acidic and basic fast skeletal muscle TnT (Fig. 6). The relative binding of skeletal and cardiac TnT at equal concentrations (0.1 μm) showed that the affinity of cardiac TnT for Tm was higher (Fig. 8 A), consistent with a more effective cooperative effect of cardiac TnT than that of basic fast TnT on the binding of acidic fast TnT. Densitometry analyses showed that under the co-immunoprecipitation conditions, binding stoichiometry between TnT and Tm dimers was less than 1, indicating that the TnT-Tm interaction remained within physiological levels. To further dissect the basis for the cooperative binding between TnT and Tm, we repeated the solid phase competition experiments using TnT fragments. The NH2-terminal N165 fragment was unable to promote acidic TnT binding to Tm (Fig.9), suggesting that the central Tm binding site and the hypervariable NH2 terminus of TnT do not directly promote the cooperative interaction of TnT with Tm. However, the chymotryptic TnT fragment from the well conserved COOH-terminal region of TnT (T2 fragment) resulted in increased binding of acidic TnT to Tm. Therefore, the COOH-terminal Tm binding site of TnT alone may be the primary determinant to initiate in the cooperative binding of TnT to Tm. Isoform and sequence diversity of the NH2-terminal extension of TnT indicate that this fragment is a non-essential element. A genetically expressed TnT with an NH2-terminal truncation has been shown to conserve the core functions of full-length TnT (34Pan B.S. Gordon A.M. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12432-12438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the primary role of TnT in striated muscle thin filaments as an intermediary to tether TnI and TnC to Tm can be accomplished in the absence of the NH2terminus of TnT. Consistent with these observations, the highly conserved COOH-terminal region of TnT is responsible for TnI and TnC binding and has the higher affinity Tm binding site. The second Tm binding site resides in the central region of TnT (5Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, an increasing amount of data demonstrates the functional importance of the variable NH2-terminal region of TnT (36Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Malnic B. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. J. Biol.

Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4548-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Variations in the NH2-terminal primary structure are able to modify the overall conformation of TnT (27Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Ogut O. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16581-16590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), affecting its interaction with Tm (29Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and TnI (27Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) while changing the Ca2+ sensitivity of force and stiffness in skinned skeletal muscle fibers (25Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of TnT isoforms on muscle contractility are likely to be mediated by changes in TnT interaction with other thin filament constituents. In this respect, the solid phase binding assay in Fig. 4 revealed a significant difference in the binding of acidicversus basic TnT to Tm. These variations in acidic and basic TnT binding to Tm must be attributed to the variable NH2-terminal region. This conclusion is supported by the observation that both the central and COOH-terminal regions of TnT are well conserved among species and identical in the chicken TnT compared in this study (29Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, the variable NH2 terminus of TnT must affect the tertiary structure of the central and/or COOH-terminal Tm binding sites. The role of TnT isoforms in contractility may also be defined by the differential binding of TnT isoforms to TnI (Fig. 5), an effect mediated through a single binding site near the COOH terminus of TnT (40Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2534-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in TnI binding between the acidic and basic TnT isoforms supports the conclusion that changes in the primary structure of the NH2-terminal variable region dictate changes in the overall tertiary structure of the TnT, including the functionally important COOH-terminal domain. Although the variable NH2-terminal region of TnT does not directly interact with TnI or Tm, its effects on the binding of intact TnT to these thin filament proteins is evident. In the solid phase competition assays (Fig. 6), basic TnT required a molar excess to effectively compete with acidic TnT most likely because of its weaker binding to Tm (Fig. 4). However, with an optimal range of concentration of total TnT in the reaction, the addition of basic TnT was able to increase the binding of acidic TnT to Tm by a cooperative effect. This was also shown in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 8) wherein bovine cardiac TnT increased the apparent affinity of acidic TnT for Tm. The cooperativity between TnT molecules for Tm binding appears to be a general feature because chicken basic fast TnT, bovine cardiac TnT, and the conserved COOH-terminal T2 fragment all induced cooperative binding of the acidic fast TnT to Tm. However, we have not excluded the possibility that the presence of two or more TnT isoforms (e.g. in most vertebrate fast skeletal muscles) may enhance the cooperative interaction with Tm. Although it has been previously shown that the troponin interaction with Tm-F-actin filaments is cooperative (38Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), our experiments demonstrate that TnT-Tm cooperativity also exists in the absence of F-actin. Increased acidic TnT binding to Tm is well explained by cooperative recruitment of TnT molecules to adjacent Tm dimers following the initial interaction between TnT and Tm molecules. In effect, the binding of TnT to a Tm dimer would promote a conformational change not only in the Tm dimer bound to TnT but also in the adjacent naked Tm dimer. This conformational change would “prime” the adjacent Tm dimer for interaction with TnT, explaining the cooperativity seen in Figs. 6 and 8. Further, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the cooperative TnT-Tm interaction remained stoichiometric, mimicking the physiological ratio of one TnT molecule per Tm dimer. We found that the COOH-terminal Tm binding site of TnT was the initiator of the cooperative TnT-Tm interactions, as the COOH-terminal T2 fragment, not the NH2-terminal N165 fragment, promoted cooperative binding (Fig. 9). Because TnT from different genes (cardiac versusfast skeletal muscle) and species (avian versus mammalian) promoted cooperative TnT binding to Tm, this conserved function of TnT is expected to be mediated primarily by a conserved domain of the molecule. The importance of the T2 region of TnT in this cooperativity is intuitive, because it is the site of interaction for TnI-TnC and would be the primary intermediary following activation when TnC binds Ca2+. Because our detection of the cooperative TnT-Tm interaction was through the binding of intact TnT in the assay systems, we cannot exclude that the central region Tm binding site and the NH2-terminal domain of TnT contributed to the responding effect. Note that cooperative TnT binding to Tm in the presence of the T2 fragment was not as effective as in the presence of intact TnT. This is predicted and in agreement with previous data that the NH2-terminal variable region of TnT increases but is not critical to the cooperative binding of troponin to Tm-F-actin filaments (38Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that association with F-actin is not absolutely required for the cooperativity and/or cross-talk between adjacent Tm dimers. The results suggest that there is a determinant of cooperativity in muscle activation/relaxation intrinsic to troponin-Tm interaction. Our experiments have demonstrated that acidic and basic TnT isoforms show distinct interactions within the thin filament. These changes in TnT function are predicted to be because of NH2-terminal variation-originated changes in the tertiary structure of the COOH-terminal T2 region where both TnI and Tm show strong interactions. However, the mechanism governing how functional differences in TnT isoforms contribute to muscle contractility remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that striated muscle fibers expressing more acidic TnT isoforms show increased sensitivity to Ca2+ for both force and stiffness development (25Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Solaro R.J. Lee J.A. Kentish J.C. Allen D.G. Circ.

In addition, transgenic expression of a relatively basic fast skeletal muscle TnT in mouse hearts increased the cooperativity of the force response to Ca2+ (26Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 520 (a): 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These examples provide two outcomes of TnT isoform expression. At this point, we can only hypothesize the mechanism of contribution of TnT isoforms to these observations. It is well known that the most energetically favorable interaction in the myofilament assembly is the actin-myosin interaction. This is supported by the strong interaction of myosin heads with actin active sites during rigor in the absence of Ca2+ (for review, see Ref.43Cooke R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 671-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The troponin-Tm assembly serves to regulate this favored interaction through the cooperative release and/or return of the inhibition of cycling actomyosin cross-bridges. Therefore, a change in the cooperative interaction between TnT isoforms and Tm provides an effective point to regulate muscle contraction. We thank Dr. L. B. Smillie for the rabbit fast TnT-T2 fragment and helpful discussions and Dr. J. J.-C. Lin for the anti-Tm mAb CH1."
https://openalex.org/W2016378337,"Mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of the osmotically controlled GPD1 gene inSaccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated by promoter analysis. The GPD1 gene encodes NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the production of the compatible solute glycerol. By analysis of promoter deletions, we identified a region at nucleotides −478 to −324, in relation to start of translation, to be of great importance for both basal activity and osmotic induction ofGPD1. Electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I footprint analyses demonstrated protein binding to parts of this region that contain three consensus sequences for Rap1p (repressoractivator protein 1)-binding sites. Actual binding of Rap1p to this region was confirmed by demonstrating enhanced electrophoretic mobility of the protein-DNA complex with extracts containing an N-terminally truncated version of Rap1p. The detected Rap1p-DNA interactions were not affected by changes in the osmolarity of the growth medium. Specific inactivation of the Rap1p-binding sites by a C-to-A point mutation in the core of the consensus showed that this factor is a major determinant ofGPD1 expression since mutations in all three putative binding sites for Rap1p strongly hampered osmotic induction and drastically lowered basal activity. We also show that the Rap1p-binding sites appear functionally distinct; the most distal site (core of the consensus at position −386) exhibited the highest affinity for Rap1p and was strictly required for low salt induction (≤0.6 mNaCl), but not for the response at higher salinities (≥0.8m NaCl). This indicates that different molecular mechanisms might be operational for low and high salt responses of theGPD1 promoter.

The genetically tractable yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has proven particularly useful in identifying signal transduction components and in unraveling their function, which has generated a wealth of molecular information over the past few years (1Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 2Hohmann S. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses.

The HOG (highosmolarity glycerol response) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is a prominent signal transduction pathway responding to osmotic stress. The HOG1 and PBS2genes, which code for a mitogen-activated protein kinase and its regulatory mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, respectively, represent two central components of this pathway that were identified by analysis of yeast mutants sensitive to high salt concentrations (4Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). More recent work identified several upstream components of two distinct branches of the pathway affecting Hog1p phosphorylation (5Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Another signaling pathway of general importance in modulating various cellular activities, i.e. the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway, influences the expression of some of the stress-regulated genes (1Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 9Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2000; 16: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by opposing the effects from signaling in the HOG pathway (10Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). There is, moreover, evidence for the existence of an osmostress-activated signaling pathway, involving calcineurin, that does not respond to general osmotic stress, but to high salt concentrations (11Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate rapidly accumulates in yeast cells during hyperosmotic stress (12Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L. Parker G.P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 13Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1219-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of a so far uncharacterized phosphoinositide pathway in the yeast stress response. Clearly, yeast appears to coordinately activate various signal transduction pathways when confronted with osmotic challenges. Central to the understanding of the overall cellular function of signaling pathways is the characterization of the regulatory elements of their target genes and the mechanism by which the transcription of these genes are controlled. However, only in a limited number of cases have the molecular details operational at the osmoregulated promoters been unraveled. It was recently shown that the ENA1 gene, encoding a P-type ATPase involved in the extrusion of Na+from the yeast cytoplasm, is regulated by a derepression mechanism. The repressor that binds to the ENA1 promoter was identified as Sko1p (14Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the repression effect is dependent on the integrity of the Ssn6p-Tup1p corepressor complex, which appears to be relieved by a HOG1-dependent mechanism. This corepressor has also been implicated in the control of theHAL1 gene and a number of other stress-regulated promoters, indicating derepression as a more general molecular mechanism for stress induction (15Marquez J.A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pentanucleotide element CCCCT, being the core consensus of the stress-responsive element (STRE),1 has been implicated in transcriptional activation of numerous genes during general stress conditions (1Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This element responds to osmotic shock mediated via the HOG module. Two transcription factors, Msn2p and Msn4p, have been shown to bind to STRE and to be instrumental for STRE-activated transcription (16Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The control of the Msn2p/4p-dependent gene activation by the HOG pathway appears to be influenced by the phosphorylation state of the transcription factors and their subsequent nuclear localization (17Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Elevated glycerol production is a prerequisite for the adaptation ofS. cerevisiae to hyperosmotic stress, and several investigators have identified glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the key enzyme in the glycerol synthesis pathway (18Edgley M. Brown A.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 3453-3463Google Scholar, 19André L. Hemming A. Adler L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Blomberg A. Adler L. J.

The principal mechanism for increasing glycerol production is increased expression of the GPD1 gene, and evidence has accumulated to indicate theGPD1 promoter as a target for the diverse signaling pathways responding to cellular dehydration (22Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Salt-induced GPD1expression is not dependent on a functional Sko1p, 2M. Rep and S. Hohmann, personal communication. Msn2p/4p (23Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), or functional STREs. 3H. Alipour, P. Eriksson, and A. Blomberg, submitted for publication. However, it was recently proposed that two putative transcription factors with slight sequence similarity to Gcr1p, an important regulatory factor of glycolytic gene expression, are involved in the hyperosmotic regulation of GPD1 (23Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The most prominent of these two candidates, Hot1p (high osmolarity-inducedtranscription), was shown to be essential for full level response to salt stress; the salt-induced transcriptional response in ahot1Δ mutant was ∼40% of the wild-type level. Simultaneous deletion of MSN1, encoding the other Gcr1p sequence homolog, resulted in a further reduction in salt-inducedGPD1 expression. However, irrespective of a combination of a number of gene knockouts involving also HOG1,MSN2, and MSN4, the GPD1 gene remained salt-responsive, although to a much decreased extent. Thus, although Hot1p and Msn1p are involved in the osmostress-mediated transcriptional activation of GPD1, additional mechanisms are apparently in operation. In this work, we report experimental evidence for the repressor/activator protein Rap1p (25Shore D. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) as an important determinant of both the basal and salt-induced transcriptional activities of theGPD1 promoter. We also present evidence for the binding of Rap1p to neighboring binding sites that appear involved in mediating regulatory effects upon dehydration via different mechanisms, depending on the magnitude of stress. This is the first time that this multifunctional transcription factor is being implicated in the osmostress response. It is hypothesized, based on the importance of Rap1p in the Gcr1p-mediated induction of glycolytic genes, that Rap1p might interact directly or indirectly with Hot1p and/or Msn1p and thereby facilitate their binding and subsequent activation of theGPD1 promoter. The following strains of S. cerevisiae were used: YPH499 (MAT a ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 leu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63 ) and YPH102a (MAT a ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 leu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200)(a gift from Mike Gustin, who had changed the mating type on the original YPH102) (26Sikorski R.S.

Cultures were grown in defined minimal medium (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate (Difco)) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, and appropriate amino acids and nucleotides (120 mg/liter). All constituents, except the glucose, were sterilized by filtration. When indicated, strains were grown in complex yeast extract/peptone medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract and 2% (w/v) peptone, sterilized by filtration) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose and 120 mg/liter adenine. Precultures (5 ml) were grown overnight in 15-ml Falcon tubes at 30 °C on a rotator, inoculated to A610 = 0.1–0.2 in fresh medium, and grown to mid-exponential growth phase (A610 = 0.5–1) before harvest. Liquid cultures were incubated in E-flasks and with rotary agitation at 110 rpm at 30 °C. Plasmids were introduced to yeast by means of either electroporation (29Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) or the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

Escherichia coli strain DH5α (recA1 endA1 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 gyrA96 relA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169(m80lacZΔM15)) was used for plasmid amplification and transformed by electroporation (31Ausubel F.M.

Open table in a new tab The following procedure was applied in the construction of the plasmid pO54 (32Eriksson P. André L. Ansell R. Blomberg A. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A 1449-bp SspI/SspI GPD1promoter fragment was isolated, ligated to a BamHI linker (CGGATCCG; Sigma catalog no. L6888), and inserted into theBamHI site of the integrative CAT reporter plasmid YIp5-32cat (33Mannhaupt G. Pilz U. Feldmann H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This procedure yielded a GPD1 promoter-CAT reporter fusion (pGPD1-CAT) with the following junction sequence:−20(GPD1) CAAAT CGGATCCG AGATTTTCAAGGAGCTAAGGAAGCTAAAATGGAG +6(CAT)(junction verified by sequencing; the GPD1 promoter is in boldface, the BamHI linker is underlined, and the CAT gene is in italic with the coding sequence indicated in boldface). Plasmid pPE110 (GPD1-(−687 to −16)) was constructed by inserting a 1.64-kb StuI/XbaI fragment from pO54, containing a 670-bp proximal GPD1 promoter fragment (nucleotides −687 to −16 upstream from the GPD1translational start codon) and the CAT gene, intoSmaI/XbaI-cleaved pRS316 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pPE110a plasmid is a pPE110 derivative with a XhoI/KpnI deletion in the multiple cloning site. pPE110b and pPE110c are pPE110a derivatives in which the GPD1 promoter fragment has been exchanged for the corresponding fragments from pPE103a and pPE110b, respectively (introducing unique KpnI sites at positions −581 and −483 in the promoter). For the 5′-deletions, plasmids pPE111 (GPD1-(−377 to −16)) and pPE112 (GPD1-(−322 to −16)) were constructed by ligation of a 1.33-kb SmaI/XbaI fragment and a 1.28-kb PstI/XbaI fragment from pO54 toSmaI/XbaI-cleaved pRS316 (the PstI sticky ends were made blunt-ended before ligation). Plasmids pPE113 (GPD1-(−577 to −16)) and pPE114 (GPD1-(−478 to −16)) were made by adopting a PCR-mediated technique (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moor D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar) utilizingVentR DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Primer pairs PCR1/PCR3 and PCR2/PCR3 were used for the amplification of a 560-bp and a 460-bp GPD1 promoter fragment, respectively, using pO54 as template. PCR products were incubated with restriction enzymes KpnI and BamHI and ligated into the pPE110 plasmid digested with the same enzymes (the promoter fragment of pPE110 resulting from the digestion was eliminated by gel electrophoresis prior to the ligation). The internal deletions in the promoter were made by the following procedure where first some additional plasmid constructs were made. Plasmid pPE102 consists of a 1449-bp SspI/SspIGPD1 promoter fragment complemented with BamHI linkers and ligated to the BamHI-cleaved vector pBSKS+ (pBluescript II KS+, Stratagene). pPE102a is a modified pPE102 construct with theKpnI/XhoI fragment deleted in the multiple cloning site. pPE103 is a version of pPE102a with the distal 771 base pairs of the GPD1 promoter deleted (down to nucleotide −678). The pPE104 plasmid (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−580 to −479)) was constructed by PCR amplification of pPE103 using primers PCR2 and PCR4. This results in a GPD1 promoter deletion between nucleotides −581 and −478 and introduction of a uniqueKpnI site. pPE105 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−377 to −323)) is a pPE103 variant in which the fragment spanning nucleotides −377 (SmaI site) to −323 (PstI site) has been deleted by digestion of pPE103 with PstI (5′-extension repaired using Klenow fragment) and SmaI, followed by religation. The pPE106 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−580 to −323)) and pPE107 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−482 to −323)) plasmids were constructed using the same approach; pPE103a and pPE103b, respectively, were digested withPstI (5′-extension repaired using Klenow fragment) andKpnI before religation. Plasmid pPE115 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−580 to −479)) is the result of swapping the promoter fragment (HindIII/BamHI) of pPE110a with the corresponding fragment in pPE104. pPE116 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−377 to −323)) is pPE110a with the promoter fragment (HindIII/BamHI) exchanged for the corresponding part of plasmid pPE105. Plasmids pPE117 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−580 to −323)) and pPE118 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−482 to −323)) were constructed in the same manner, with the promoter part (HindIII/BamHI) in pPE110a swapped for the equivalent part of plasmids pPE106 and pPE107, respectively. Plasmids pPE119 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−580 to −379)) and pPE120 (GPD1-(−687 to −16,Δ−482 to −379)) are based on modifications of plasmids pPE110b and pPE110c, respectively. The uniqueSmaI and KpnI sites in these plasmids were digested and made blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase, and the DNAs were then subsequently religated, generating new plasmid constructs with the designated deletions. Plasmid pPE110R1 (GPD1-(−687 to −16) with a C-to-A exchange at nucleotide −386) was made by swapping the promoter fragment ClaI/XmaI (nucleotides −687 to −378) from pPE110 with a PCR-generated fragment. Primer pair PCR9/PCR10 (utilizing pO54 as a substrate) was used to generate a 310-bp fragment that was digested with ClaI/XmaI and ligated into pPE110. Plasmid pPE110R3 (GPD1-(−687 to −16) with C-to-A exchanges at nucleotides −386, −371, and −358) was made using the same strategy. An XmaI/BamHI promoter fragment (nucleotides −378 to −16) in pPE110R1 was swapped with a PCR-generated fragment (primer pair PCR18/PCR3) digested with the same enzymes. This generates three-point mutations in the presumed Rap1p-binding sites. The full GPD1 promoter sequence of all constructs was checked by sequencing using the sequencing kit BigDye (Perkin-Elmer catalog no. 4303149), and the PCR-generated products were analyzed by the BM enheten (Enheten för biomolekylär service, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden). The CAT protein amount was measured by an immunological assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalog no. 1 363 727) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. The assay has earlier been checked for quantitative reliability (34Alipour H. Eriksson P. Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The cell pellet (∼1 × 108 cells) was chilled on ice, washed once with ice-cold 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.8), resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.4 m MOPS and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 6.5)) supplied with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent immunoassay kit, and then disrupted by vortexing with 0.4 g of glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) for 4 × 30 s with intermediate incubations on ice for at least 1 min. The cell extract was centrifuged at 13,200 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen at −20 °C until analyzed. The CAT data obtained were divided by the total protein concentration in each sample as determined by a Lowry-based protein assay kit (Sigma catalog no. 5656) using bovine serum albumin as the standard and indicated as parts/million. Cells from a 0.5-liter culture (A610 ≈ 1) were harvested by centrifugation (2600 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed once with 15 ml of H-buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of H-buffer containing protease inhibitors (35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.4 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell suspension was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes; and after centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 3 min, 4 °C), the cell pellets were stored in −20 °C. Cells were thawed at 0 °C and mixed with 1 ml of H-buffer (supplemented with protease inhibitors) and 1 g of acid-washed glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) in precooled homogenization tubes. Homogenization of the cells was performed by vortexing in a Vibrogen-Zellmühle (Edmünd Bühler, Tübingen-Weilheym, Germany) for 10 min at 4 °C until ≥95% of the cells were broken (checked by 10% (w/v) nigrosin staining). The homogenates were transferred to 1.5-ml vials and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was divided into aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The DNA fragments used as specific competitors and radioactive probes in EMSA were isolated from the cloning vectors by restriction enzyme cleavage and agarose gel electrophoresis. The agarose-embedded DNA was cut out from the gel and purified by β-agarase treatment as described above. DNA probes were prepared by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech catalog no. AA0004, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by purification with the Wizard DNA clean-up system (Promega), and the eluted DNAs were ethanol-precipitated. The activity of the probe was ∼105 cpm (Cerenkov)/ng in a typical case. The binding reaction contained, in a final volume of 10 μl, the following components: 0.5–1 × 105 cpm of DNA probe, 6 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10–20 μg of crude whole cell protein extracts, a 100–400-fold higher molar concentration of unlabeled competitor DNA where indicated, and binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 125 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The binding reaction was gently mixed and incubated for 15 min in 30 °C before loading on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:0.8 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, prerun at 8 V/cm for 1 h at 4 °C) in Tris/glycine buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.6), 100 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA) and run at 13 V/cm for ∼2 h at 25 °C. The gels were dried, and PhosphorImager plates were exposed and subsequently scanned in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The images were processed with the aid of computer software from Adobe Systems Inc. (Photoshop Version 2.0.1) and Deneba Systems Inc. (Canvas Version 3.5). For the DNase I footprint experiment, plasmid pPE130 (pGPD1-(−478 to −16)) was cleaved withHindIII, labeled (Klenow fill-in reaction) with [α-32P]dATP, purified with the Wizard DNA clean-up system, cleaved with BamHI, and ethanol-precipitated, and the resulting fragments were electrophoretically separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. The fragment of interest was electrophoresed into a DEAE membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) and eluted according to a standard procedure (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moor D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). 1 × 104 cpm (Cerenkov) of the probe were used for each binding reaction and for a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moor D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The probe was mixed with binding buffer (supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmCaCl2), 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20 μg of protein extract (except for the control sample) to a final volume of 20 μl. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C before the addition of 2 μl of DNase I (5120 units/ml; 2560 units/ml for the control sample without protein). After a 120-s incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5"
https://openalex.org/W2034105313,"The albumin-alpha-fetoprotein locus epitomizes the main features of transcriptional regulation of fetal and adult hepatocyte-specific genes: developmentally regulated promoters and strong distant enhancers. Full enhancer activity required only a proximal albumin-promoter region containing the TATA box, hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), and nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) sites. Deletion of the HNF1 site abrogated enhancer and promoter activity, whereas methylation of the site reduced all activity by about 3-fold. Deletion of the NF-Y site attenuated activity by about half, but much of the activity could be replaced by juxtaposition of an upstream region (designated distal element IV). Gel shift and competition analysis demonstrated that binding of architectural factors overlapped NF-Y binding. Moreover, a mutation that eliminated NF-Y binding but only minimally perturbed the surrounding region did not affect enhancer function. In plasmids with a second promoter, the enhancers simultaneously stimulated both albumin and alpha-fetoprotein promoters with minimal competition, but surprisingly some mutations in the albumin promoter attenuated expression from both promoters, whereas another uncoupled their expression. With single promoters, the function of the proximal promoter region was controlled by three parameters in the following hierarchy: HNF1 binding > local architecture > NF-Y binding, but integrated two-promoter function had a much greater dependence on NF-Y."

We studied this question using human CFPAC-1 pancreatoma cells grown in polarized monolayers. Cellular Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels were acutely sensitive to purinergic receptor activation, rising 3-fold within 1 min of agonist addition. Intracellular Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels were therefore specifically elevated, independently of receptor activation, by incubating cells with a cell-permeant bioactivable analogue, 1,2-di-O-butyl-myo-inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate octakis(acetoxymethyl)ester (Bt2Ins (3,4,5,6)P4/AM). The latter inhibited Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion by 60%. We next used nystatin to selectively permeabilize the basolateral membrane to monovalent anions and cations, thereby preventing this membrane from electrochemically dominating ion movements through the apical membrane. Thus, we studied autonomous regulation of apical Cl− channels in situ. The properties of Cl− flux across the apical membrane were those expected of CaCC: niflumic acid sensitivity, outward rectification, and 2-fold greater permeability of I− over Cl−. Following nystatin-treatment, we elevated intracellular levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 with either purinergic agonists or with Bt2Ins(3,4,5,6)P4/AM. Both protocols inhibited Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion (up to 70%). These studies provide the first demonstration that, in a physiologically relevant context of a polarized monolayer, there is an apical, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4-inhibited CaCC."

Total protein from the fetal-embryonic region of old human lenses was digested with trypsin, followed by resolution of tryptic fragments containing amidated and deamidated forms using high pressure liquid chromatography-reverse phase chromatography together with synthetic peptide standards and mass spectral analysis.

Probably the most common post-translational modification occurring in living systems involves nonenzymatic deamidation of glutamine and asparagine residues. This process occurs during the differentiation and/or aging of cells, resulting in the accumulation of glutamate and aspartate, respectively. Because deamidation results in the introduction of negative charges, it is possible that deamidation may play a major role in protein structural changes that are known to occur in development and aging. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that deamidation may have a major effect upon the turnover rate of proteins (1Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 248-295Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis has been the observation that proteins that turn over rapidly generally have greater rates of deamidation, whereas proteins that are more stable have glutamine and/or asparagine residues that are more resistant to this process (1Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 248-295Google Scholar).Perhaps the most stable proteins in the body are α, β, and γ crystallins found in the lens. Because of the inability of differentiated fiber cells to synthesize appreciable amounts of new protein, lens crystallins must remain relatively intact during the entire lifetime of the individual. The central, fetal-embryonic region of an aged human lens contains crystallins that were synthesized during the prenatal period of lens growth. Characterization of these crystallins should be a good test of the hypothesis that stable proteins, which contain glutamine and asparagine residues, have very low rates of deamidation. Previous studies have shown that α-A crystallin, purified from total proteins of the human lens, contains some glutamine residues that are resistant to in vivodeamidation (2Takemoto L. Boyle D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13681-13685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the β and γ crystallins belong to a different family of lens proteins, and because they comprise the majority of proteins present in the dry weight material of the lens, it is important to verify whether asparagine and glutamine residues in this class of lens proteins are also relatively resistant toin vivo deamidation.Unfortunately, it is impossible to purify any of the β and γ crystallins from the aged human lens because they undergo a series of post-translational reactions that results in extensive heterogeneity in their molecular weights and charge properties. In addition, in the aged human lens, a significant percentage of β and γ crystallins are water insoluble, making it even more difficult to quantitatively assess the degree of deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues of specific crystallins. To circumvent these difficulties, we first used trypsin to digest total lens proteins from the fetal-embryonic region of aged human lenses and followed this by using synthetic peptides corresponding to selected amidated and deamidated tryptic peptides of γ-S crystallin. These synthetic peptides have been used as markers, to develop the optimal acetonitrile gradients for separation of amidated and deamidated peptides. Because of the large number of tryptic peptides generated from treatment of lens proteins, when necessary we have also used sequential gradients containing different ion-pairing agents to resolve the amidated and deamidated species. As an indication of possible deamidation reactions occurring in the β and γ crystallins during aging, we have chosen to resolve possible amidated and deamidated species of glutamine 92, glutamine 96, asparagine 143, and glutamine 170 from γ-S crystallin. The results of our analyses demonstrate no detectable deamidation of these residues during the entire lifetime of lenses from aged human donors, consistent with the hypothesis that very long-lived proteins contain at least some glutamine and asparagine residues that are resistant to the deamidation process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNormal human lenses ages 57, 60, and 66 years were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia, PA. The whole lenses were stored at −75 °C. After thawing the lens at room temperature, the fetal-embryonic region of each lens was obtained by dissection (3Takemoto L. Boyle D. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 119-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This region of the lens was dissolved completely in 7m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.3m Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.6, and was then reduced by carboxymethylation and dialyzed against distilled water as described previously (2Takemoto L. Boyle D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13681-13685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein was determined as described previously (4Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213195) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The lyophilized protein (3.0 mg) was digested with 25 g of sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 16–20 h at 37 °C in 0.30 ml of buffer containing 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide and 0.1m Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.4.Approximately 2–10% of the resulting solution was resolved on a 4.6 × 250-mm C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using various linear gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (see figure legends for specific gradients). Synthetic peptide standards were used to select gradients for the optimal resolution of peptides. Regions of the elution profile corresponding to selected amidated or deamidated tryptic peptides of γ-S crystallin were collected followed by lyophilization and further resolution using the same column with various linear gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid (see figure legends for specific gradients). Synthetic peptides corresponding to amidated and deamidated tryptic peptides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. When necessary, peptide preparations were further purified using reverse phase chromatography. Characterization of peptides by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation was performed by the Biotechnology Core Facility of Kansas State University.RESULTSTable I lists synthetic peptide standards corresponding to expected tryptic fragments containing amidated or deamidated forms of glutamine 92, glutamine 96, asparagine 143, and glutamine 170. These synthetic peptides were used as markers to develop the optimal acetonitrile gradient, for the reverse phase resolution of these peptides from the tryptic digest of total proteins from the fetal-embryonic region of the aged human lens.Table ISynthetic peptide standardsγ-S residuesSequence 84–94 (amidated)AVHLPSGGQYK 84–94 (deamidated)AVHLPSGGEYK 95–100 (amidated)IQIFEK 95–100 (deamidated)IEIFEK131–145 (amidated)VLEGVWIFYELPNYR131–145 (deamidated)VLEGVWIFYELPDYR158–173 (amidated)KPIDWGAASPAVQSFR158–173 (deamidated)KPIDWGAASPAVESFR Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the elution of tryptic peptides from the fetal-embryonic region of a 60-year-old human lens. A linear gradient of 30–40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was used over a period of 60 min, because it was found that these conditions clearly separated the amidated and deamidated forms of the γ-S sequence 131–145 (see solidand split arrows in Fig. 1). A peak eluting at 28.5 min coincided with the expected elution time of the amidated peptide, but no peak was found with the expected time of the deamidated form of this same sequence. Mass spectral analysis of the 28.5 min peak showed that it comprised a single component of M r 1898.7, which within experimental error was the same as the calculated value of 1898.2 for the amidated form of sequence 131–145. The results of Fig.1 therefore demonstrate that no detectable deamidation of asparagine 143 in sequence 131–145 has occurred during the approximately 60 years since the protein was synthesized.In a similar manner, synthetic peptides of γ-S sequence 158–173 were used to develop the optimal acetonitrile gradient for the separation of the amidated and deamidated forms of this sequence. Fig.2 shows a major peak eluting at 19.5 min (solid arrow) that coincides with the elution time of the amidated form of the peptide. In addition, there were two minor peptides that eluted at the approximate time of the deamidated form (split arrow). To unambiguously determine whether any of these minor peaks corresponded to the deamidated form, the elution interval designated by the horizontal bar was collected, followed by resolution using a different acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid instead of trifluoroacetic acid as ion-pairing agent. Previous results have shown these different ion-pairing agents can interact differently with peptides (5Guo D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 386: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), making it possible to resolve a complex mixture of peptides on a reverse phase column by using sequential gradients containing either trifluoroacetic acid or heptafluorobutyric acetic acid. Fig. 3 shows that the amidated form of sequence 158–173 was present as a peak eluting at 29.5 min, with the absence of any peaks eluting at the elution time of the deamidated form of this sequence. Mass spectral analysis of the 29.5 min peak demonstrated that it comprised a single component ofM r 1730.1, which within experimental error is the same as the calculated M r of 1729.9 for the amidated sequence.Figure 2Analysis for possible deamidation of glutamine 170.

The conditions would be expected to include the elution times of the amidated and deamidated forms of γ-S sequence 84–94 and 95–100 (horizontal bars, Fig. 4). These elution times were collected, then further resolved on another acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid as the ion-pairing agent. Fig. 5 shows that the elution time corresponding to 34.5–37.5 min, when further resolved, resulted in a peak eluting at the expected time of the amidated form of sequence 84–94 (solid arrow). Mass spectral analysis of this peak demonstrated the presence of two components with M r 1155.9 and 648.8. The first component corresponds within experimental error to amidated γ-S sequence 84–94 with calculatedM r 1156.3, whereas the identity of theM r 649.8 peak is unknown. However, no peaks corresponding to the elution time of the deamidated form of sequence 84–94 were present (split arrow), demonstrating no significant deamidation of the glutamine 92 residue from the fetal-embryonic region of the 60-year-old lens.Figure 4Analysis for possible deamidation of glutamine 92 and glutamine 96 using reverse phase chromatography of a tryptic digest of total proteins from the fetal-embryonic region of a 60-year-old lens.

Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 therefore demonstrate that for the fetal-embryonic region of a 60-year-old lens, there is no detectable deamidation of asparagine 143, glutamine 170, glutamine 92, and glutamine 96 from γ-S crystallin. In an identical manner, the fetal-embryonic regions of two other lenses, age 57 and 66 years, were also shown to contain the same γ-S sequences in only the amidated form (results not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate the extraordinary stability of some of the asparagine and glutamine residues of γ-S crystallin toward in vivo deamidation during aging of the normal human lens.DISCUSSIONBecause nonenzymatic deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues is thought to be an important factor in the turnover of proteins, it is possible that resistance to deamidation, in vivo, is a characteristic of long-lived proteins. Previous reports have characterized the deamidation rate of proteins with half-lives as short as 3–4 h and as long as 3–4 months (1Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 248-295Google Scholar). Rapidly growing cells contain many enzymes and structural proteins that deamidate rapidly (1Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 248-295Google Scholar), an observation consistent with the importance of deamidation in protein turnover. In contrast, very little information is available on proteins that are extremely stable in vivo. Resistance to deamidation of such proteins might support the hypothesis that deamidation rates may play a role in their relative rates of turnoverin vivo.The central, fetal-embryonic region of the aged human lens is perhaps the best tissue to use in studying the relationship between nonenzymatic deamidation and protein stability of long-lived proteins. This region comprises so-called fiber cells that are lacking intracellular organelles. Although preliminary studies suggest a possible intercellular exchange of proteins within the central region of the lens (6Shestopalov V.I. Bassnett S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1913-1921PubMed Google Scholar), it is generally believed that proteins within this region were synthesized early in the lifetime of the individual during the fetal-embryonic period of lens development. The current study has taken advantage of the availability of old human lenses, in which the central fetal-embryonic region contains a relatively small number of proteins for which complete sequences have already been determined. It is hypothesized that because the crystallins exhibit remarkable stability over the lifetime of the individual, they should contain asparagine and glutamine residues that are relatively resistant toin vivo deamidation. By using synthetic peptides corresponding to expected amidated and deamidated tryptic fragments, it is now possible to determine precisely the optimal high pressure liquid chromatography gradient to separate the two forms from themselves and from other contaminating peptides. A key part of this methodology involves the sequential use of two different ion-pairing agents, trifluoroacetic acid and heptafluorobutyric acid, in the acetonitrile gradients. Previous studies have demonstrated that these two reagents differentially interact with peptides (5Guo D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 386: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), making it possible to resolve and quantitate the presence of specific sequences among the hundreds of peptides present in a tryptic digest of total lens. In addition, it is anticipated that this experimental approach can be used to quantitate deamidation of specific asparagine and glutamine residues in any aged tissue, where it is expected that many peptide fragments will be generated after tryptic digestion.Previous studies using α-A crystallin purified from total proteins from the same region of the aged human lens have suggested that some, but not all, selected glutamine residues were also resistant to age-related deamidation (2Takemoto L. Boyle D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13681-13685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because α-A crystallin has a sequence and probable structure completely different from the β/γ crystallins, the present study has investigated the possibility that a member of the β/γ family of crystallins might also contain glutamine and/or asparagine residues resistant to deamidation. The β and γ crystallins of the human lens have related sequences and similar structures, together making up the bulk of proteins from the lens.The results of the current study demonstrate that one of the major members of the β/γ crystallin family, γ-S crystallin, contains some glutamine and asparagine residues that are extremely resistant toin vivo deamidation, consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to age-dependent deamidation is a property common to long-lived proteins. Specific tryptic peptides were chosen that contained only a single glutamine or asparagine residue. This experimental approach minimized the number of synthetic peptide standards necessary for development of the optimal acetonitrile gradients. With the appropriate synthetic peptides, however, this same methodology can also be used to identify and quantitate deamidation in tryptic fragments containing multiple glutamine and/or asparagine residues.Recently, mass spectral analysis has been used to approximate the deamidation of various glutamine and asparagine residues of γ-S crystallin from whole human lens (7Hanson S.R. Smith D.L. Smith J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results suggested that glutamine 92 and glutamine 170 undergo significant deamidation during the aging process. The reasons for the discrepancy with the present results are not known, but it may be related to differences in the methods of quantitation. In addition, the previous study (7Hanson S.R. Smith D.L. Smith J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) characterized the water-soluble fraction of whole lenses, whereas the present study quantitated possible deamidation of total proteins from the fetal-embryonic region of old lenses. A priori, one would expect increased deamidation in total proteins from the oldest part of the lens, although it is possible that increased deamidation may allow for a greater proportion of γ-S crystallin to be found in the water-soluble fraction. Further studies, involving quantitation of the same protein fraction by the two different methodologies, are necessary to obtain a more accurate determination of the extents of deamidation of these two residues.Although the reasons for the exceptional stability of glutamine 92, glutamine 96, asparagine 143, and glutamine 170 of γ-S crystallin toward age-related deamidation are not well understood, such information would be important in understanding the molecular basis of selective deamidation during the aging process. Analysis of the extent of deamidation of peptides and proteins has established that secondary protein structure (8Xie M. Schowen R.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 1999; 88: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), as well as the primary sequence near the asparagine residue (9Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may determine the lability toward deamidation. γ-S protein from aged human lens should provide an ideal system to study the effects of protein structure upon deamidation, because much is known about the three-dimensional structure of this polypeptide (10Zarina S. Slingsby C. Jaeniche R. Zaidi Z.H. Driessen H. Srinivasan N. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1840-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of this protein has suggested that glutamine 92, glutamine 96, asparagine 143, and glutamine 170 are all solvent-exposed. 1C. Slingsby, personal communication. Resistance to age-dependent deamidation for such residues may be particularly important because they may be involved in the short-range order of crystallins that has been hypothesized to be necessary for lens transparency (11Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar).In addition to the primary sequence, it is also possible that different environments of cells containing long-lived versusshort-lived proteins may play an important role in the stability of proteins in vivo. According to this theory, the same polypeptide sequence could have different half-lives depending upon cell-specific factors that may affect the rates of turnover. An excellent test of this hypothesis would be to determine the half-lives and rates of deamidation of crystallins in lens versusnon-lens tissue. With the methodology described in this report, it should be possible to quantitate the deamidation rates of all major crystallin species in different tissues, to obtain unique insights into protein structural parameters and/or cellular environments that may result in the differential resistance of specific glutamine and asparagine residues toward in vivo deamidation. Probably the most common post-translational modification occurring in living systems involves nonenzymatic deamidation of glutamine and asparagine residues. This process occurs during the differentiation and/or aging of cells, resulting in the accumulation of glutamate and aspartate, respectively. Because deamidation results in the introduction of negative charges, it is possible that deamidation may play a major role in protein structural changes that are known to occur in development and aging. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that deamidation may have a major effect upon the turnover rate of proteins (1Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 248-295Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis has been the observation that proteins that turn over rapidly generally have greater rates of deamidation, whereas proteins that are more stable have glutamine and/or asparagine residues that are more resistant to this process (1Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 248-295Google Scholar). Perhaps the most stable proteins in the body are α, β, and γ crystallins found in the lens. Because of the inability of differentiated fiber cells to synthesize appreciable amounts of new protein, lens crystallins must remain relatively intact during the entire lifetime of the individual. The central, fetal-embryonic region of an aged human lens contains crystallins that were synthesized during the prenatal period of lens growth. Characterization of these crystallins should be a good test of the hypothesis that stable proteins, which contain glutamine and asparagine residues, have very low rates of deamidation. Previous studies have shown that α-A crystallin, purified from total proteins of the human lens, contains some glutamine residues that are resistant to in vivodeamidation (2Takemoto L. Boyle D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13681-13685Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the β and γ crystallins belong to a different family of lens proteins, and because they comprise the majority of proteins present in the dry weight material of the lens, it is important to verify whether asparagine and glutamine residues in this class of lens proteins are also relatively resistant toin vivo deamidation. Unfortunately, it is impossible to purify any of the β and γ crystallins from the aged human lens because they undergo a series of post-translational reactions that results in extensive heterogeneity in their molecular weights and charge properties. In addition, in the aged human lens, a significant percentage of β and γ crystallins are water insoluble, making it even more difficult to quantitatively assess the degree of deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues of specific crystallins. To circumvent these difficulties, we first used trypsin to digest total lens proteins from the fetal-embryonic region of aged human lenses and followed this by using synthetic peptides corresponding to selected amidated and deamidated tryptic peptides of γ-S crystallin. These synthetic peptides have been used as markers, to develop the optimal acetonitrile gradients for separation of amidated and deamidated peptides. Because of the large number of tryptic peptides generated from treatment of lens proteins, when necessary we have also used sequential gradients containing different ion-pairing agents to resolve the amidated and deamidated species. As an indication of possible deamidation reactions occurring in the β and γ crystallins during aging, we have chosen to resolve possible amidated and deamidated species of glutamine 92, glutamine 96, asparagine 143, and glutamine 170 from γ-S crystallin. The results of our analyses demonstrate no detectable deamidation of these residues during the entire lifetime of lenses from aged human"
https://openalex.org/W2035222222,"We have recently identified an Egr1 motif that overlaps with the Sp1 element in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. Here we examine whether this motif has a functional role in the regulation of TH transcription in PC12 cells. In nuclear extracts from control PC12 cells, an oligonucleotide containing the TH Sp1/Egr1 motif binds Sp1-containing complexes. Treatment of PC12 cells with phorbol ester (2 micrometer 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) gives rise to a new Egr1-containing complex. TPA treatment reduces the steady-state levels of the Sp1 protein and leads to the appearance of immunoreactive Egr1 protein within 30-60 min. Expression of the Egr1 protein in PC12 cells stimulates the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene placed under the control of the first 272 nucleotides of the rat TH promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of either the Sp1/Egr1 motif or of an upstream AP-1 motif or both abolishes the Egr1-mediated induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. An oligonucleotide encompassing the AP-1/E-box sequence of the rat TH promoter competes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays for binding of nuclear extracts from control and TPA-treated cells to an oligonucleotide containing the Sp1/Egr1 element, indicating that these two enhancers may interact. The results show that Egr1 can activate TH transcription and reveals cross-talk between Sp1/Egr1 and AP-1 factors."
https://openalex.org/W2046789203,"In this study, regulation of transcription factor NF-E2 was examined in differentiating erythroid and myeloid cells, and the impact of raising NF-E2 concentrations within these cell types was assessed. NF-E2 was expressed in the J2E erythroid cell line, but the levels increased only marginally during erythropoietin-induced differentiation. In contrast, rare myeloid variants of J2E cells did not express NF-E2. Although NF-E2 was present in M1 monoblastoid cells, it was undetectable as these cells matured into macrophages. Compared with erythroid cells, transcription of the NF-E2 gene was reduced, and the half-life of the mRNA was significantly shorter in monocytoid cells. Ectopic expression of NF-E2 had a profound impact upon the J2E cells; morphologically mature erythroid cells spontaneously emerged in culture, but the cells failed to synthesize hemoglobin, even in the presence of erythropoietin. Although proliferation and viability increased in the NF-E2-transfected J2E cells, their responsiveness to erythropoietin was severely diminished. Strikingly, increasing the expression of NF-E2 in M1 cells produced sublines that contained erythroid or immature megakaryocytic cells. Finally, overexpression of NF-E2 in primary hemopoietic progenitors from fetal liver increased erythroid colony formation in the absence of erythropoietin. These data demonstrate that elevated NF-E2 (i) had a dominant effect on the phenotype and maturation of J2E erythroid cells, (ii) was able to reprogram the M1 monocytoid line, and (iii) promoted the development of erythroid colonies by normal progenitors.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence is emerging that the concentration of transcription factors influences lineage commitment. Indeed, by manipulating the levels of transcription factors in cell lines, the plasticity of the hemopoietic system has been demonstrated (2Yamaguchi Y. Zon L.I. Ackerman S.J. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The phenomenon of hemopoietic lineage switching (4Klinken S.P. Alexander W.S. Adams J.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) probably occurs because of alterations to the levels of transcription factors. NF-E2 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that consists of a hemopoietic-restricted subunit (p45NF-E2) and a ubiquitously expressed subunit belonging to the Maf family of proteins (5Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 6Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Btomage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). NF-E2 is expressed primarily in erythroid cells, but is also found at lower levels in progenitor, megakaryocytic, mast, and granulocytic cells (5Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). It binds to an extended AP-1-binding site, (T/C)GCTGA(G/C)TCA(T/C) (7Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowery C.H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, in vitro studies have implicated NF-E2 as a major regulator of hemoglobin production during erythropoiesis (17Andrews N.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). NF-E2 knockout mice display an unexpectedly mild diserythropoiesis. Alterations to the erythroid compartment are most pronounced in neonates, where anemia, dysmorphic red cells, and decreased hemoglobin content are observed (18Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, these mice die shortly after birth due to a lack of circulating platelets, indicating that NF-E2 plays a key role in megakaryopoiesis (19Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J.M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). While megakaryocytes are present in the NF-E2−/− mice, they have aberrant distribution of demarcation membranes and platelet fields in their cytoplasm (19Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J.M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Although megakaryocytes in these mice can respond to thrombopoietin, they fail to produce platelets, suggesting that NF-E2 is required in the late stages of megakaryopoiesis (19Shivdasani R.A.

Blood. 1999; 94: 3037-3047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that NF-E2 is required for megakaryocyte proliferation as well as differentiation. To date, NF-E2 has been shown to bind to the promoter and to regulate the expression of only one megakaryocytic gene, viz. thromboxane synthase (23Deveaux S. Cohen-Kaminsky S. Shivdasani R.A. Andrews N.C. Filipe A. Kuzniak I. Orkin S.H. Romeo P.H. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To further examine the effect of NF-E2 in different hemopoietic lineages, we generated J2E erythroid and M1 monoblastoid cell lines that express NF-E2 ectopically. J2E cells are erythropoietin (epo)1-responsive and show enhanced proliferation and viability, morphological maturation, and accumulation of hemoglobin when exposed to the hormone (24Klinken S.P. Nicola N.A. Johnson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8506-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P.

However, under adverse conditions, J2E cells have occasionally switched lineage and displayed the phenotype of monocytoid cells (27Keil U. Busfield S.J. Farr T.J. Papadimitriou J. Green A.R. Begley C.G. Klinken S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, M1 cells are immature myeloid cells that develop into macrophages in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (28Lotem J. Shabo Y. Sachs L. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1989; 3: 804-807PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that excess NF-E2 promoted a mature erythroid phenotype in both J2E and M1 cell lines and the appearance of immature megakaryocytes in one clone of the M1 cells. Furthermore, the higher level of NF-E2 in J2E cells interfered with hemoglobin synthesis, proliferation, viability, and responsiveness to epo. Erythroid colony formation by nontransformed progenitors was also enhanced by elevated NF-E2 levels. These data demonstrate that changing the concentration of NF-E2 in hemopoietic cells has a profound effect on their phenotype. The J2E (24Klinken S.P. Nicola N.A. Johnson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For differentiation studies, M1 cells were stimulated with either LIF (5 ng/ml) or IL-6 (32 ng/ml), whereas J2E cells were induced with epo (5 units/ml). Cell viability was determined by eosin exclusion (25Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 412-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hemoglobin synthesis was determined by benzidine (29Cooper M.C. Levy J. Cantor L.N. Marks P.A. Rifkind P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hemoglobin. 1995; 19: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) staining. Proliferation assays were performed on cells transferred to RPMI 1640 medium (Biosciences, New South Wales, Australia) immediately before the assay. Cultures were then established at 103 cells/100 μl and stimulated with epo for 16 h before being pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for 4 h. Cell morphology was examined by cytocentrifuging cells onto glass slides and immersion in Wright's stain. For hemoglobin spectra, cells (5 × 107) were lysed in water for 1 h on ice, and scans were performed between 350 and 700 nm. Expression of the epo receptor was determined by cytocentrifuging cells onto glass slides, fixing in 2.5% paraformaldehyde, and incubating in the presence of an anti-epo receptor polyclonal antibody, followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and examination by immunofluorescence. The rabbit anti-epo receptor antibody was made using the extracellular domain of the epo receptor fused to glutathioneS-transferase as the immunizing agent. The retroviral vector pRuf(tk)Neo (31Rayner J.R. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was used to express the entire coding region of p45NF-E2. The packaging cell line PA317 was then transfected with the retroviral construct by calcium phosphate precipitation (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar), and supernatants containing amphotropic retroviruses were used to infect J2E and M1 cells. Cells were selected in Geneticin (Sigma) before cloning in methylcellulose as described elsewhere (26Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P.

Six to twelve independent colonies were isolated for each construct, and integration of the construct was confirmed by Southern analysis. The NF-E2 retroviral construct was also transfected in Ψ2 cells, and ecotropic virus-containing supernatants were used to infect day 12 fetal liver cells. These cell were then placed in methylcellulose cultures as described previously (33Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P.

For run-on transcription assays, nuclei were prepared from 1 × 108 cells, and the assays were performed using modifications of the methods of Piechaczyk et al. (43Piechaczyk K. Yang J.Q. Blamchard J.H. Jeanteur P. Marcu K. Cell. 1985; 42: 589-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Linial et al. (44Linial G. Gunderson N. Groudine M. Science. 1985; 230: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) as we described elsewhere (35Busfield S.J. Chappell D.S. Jennings G. Trengrove N.J. Riches K.J. Callus B.A. Tilbrook P.A. Klinken S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 429-437PubMed Google Scholar). Nylon filters were prepared containing 5 μg of NF-E2 and GAPDH. Typically, 2 × 107 cpm of labeled RNA in 2 ml of hybridization buffer was added to each filter. All quantitation was performed using ImageQuant Version 1.1 software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). To monitor changes in NF-E2 levels during erythroid differentiation, J2E cells were stimulated with epo. Untreated J2E cells expressed the transcription factor, and the levels of NF-E2 transcripts and protein increased slightly during epo-induced differentiation (Fig.1, A and B). Although the rise was modest (20–50%), it was reproducible. These observations are consistent with a marginal increase in NF-E2 transcription determined by nuclear run-on assay (data not shown). Since J2E cells have occasionally generated mutants that have switched lineage and developed a monocytoid phenotype (27Keil U. Busfield S.J. Farr T.J. Papadimitriou J. Green A.R. Begley C.G. Klinken S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar), NF-E2 expression was examined in these myeloid variants. Significantly, NF-E2 transcription was down-regulated 20–95% in these myeloid lines (Fig.1 C); moreover, NF-E2 mRNA and protein were detected only in J2E-m1 and J2E-m2 cells, the least mature of the monocytoid variants (Fig. 1, D and E). These results indicated that NF-E2 expression was markedly down-regulated in cells displaying a more differentiated monocytic phenotype. To examine changes in NF-E2 levels during monocytic/macrophage maturation more closely, the M1 monoblastoid cell line was induced to differentiate with either IL-6 or LIF. Although uninduced M1 cells expressed NF-E2, both the transcript and protein disappeared as the cells differentiated (Fig.2, A and B). The NF-E2 gene was transcribed in all myeloid variants of J2E cells (Fig. 1 C), but little mRNA was detected in most lines; we therefore predicted that the transcript might be less stable in monocytoid cells. To determine whether differences in NF-E2 mRNA stability existed between erythroid and myeloid cells, actinomycin D was added to cultures of J2E and M1 cells, and the decay of NF-E2 mRNA was monitored. Fig. 2 C shows that NF-E2 transcripts had a half-life of ∼80 min in the J2E erythroid cells, compared with only 25 min in M1 monocytoid cells. This abbreviated half-life did not alter appreciably during M1 maturation (data not shown). Together, the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 show that NF-E2 levels increased slightly during erythroid differentiation, but declined markedly with monocytic maturation via transcriptional and post-transcriptional means. To determine the consequences of raising NF-E2 levels in erythroid and myeloid cells, J2E and M1 cells were infected with a retroviral vector containing the entire coding region of NF-E2; these clones were called JNF and MNF, respectively. Numerous clones were obtained, and those displaying the highest expression are shown in Fig.3 (A and B). Although the virally encoded NF-E2 RNA was up to four times more abundant than endogenous transcripts, NF-E2 protein content rose moderately, indicating that translation, or polypeptide stability, may play an important role in determining the final protein content. Interestingly, there was no appreciable alteration in endogenous NF-E2 transcripts. Although virally produced NF-E2 RNA was present throughout epo-initiated differentiation of JNF cells, both viral and endogenous NF-E2 transcripts decreased during LIF-induced maturation in the M1 transfectants (Fig. 3 C). Since transcription from this retroviral vector continues throughout myeloid maturation, 2T. J. Gonda, personal communication. this result supports the observation of increased turnover of NF-E2 RNA in monocytic cells (Fig. 2 C). When stimulated with epo, a significant proportion of J2E cells undergo morphological maturation and synthesize hemoglobin (24Klinken S.P. Nicola N.A. Johnson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8506-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 412-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An example of epo-induced morphological change is shown in Fig.4 A, where some cells display condensed nuclei on the verge of extrusion, whereas others have the appearance of enucleate reticulocytes. The proportion of cells that retain an immature proerythroblastoid phenotype and those with a more differentiated morphology is summarized in Fig. 4 C. Surprisingly, numerous mature erythroid cells and reticulocytes were detected in JNF cells in the absence of epo (Fig. 4, B andC); however, these numbers did not change following epo stimulation (Fig. 4 C). Thus, increasing the concentration of NF-E2 in these erythroid cells promoted spontaneous morphological maturation. The other characteristic feature of erythroid terminal differentiation is hemoglobin synthesis. The presence of hemoglobin in parental J2E cells and JNF19 and JNF26 cultures was assessed initially by benzidine staining. Fig. 5 A shows that, as anticipated, J2E cells produced more hemoglobin after epo stimulation (24Klinken S.P. Nicola N.A. Johnson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8506-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 412-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, the JNF19 and JNF26 cells synthesized negligible amounts of hemoglobin in the absence of epo, and these levels did not rise when the hormone was added to the cultures. To confirm this unexpected observation, hemoglobin levels were ascertained by spectral scans. The data shown in Fig. 5 Bdemonstrate that unstimulated J2E cells contain hemoglobin with absorbance peaks appearing at 413, 540, and 577 nm, whereas significantly reduced levels were detected in JNF19 and JNF26 cells. Therefore, elevating NF-E2 levels in J2E cells enhanced morphological maturation, but suppressed hemoglobin synthesis. In addition to morphological changes and hemoglobin synthesis, J2E cells respond to epo with a burst of proliferation and remain more viable under serum-free conditions (24Klinken S.P. Nicola N.A. Johnson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8506-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Busfield S.J. Klinken S.P.

Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 103-113Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of increasing NF-E2 concentrations on replication rate and cell survival was examined next. Interestingly, raising the levels of NF-E2 in J2E cells increased the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (Fig. 5 C) and the rate of cell division (data not shown). Although uptake of labeled thymidine was 3–5-fold greater in JNF cells compared with the parental line, they failed to respond to epo (Fig. 5 C). Similarly, cells expressing exogenous NF-E2 remained more viable in the absence of serum, but reacted moderately to the addition of epo (Fig.5 D). Taken together, altering NF-E2 levels in J2E cells had a dramatic impact on their phenotype, as morphological appearance, hemoglobin synthesis, cell division, and viability were all affected by raising the intracellular concentration of NF-E2. The immature M1 monoblastoid cell develops into macrophages following exposure to a number of agents, including IL-6 and LIF (Fig.6 A). Despite their apparent commitment to the monocytic pathway, introduction of GATA-1 has been shown to induce the appearance of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in these cultures (2Yamaguchi Y. Zon L.I. Ackerman S.J. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Fig. 6 A shows that increased NF-E2 levels in M1 cells promoted the emergence of erythroid cells in two of three sublines. Both MNF4 and MNF11 cultures contained up to 5% erythroid cells, varying from proerythroblast to orthochromatic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. These cells were also present in cultures exposed to LIF, although their proportion did not change (Fig.6 A). A number of hemoglobin-producing cells (3–7%) were detected in these cultures (Fig. 6 B), and surface epo receptors were identified by immunofluorescence (Fig. 6 C). In contrast with the MNF4 and MNF11 lines, the MNF12 clone contained some very large cells that had the appearance of megakaryocytic precursors (Fig. 6 A). However, these cells did not contain acetylcholinesterase (data not shown) and disappeared from culture after the addition of LIF. These data demonstrate that, like GATA-1 (2Yamaguchi Y. Zon L.I. Ackerman S.J. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NF-E2 can force M1 cells to alter their appearance and to display an erythroid or immature megakaryocytic phenotype. M1 cells have also been transfected with SCL, another transcription factor important for erythroid cells (46Tanigawa T. Nicola N. McArthur G.A. Strasser A. Begley C.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 379-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these transfectants did not display any erythroid features, macrophage differentiation was impeded. To examine whether NF-E2 also inhibited the maturation of M1 cells, cultures were exposed to LIF and monitored for the expression of Mac-1, a macrophage surface marker. Fig.7 A shows that, unlike SCL (46Tanigawa T. Nicola N. McArthur G.A. Strasser A. Begley C.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 379-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NF-E2 did not interfere with macrophage maturation. Similar results were obtained at all time points and concentrations of LIF examined (data not shown). The difference between the effects of these two transcription factors may be due, in part, to the degradation of NF-E2 as M1 cells mature (Fig. 3 C). To examine the effect of ectopic NF-E2 expression on other erythroid-restricted transcription factors, Northern blots were probed for the presence of GATA-1 and EKLF mRNAs. Fig. 7 B shows that elevated NF-E2 did not induce expression of GATA-1 or EKLF. It is possible that NF-E2 was able to impose an erythroid phenotype on M1 cells without an obvious increase in GATA-1 and EKLF; however, it is likely that subtle changes occurred to GATA-1 and EKLF that were not detected by Northern blotting of total RNA. Having observed noticeable effects of exogenous NF-E2 expression in cell lines, the consequences of NF-E2 overexpression were examined in primary hemopoietic progenitors. To this end, fetal liver cells were infected with a NF-E2 retrovirus, and colony formation was enumerated 7 days later. Significantly, a 3–4-fold increase in burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) was detected in cultures expressing NF-E2 ectopically (Fig. 8). These colonies were pale and appeared to contain less hemoglobin than controls. Despite the rise in BFU-E with NF-E2, there was no increase in colony formation after treatment with epo. In contrast, exposure to the NF-E2 retrovirus reduced the number of myeloid colonies slightly. These data are consistent with the effects of NF-E2 overexpression in J2E cells (Figs.4 and 5) and demonstrate that normal erythroid progenitors in particular are influenced by the concentration of NF-E2. In this study, we have demonstrated that ectopic expression of NF-E2 had a profound effect on erythroid and monoblastoid cells. In the J2E erythroid cell line, this was manifest by markedly increased proliferation rates, spontaneous morphological maturation, suppressed hemoglobin synthesis, and enhanced viability. Responsiveness to epo was also greatly diminished. These effects in J2E cells are compatible with increased epo-independent BFU-E generated by overexpression of NF-E2 in primary erythroid progenitors. In contrast, enforced NF-E2 expression resulted in the appearance of erythroid or megakaryoblast-like cells in the M1 monoblastoid cultures. The effect of exogenous NF-E2 on J2E cells is remarkably similar to the effects of overexpressing GATA-1 in murine erythroleukemia cells (47Whyatt D.J. Karis A. Harkes I.C. Verkerk A. Gillemans N. Elefanty A.G. Vairo G. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In both cases, cell division was promoted, at the expense of hemoglobin production. Since NF-E2 has been implicated in the regulation of globin gene transcription in vitro (15Lu S.J. Rowan S. Ban M.R. Ben-David Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8398-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and neonatal NF-E2−/− mice are anemic due to reduced hemoglobin content (18Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the inhibition of hemoglobin production in J2E cells due to excess NF-E2 was unexpected. It is possible that by altering the NF-E2 concentration in the cells, albeit modestly (Fig.3), the equilibrium with other transcription factors has been modified. NF-E2 is known to heterodimerize with members of the Maf family (6Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Btomage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and to bind the thyroid hormone receptor (48Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The severe biological consequences of changing NF-E2 concentration in these cells may be due to disruption of these nuclear complexes. An interesting aspect of this study involved the uncoupling of cytological changes from hemoglobin production in J2E cells. Here, excess NF-E2 promoted spontaneous morphological maturation, without concomitant hemoglobin synthesis, suggesting that two processes regulated coordinately during erythroid terminal differentiation can be dissected. These observations support previous data in EKLF null mice, in which mature red blood cells lacking hemoglobin are produced (49Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar,50Neuz B. Mikalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition, down-regulation of EKLF in J2E cells does not prevent reticulocyte formation in the absence of hemoglobin production (51Spadaccini A. Tilbrook P.A. Sarna M.K. Crossley M. Bieker J.J. Klinken S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23793-23798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Significantly, NF-E2−/− mice contain dysmorphic red cells, particularly in neonates (18Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); moreover, numerous defective red cell fragments are present in NF-E2−/− mice (22Levin J. Peng J.P. Baker G.R. Villeval J.L. Lecine P. Burstein S.A. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 3037-3047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that NF-E2 may be an important determinant in the development of morphologically mature erythroid cells. The expression pattern of NF-E2 during J2E cell differentiation is consistent with several other models of erythropoiesis. Labbayeet al. (52Labbaye C. Valtieri M. Barberi T. Meccia E. Masella B. Pelosi E. Condorelli G.L. Testa U. Peschle C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2346-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that NF-E2 is expressed throughout the development of normal erythroid cells, and NF-E2 levels remain elevated in chemically induced murine erythroleukemia and K562 cells (53Nagai T.

Molle I. Trentasaux C. Jeannesson P. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, EKLF levels are consistently raised during epo-induced differentiation of J2E cells (51Spadaccini A. Tilbrook P.A. Sarna M.K. Crossley M. Bieker J.J. Klinken S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23793-23798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas GATA-1 levels decrease late in the maturation process (36Busfield S.J. Spadaccini A. Riches K.J. Tilbrook P.A. Klinken S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of NF-E2 in myeloid variants of J2E cells as well as in differentiating M1 cells agrees with the lack of NF-E2 in normal myeloid cells (52Labbaye C. Valtieri M. Barberi T. Meccia E. Masella B. Pelosi E. Condorelli G.L. Testa U. Peschle C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2346-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The suppression of NF-E2 in myeloid cells was due not only to reduced transcription of the gene, but also to increased turnover of the transcripts (Figs. 1 and2). The reduction in virally generated NF-E2 in maturing M1 cells suggests that some instability elements may exist within the coding region of the mRNA, as has been described for other transcripts such as c-fos (55Chen C.Y. You Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, NF-E2 levels did not decrease when J2E cells developed an immature monocytoid appearance due to the introduction of the hemopoietic lineage switch gene HLS7(33Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is homologous to the novel human oncogene MLF1(56Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Caroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265PubMed Google Scholar). The emergence of erythroid cells in M1 cultures expressing NF-E2 is significant. Clearly, this transcription factor is turned off during monocytic terminal differentiation (Fig. 2), and ectopic expression has generated clones containing erythroid cells. This observation is similar to the introduction of GATA-1 into M1 cells, resulting in the appearance of cells with an erythroid phenotype (2Yamaguchi Y. Zon L.I. Ackerman S.J. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of cells resembling megakaryoblasts in one clone of M1 cells expressing exogenous NF-E2 is also comparable with the data of Yamaguchi et al. (2Yamaguchi Y. Zon L.I. Ackerman S.J. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is consistent with the crucial role of NF-E2 in megakaryocyte development identified in knockout mice (19Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J.M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate M1 cells have a propensity to generate erythroid and megakaryocytic cells if the transcription factor ratio is altered. The reprogramming of M1 cells by NF-E2 is also similar to the ability of GATA-1 to generate erythroblasts, thromboblasts, and eosinophils from transformed myelomonocytic cells (3Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NF-E2 in primary hemopoietic cells substantially increased BFU-E numbers in the absence of epo, but only slightly reduced myeloid colony formation. These data reflect the impact of exogenous NF-E2 on J2E and M1 cell lines and suggest that increased NF-E2 expression favors erythroid development over myeloid maturation in agreement with the role of NF-E2 in erythroid gene regulation (8Mignotte V.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although elevated NF-E2 promoted BFU-E formation, the colonies appeared pale and poorly hemoglobinized, which was similar to the increased proliferation and reduced hemoglobin synthesis observed in JNF cells. Thus, as seen with the NF-E2−/−mice (18Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Levin J. Peng J.P. Baker G.R. Villeval J.L. Lecine P. Burstein S.A. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 3037-3047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the correct concentration of NF-E2 is essential for complete development of red blood cells. It is possible that rapid degradation of NF-E2 transcripts in myeloid cells (Fig. 2) may have prevented a more significant effect on colony formation in that lineage. Taken together, the information presented here on ectopic NF-E2 expression in normal and immortalized cells highlights the importance of transcription factor concentrations during the development and terminal differentiation of hemopoietic cells (1Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interference with this delicate balance can have dramatic ramifications for the production of fully functional blood cells. Recombinant human epo (Eprex) was a generous gift from Drs. J. Adams and J. Patava (Jansen-Cilag, Sidney, Australia). We thank Jennifer Beaumont for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2002049971,"Osmotic shock treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes an increase in glucose transport activity and translocation of GLUT4 protein similar to that elicited by insulin treatment. Insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport activity was completely inhibited by wortmannin, however, activation by osmotic shock was only partially blocked. Additionally, we have found that the newly identified insulin receptor substrate Gab-1 (Grb2-associated binder-1) is tyrosine-phosphorylated following sorbitol stimulation. Treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibited osmotic shock-stimulated Gab-1 phosphorylation as well as shock-induced glucose transport. Furthermore, pretreatment with the selective Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 completely inhibited the ability of sorbitol treatment to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1. We have also shown that microinjection of anti-Gab-1 antibody inhibits osmotic shock-induced GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, phosphorylated Gab-1 binds and activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in response to osmotic shock. The PI3K activity associated with Gab-1 was 82% of that associated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, indicating that Gab-1 is the major site for PI3K recruitment following osmotic shock stimulation. Although wortmannin only causes a partial block of osmotic shock-stimulated glucose uptake, wortmannin completely abolishes Gab-1 associated PI3K activity. This suggests that other tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways, in addition to the Gab-1-PI3K pathway, contribute to osmotic shock-mediated glucose transport. To date, Gab-1 is the first protein identified as a member of the osmotic shock signal transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1967701644,"Abstract Previous studies in our laboratory have characterized 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) as a potent inhibitor of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in cultured cells (Steet, R., Alizadeh, M., Melancon, P., and Kuchta, R. D. (1999) Glycoconj. J. 16, 237–245; Yan, J.-P., Ilsley, D. D., Frohlick, C., Steet, R., Hall, E. T., Kuchta, R. D., and Melancon, P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22836–22841). Here, we report that AZT treatment of K562 cells results in significant alterations in the profile of N-linked oligosaccharides. Fractionation of [3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides from AZT-treated K562 cells using lectin affinity chromatography revealed striking changes in the branching and processing ofN-linked glycoconjugates. AZT treatment resulted in the production of fewer highly branched complex glycans (60% of control at 20 μm AZT) and a significant accumulation of core-fucosylated biantennary oligosaccharides. In addition, extension of branched oligosaccharides with multiple poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats is nearly abolished by AZT concentrations as low as 2 μm. A shift from multiantennary to moderately branched oligosaccharides was also apparent in the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-30 upon AZT treatment.N-Linked glycans from both cell lines exhibited increased affinity for the β-galactoside-binding lectin RCA-I in the presence of AZT, suggesting that the addition of terminal sialic acid is sensitive to the drug. These results demonstrate the ability of AZT to modulate strongly the processing of asparagine-linked glycoconjugates in whole cells and reveal a novel mechanism by which AZT treatment may cause anemia."
https://openalex.org/W1986517933,"The C-terminal regulatory segment of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase folds back on its catalytic core to inhibit kinase activity. This regulatory segment consists of autoinhibitory residues linking the catalytic core to the calmodulin-binding sequence and perhaps additional C-terminal residues including an immunoglobulin-like motif. However, mutational and biochemical analyses showed no specific involvement of residues C-terminal to the calmodulin-binding sequence. To obtain additional insights on the proposed mechanisms for autoinhibition and Ca2+/calmodulin activation of the kinase, the polypeptide backbone chain of myosin light chain kinase was cleaved by genetic means to produce N- and C-terminal protein fragments. The N-terminal fragment containing the catalytic core was catalytically inactive when expressed alone. Co-expression of the N-terminal fragment with the C-terminal fragment containing the regulatory segment restored kinase activity. Deletion of the autoinhibitory linker residues without or with the calmodulin-binding sequence prevented restoration of kinase activity. In the presence or absence of Ca2+/calmodulin, regulatory segment binding occurred through the linker region connecting the catalytic core to the calmodulin-binding sequence. Collectively, these results indicate that residues C-terminal to the calmodulin-binding sequence (including the immunoglobulin-like motif) are not functional components of the regulatory segment. Furthermore, the principal autoinhibitory motif is contained in the sequence linking the catalytic core of myosin light chain kinase to the calmodulin-binding sequence."
