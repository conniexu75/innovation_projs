https://openalex.org/W2218418953,"During systems-level consolidation, mnemonic representations initially reliant on the hippocampus are thought to migrate to neocortical sites for more permanent storage, with an eminent role of sleep for facilitating this information transfer. Mechanistically, consolidation processes have been hypothesized to rely on systematic interactions between the three cardinal neuronal oscillations characterizing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Under global control of de- and hyperpolarizing slow oscillations (SOs), sleep spindles may cluster hippocampal ripples for a precisely timed transfer of local information to the neocortex. We used direct intracranial electroencephalogram recordings from human epilepsy patients during natural sleep to test the assumption that SOs, spindles and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. Employing cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses, we found that spindles were modulated by the up-state of SOs. Notably, spindles were found to in turn cluster ripples in their troughs, providing fine-tuned temporal frames for the hypothesized transfer of hippocampal memory traces."
https://openalex.org/W2205886515,"CD47 is a widely expressed cell surface protein that functions as a regulator of phagocytosis mediated by cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. CD47 serves as the ligand for a receptor on these innate immune cells, SIRP-alpha, which in turn delivers an inhibitory signal for phagocytosis. We previously found increased expression of CD47 on primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells, and demonstrated that blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 enabled the phagocytosis and elimination of AML, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and many solid tumors in xenograft models. Here, we report the development of a humanized anti-CD47 antibody with potent efficacy and favorable toxicokinetic properties as a candidate therapeutic. A novel monoclonal anti-human CD47 antibody, 5F9, was generated, and antibody humanization was carried out by grafting its complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human IgG4 format. The resulting humanized 5F9 antibody (Hu5F9-G4) bound monomeric human CD47 with an 8 nM affinity. Hu5F9-G4 induced potent macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of primary human AML cells in vitro and completely eradicated human AML in vivo, leading to long-term disease-free survival of patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, Hu5F9-G4 synergized with rituximab to eliminate NHL engraftment and cure xenografted mice. Finally, toxicokinetic studies in non-human primates showed that Hu5F9-G4 could be safely administered intravenously at doses able to achieve potentially therapeutic serum levels. Thus, Hu5F9-G4 is actively being developed for and has been entered into clinical trials in patients with AML and solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02216409)."

They find trait-associated SNPs at 12 loci, some of which are associated with methylation at nearby CpG sites. We carried out a trans-ancestry genome-wide association and replication study of blood pressure phenotypes among up to 320,251 individuals of East Asian, European and South Asian ancestry. We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 × 10−11 to 5.0 × 10−21). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 × 10−6). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation."

Since the discovery of spindle apparatus in the 1800s (Lukács, 1981Lukács D. [Walter Flemming, discoverer of chromatin and mitotic cell division].Orv. Hetil. 1981; 122: 349-350PubMed Google Scholar), much attention has focused on how microtubules (MT) interact with chromosomes to ensure equal partitioning of chromosomes into daughter cells. Investigation of the mechanisms by which MTs and MT-associated proteins regulate mitosis (Walczak et al., 2010Walczak C.E. Cai S. Khodjakov A. Mechanisms of chromosome behaviour during mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is fueled by the ease of visualizing the spindle-shaped MT fibers, the disruption of chromosome segregation and cell division upon MT perturbation, and the discovery of tubulin (Oakley, 2000Oakley B.R.

Historically, this ill-defined spindle-associated material has been referred to as spindle matrix.

Despite these studies, the structural nature of the spindle matrix remains undefined and whether it constitutes a cohesive functional unit is unclear. In fact, some modeling and biophysical probing of spindle apparatus have not provided evidence for the existence of spindle matrix (Brugués and Needleman, 2014Brugués J. Needleman D. Physical basis of spindle self-organization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 18496-18500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Gatlin et al., 2010Gatlin J.C. Matov A. Danuser G.

Insights into the micromechanical properties of the metaphase spindle.Cell. 2011; 145: 1062-1074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, whether spindle matrix is a real structural element of spindle apparatus or a mere artifact induced upon depolymerization of spindle MTs remains an open question. Unlike membranous organelles, the spindle apparatus is not surrounded by membrane barrier during vertebrate mitosis. However, spindles may need to concentrate many components in order to support spatially and temporally diverse reactions. Consistently, tubulin and some SAFs are shown to be concentrated in the region where nascent spindle begins to assemble in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos (Hayashi et al., 2012Hayashi H. Kimura K. Kimura A. Localized accumulation of tubulin during semi-open mitosis in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This concentration process is independent of MTs but it requires nuclear envelope permeabilization and RanGTPase, which stimulates spindle assembly (Kalab et al., 1999Kalab P. Pu R.T. Dasso M. The ran GTPase regulates mitotic spindle assembly.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 481-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Ohba et al., 1999Ohba T. Nakamura M. Nishitani H.

Zheng Y. Stimulation of microtubule aster formation and spindle assembly by the small GTPase Ran.Science. 1999; 284: 1359-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Proteins, such as elastin and elastin-like peptides, can undergo liquid-liquid phase transition or coacervation to form liquid droplets (Yeo et al., 2011Yeo G.C. Keeley F.W. Weiss A.S. Coacervation of tropoelastin.Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2011; 167: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The phase separation has been proposed to promote concentration of molecules into the liquid droplets, which can then facilitate biochemical reactions (Hyman et al., 2014Hyman A.A. Weber C.A. Jülicher F. Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 39-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Indeed, the liquid droplet feature of P granules and nucleoli is consistent with the idea that assembly and function of these non-membranous organelles could be driven by the phase transition of some of their structural components (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P. Eckmann C.R. Courson D.S. Rybarska A. Hoege C. Gharakhani J. Jülicher F. Hyman A.A. Germline P granules are liquid droplets that localize by controlled dissolution/condensation.Science. 2009; 324: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, Brangwynne et al., 2011Brangwynne C.P. Mitchison T.J. Hyman A.A. Active liquid-like behavior of nucleoli determines their size and shape in Xenopus laevis oocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 4334-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). No proteins of these organelles, however, have yet been shown to undergo functionally relevant phase transition. Interestingly, when engineered as multiple tandem repeats, SRC homology 3 (SH3) domains of NCK and proline-rich motif (PRM) of N-WASP form multivalent interactions, which allow the protein mixture to undergo phase transition to form liquid droplets. These droplets concentrate actin to promote F-actin assembly in vitro (Li et al., 2012Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L. Llaguno M. Hollingsworth J.V. King D.S. Banani S.F. et al.Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins.Nature. 2012; 483: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Despite the observed in vitro phase transition into liquid droplets, proteins have been shown to function in vivo via phase transition. Here, we examine the spindle regulatory protein BuGZ, which we noted contains evolutionarily conserved low complexity sequence, and demonstrate that it forms a MT-independent structure through temperature- and hydrophobic residue-dependent coacervation. This phase transition property allows the concentration of tubulin along MTs and supports assembly of spindle MTs and of the biochemically defined spindle matrix structure. Based on these results, we propose a model and line of investigation for further developing our understanding of observed properties and possible functions of spindle matrix. Our previous studies show that BuGZ binds MTs to promote kinetochore loading of Bub3 and chromosome alignment (Jiang et al., 2014Jiang H. He X. Wang S. Jia J. Wan Y. Wang Y. Zeng R. Yates 3rd, J. Zhu X. Zheng Y. A microtubule-associated zinc finger protein, BuGZ, regulates mitotic chromosome alignment by ensuring Bub3 stability and kinetochore targeting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 268-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We noticed that human BuGZ (hBuGZ) depletion in HeLa cells resulted in a more severe disruption of spindle morphology and reduction of MT intensity than those depleted of Bub3, especially when RNAi treatment was extended to 72 hr (Figures S1A and S1B). The more severe spindle defects in hBuGZ-depleted cells were consistent with a stronger chromosome misalignment than those depleted of hBub3 (Figure S1C). This suggests that BuGZ could directly regulate spindle assembly independent of Bub3′s kinetochore function. Previously, we developed a bead-based spindle assembly assay (Tsai and Zheng, 2005Tsai M.Y. Zheng Y. Aurora A kinase-coated beads function as microtubule-organizing centers and enhance RanGTP-induced spindle assembly.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2156-2163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) by tethering the mitotic kinase Aurora A to 2.8-μm magnetic beads via antibodies. These beads function as MT organizing centers to induce efficient spindle assembly in the cytostatic factor (CSF) arrested Xenopus egg extract (referred to as extract below) in the presence of RanGTP. Since spindles induced by Aurora A beads and RanGTP do not have chromosomes and kinetochores, we can test the kinetochore-independent function of BuGZ in spindle assembly. Immunodepletion of Xenopus BuGZ (xBuGZ) by ∼90% (Figure 1A) resulted in a significant reduction of astral MT length and bipolar spindle numbers (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1E). Most bipolar spindles formed in the absence of xBuGZ were also significantly shorter than those of controls (Figure 1D). These defects were fully rescued by purified xBuGZ (Figures 1A–1E). xBuGZ depletion also disrupted spindle assembly induced by sperm chromatin. Major phenotypes included spindles with MT aggregates surrounding sperm chromatin or spindles with reduced MTs, followed by asters, half spindles, or abnormal spindle shapes with normal MT density (Figures 1F–1H), and all of the defects were also rescued by purified xBuGZ (Figures 1F–1H). Thus BuGZ promotes spindle assembly independent of its kinetochore function. To understand how BuGZ promotes spindle assembly, we treated HeLa cells with control or hBuGZ siRNA and then depolymerized MTs in the cold. MT regrowth was examined after returning cells to 37°C. hBuGZ depletion greatly reduced astral MT regrowth, which was rescued by expressing the RNAi-insensitive wild-type mouse BuGZ (mBuGZ, Figures 1I and 1J). The N-terminal 92 amino acids of BuGZ bind directly to MTs, while the Gle2-binding sequence (GLEBS) within the C terminus of BuGZ directly binds and stabilizes Bub3 (Jiang et al., 2014Jiang H. He X. Wang S. Jia J. Wan Y. Wang Y. Zeng R. Yates 3rd, J. Zhu X. Zheng Y. A microtubule-associated zinc finger protein, BuGZ, regulates mitotic chromosome alignment by ensuring Bub3 stability and kinetochore targeting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 268-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Replacing the two highly conserved glutamic acids (E) in GLEBS with alanine (A) results in a mutant (mBuGZAA) that fails to bind and stabilize Bub3, while mBuGZΔN lacking the N-terminal 92 amino acids does not bind to spindles in vivo and MTs in vitro (Jiang et al., 2014Jiang H. He X. Wang S. Jia J. Wan Y. Wang Y. Zeng R. Yates 3rd, J. Zhu X. Zheng Y. A microtubule-associated zinc finger protein, BuGZ, regulates mitotic chromosome alignment by ensuring Bub3 stability and kinetochore targeting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 268-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The wild-type mBuGZ and mBuGZAA bound to spindle MTs and MTs assembled from pure tubulin (Figures S1D–S1F). To analyze which of these two known domains in BuGZ promotes assembly of spindle, we depleted endogenous hBuGZ from HeLa or U2OS cells by RNAi. BuGZ RNAi-induced spindle defects, judged by spindle MT intensity, were rescued fully by wild-type mBuGZ and partially by mBuGZAA, but not by mBuGZΔN (Figures 1J–1L). hBuGZ depletion did not alter interphase MT densities (Figure S1G). Thus MT binding of BuGZ promotes spindle MT assembly. Since BuGZ was identified as a spindle matrix component, we assayed for spindle matrix by assembling Aurora A-bead spindles in extract and then depolymerizing MTs using nocodazole at room temperature (RT) (Ma et al., 2009Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii J.R. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Requirement for Nudel and dynein for assembly of the lamin B spindle matrix.Nat.

A mitotic lamin B matrix induced by RanGTP required for spindle assembly.Science. 2006; 311: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The nocodazole-insensitive material that remains on the Aurora A beads, i.e., the spindle matrix, was isolated using a magnet and analyzed by western blotting or immunostaining probing known spindle matrix markers, lamin-B3 (LB3, the major lamin in extracts), dynein, Eg5, NuMA, and XMAP215 (Ma et al., 2009Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii J.R. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Requirement for Nudel and dynein for assembly of the lamin B spindle matrix.Nat.

Depleting xBuGZ greatly diminished recovery of the spindle matrix, but this was rescued by purified xBuGZ (see the Noc, RT panels in Figures 2A–2C ). Although xBuGZ depletion diminished the recovery of LB3, depleting LB3 did not affect association of xBuGZ with the spindle matrix (Figure S2A). Thus, BuGZ may function upstream of LB3 to promote spindle matrix assembly.Figure S2Effects of BuGZ and Temperature on Spindle Matrix, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Depletion of LB3 did not reduce xBuGZ amount in Aurora A bead-associated spindle matrix. xBuGZ depletion was used as a control.

When spindle MTs were depolymerized by nocodazole on ice, less matrices were associated with Aurora A beads than those incubated at RT (compare IgG matrix panels in Figures 2A and 2B). Quantification of LB3 staining revealed a significant reduction of matrices around beads upon cold treatment or upon xBuGZ depletion (Figure 2C). xBuGZ depletion plus cold treatment caused an additional matrix reduction that could be rescued by purified xBuGZ (Figure 2C). Thus spindle matrix assembly and stability require BuGZ and a physiological temperature. Unlike many MT-associated SAFs that decorate MT fibers densely and brightly, BuGZ appears as a loose “haze” enriched on spindles (Figure S1E) (Jiang et al., 2014Jiang H. He X. Wang S. Jia J. Wan Y. Wang Y. Zeng R. Yates 3rd, J. Zhu X. Zheng Y. A microtubule-associated zinc finger protein, BuGZ, regulates mitotic chromosome alignment by ensuring Bub3 stability and kinetochore targeting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 268-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When HeLa cells were incubated at RT or on ice for 5 min followed by immunostaining, we found that cold treatment diminished BuGZ signal on spindles, whether or not the spindle MTs were stabilized with Taxol (Figures 2D and S2B). xBuGZ signal was also reduced on cold-treated Aurora A-bead spindles stabilized by Taxol (Figure 2E). We then treated HeLa cells by Taxol and collected mitotic cells by shake-off. Detergent extraction of these cells on ice or at RT in the presence of Taxol followed by immunoblotting showed that more hBuGZ was extracted in the cold as compared to tubulin or CENP-A controls (Figure S2C). Immunostaining further indicated that spindle-associated hBuGZ was more sensitive to the extraction on ice than at RT (Figure 2F). We analyzed vertebrate BuGZ protein sequences using PONDR and SEG, programs designed to predict the disordered (Xue et al., 2010Xue B. Dunbrack R.L. Williams R.W. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N.

The recent discovery of two prevalent somatic mutations-C250T and C228T-in the TERT promoter in various cancers has provided insight into a plausible mechanism of TERT reactivation. Although the two hotspot mutations create a similar binding motif for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, we show that they are functionally distinct, in that the C250T unlike the C228T TERT promoter is driven by non-canonical NF-κB signalling. We demonstrate that binding of ETS to the mutant TERT promoter is insufficient in driving its transcription but this process requires non-canonical NF-κB signalling for stimulus responsiveness, sustained telomerase activity and hence cancer progression. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized role of non-canonical NF-κB signalling in tumorigenesis and elucidate a fundamental mechanism for TERT reactivation in cancers, which if targeted could have immense therapeutic implications."

Since the discovery of the first oncogene, Src (Stehelin et al., 1976Stehelin D. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Vogt P.K. DNA related to the transforming gene(s) of avian sarcoma viruses is present in normal avian DNA.Nature. 1976; 260: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and tumor suppressor, Rb (Friend et al., 1986Friend S.H. Bernards R. Rogelj S. Weinberg R.A. Rapaport J.M. Albert D.M. Dryja T.P. A human DNA segment with properties of the gene that predisposes to retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma.Nature. 1986; 323: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar), more than three decades ago, our understanding of some of the specific genetic aberrations supporting cancer progression has steadily risen. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the identification of large numbers of somatic cancer mutations through whole genome and exome sequencing of tumors. Given how complex it is to assess the relevance of this enormous repertoire of reported somatic cancer mutations (currently running in excess of 1 million variants) (Forbes et al., 2011Forbes S.A. Bindal N. Bamford S. Cole C. Kok C.Y. Beare D. Jia M. Shepherd R. Leung K. Menzies A. et al.COSMIC: mining complete cancer genomes in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D945-D950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar), the discovery of new somatic mutations has vastly outpaced our ability to unravel their functional roles (Figure S1A). Despite the fact that alterations to the physiological cellular responses to environmental cues are fundamental hallmarks of cancer cells (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22347) Google Scholar) and that cellular responses to input cues are driven by signaling networks, a comprehensive understanding of how mutations perturb these networks is still missing. In fact, new conceptual paradigms and computational strategies allowing better assessment of the intrinsic complexities of cancer cells, such as the integration of cancer genomic and proteomic data, have been recently pinpointed as key requirements in the field of cancer research (Weinberg, 2014Weinberg R.A. Coming full circle-from endless complexity to simplicity and back again.Cell. 2014; 157: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Yaffe, 2013Yaffe M.B. The scientific drunk and the lamppost: massive sequencing efforts in cancer discovery and treatment.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pe13Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Specifically, new approaches for decoding mutations that perturb signaling networks (or as we term them, “network-attacking” mutations [NAMs]) (Creixell et al., 2012aCreixell P. Schoof E.M. Erler J.T. Linding R. Navigating cancer network attractors for tumor-specific therapy.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the mechanisms by which they may statically or dynamically alter these networks will be fundamental in closing this gap (Figure S1B) (Yaffe, 2013Yaffe M.B. The scientific drunk and the lamppost: massive sequencing efforts in cancer discovery and treatment.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pe13Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we describe and validate such a conceptual and computational framework capable of identifying, classifying and unraveling the impact of numerous predicted NAMs. In order to evaluate whether cancer mutations perturb signaling networks, we initially developed a classification system with concrete types of NAMs. We divide NAMs into three fundamental classes. The first and relatively well-described type of NAM is one that disrupts signaling network dynamics by constitutively activating or inactivating a protein kinase, thereby maintaining the information flow either “on” or “off” uninterrupted over time. Examples of such “on” mutations are those substitutions that mimic activation loop phosphorylations, whereas examples of “off” mutations include those that alter catalytically essential residues of kinases, or residues in SH2 domains that are critical for phospho-tyrosine binding. Since the timely activation and termination of signals is critical for the proper cellular homeostasis as well as phenotypic responses to environmental stimuli, such mutations lead to aberrant information processing (Figure 1A). A second, largely undescribed type of NAMs are those mutations that shift the signaling network structure by “rewiring” upstream or downstream interactions (of the mutated protein or node). Upstream rewiring can be caused by mutations in a kinase substrate that disrupt the linear motif around a phosphorylation site, thus causing a new upstream kinase to phosphorylate the mutant substrate. Downstream rewiring, in contrast, can be caused by drifts in the peptide specificity upon mutation of the determinants of specificity (DoS) in kinase (or SH2) domains (Creixell et al., 2015Creixell P. Palmeri A. Miller C.J. Lou H.J. Santini C.C. Nielsen M. Turk B.E. Lining R. Unmasking determiniants of specifity in the human kinome.Cell. 2015; 163 (this issue): 187-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]) (Figure 1A). Finally, we hypothesized that a third type of NAMs could exist where mutations would generate or destroy phosphorylation sites, effectively generating new molecular logic gates in cancer cells (Figure 1A). Node inactivation and node activation would fall within the categories of what is traditionally referred to as loss-of-function and gain-of-function hypermorphic mutations, while the other mutations would fit best within a gain-of-function neomorphic classification. With the aim of systematically identifying NAMs in phosphorylation-based signaling networks, we developed a computational approach, ReKINect, capable of predicting these defined functional mutations (Figures 1A and 1B; http://ReKINect.science). We began by assembling comprehensive sequence and positional information covering all known 538 kinase domains, 111 SH2 domains, and 149,838 phosphorylation sites in the human proteome (refer to the Experimental Procedures for further information). This information facilitated the mapping of NAMs onto these domains and the modeling of the likely functional effect of mutations (Figure 1B). Mutations in established or predicted functional residues (essential residues on the different domains, determinants of specificity identified in our accompanying paper [Creixell et al., 2015Creixell P. Palmeri A. Miller C.J. Lou H.J. Santini C.C. Nielsen M. Turk B.E. Lining R. Unmasking determiniants of specifity in the human kinome.Cell. 2015; 163 (this issue): 187-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar] as well as phosphorylation sites) would then be predicted to lead to the dysregulation of network dynamics, network rewiring, and gain or loss of phosphorylation sites (Figure 1B). Below, we provide an overview, further details, and experimental evidence using a wide range of techniques (including genome-specific global phospho-proteomics, peptide specificity, or phenotypic data) for the different predictions generated by the ReKINect algorithm and explore the impact on signaling networks of the NAMs we identify. Having defined the different NAMs, we next intended to assess their existence and abundance in cancer. We thus collected a set of 678,050 unique missense somatic cancer variants from COSMIC (version 67) (Forbes et al., 2011Forbes S.A. Bindal N. Bamford S. Cole C. Kok C.Y. Beare D. Jia M. Shepherd R. Leung K. Menzies A. et al.COSMIC: mining complete cancer genomes in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D945-D950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar) and deployed ReKINect on this set to predict a large number of instances across the NAM classes (Figure 2). In order to experimentally investigate NAMs, we performed a global integrative analysis by combining exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based (phospho-)proteomics on a set of five ovarian cancer cell lines (ES2, OVAS, OVISE, TOV-21, and KOC-7C; Figures S1 and S2) and conducted genome-specific proteomics analyses (Experimental Procedures). By following a Spike-in SILAC-based labeling strategy (Geiger et al., 2011Geiger T. Wisniewski J.R. Cox J. Zanivan S. Kruger M. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Use of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture as a spike-in standard in quantitative proteomics.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Figures S1 and S2; Experimental Procedures), we could identify and accurately quantify on average more than 6,000 unique phosphorylation sites across over 2,000 proteins in each of the five cell lines. Furthermore, NGS identified close to 9,000 unique missense variants per cell line (including SNPs and germline mutations as well as somatic mutations) that were subsequently interpreted by ReKINect (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2 (and Data S1–S6) ReKINect could identify functional mutations covering each class of NAM included in our model as well as enrichments in these functional mutations (Figure S1). In addition, we computed the frequency at which different protein domains are affected by cancer mutations in the global repository of somatic cancer mutations as a means to provide general estimations of the likelihood of finding perturbations in different modular protein domains in cancer (Figure S1). Given our currently limited knowledge about the different processes that can lead to the different NAMs (e.g., phospho-mimicking mutations are the only case currently covered by ReKINect that result in kinase activation) the number of functional mutations presented in Figure 2 is most likely a significant underestimation. Nevertheless, in the following sections we provide further details and evidence supporting the existence of these predicted NAMs in cancer signaling networks. Having collected both exome sequencing and proteomic data on the same set of cancer cell lines, we were able to address the question of whether mutations could create new phosphorylation sites or destroy existing ones, thereby generating new cancer-associated molecular logic gates within a cancer cell signaling circuitry. To identify such events, we specifically inquired the global sequencing data for the appearance of phosphorylatable residues resulting from mutations, some of which could be experimentally verified to be bona fide sites by mass spectrometry. Strikingly, this approach uncovered several examples of mutations that lead to the genesis of new phosphorylatable sites, which become recognized and phosphorylated by kinases (Figures 3A and S2). Among the proteins harboring these neomorphic phosphorylation sites were TANC1 and HSF1 (Figure 3A). While little is known about TANC1, HSF1 is a heat-shock protein previously reported to be associated with carcinogenesis and poor prognosis, as well as supporting malignancy in a variety of cancers (Dai et al., 2007Dai C. Whitesell L. Rogers A.B. Lindquist S. Heat shock factor 1 is a powerful multifaceted modifier of carcinogenesis.Cell. 2007; 130: 1005-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Thus, further investigations of this new phosphorylation site on HSF1 and its predicted cell-cycle-dependent upstream kinase, CDK2, may lead to new insights on the role of this heat-shock protein in cancer (Figure 3A). In order to discover NAMs destroying phosphorylation sites, we combined our exome sequencing data with those from the quantitative mass-spectrometry analysis of the phospho-proteomes of the five ovarian cancer cell lines. This enabled us to perform genome-specific searches of the mass-spectra, in order to identify direct proteomic evidence of the destruction of phosphorylation sites (Figure 3B) by identifying the mutated but unmodifiable peptides. This approach enabled us to identify 380 variants in our five cell lines and 6902 in the global repository of cancer mutations destroying phosphorylation sites (Experimental Procedures and Figure 2). Two such events from the cell lines illustrated in Figure 3B, are RAB11FIP1 (T281M) and TNKS1BP1 (S1533G). Whereas the role of RAB11FIP1 in cancer is not as clear, Tankyrase-1-binding protein (TNKS1BP1) binds Tankyrase, which in turn, associates with TRF1 protein at the telomeres. This complex is not only tightly regulated during cell-cycle progression but critically it regulates telomere length by binding on the double-stranded TTAGGG repeat of telomeres. This, together with the fact that Aurora Kinase B (AurKB), a key cell-cycle mitotic kinase (Alexander et al., 2011Alexander J. Lim D. Joughin B.A. Hegemann B. Hutchins J.R.A. Ehrenberger T. Ivins F. Sessa F. Hudecz O. Nigg E.A. et al.Spatial exclusivity combined with positive and negative selection of phosphorylation motifs is the basis for context-dependent mitotic signaling.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra42Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), is predicted by NetworKIN (Linding et al., 2007Linding R. Jensen L.J. Ostheimer G.J. van Vugt M.A.T.M. Jørgensen C. Miron I.M. Diella F. Colwill K. Taylor L. Elder K. et al.Systematic discovery of in vivo phosphorylation networks.Cell. 2007; 129: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) to phosphorylate the wild-type form of TNKS1BP1, suggests a potential role in cell-cycle and telomere length dysregulation for this mutant variant. In order to provide further characterization and assess the phenotypic impact of mutations resulting in genesis and destruction of phosphorylation respectively, we performed siRNA-based knockdown experiments of both TANC1 and RAB11FIP1 across the five cell lines. While knockdown effect could certainly be attributable to many other factors besides these specific mutations, surprisingly, as shown in Figure S3 and detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, we indeed observed phenotypic effects supporting the most parsimonious expectations arising from ReKINect’s predictions. Above, we aimed to provide the most accurate and evident instances of NAMs that generate and destroy phosphorylation sites and achieved this through integration of exome-sequencing and MS experimental data following stringent selection criteria (Experimental Procedures). Thus, we speculate that many more NAMs leading to the genesis and extinction of molecular logic gates will undoubtedly exists. Next, in order to explore if cancer mutations can hit residues that determine kinase specificity (determinants of specificity [DoS]) and thereby impose downstream rewiring, we included the results from the KINspect algorithm, described in the accompanying article (Creixell et al., 2015Creixell P. Palmeri A. Miller C.J. Lou H.J. Santini C.C. Nielsen M. Turk B.E. Lining R. Unmasking determiniants of specifity in the human kinome.Cell. 2015; 163 (this issue): 187-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in the ReKINect platform. Sourcing from the global repository of cancer-associated somatic mutations we could predict a large set of putative NAMs leading to downstream rewiring (Experimental Procedures; Table S1). Following a prioritization procedure described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, we compiled a ranked list of cancer somatic mutations with the highest potential to cause downstream rewiring (Table S1). The list includes 1,871 unique missense mutations predicted to alter determinants of specificity by hitting the kinase domain residues most likely to play significant roles in specificity (specificity score higher than 0.9). Even with maximum stringency filters and focusing on the single kinase position most likely to drive specificity (highest specificity score of 1.0, previously reported by the literature as a determinant of specificity [Brinkworth et al., 2003Brinkworth R.I. Breinl R.A. Kobe B. Structural basis and prediction of substrate specificity in protein serine/threonine kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar] and in direct physical contact with the substrate with a distance of <3 Å), we identified 42 unique missense mutations on this specific position covering all branches of the human kinome tree (Table S1). As detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, identifying the cases more suitable to experimental validation narrowed our candidates down to mutations on three positions in direct contact with the substrate and high KINspect score (Creixell et al., 2015Creixell P. Palmeri A. Miller C.J. Lou H.J. Santini C.C. Nielsen M. Turk B.E. Lining R. Unmasking determiniants of specifity in the human kinome.Cell. 2015; 163 (this issue): 187-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) leading to the cloning, expression, and purification of these mutant kinases as well as their wild-type variants (Figures 4A–4E ). First, we purified the two PKCγ mutants, D484G and M501I, predicted to perturb the determinants of specificity in alignment positions 651 and 995, respectively (Figures 4A and 4B). Since the determinant of specificity perturbed by the mutant variant D484G was located four residues downstream of the conserved HRD motif on the kinase domain, we named this determinant as HRD+4 (Figure 4A). Given this spatial location and proximity to the P−2 position of the substrate peptide, we predicted this first mutant would affect P−2 specificity. In contrast, the mutant variant M501I was found immediately downstream of the conserved DFG motif within the kinase activation loop (DFG+1), a residue for which there is recent evidence for its role driving serine-threonine specificity at the phosphorylation site (P0 i.e., central S/T(/Y) residue) position (Chen et al., 2014Chen C. Ha B.H. Thévenin A.F. Lou H.J. Zhang R. Yip K.Y. Peterson J.R. Gerstein M. Kim P.M. Filippakopoulos P. et al.Identification of a major determinant for serine-threonine kinase phosphoacceptor specificity.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 140-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 4B and S4, experimental determination of the peptide specificity of both variants by positional scanning peptide library (PSPL) (Hutti et al., 2004Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. A rapid method for determining protein kinase phosphorylation specificity.Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) corroborated the specificity drift of both these mutants. In the case of the variant PKCγ D484G, our results uncovered a loss of Arg preference in position P−2 of the substrate peptide for the mutant variant (Figures 4B and S4). As predicted in the case of the variant M501I, PSPL results demonstrated a change in phosphoacceptor residue preference from Ser to Thr (Figure 5B). This specificity “switch” was further confirmed by performing phosphorylation assays on both the wild-type and mutant variants using a pair of matched peptide substrates of identical sequence save for having Ser or Thr in the P0 position (Figure 4C). As seen with PSPL analysis, WT PKCγ preferred Ser over Thr, while the M501I mutant by contrast phosphorylated the Thr peptide most efficiently. Given that PKCγ is a critical regulator of migration in development (Kramer et al., 2002Kramer K.L. Barnette J.E. Yost H.J. PKCgamma regulates syndecan-2 inside-out signaling during xenopus left-right development.Cell. 2002; 111: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), that it has been linked to metastasis (Yang et al., 2014Yang J. Song X. Chen Y. Lu X. Fu Y. Luo Y. PLCγ1-PKCγ signaling-mediated Hsp90α plasma membrane translocation facilitates tumor metastasis.Traffic. 2014; 15: 861-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and that its overexpression in epithelial cells triggers a malignant phenotype and tumorigenic behavior in vivo (Mazzoni et al., 2003Mazzoni E. Adam A. Bal de Kier Joffe E. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Immortalized mammary epithelial cells overexpressing protein kinase C gamma acquire a malignant phenotype and become tumorigenic in vivo.Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 776-787PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that these specificity drifts ReKINect has predicted could provide tumorigenic, invasive, and metastatic capabilities to cancer cells. While these PKCγ mutants were identified in lung cancer samples (Kan et al., 2010Kan Z. Jaiswal B.S. Stinson J. Janakiraman V. Bhatt D. Stern H.M. Yue P. Haverty P.M. Bourgon R. Zheng J. et al.Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in human cancers.Nature. 2010; 466: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) wild-type PKCγ is typically expressed only in the brain (Sundram et al., 2011Sundram V. Chauhan S.C. Jaggi M. Emerging roles of protein kinase D1 in cancer.Mol. Cancer Res. 2011; 9: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKCγ was overexpressed in the tumor bearing the M501I mutation (Figure 4D) to levels substantially higher than in tumors where this genomic region had been amplified (as reported by cBioPortal [Gao et al., 2013Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. et al.Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci.

By plotting the probability of both kinases to phosphorylate the wild-type and mutant variants of the protein, we can visualize, quantify, and compare different upstream rewiring mutations.(B) The rewiring power and the rewiring angle can be computed by considering the necessary trajectory that the mutation causes (from the “origin” right-bottom triangle to the “destination” left-top triangle). The rewiring power is equivalent to the magnitude of the vector and measures the rewiring capacity of the mutation. The rewiring angle is the angle of the vector from the diagonal and distinguishes whether the rewiring effect is mainly driven by kinase resignation (i.e., a loss of phosphorylating ability of the wild-type kinase, angle >45°), depicted in blue, or by kinase take-over (i.e., an increase of phosphorylation ability of a new kinase, angle <45°), depicted in green. The three examples illustrate how three different mutations (A–C) can lead to different outcomes, such as the same rewiring power but different main driving force (A and B) or the same driving force but different magnitude (B and C).(C) Illustration of the two main driving processes that cause upstream rewiring, namely the reduced ability of the original kinase to phosphorylate the new mutant substrate variant (resignation) and the increased ability of a second kinase to phosphorylate the mutant substrate protein (take-over).(D) Representation of all the upstream rewiring mutations identified in the global repository of somatic mutations at different distances relative to the phosphorylation site (from five residues before a phosphorylation site, P−5, to five residues after a phosphorylation site, P+5).

https://openalex.org/W1821567097,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used antidepressants, but the mechanisms by which they influence behavior are only partially resolved. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for some of the responses to SSRIs, but it is not known whether mature dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) also contribute. We deleted the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR, a receptor required for the SSRI response) specifically from DG GCs and found that the effects of the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were abolished. By contrast, mice lacking 5HT1ARs only in young adult-born GCs (abGCs) showed normal fluoxetine responses. Notably, 5HT1AR-deficient mice engineered to express functional 5HT1ARs only in DG GCs responded to fluoxetine, indicating that 5HT1ARs in DG GCs are sufficient to mediate an antidepressant response. Taken together, these data indicate that both mature DG GCs and young abGCs must be engaged for an antidepressant response."
https://openalex.org/W1955514206,"ELABELA (ELA) is a peptide hormone required for heart development that signals via the Apelin Receptor (APLNR, APJ). ELA is also abundantly secreted by human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which do not express APLNR. Here we show that ELA signals in a paracrine fashion in hESCs to maintain self-renewal. ELA inhibition by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion, shRNA, or neutralizing antibodies causes reduced hESC growth, cell death, and loss of pluripotency. Global phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses of ELA-pulsed hESCs show that it activates PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling required for cell survival. ELA promotes hESC cell-cycle progression and protein translation and blocks stress-induced apoptosis. INSULIN and ELA have partially overlapping functions in hESC medium, but only ELA can potentiate the TGFβ pathway to prime hESCs toward the endoderm lineage. We propose that ELA, acting through an alternate cell-surface receptor, is an endogenous secreted growth factor in human embryos and hESCs that promotes growth and pluripotency."

https://openalex.org/W2213204442,"A bi-specific antibody that binds both T cells and a tumor-specific intracellular antigen shows therapeutic promise in mouse models of cancer. Intracellular tumor antigens presented on the cell surface in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules have been targeted by T cell–based therapies, but there has been little progress in developing small-molecule drugs or antibodies directed to these antigens. Here we describe a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody derived from a T-cell receptor (TCR)-mimic monoclonal antibody (mAb) ESK1, which binds a peptide derived from the intracellular oncoprotein WT1 presented on HLA-A*02:01. Despite the very low density of the complexes at the cell surface, ESK1-BiTE selectively activated and induced proliferation of cytolytic human T cells that killed cells from multiple leukemias and solid tumors in vitro and in mice. We also discovered that in an autologous in vitro setting, ESK1-BiTE induced a robust secondary CD8 T-cell response specific for tumor-associated antigens other than WT1. Our study provides an approach that targets tumor-specific intracellular antigens without using cell therapy and suggests that epitope spreading could contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of this BiTE."
https://openalex.org/W2212430218,"Background Inflammation-based prognostic scores such as the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), and modified GPS (mGPS) have been reported to have prognostic value in patients with many types of cancer, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the role of the C-reactive protein/Albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio in ESCC has not yet been evaluated. Methods A total of 468 patients suffering from histologically proven ESCC were enrolled between January 2000 and July 2010. The GPS, mGPS, NLR, PLR and CRP/Alb ratios were tested together with established prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of overall survival (OS). Results The optimal cutoff level for the CRP/Alb ratio was 0.50. The CRP/Alb ratio (continuous) had higher AUC values at 12 months (0.796), 24 months (0.805), and 36 months (0.815) than the NLR, GPS and mGPS. In univariate analysis, the 5-year OS rate for patients with a CRP/Alb ratio > 0.50 was 43.4%, while the rate for patients with a CRP/Alb ratio ≤ 0.50 was 17.7% (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, patients with a CRP/Alb ratio > 0.50 had worse survival than patients with a CRP/Alb ratio ≤ 0.50 (HR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.82–3.26; P < 0.0001). Conclusion In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the CRP/Alb ratio as a novel inflammation-based prognostic factor in a large group of ESCC patients. The prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio needs to be verified in prospective multicenter studies."
https://openalex.org/W2223857334,"The selectivity of ion channels is fundamental for their roles in electrical and chemical signaling and in ion homeostasis. Although most ion channels exhibit stable ion selectivity, the prevailing view of purinergic P2X receptor channels, transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) channels and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) is that their ion conduction pores dilate upon prolonged activation. We investigated this mechanism in P2X receptors and found that the hallmark shift in equilibrium potential observed with prolonged channel activation does not result from pore dilation, but from time-dependent alterations in the concentration of intracellular ions. We derived a physical model to calculate ion concentration changes during patch-clamp recordings, which validated our experimental findings and provides a quantitative guideline for effectively controlling ion concentration. Our results have fundamental implications for understanding ion permeation and gating in P2X receptor channels, as well as more broadly for using patch-clamp techniques to study ion channels and neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2113081116,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to share several properties with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including cell-cycle quiescence and a capacity for self-renewal. These features are hypothesized to underlie leukemic initiation, progression, and relapse, and they also complicate efforts to eradicate leukemia through therapeutic targeting of LSCs without adverse effects on HSCs. Here, we show that acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with genomic rearrangements of the MLL gene contain a non-quiescent LSC population. Although human CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs are generally highly quiescent, the C-type lectin CD93 is expressed on a subset of actively cycling, non-quiescent AML cells enriched for LSC activity. CD93 expression is functionally required for engraftment of primary human AML LSCs and leukemogenesis, and it regulates LSC self-renewal predominantly by silencing CDKN2B, a major tumor suppressor in AML. Thus, CD93 expression identifies a predominantly cycling, non-quiescent leukemia-initiating cell population in MLL-rearranged AML, providing opportunities for selective targeting and eradication of LSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2200538266,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a promising target for cancer therapy, particularly for metastatic lung cancers, but how CSCs are regulated is largely unknown. We identify two proteins, SLUG (encoded by SNAI2 gene) and SOX9, which are associated with advanced stage lung cancers and are implicated in the regulation of CSCs. Inhibition of either SLUG or SOX9 sufficiently inhibits CSCs in human lung cancer cells and attenuates experimental lung metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. Correlation between SLUG and SOX9 levels was observed remarkably, we therefore sought to explore their mechanistic relationship and regulation. SLUG, beyond its known function as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor, was found to regulate SOX9 by controlling its stability via a post-translational modification process. SLUG interacts directly with SOX9 and prevents it from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. SLUG expression and binding are necessary for SOX9 promotion of lung CSCs and metastasis in a mouse model. Together, our findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of CSCs via SLUG-SOX9 regulatory axis, which represents a potential novel target for CSC therapy that may overcome cancer chemoresistance and relapse."

Cellular signaling fidelity is maintained essentially through two coupled mechanisms. At a macro-molecular level, protein specificity ensures that each protein kinase will reach and interact with its protein substrates. At a micro-molecular or atomic level, peptide specificity defines the ability of a given kinase domain present in all active protein kinases to recognize and phosphorylate a specific peptide within the protein substrate (Turk, 2008Turk B.E. Understanding and exploiting substrate recognition by protein kinases.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). A variety of experimental techniques have been developed to elucidate the peptide specificity for many modular signaling domains and obtain specificity profiles (e.g., the so-called Position-Specific Scoring Matrices, PSSMs), as a quantitative measure of the preference of each kinase domain for each amino acid residue at every peptide substrate position (Figure S1). While other factors contributing to protein interaction specificity at a macro-molecular level (such as co-localization, co-expression, docking motifs, and scaffold or adaptor proteins) have been described (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006Bhattacharyya R.P.

This observation prompted the introduction of specificity masks (different combinations of residues with different degrees of contributions to domain specificity) used subsequently in this study. Here, we present a computational approach that aims to overcome these limitations and address the following open questions. Which residues within the kinase domain contribute to peptide specificity (constituting the so-called DoS)? Are these determinants just a small group of residues localized in close proximity to the substrate as currently thought, or do they form a sparse network of residues instead (Figure 1C)? Are such principles of domain-peptide specificity conserved in other domains? Finally, how do these DoS relate, spatially and functionally, to those residues known to be involved in the regulation and catalytic activity of the kinase domain? In other words, are these different functionalities loaded onto the same residues or on independent groups of residues, and how did they evolve? As we demonstrate in our accompanying article (Creixell et al., 2015Creixell P. Schoof E.M. Simpson C.D. Longden J. Miller C.J. Lou H.J. Perryman L. Cox T.R. Zivanovic N. Palmeri A. et al.Kinome-wide decoding of network-attacking mutations rewiring cancer signaling.Cell. 2015; 163 (this issue): 202-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]), which explores how cancer mutations affect domain specificity by integrating the DoS identified here, resolving these questions could represent a valuable contribution not only for basic signaling biology but also for cancer research. When investigating the relationship between kinases at the domain primary sequence similarity level and at the substrate sequence motif similarity level (using specificity profiles or PSSMs derived from Positional Scanning Peptide Library or PSPL experiments, see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1), it is apparent that, when considering the domain in its entirety, no strong linear correlation between these exists (Figure S1). We hypothesized that this lack of correlation could indicate that substrate specificity is not encoded by the domain as a whole. Instead, we hypothesized that a limited number of residues contribute to specificity, and that those that do contribute, are likely to do so to different degrees. In order to capture this principle, we introduced the specificity mask as a fundamental entity in our approach. As depicted in Figures 1B and 2 (small box), a specificity mask is defined as a particular combination of contributions to specificity from the different residues in the kinase domain. For example, an extreme hypothesis where all residues within the kinase domain contribute equally to specificity would be represented by all entries in a mask with the same score (e.g., 0.5). Instead, a situation where a single residue, X, would drive specificity would be represented by all entries scoring 0.0 except position X scoring 1.0. Our approach (described below) explores the possibility that within a large ensemble of specificity masks, certain masks can discriminate between kinases with dissimilar substrate specificities better than others. These masks will range from those capturing very few and localized DoS (reminiscent of models explored in the structural studies; Brinkworth et al., 2003Brinkworth R.I. Breinl R.A. Kobe B.

As further detailed in the next section, since our aim was to identify new DoS following an unbiased data-driven systematic approach, we did not impose any restrictions in the set of specificity masks that can be found; instead, we explore a large set of possible specificity masks and let the system evolve and find those showing the best discriminatory capabilities. In order to identify which residues contribute to specificity, we developed a computational framework named KINspect, which explores a very large number of combinations of residues, and their contribution toward specificity, and subsequently identifies those featuring the best predictive capability (Figure 2). This type of approach, known in machine learning as learning classifier systems (Lanzi et al., 2000Lanzi, P.L., Stolzmann, W., and Wilson, S.W. (2000). Learning classifier systems: from foundations to applications. (1813).Google Scholar), enables the selection of the best-performing set of specificity masks starting from a large initial set of random masks by following three consecutive steps (Figure 2). First, for each specificity mask, the specificity profiles (PSSMs) for each kinase are predicted by comparing all kinases across the human kinome at each amino acid position within the kinase domain (amino acid similarity) and by incorporating a weighting factor (from 0 to 1; 0 being not important, 1 being critical) of the “specificity importance” of each position as determined by the given specificity mask. A PSSM for each kinase is then predicted by integrating the PSSMs for the other kinases using the mask-dependent similarity as a weighting factor. Naturally, the majority of masks within the original set of random masks will predict specificity poorly, but, as the system evolves, the masks will improve their predictive power, i.e., become more fit. Second, masks are ranked according to their predictive performance (i.e., their ability to predict PSSMs that are similar to the experimentally determined PSSMs). In essence, masks that more closely capture the true contribution of each position within the kinase domain (i.e., those scoring higher at kinase domain positions that truly contribute to specificity) will result in a better prediction of the specificity profiles, thus ranking higher. Third, the worst-performing masks are filtered out and new masks, representing both subtle (mutation) but also more abrupt (cross-over) variations of the best-performing masks, will be added. These three steps are initially started with random specificity masks and repeated until convergence is reached and fitness cannot be optimized further. Residues consistently scoring higher in the specificity masks following the optimization procedure will be considered candidate DoS. For a more technical description of the algorithm, please refer to Figure 2 and Extended Experimental Procedures. Since our method contains stochastic aspects (such as the starting set of random masks and the generation of new masks by mutation and cross-over), one initial question that must be addressed is whether the method is robust to this initial stochasticity, i.e., whether one would obtain similar results if the process was started with arbitrary initial conditions and evaluated independently several times. To this end, we compared the fitness evolution of ten independent KINspect evaluations and found highly comparable fitness trajectories, as well as increasing similarity between the best-performing masks at each generation (Figure S2; Data S1, S2, and S3). Moreover, we confirmed that the results are not simply due to trivial technical factors, such as residue conservation or alignment gaps (Figure S3), and that similar results could not be obtained using uniform or randomized sets (Figure S3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that KINspect is robust to arbitrary initial conditions and converges to a limited set of highly similar solutions (specificity masks, Figure S3).Figure S3Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) The DoS Identified by KINspect Cannot Be Explained Simply By Conservation (A) or Alignment Gaps (B). In order to refute the possibility that we are simply identifying the most conserved positions in our alignment or that gaps in our alignment bias substantially our results, we plotted alignment column entropy (A) and the gap fraction (B) versus the position score. These results confirm that neither conservation (i.e., lower entropy) nor alignment gaps would directly explain our findings, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our method to such potential artifacts.(C and D) Randomized or Uniform Versions of Our Sequence-Specificity Sets Do Not Result In Optimized Convergent Results. In order to confirm that our results are not a result of intrinsic properties of our method or somehow uncoupled from our data, we produced two control set; one with all specificity profiles set to the same uniform matrix (Uniform set) and a second one, where the linkage kinase-specificity profile was randomized (Randomized set). Neither of these two control sets leads to an optimization process (i.e., decrease in fitness landscape terms) similar to the one observed for the actual KINspect set, represented in blue. Note that the uniform set does not effectively represent a predictive challenge for the method, which explains why the fitness remains at 0.0 for all iterations. In addition to this marked decrease in optimization potential, unlike in the actual set, the two control sets do not lead to convergent masks either (i.e., the dissimilarity between the masks is kept high along the optimization process), as observed in (D).(E) Enrichment in Previously Reported DoS. In order to investigate whether the specificity mask identified previously described determinants of specificity, we curated from the literature a number of determinants identified using different means and in different species (Table S1). Next, we compared the KINspect score obtained by this group of previously described determinants (top) as well as all other residues (bottom) at the beginning of the evaluation run (left, before optimization) and after KINspect was optimized (right). Marked different distribution trajectories can be observed between both groups, with most residues tending toward zero at the bottom, while a much larger fraction of residues previously identified as determinants score higher at the top, illustrating an enrichment of previously reported DoS (Fisher’s exact test one-sided, p = 8.4x10−7). Interestingly, several additional DoS were identified by KINspect (bottom right) and some of the reported DoS did not obtain a high KINspect score (some of which had been reported in non-human species).(F) Comparison to Previous Methods. Whereas a global comparison to previous methods would be unfeasible due to the highly limited coverage of human kinases that previous methods utilized, we were able to employ the gold standard set used in the DREAM challenge on peptide specificity (Ellis and Kobe, 2011Ellis J.J. Kobe B. Predicting protein kinase specificity: Predikin update and performance in the DREAM4 challenge.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e21169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While KINspect performed similarly poorly on CaMKK2 (a kinase with very distinct specificity), we could confirm in this limited test set that KINspect outperforms previous structure-based methods (Brinkworth et al., 2003Brinkworth R.I.

We found that high-complexity genes-those with a large total number of DNase-mapped enhancers across the lineage-differ architecturally and functionally from low-complexity genes, achieve larger expression changes and are enriched for both cell type-specific and transition enhancers, which are established in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and maintained in one differentiated cell fate but lost in others. We then developed a quantitative model to accurately predict gene expression changes from the DNA sequence content and lineage history of active enhancers. Our method suggests a new mechanistic role for PU.1 at transition peaks during B cell specification and can be used to correct assignments of enhancers to genes."
https://openalex.org/W3133907395,"The AAA-ATPase VCP (also known as p97 or CDC48) uses ATP hydrolysis to 'segregate' ubiquitylated proteins from their binding partners. VCP acts through UBX-domain-containing adaptors that provide target specificity, but the targets and functions of UBXD proteins remain poorly understood. Through systematic proteomic analysis of UBXD proteins in human cells, we reveal a network of over 195 interacting proteins, implicating VCP in diverse cellular pathways. We have explored one such complex between an unstudied adaptor UBXN10 and the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex, which regulates anterograde transport into cilia. UBXN10 localizes to cilia in a VCP-dependent manner and both VCP and UBXN10 are required for ciliogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of VCP destabilized the IFT-B complex and increased trafficking rates. Depletion of UBXN10 in zebrafish embryos causes defects in left-right asymmetry, which depends on functional cilia. This study provides a resource for exploring the landscape of UBXD proteins in biology and identifies an unexpected requirement for VCP-UBXN10 in ciliogenesis."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive bone marrow malignancy with over 20,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths each year in the United States. AML arises from leukemia stem cell (LSC) transformation as a consequence of multiple cooperative mutations or epigenetic alterations. Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in AML frequently result in transcription factor fusion proteins that contribute to the unique etiology and prognosis of distinct cytogenetic subsets (Look, 1997Look A.T. Oncogenic transcription factors in the human acute leukemias.Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The core-binding factor (CBF) complex, consists of a DNA-binding RUNX protein and a non-DNA binding CBFβ, is a master transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis and a frequent target of leukemia associated mutations (Speck and Gilliland, 2002Speck N.A. Gilliland D.G. Core-binding factors in haematopoiesis and leukaemia.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). A common recurrent cytogenetic aberration found in approximately 5%–12% of AML patients is chromosome 16 inversion inv(16)(p13.1q22) or translocation t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) (henceforth inv(16)) (Liu et al., 1996Liu P.P.

Identification of the chimeric protein product of the CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene in inv(16) leukemia cells.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996; 16: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inv(16) results in fusion of CBFB with the MYH11 gene, which encodes a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) protein (Liu et al., 1993Liu P. Tarlé S.A. Hajra A. Claxton D.F. Marlton P. Freedman M.

Fusion between transcription factor CBF β/PEBP2 β and a myosin heavy chain in acute myeloid leukemia.Science. 1993; 261: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein CBFβ-SMMHC (CM) retains the RUNX1 binding interface of CBFβ and the coiled-coil rod region of SMMHC. Heterozygote Cbfb-MYH11 knockin (KI) at the Cbfb locus led to lethal defects in definitive hematopoiesis at E12.5 (Castilla et al., 1996Castilla L.H. Wijmenga C. Wang Q. Stacy T. Speck N.A.

These results suggested that CM is a dominant inhibitor of CBF during hematopoietic ontogeny. Our previous studies in a conditional CM KI mouse model further revealed that CM expression in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to impaired differentiation of multiple hematopoietic lineages and produces pre-leukemic stem and progenitors that are at risk for LSC transformation (Castilla et al., 1996Castilla L.H.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the leukemogenic function of CM has been elusive. AML is maintained and propagated by LSCs that are relatively resistant to chemotherapy and can persist as potential sources of relapse. Although patients with inv(16) AML have a relatively favorable prognosis, only approximately half of them eventually achieve long-term survival with the standard chemotherapy regimens (Prébet et al., 2009Prébet T.

Molecular insights into leukemogenic mechanisms are necessary to design new LSC-targeted therapies to reduce relapse and improve outcomes. TP53 mutations are relatively rare in de novo AML (approximately 10%); however, TP53 mutation is associated with complex karyotypes, drug resistance, and dismal outcome (Rücker et al., 2012Rücker F.G. Schlenk R.F. Bullinger L. Kayser S. Teleanu V. Kett H. Habdank M. Kugler C.-M. Holzmann K.

Mutations of the TP53 gene in acute myeloid leukemia are strongly associated with a complex aberrant karyotype.Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 has also been shown to promote AML pathogenesis in mice by enabling aberrant self-renewal (Zhao et al., 2010Zhao Z. Zuber J. Diaz-Flores E. Lintault L. Kogan S.C. Shannon K. Lowe S.W. p53 loss promotes acute myeloid leukemia by enabling aberrant self-renewal.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The functions of p53 are coordinately modulated by a number of post-translational modifications including acetylation (Dai and Gu, 2010Dai C. Gu W. p53 post-translational modification: deregulated in tumorigenesis.Trends Mol. Med. 2010; 16: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Given the low TP53 mutation rate, alternative mechanisms affecting p53 protein stability or post-translational modification are possibly involved in disrupting p53 function during AML pathogenesis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl moieties from lysine residues in a variety of histones proteins and transcription factors including p53. HDAC8 is a class I HDAC that is overexpressed in multiple tumor types, including neuroblastoma, glioma (Oehme et al., 2009Oehme I. Deubzer H.E. Wegener D. Pickert D. Linke J.-P. Hero B. Kopp-Schneider A. Westermann F. Ulrich S.M. von Deimling A. et al.Histone deacetylase 8 in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Moreno et al., 2010Moreno D.A. Scrideli C.A. Cortez M.A.A. de Paula Queiroz R. Valera E.T. da Silva Silveira V. Yunes J.A. Brandalise S.R. Tone L.G.

Haematol. 2010; 150: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although HDAC8 has been shown to interact with the CM chimeric protein as part of a transcriptional repressor complex (Durst et al., 2003Durst K.L. Lutterbach B. Kummalue T. Friedman A.D. Hiebert S.W. The inv(16) fusion protein associates with corepressors via a smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), its functional role in AML pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, we uncovered an HDAC8-mediated post-translational p53-inactivating mechanism underlying CM-associated LSC transformation and maintenance. We investigated the functional contribution of HDAC8 in human AML stem/progenitor cell survival and propagation and evaluated the efficacy of HDAC8-selective inhibitors in targeting murine and human AML LSCs in vivo. The activity of p53 is normally tightly controlled and is rapidly induced upon genotoxic stress triggered by radiation or chemotherapy. Acetylation of the p53 protein, critical for its stability and transcriptional activity, is rapidly induced upon p53 activation (Dai and Gu, 2010Dai C. Gu W. p53 post-translational modification: deregulated in tumorigenesis.Trends Mol. Med. 2010; 16: 528-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We have previously generated a conditional CM KI mouse model (Cbfb56M/+/Mx1-Cre), which expresses CM under the endogenous Cbfb promoter after polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (pIpC) treatment (Kuo et al., 2006Kuo Y.-H. Landrette S.F. Heilman S.A. Perrat P.N. Garrett L. Liu P.P. Le Beau M.M. Kogan S.C. Castilla L.H. Cbf beta-SMMHC induces distinct abnormal myeloid progenitors able to develop acute myeloid leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using an antibody against an acetylated (Ac)-form of p53 (K379) revealed that Ac-p53 levels were largely reduced in CM pre-leukemic (2 weeks after pIpC) bone marrow (BM) cells treated with γ-irradiation (IR, 3Gy) compared to similarly treated control BM (Figure 1A). Time course analysis revealed that the initial acetylation of p53 occurred (2 hr), however, p53 was rapidly deacetylated in the presence of CM (Figure 1A). To verify whether this is directly related to CM expression, we transduced a myeloid progenitor cell line 32D (p53 intact) with MSCV-ires-GFP (MIG) expressing FLAG-tagged CM (32D-CM) or normal CBFβ (32D-CBFβ). The levels of Ac-p53 were consistently reduced in 32D-CM compared to 32D-CBFβ cells (Figure 1B). In addition, expression of CM by transducing Cbfb56M/+ BM cells with a MIG-Cre vector readily reduced Ac-p53 induction (Figure 1C), suggesting that this is likely to be a direct effect of CM. Furthermore, knocking down CM using small hairpin (sh)-RNAs against the Cbfb-MYH11 sequence rapidly restored Ac-p53 induction in 32D-CM cells (Figure 1D). Similarly, silencing CM in mouse AML cells significantly induced p53 target gene expression (Figures 1E and S1A). The transcription of p53 was not affected as CM expression in 32D cells or in primary myeloid progenitors did not cause significant changes in p53 mRNA levels (Figure S1B). To determine how CM fusion protein impairs p53 activity, we examined whether CM interacts with the p53 protein. First, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) followed by western blot analysis in 32D-CM and 32D-CBFβ cells. We found that the CM fusion protein, but not CBFβ, was pulled down together with p53 (Figures 1F and S1D). As an alternative approach, we used a proximity ligation assay (PLA) to assess intermolecular interaction in situ. Punctate red fluorescent foci were observed in 32D-CM, but not 32D-CBFβ cells (Figure 1G), indicating the presence of specific interaction between CM and p53 proteins. In contrast, in situ PLA using an Ac-p53 (K379) specific antibody showed very few interacting foci (Figure S1C), suggesting that the p53 protein interacting with CM is mostly deacetylated. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation revealed that the CM-p53 complex is detected mainly in the nucleus (Figure S1E). Similar CM-p53 interaction was seen when RUNX1 is knocked down (Figure S1F), suggesting that RUNX1 is not required for CM-p53 binding. The CM-p53 complex can also be detected in primary CM pre-leukemic BM cells with or without IR (Figure 1H). Furthermore, coIP in primary AML CD34+ cells isolated from patients showed that CM-p53 protein complex was seen specifically in inv(16)+ AML CD34+ cells and not in non-inv(16) cells (Figure 1I). Altogether, these results indicate that CM fusion protein binds to p53 and impairs acetylation and activation of p53. Consistent with a previous report (Durst et al., 2003Durst K.L. Lutterbach B. Kummalue T. Friedman A.D. Hiebert S.W. The inv(16) fusion protein associates with corepressors via a smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we found that CM interacts specifically with HDAC8 and not other class I HDACs including HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 (Figures S2A and S2B). We next assessed whether CM forms a multimeric protein complex with HDAC8 and p53 by sequential IP followed by western blot analysis. Indeed, we were able to pull down CM, p53, and HDAC8 in a protein complex using two different antibody sequential combinations (Figure 2A). To further examine whether the CM-p53 interaction is dependent on HDAC8 binding, we generated a set of CM deletion mutants (Figure 2B, left). The CM-ΔC95 mutant lacking 95 amino acids at the C terminus did not bind HDAC8 (Figure S2B), as previously reported (Durst et al., 2003Durst K.L. Lutterbach B. Kummalue T. Friedman A.D. Hiebert S.W. The inv(16) fusion protein associates with corepressors via a smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). CoIP and in situ PLA revealed that CM-ΔC95 can bind p53, while CM variants d134 (residues 134–236 deleted) and d179 (residues 179–221 deleted) cannot (Figures 2B and 2C). In addition, coIP and in situ PLA showed that CM-p53 binding was unaffected in Hdac8 knocked down 32D-CM cells (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2C). These results suggest that CM-p53 interaction does not require HDAC8 binding. However, aberrant p53 deacetylation associated with CM depends critically on Hdac8 because knocking down Hdac8 led to a robust increase in Ac-p53 induced by IR (Figure 2E). In addition, CM deletion mutants ΔC95, d134, or d179 that were unable to bind either HDAC8 or p53 had no effect on Ac-p53 induction compared to control (FLAG or CBFβ) 32D cells (Figures 2F and S2D). Quantitative (q) RT-PCR analysis shows that induction of p53 target genes including p21 Cdkn1a, Mdm2, Bid, Bax, and Gadd45b were restored in CM-ΔC95 cells compared to full-length CM-expressing cells (Figure 2G). Collectively, these results indicate that although binding to p53 and HDAC8 occurs through distinct regions of the CM protein, simultaneous interaction with HDAC8 and p53 is required for aberrant deacetylation and inactivation of p53. To determine the contribution of HDAC8 in CM-induced AML LSC transformation, we generated a floxed Hdac8 (Hdac8f) allele in which exon 3 was flanked by loxP sites (Figure S3A). Mice carrying Hdac8f/f were crossed with Cbfb56M/+/Mx1-Cre (C56Bl6 strain) and induced with pIpC as previously described (Kuo et al., 2006Kuo Y.-H. Landrette S.F. Heilman S.A. Perrat P.N. Garrett L. Liu P.P. Le Beau M.M. Kogan S.C. Castilla L.H. Cbf beta-SMMHC induces distinct abnormal myeloid progenitors able to develop acute myeloid leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Successful induction of Hdac8 deletion in Hdac8KO/Cbfb56M/+/Mx1-Cre mice was confirmed by PCR (data not shown) and western blot analysis (Figure 3A). CM/Hdac8KO pre-leukemic BM progenitors show significantly higher levels of Ac-p53 upon IR (Figures 3B and S3B), consistent with HDAC8 mediating CM-associated p53 deacetylation. Similar to previous studies, C56BL/6 CM KI mice spontaneously develop AML with 100% penetrance and a median survival of 122 days. Notably, deletion of Hdac8 (CM/Hdac8KO) significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced AML incidence (13.6%) and prolonged disease-free survival (Figure 3C). These results indicate that HDAC8 promotes LSC transformation and AML progression. To test whether p53 acetylation and activity could be modulated by HDAC8 deacetylase activity, we used HDAC8-selective pharmacological inhibitors (HDAC8i) including PCI-34051 (Balasubramanian et al., 2008Balasubramanian S. Ramos J. Luo W. Sirisawad M. Verner E. Buggy J.J. A novel histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8)-specific inhibitor PCI-34051 induces apoptosis in T-cell lymphomas.Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1026-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and compound 22d (Huang et al., 2012Huang W.-J. Wang Y.-C. Chao S.-W. Yang C.-Y. Chen L.-C. Lin M.-H. Hou W.-C. Chen M.-Y. Lee T.-L. Yang P. Chang C.I. Synthesis and biological evaluation of ortho-aryl N-hydroxycinnamides as potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) 8 isoform-selective inhibitors.ChemMedChem. 2012; 7: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) designed to block HDAC8 catalytic activity. Treatment with both HDAC8i compounds remarkably enhanced Ac-p53 in 32D-CM cells (Figure 3D, lanes 3, 8, and 9 from left). Because p53 protein levels were also increased upon HDAC8i treatment, we included the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 to stabilize the p53 protein. Treatment of HDAC8i (PCI-34051 or 22d) in combination with Nutlin-3 elevated Ac-p53 compared to Nutlin-3 alone (Figure 3D, lanes 4–6 and 10–12 from left), suggesting that the enhanced Ac-p53 by HDAC8i is not a result of p53 protein stabilization. In fact, 22d differentially increased Ac-p53 as well as the HDAC8-specific substrate Ac-SMC3 (Deardorff et al., 2012Deardorff M.A. Bando M. Nakato R. Watrin E. Itoh T. Minamino M. Saitoh K. Komata M. Katou Y. Clark D. et al.HDAC8 mutations in Cornelia de Lange syndrome affect the cohesin acetylation cycle.Nature. 2012; 489: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) compared to other class I HDAC (MS-275), class III HDAC (TV6), or broad-spectrum (PCI-24781) inhibitors with limited HDAC8 inhibitory activity (Figures 3E and S3C). In addition, HDAC8i (PCI-34051 or 22d) treatment significantly induced expression of multiple p53 targets as determined by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 3F). This is indeed p53-dependent, since knocking down p53 significantly reduced the effect (Figures S3D and S3E). Similarly, Hdac8 deletion significantly decreased p53 targets induction by 22d (Figure 3G). Activation of p53 upon 22d treatment was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis of 32D-CM cells (IC50 = 4.25 μM) compared to 32D-CBFβ cells (IC50 = 7.54 μM). This enhanced apoptosis and Ac-p53 can be rescued by overexpression of HDAC8 (IC50 = 9.15 μM; Figures 3H and 3I). In addition, primary CM/Hdac8KO BM cells (IC50 = 7.36 μM) were significantly more resistant to 22d-induced apoptosis compared to CM BM cells (IC50 = 4.99 μM; Figure S3F). To further substantiate that this is mediated by p53 activation, we expressed CM in BM cells from p53ERTAM KI mice carrying a 4-hydroytamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible form of the p53 protein (Christophorou et al., 2005Christophorou M.A. Martin-Zanca D. Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Restoring p53 activity upon 4-OHT treatment significantly increased apoptosis and the sensitivity to 22d (Figure S3G). Furthermore, human K562 cells (p53 inactive) were significantly (p = 0.0024) more sensitive to 22d when coexpressing CM and wild-type (WT) p53 (IC50 = 9.48 μM) compared to an acetylation sites-mutated (8KR; IC50 = 21.03 μM) form of p53 (Figures S3H and S3I). Using a p53-luciferase reporter construct under the control of p53 responsive elements (Dai et al., 2004Dai M.-S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.-X. David L. Lu H. Ribosomal protein L23 activates p53 by inhibiting MDM2 function in response to ribosomal perturbation but not to translation inhibition.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), we show that p53 transcription activity is significantly induced by 22d in K562 cells rescued with p53-WT, but not p53-8KR (Figure 3J). Altogether, these results provide genetic evidence that 22d induces p53 activation and apoptosis through inhibition of HDAC8. To evaluate the role of HDAC8 in human AML, we first examined the expression of HDAC8 in primary human CD34+ cells. The levels of HDAC8 mRNA were significantly higher in inv(16)+ AML CD34+ cells (n = 7; p = 0.0003) compared to normal (NL) mobilized CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs; n = 7) or non-inv(16) AML (n = 19) CD34+ cells (Figure 4A). Treatment with HDAC8i (22d, 48 hr) significantly reduced the proliferation of inv(16)+ CD34+ cells relative to NL CD34+ cells (Figure S4A; inv(16)+ AML n = 9; NL n = 7). More importantly, 22d selectively induced apoptosis of inv(16)+ AML CD34+ cells (IC50 = 10.65 μM) compared to t(8;21)+ CBF AML (IC50 = 25.99 μM; p = 0.0176), other non-inv(16) AML CD34+ (IC50 = 45.56 μM; p = 0.0011) or NL CD34+ (IC50 = 99.92 μM; p < 0.0001) cells (Figures 4B and 4C). Meanwhile, treatment with 22d (10 μM) did not affect the short- or long-term engraftment capacity of NL CD34+ cells (Figure S4B and data not shown). Next, we assessed whether HDAC8i could selectively activate p53 in inv(16)+ AML CD34+ cells. Indeed, enhanced Ac-p53 (K382) upon 22d (6 hr) treatment were consistently observed in all inv(16)+ patient samples, but not in non-inv(16) AML (p53 non-mutated) or NL CD34+ cells (Figures 4D and S4C and data not shown). Expression of p53 target genes, particularly apoptosis-related genes, were also significantly induced in inv(16)+ CD34+ cells (n = 9–13) relative to NL (n = 7) CD34+ cells (Figure 4E). The apoptosis-inducing effect of 22d was significantly reduced in p53 knocked down (Figure S4D) inv(16)+ CD34+ cells (IC50 = 54.6 μM; p = 0.0079) compared to non-silenced control (IC50 = 16.62 μM) (Figures 4F and 4G; n = 5), suggesting that p53 is critical for the apoptotic effects of 22d. Furthermore, treatment with 22d (5 or 10 μM) significantly enhanced the sensitivity to cytarabine (Ara-C) or daunorubicin (DNR), commonly used chemotherapeutics for AML treatment (Figure 4H). These results suggest that inv(16)+ AML stem and prognitors are selectively dependent on HDAC8 activity for survival and that inhibiting HDAC8 activates p53, thereby sensitizing for apoptosis. AML LSCs are functionally defined by their capacity to engraft and reproduce AML disease in serial transplants. To test whether HDAC8 inhibition could affect AML engraftment and LSC leukemia-initiating capacity, we used a CM AML mouse model with a tdTomato+ Cre-reporter (Cbfb56M/+/Mx1-Cre/tdTomato+). These mice develop transplantable AML 3–6 months after pIpC induction and allow easy tracking of CM-expressing AML cells (dTomato+/cKit+). First, we examined the effect of 22d treatment on AML cell engraftment capacity after ex vivo exposure (Figure 5A). AML engraftment was clearly inhibited by 22d treatment, as evidenced by low amounts of AML cells detected in the peripheral blood (PB), spleen, and BM of mice receiving 22d treated cells (Figures 5B–5F, S5A, and S5B). Over 80% (nine of 11) of vehicle treated recipients succumbed to lethal AML (median survival 68 days), while no AML reoccurrence was observed in 22d treated group (n = 8) monitored up to 8 months (Figure 5G; p = 0.0007). In addition, we assessed changes in the engraftment capacity of AML cells by transplanting equal numbers of cells (2 × 106) that survived the 22d or vehicle treatment (48 hr). Similarly, engraftment levels were significantly lower in recipients of 22d treated cells compared to the vehicle control group in which two mice died of aggressive AML before analysis (Figures 5H, 5I, S5C, and S5D). None of the 22d treated recipients developed leukemia compared to lethal AML seen in 100% (n = 4) of the vehicle control mice (Figure 5J; p = 0.0091). These results indicate that HDAC8i treatment diminished AML engraftment capacity on a per cell basis. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of in vivo administration of HDAC8i 22d. To generate cohorts of AML-bearing mice, AML cells were directly transplanted into sublethally irradiated (6.5 Gy) congenic recipients. After 5–6 weeks, AML-bearing mice were treated with vehicle or 22d by intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg/dose) twice a day for 2 weeks (Figure 6A). We found that Ac-p53 and Ac-SMC3 levels were effectively induced as early as 2 days after initiating 22d treatment (Figure 6B). Post-treatment analysis revealed a significantly reduced frequency (p = 0.0097) and number (p = 0.0101) of dTomato+/cKit+ AML cells in the BM and spleen of 22d treated compared to vehicle treated mice (Figures 6C–6E and data not shown). To further assess LSC activity, we transplanted BM cells (2 × 106) from these treated mice into secondary recipients. A significantly reduced frequency (p < 0.0001) and number (p = 0.0006) of dTomato+/cKit+ AML cells were observed in the BM at 8 weeks (Figures 6F and 6G), along with a significantly reduced spleen weight and AML infiltration (Figure 6H and data not shown). We monitored leukemia onset and survival in a cohort of secondary recipients who received BM cells (5 × 106) from 22d or vehicle treated mice. While all vehicle treated transplants (n = 5) succumbed to aggressive AML with a median survival of 51 days, only two (of four) 22d treated transplants showed signs of leukemia with prolonged latency (median survival 270 days; Figure 6I). Collectively, these results indicate that in vivo 22d treatment effectively diminishes AML burden and eliminates the leukemia-initiating capacity of LSCs in CM AML mouse model. To further evaluate the efficacy of targeting human AML LSCs, we expanded primary patient-derived inv(16)+ AML cells in NOD/SCID/IL-2R-γ−/−/Tg (CMV-IL3, CSF2, KITLG) mice (NSGS). T cell depleted AML cells (1 × 106) were transplanted into irradiated (300 cGy) NSGS mice via intrafemoral injection. Human AML (hCD45+) cells were selected from leukemic BM for transplantation into larger cohorts. When levels of hCD45+ AML cells reached 5%–6% in sampled BM aspirates (Figure S6A), we began treatment with 22d or vehicle twice daily for 2 weeks (Figure 7A"
https://openalex.org/W2207722919,"Whole genome amplification (WGA) is essential for obtaining genome sequences from single bacterial cells because the quantity of template DNA contained in a single cell is very low. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA), using Phi29 DNA polymerase and random primers, is the most widely used method for single-cell WGA. However, single-cell MDA usually results in uneven genome coverage because of amplification bias, background amplification of contaminating DNA, and formation of chimeras by linking of non-contiguous chromosomal regions. Here, we present a novel MDA method, termed droplet MDA, that minimizes amplification bias and amplification of contaminants by using picoliter-sized droplets for compartmentalized WGA reactions. Extracted DNA fragments from a lysed cell in MDA mixture are divided into 105 droplets (67 pL) within minutes via flow through simple microfluidic channels. Compartmentalized genome fragments can be individually amplified in these droplets without the risk of encounter with reagent-borne or environmental contaminants. Following quality assessment of WGA products from single Escherichia coli cells, we showed that droplet MDA minimized unexpected amplification and improved the percentage of genome recovery from 59% to 89%. Our results demonstrate that microfluidic-generated droplets show potential as an efficient tool for effective amplification of low-input DNA for single-cell genomics and greatly reduce the cost and labor investment required for determination of nearly complete genome sequences of uncultured bacteria from environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W2163798090,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is globally ubiquitous, and infection during the first six months of life is a major risk for severe disease and hospital admission; consequently RSV is the most important viral cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality in young children. Development of vaccines for young infants is complicated by the presence of maternal antibodies and immunological immaturity, but vaccines targeted at older children avoid these problems. Vaccine development for young infants has been unsuccessful, but this is not the case for older children (> 6 m). Would vaccinating older children have a significant public health impact? We developed a mathematical model to explore the benefits of a vaccine against RSV.We have used a deterministic age structured model capturing the key epidemiological characteristics of RSV and performed a statistical maximum-likelihood fit to age-specific hospitalization data from a developing country setting. To explore the effects of vaccination under different mixing assumptions, we included two versions of contact matrices: one from a social contact diary study, and the second a synthesised construction based on demographic data. Vaccination is assumed to elicit an immune response equivalent to primary infection. Our results show that immunisation of young children (5-10 m) is likely to be a highly effective method of protection of infants (<6 m) against hospitalisation. The majority benefit is derived from indirect protection (herd immunity). A full sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling of the parameter space shows that our results are robust to model structure and model parameters.This result suggests that vaccinating older infants and children against RSV can have a major public health benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2260872739,"The human antigen R (HuR) stabilizes many mRNAs of proto-oncogene, transcription factors, cytokines and growth factors by recognizing AU-rich elements (AREs) presented in their 3' or 5' untranslated region (UTR). Multiple lines of experimental evidence suggest that this process plays a key role in cancer development. Thus, destabilizing HuR/RNA interaction by small molecules presents an opportunity for cancer treatment/prevention. Here we present an integrated approach to identify inhibitors of HuR/RNA interaction using a combination of fluorescence-based and NMR-based high throughput screening (HTS). The HTS assay with fluorescence polarization readout and Z'-score of 0.8 was used to perform a screen of the NCI diversity set V library in a 384 well plate format. An NMR-based assay with saturation transfer difference (STD) detection was used for hits validation. Protein NMR spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that some hit compounds disrupt formation of HuR oligomer, whereas others block RNA binding. Thus, our integrated high throughput approach provides a new avenue for identification of small molecules targeting HuR/RNA interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2213035537,"Cadmium is a known carcinogen that can disrupt endocrine signalling. Cigarette smoking and food are the most common routes of non-occupational exposure to cadmium. Cadmium accumulates in the kidney and can be measured in urine, making urine cadmium (U-Cd) a biomarker of long-term exposure. However dietary-cadmium (D-Cd) intake estimates are often used as surrogate indicator of cadmium exposure in non-smoking subjects. It is therefore important to investigate the concordance between D-Cd estimates obtained with Food Frequency Questionnaires and U-Cd.U-Cd levels were compared with estimated dietary-cadmium (D-Cd) intake in 1764 post-menopausal women from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort. For each participant, a food frequency questionnaire, and measures of cadmium content in standard recipes were used to judge the daily intake of cadmium, normalized by daily caloric intake. Cadmium was measured by ICP-MS in spot urine sampled at baseline and normalized by urinary creatinine. Information on diet, socio-demographics and smoking were self-reported at baseline.Linear regressions between U-Cd and D-Cd alone revealed minimal but significant positive correlation in never smokers (R2 = 0.0076, β = 1.5% increase per 1 ng Cd kcal(-1), p = 0.0085, n = 782), and negative correlation in current smokers (R2 = 0.0184, β = 7.1% decrease per 1 ng Cd kcal(-1) change, p = 0.0006, n = 584). In the full study population, most of the variability in U-Cd was explained by smoking status (R2 = 0.2450, n = 1764). A forward selection model revealed that the strongest predictors of U-Cd were age in never smokers (Δ R2 = 0.04), smoking duration in former smokers (Δ R2 = 0.06) and pack-years in current smokers (Δ R2 = 0.07). Food items that contributed to U-Cd were leafy vegetables and soy-based products, but explained very little of the variance in U-Cd.Dietary-Cd intake estimated from food frequency questionnaires correlates only minimally with U-Cd biomarker, and its use as a Cd exposure indicator may be of limited utility in epidemiologic studies."

https://openalex.org/W2203113201,"It has been established that the recognition of facial expressions integrates contextual information. In this study, we aimed to clarify the influence of contextual odors. The participants were asked to match a target face varying in expression intensity with non-ambiguous expressive faces. Intensity variations in the target faces were designed by morphing expressive faces with neutral faces. In addition, the influence of verbal information was assessed by providing half the participants with the emotion names. Odor cues were manipulated by placing participants in a pleasant (strawberry), aversive (butyric acid), or no-odor control context. The results showed two main effects of the odor context. First, the minimum amount of visual information required to perceive an expression was lowered when the odor context was emotionally congruent: happiness was correctly perceived at lower intensities in the faces displayed in the pleasant odor context, and the same phenomenon occurred for disgust and anger in the aversive odor context. Second, the odor context influenced the false perception of expressions that were not used in target faces, with distinct patterns according to the presence of emotion names. When emotion names were provided, the aversive odor context decreased intrusions for disgust ambiguous faces but increased them for anger. When the emotion names were not provided, this effect did not occur and the pleasant odor context elicited an overall increase in intrusions for negative expressions. We conclude that olfaction plays a role in the way facial expressions are perceived in interaction with other contextual influences such as verbal information."
https://openalex.org/W2180166599,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy due, in part, to the influence of the bone marrow microenvironment on survival and drug response. Identification of microenvironment-specific survival signaling determinants is critical for the rational design of therapy and elimination of MM. Previously, we have shown that collaborative signaling between β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and interleukin-6 confers a more malignant phenotype via amplification of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Further characterization of the events modulated under these conditions with quantitative phosphotyrosine profiling identified 193 differentially phosphorylated peptides. Seventy-seven phosphorylations were upregulated upon adhesion, including PYK2/FAK2, Paxillin, CASL and p130CAS consistent with focal adhesion (FA) formation. We hypothesized that the collaborative signaling between β1 integrin and gp130 (IL-6 beta receptor, IL-6 signal transducer) was mediated by FA formation and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) activity. Both pharmacological and molecular targeting of PYK2 attenuated the amplification of STAT3 phosphorylation under co-stimulatory conditions. Co-culture of MM cells with patient bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) showed similar β1 integrin-specific enhancement of PYK2 and STAT3 signaling. Molecular and pharmacological targeting of PYK2 specifically induced cell death and reduced clonogenic growth in BMSC-adherent myeloma cell lines, aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive MM cancer stem cells and patient specimens. Finally, PYK2 inhibition similarly attenuated MM progression in vivo. These data identify a novel PYK2-mediated survival pathway in MM cells and MM cancer stem cells within the context of microenvironmental cues, providing preclinical support for the use of the clinical stage FAK/PYK2 inhibitors for treatment of MM, especially in a minimal residual disease setting."
https://openalex.org/W2203213766,"LRIG1 (leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain containing), a member of the LRIG family of transmembrane leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins, is a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and a tumor suppressor. LRIG1 expression is broadly decreased in human cancer and in breast cancer and low expression of LRIG1 has been linked to decreased relapse-free survival. Recently, low expression of LRIG1 was revealed to be an independent risk factor for breast cancer metastasis and death. These findings suggest that LRIG1 may oppose breast cancer cell motility and invasion, cellular processes that are fundamental to metastasis. However, very little is known of LRIG1 function in this regard. In this study, we demonstrate that LRIG1 is downregulated during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that LRIG1 expression may represent a barrier to EMT. Indeed, depletion of endogenous LRIG1 in human mammary epithelial cells expands the stem cell population, augments mammosphere formation and accelerates EMT. Conversely, expression of LRIG1 in highly invasive Basal B breast cancer cells provokes a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition accompanied by a dramatic suppression of tumorsphere formation and a striking loss of invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. LRIG1 expression perturbs multiple signaling pathways and represses markers and effectors of the mesenchymal state. Furthermore, LRIG1 expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells significantly slows their growth as tumors, providing the first in vivo evidence that LRIG1 functions as a growth suppressor in breast cancer."

While several studies have shown elevated levels in patients with coronary heart disease, results in prospective population based studies evaluating MMP-9 in relation to first time coronary events have been inconclusive. As of today, there are four published studies which have measured MMP-9 in serum and none using plasma. Measures of MMP-9 in serum have been suggested to have more flaws than measures in plasma.To investigate the independent association between plasma levels of MMP-9 and first-time incidence of coronary events in an 8-year follow-up.428 men and 438 women, aged 45-69 years, free of previous coronary events and stroke at baseline, were followed-up. Adjustments were made for sex, age, socioeconomic position, behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, chronic disease at baseline, depressive symptoms, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein.53 events were identified during a risk-time of 6 607 person years. Hazard ratio (HR) for MMP-9 after adjustment for all covariates were HR = 1.44 (1.03 to 2.02, p = 0.033). Overall, the effect of adjustments for other cardiovascular risk factors was low.Levels of plasma MMP-9 are independently associated with risk of first-time CHD events, regardless of adjustments. These results are in contrast to previous prospective population-based studies based on MMP-9 in serum. It is essential that more studies look at MMP-9 levels in plasma to further evaluate the association with first coronary events."

https://openalex.org/W2223625162,"Crystal structure of the Type ISP restriction enzyme−DNA complex and single-molecule studies reveal that DNA cleavage occurs through remodeling of ATPase-DNA interactions resulting in translocation of the enzyme without loop formation. Production of endonucleolytic double-strand DNA breaks requires separate strand cleavage events. Although catalytic mechanisms for simple, dimeric endonucleases are known, there are many complex nuclease machines that are poorly understood. Here we studied the single polypeptide Type ISP restriction-modification (RM) enzymes, which cleave random DNA between distant target sites when two enzymes collide after convergent ATP-driven translocation. We report the 2.7-Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of a Type ISP enzyme−DNA complex, revealing that both the helicase-like ATPase and nuclease are located upstream of the direction of translocation, an observation inconsistent with simple nuclease-domain dimerization. Using single-molecule and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that each ATPase remodels its DNA-protein complex and translocates along DNA without looping it, leading to a collision complex in which the nuclease domains are distal. Sequencing of the products of single cleavage events suggests a previously undescribed endonuclease model, where multiple, stochastic strand-nicking events combine to produce DNA scission."

This study first determined the different effects of different-size ultrasound (US) contrast agents and microbubbles (MBs) for enhancing the transdermal delivery of high-molecular-weight drugs. The effects of US-mediated different-size (1.4, 2.1, and 3.5 μm) MBs (as a contrast agent) and ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate (VC-IP) on enhancing skin transdermal delivery were demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that at a power density of 3 W/cm2 the penetration depth in group US combined with 3.5-μm MBs and penetrating VC-IP (U+3.5) was 34% and 14% higher than those in groups US combined with 1.4-μm MBs and penetrating VC-IP (U+1.4) and US combined with 2.1-μm MBs and penetrating VC-IP (U+2.1), respectively, for the agarose phantoms, while the corresponding increases for pigskin were 37% and 19%.In terms of the skin permeation of VC-IP, the VC-IP concentration in group U+3.5 was 23% and 10% higher in than those in groups U+1.4 and U+2.1, respectively. The whitening effect (luminosity index) of mice skin in group U+3.5 had increased (significantly) by 28% after 1 week, by 34% after 2 weeks, and tended to stabilize after 3 weeks (45%) in C57BL/6J mice over a 4-week experimental period. The results obtained in this study indicate that combining US with MBs of different sizes can produce different degrees of skin permeability so as to enhance the delivery of VC-IP to inhibit melanogenesis, without damaging the skin in mice."

The transcriptional regulatory network governed by σE in Salmonella and E. coli has been examined using microarray, however a genome-wide analysis of σE–binding sites in Salmonella has not yet been reported. We infected macrophages with Salmonella Typhimurium over a select time course. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), 31 σE–binding sites were identified. Seventeen sites were new, which included outer membrane proteins, a quorum-sensing protein, a cell division factor, and a signal transduction modulator. The consensus sequence identified for σE in vivo binding was similar to the one previously reported, except for a conserved G and A between the -35 and -10 regions. One third of the σE–binding sites did not contain the consensus sequence, suggesting there may be alternative mechanisms by which σE modulates transcription. By dissecting direct and indirect modes of σE-mediated regulation, we found that σE activates gene expression through recognition of both canonical and reversed consensus sequence. New σE regulated genes (greA, luxS, ompA and ompX) are shown to be involved in heat shock and oxidative stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2260319848,"One of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is impaired reciprocal social interaction, especially in processing emotional information. Social robots are used to encourage children with ASD to take the initiative and to interact with the robotic tools to stimulate emotional responses. However, the existing evidence is limited by poor trial designs. The purpose of this study was to provide computational evidence in support of robot-assisted therapy for children with ASD. We thus propose an emotional model of ASD that adapts a Bayesian model of the uncanny valley effect, which holds that a human-looking robot can provoke repulsion and sensations of eeriness. Based on the unique emotional responses of children with ASD to the robots, we postulate that ASD induces a unique emotional response curve, more like a cliff than a valley. Thus, we performed numerical simulations of robot-assisted therapy to evaluate its effects. The results showed that, although a stimulus fell into the uncanny valley in the typical condition, it was effective at avoiding the uncanny cliff in the ASD condition. Consequently, individuals with ASD may find it more comfortable, and may modify their emotional response, if the robots look like deformed humans, even if they appear ""creepy"" to typical individuals. Therefore, we suggest that our model explains the effects of robot-assisted therapy in children with ASD and that human-looking robots may have potential advantages for improving social interactions in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2290490715,"Background For more accurate estimation of the global burden of pregnancy associated disease, clarity is needed on definition and assessment of non-severe maternal morbidity. Our study aimed to define maternal morbidity with clear criteria for identification at primary care level and estimate the distribution of and evaluate associations between physical (infective and non-infective) and psychological morbidities in two different low-income countries. Methods Cross sectional study with assessment of morbidity in early pregnancy (34%), late pregnancy (35%) and the postnatal period (31%) among 3459 women from two rural communities in Pakistan (1727) and Malawi (1732). Trained health care providers at primary care level used semi-structured questionnaires documenting signs and symptoms, clinical examination and laboratory tests which were bundled to reflect infectious, non-infectious and psychological morbidity. Results One in 10 women in Malawi and 1 in 5 in Pakistan reported a previous pregnancy complication with 1 in 10 overall reporting a previous neonatal death or stillbirth. In the index pregnancy, 50.1% of women in Malawi and 53% in Pakistan were assessed to have at least one morbidity (infective or non-infective). Both infective (Pakistan) and non-infective morbidity (Pakistan and Malawi) was lower in the postnatal period than during pregnancy. Multiple morbidities were uncommon (<10%). There were marked differences in psychological morbidity: 26.9% of women in Pakistan 2.6% in Malawi had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS) > 9. Complications during a previous pregnancy, infective morbidity (p <0.001), intra or postpartum haemorrhage (p <0.02) were associated with psychological morbidity in both settings. Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to strengthen the availability and quality of antenatal and postnatal care packages. We propose to adapt and improve the framework and criteria used in this study, ensuring a basic set of diagnostic tests is available, to ensure more robust assessment of non-severe maternal morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2336172225,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In many patients CKD is diagnosed late during disease progression. Therefore, the implementation of potential biomarkers may facilitate the early identification of individuals at risk. Trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides promote restitution processes of mucous epithelia and are abundant in the urinary tract. We therefore sought to investigate the TFF peptide levels in patients suffering from CKD and their potential as biomarkers for CKD. We analysed TFF1 and TFF3 in serum and urine of 115 patients with CKD stages 1-5 without dialysis by ELISA. 20 healthy volunteers served as controls. Our results showed, that urinary TFF1 levels were significantly increased with the onset of CKD in stages 1-4 as compared to controls and declined during disease progression (p = 0.003, < 0.001, 0.005, and 0.007. median concentrations: 3.5 pg/mL in controls vs 165.2, 61.1, 17.2, and 15.8 pg/mL in CKD 1-4). TFF1 and TFF3 serum levels were significantly elevated in stages 3-5 as compared to controls (TFF1: p < 0.01; median concentrations: 12.1, 39.7, and 34.5 pg/mL in CKD 3-5. TFF3: p < 0.001; median concentrations: 7.1 ng/mL in controls vs 26.1, 52.8, and 78.8 ng/mL in CKD 3-5). TFF3 excretion was increased in stages 4 and 5 (p < 0.001; median urinary levels: 65.2 ng/mL in controls vs 231.5 and 382.6 ng/mL in CKD 4/5; fractional TFF3 excretion: 6.4 in controls vs 19.6 and 44.1 in CKD 4/5). ROC curve analyses showed, that monitoring TFF peptide levels can predict various CKD stages (AUC urinary/serum TFF > 0.8). In conclusion our results show increased levels of TFF1 and TFF3 in CKD patients with a pronounced elevation of urinary TFF1 in lower CKD stages. Furthermore, TFF1 and TFF3 seems to be differently regulated and show potential to predict various CKD stages, as shown by ROC curve analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2205396146,"BRCA2 has an important role in the maintenance of genome stability by interacting with RAD51 recombinase through its C-terminal domain. This interaction is abrogated by cyclin A-CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA2 at serine 3291 (Ser3291). Recently, we showed that cyclin D1 facilitates RAD51 recruitment to BRCA2-containing DNA repair foci, and that downregulation of cyclin D1 leads to inefficient homologous-mediated DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin D1, via amino acids 20–90, interacts with the C-terminal domain of BRCA2, and that this interaction is increased in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, CDK4–cyclin D1 does not phosphorylate Ser3291. Instead, cyclin D1 bars cyclin A from the C-terminus of BRCA2, prevents cyclin A-CDK2-dependent Ser3291 phosphorylation and facilitates RAD51 binding to the C-terminal domain of BRCA2. These findings indicate that the interplay between cyclin D1 and other cyclins such as cyclin A regulates DNA integrity through RAD51 interaction with the BRCA2 C-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2342268517,"Poor outcome of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma patients and lack of outcome predictors prompt continued search for new markers of the disease. In this report, we show circulating microRNA distinguishing multiple myeloma patients with extramedullary disease from myeloma patients without such manifestation and from healthy donors. MicroRNA-130a was identified by TaqMan Low Density Arrays and verified by quantitative PCR on 144 serum samples (59 multiple myeloma, 55 myeloma with extramedullary disease, 30 healthy donors) in test and validation cohorts as being down-regulated in myeloma patients with extramedullary disease. Circulating microRNA-130a distinguished myeloma patients with extramedullary disease from healthy donors with specificity of 90.0% and sensitivity of 77.1%, patients with extramedullary disease from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with specificity of 77.1% and sensitivity of 34.3% in the test cohort and with specificity of 91.7% and sensitivity of 30.0% in the validation cohort of patients. Circulating microRNA-130a in patients with extramedullary myeloma was associated with bone marrow plasma cells infiltration. Further, microRNA-130a was decreased in bone marrow plasma cells obtained from patients with extramedullary myeloma in comparison to bone marrow plasma cells of myeloma patients without such manifestation, but it was increased in tumor site plasma cells of patients with extramedullary disease compared to bone marrow plasma cells of such patients (p<0.0001). Together, our data suggest connection between lower level of microRNA-130a and extramedullary disease and prompt further work to evaluate this miRNA as a marker of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W2194957536,"The effects of environmental hypoxia on cardiac and skeletal muscle metabolism are dependent on the duration and severity of hypoxic exposure, though factors which dictate the nature of the metabolic response to hypoxia are poorly understood. We therefore set out to investigate the time-dependence of metabolic acclimatisation to hypoxia in rat cardiac and skeletal muscle. Rats were housed under normoxic conditions, or exposed to short-term (2 d) or sustained (14 d) hypoxia (10% O2), after which samples were obtained from the left ventricle of the heart and the soleus for assessment of metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function. Mass-corrected maximal oxidative phosphorylation was 20% lower in the left ventricle following sustained but not short-term hypoxia, though no change was observed in the soleus. After sustained hypoxia, the ratio of octanoyl carnitine- to pyruvate- supported respiration was 11% and 12% lower in the left ventricle and soleus, respectively, whilst hexokinase activity increased by 33% and 2.1-fold in these tissues. mRNA levels of PPARα targets fell after sustained hypoxia in both tissues, but those of PPARα remained unchanged. Despite decreased Ucp3 expression after short-term hypoxia, UCP3 protein levels and mitochondrial coupling remained unchanged. Protein carbonylation was 40% higher after short-term but not sustained hypoxic exposure in the left ventricle, but was unchanged in the soleus at both timepoints. Our findings therefore demonstrate that 14 days, but not 2 days, of hypoxia induces a loss of oxidative capacity in the left ventricle but not the soleus, and a substrate switch away from fatty acid oxidation in both tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2336588966,"Many ejaculate traits show remarkable variation in relation to male social status. Males in disfavoured (subordinate) mating positions often invest heavily on sperm motility but may have less available resources on traits (e.g., secondary sexual ornaments) that improve the probability of gaining matings. Although higher investments in sperm motility can increase the relative fertilization success of subordinate males, it is unclear whether status-dependent differences in sperm traits could have any consequences for offspring fitness. We tested this possibility in whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) by experimentally fertilizing the eggs of 24 females with the sperm of either highly-ornamented (large breeding tubercles, dominant) or less-ornamented (small tubercles, subordinate) males (split-clutch breeding design). In comparison to highly-ornamented individuals, less-ornamented males had higher sperm motility, which fertilized the eggs more efficiently, but produced embryos with impaired hatching success. Also offspring size and body condition were lower among less-ornamented males. Furthermore, sperm motility was positively associated with the fertilization success and offspring size, but only in highly-ornamented males. Together our results indicate that male investments on highly motile (fertile) sperm is not necessarily advantageous during later offspring ontogeny and that male status-dependent differences in sperm phenotype may have important effects on offspring fitness in different life-history stages."
https://openalex.org/W2340188228,"Oomycetes are microorganisms that are distantly related to true fungi and many members of this phylum are major plant pathogens. Oomycetes express proteins that are able to interact with plant cell wall polysaccharides, such as cellulose. This interaction is thought to be mediated by carbohydrate-binding modules that are classified into CBM family 1 in the CAZy database. In this study, the two CBMs (1–1 and 1–2) that form part of the cell wall glycoprotein, CBEL, from Phytophthora parasitica have been submitted to detailed characterization, first to better quantify their interaction with cellulose and second to determine whether these CBMs can be useful for biotechnological applications, such as biomass hydrolysis. A variety of biophysical techniques were used to study the interaction of the CBMs with various substrates and the data obtained indicate that CBEL’s CBM1-1 exhibits much greater cellulose binding ability than CBM1-2. Engineering of the family 11 xylanase from Talaromyces versatilis (TvXynB), an enzyme that naturally bears a fungal family 1 CBM, has produced two variants. The first one lacks its native CBM, whereas the second contains the CBEL CBM1-1. The study of these enzymes has revealed that wild type TvXynB binds to cellulose, via its CBM1, and that the substitution of its CBM by oomycetal CBM1-1 does not affect its activity on wheat straw. However, intriguingly the addition of CBEL during the hydrolysis of wheat straw actually potentiates the action of TvXynB variant lacking a CBM1. This suggests that the potentiating effect of CBM1-1 might not require the formation of a covalent linkage to TvXynB."
https://openalex.org/W2182758799,"Following the introduction of effective protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against capsular group C meningococcal disease in Europe, meningococci of capsular group B remain a major cause of death and can result in debilitating sequelae. The outer membrane proteins PorA and FetA have previously been shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in humans. Despite considerable antigenic variation among PorA and FetA OMPs in meningococci, systematic molecular epidemiological studies revealed this variation is highly structured so that a limited repertoire of antigenic types is congruent with the hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages that have caused most of the meningococcal disease in Europe in recent decades. Here we describe the development of a prototype vaccine against capsular group B meningococcal infection based on a N. meningitidis isolate genetically engineered to have constitutive expression of the outer membrane protein FetA. Deoxycholate outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) extracted from cells cultivated in modified Frantz medium contained 21.8% PorA protein, 7.7% FetA protein and 0.03 μg LPS per μg protein (3%). The antibody response to the vaccine was tested in three mouse strains and the toxicological profile of the vaccine was tested in New Zealand white rabbits. Administration of the vaccine, MenPF-1, when given by intramuscular injection on 4 occasions over a 9 week period, was well tolerated in rabbits up to 50 μg/dose, with no evidence of systemic toxicity. These data indicated that the MenPF-1 vaccine had a toxicological profile suitable for testing in a phase I clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W2192238604,"The equilibrium potential for GABA-A receptor mediated currents (EGABA) in neonatal central neurons is set at a relatively depolarized level, which is suggested to be caused by a low expression of K+/Cl- co-transporter (KCC2) but a relatively high expression of Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1). Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in stratum radiatum induces a negative shift in EGABA in juvenile hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the current study, the effects of TBS on EGABA in neonatal and juvenile hippocampal CA1 neurons and the underlying mechanisms were examined. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are suggested to modulate KCC2 and NKCC1 levels in cortical neurons. Therefore, the involvement of mGluRs in the regulation of KCC2 or NKCC1 activity, and thus EGABA, following TBS was also investigated. Whole-cell patch recordings were made from Wistar rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, in a slice preparation. In neonates, TBS induces a positive shift in EGABA, which was prevented by NKCC1 antisense but not NKCC1 sense mRNA. (RS)-a-Methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), a group I and II mGluR antagonist, blocked TBS-induced shifts in both juvenile and neonatal hippocampal neurons. While blockade of mGluR1 or mGluR5 alone could interfere with TBS-induced shifts in EGABA in neonates, only a combined blockade could do the same in juveniles. These results indicate that TBS induces a negative shift in EGABA in juvenile hippocampal neurons but a positive shift in neonatal hippocampal neurons via corresponding changes in KCC2 and NKCC1 expressions, respectively. mGluR activation seems to be necessary for both shifts to occur while the specific receptor subtype involved seems to vary."
https://openalex.org/W1862304691,"In mice, hematopoietic cells home to bone marrow from fetal liver prenatally. To elucidate mechanisms underlying homing, we performed immunohistochemistry with the hematopoietic cell marker c-Kit, and observed c-Kit(+) cells localized inside muscle surrounding bone after 14.5 days post coitum. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD45(+) c-Kit(+) hematopoietic cells were more abundant in muscle than in bone marrow between 14.5 and 17.5 days post coitum, peaking at 16.5 days post coitum. CD45(+) c-Kit(+) cells in muscle at 16.5 days post coitum exhibited higher expression of Gata2, among several hematopoietic genes, than did fetal liver or bone marrow cells. Colony formation assays revealed that muscle hematopoietic cells possess hematopoietic progenitor activity. Furthermore, exo utero transplantation revealed that fetal liver hematopoietic progenitor cells home to muscle and then to BM. Our findings demonstrate that hematopoietic progenitor cell homing occurs earlier than previously reported and that hematopoietic progenitor cells reside in muscle tissue before bone marrow hematopoiesis occurs during mouse embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2337510475,"The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) has dramatically reduced restenosis rates compared with bare metal stents, but in-stent thrombosis remains a safety concern, necessitating prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy. The drug 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) has been shown to have beneficial effects in a cell-specific fashion on smooth muscle cells (SMC), endothelial cells and macrophages. We generated and analyzed a novel bioresorbable polymer coated DES, releasing 6-MP into the vessel wall, to reduce restenosis by inhibiting SMC proliferation and decreasing inflammation, without negatively affecting endothelialization of the stent surface.Stents spray-coated with a bioresorbable polymer containing 0, 30 or 300 μg 6-MP were implanted in the iliac arteries of 17 male New Zealand White rabbits. Animals were euthanized for stent harvest 1 week after implantation for evaluation of cellular stent coverage and after 4 weeks for morphometric analyses of the lesions.Four weeks after implantation, the high dose of 6-MP attenuated restenosis with 16% compared to controls. Reduced neointima formation could at least partly be explained by an almost 2-fold induction of the cell cycle inhibiting kinase p27Kip1. Additionally, inflammation score, the quantification of RAM11-positive cells in the vessel wall, was significantly reduced in the high dose group with 23% compared to the control group. Evaluation with scanning electron microscopy showed 6-MP did not inhibit strut coverage 1 week after implantation.We demonstrate that novel stents coated with a bioresorbable polymer coating eluting 6-MP inhibit restenosis and attenuate inflammation, while stimulating endothelial coverage. The 6-MP-eluting stents demonstrate that inhibition of restenosis without leaving uncovered metal is feasible, bringing stents without risk of late thrombosis one step closer to the patient."
https://openalex.org/W2341981037,"Despite high estimates of the heritability of aggressiveness, the genetic basis for individual differences in aggression remains unclear. Previously, we showed that the wild-derived mouse strain MSM/Ms (MSM) exhibits highly aggressive behaviors, and identified chromosome 15 (Chr 15) as the location of one of the genetic factors behind this escalated aggression by using a panel of consomic strains of MSM in a C57BL/6J (B6) background. To understand the genetic effect of Chr 15 derived from MSM in detail, this study examined the aggressive behavior of a Chr 15 consomic strain towards different types of opponent. Our results showed that both resident and intruder animals had to have the same MSM Chr 15 genotype in order for attack bites to increase and attack latency to be reduced, whereas there was an intruder effect of MSM Chr 15 on tail rattle behavior. To narrow down the region that contains the genetic loci involved in the aggression-eliciting effects on Chr 15, we established a panel of subconsomic strains of MSM Chr 15. Analysis of these strains suggested the existence of multiple genes that enhance and suppress aggressive behavior on Chr 15, and these loci interact in a complex way. Regression analysis successfully identified four genetic loci on Chr 15 that influence attack latency, and one genetic locus that partially elicits aggressive behaviors was narrowed down to a 4.1-Mbp region (from 68.40 Mb to 72.50 Mb) on Chr 15."
https://openalex.org/W2429307384,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. In children, the 2 major RMS subtypes are alveolar and embryonal RMS. Aberrant Hedgehog/Patched1 (Hh/Ptch) signaling is a hallmark of embryonal RMS. We demonstrate that mice carrying a Ptch mutation in mesodermal Delta1-expressing cells develop embryonal-like RMS at a similar rate as mice harboring a Ptch mutation in the germline or the brachury-expressing mesoderm. The tumor incidence decreases dramatically when Ptch is mutated in Myf5- or Pax3-expressing cells. No RMS develop from Myogenin/Mef2c-expressing cells. This suggests that Hh/Ptch-associated RMS are derived from Delta1-positive, Myf5-negative, Myogenin-negative and Pax3-negative mesodermal progenitors that can undergo myogenic differentiation but lack stable lineage commitment. Additional preliminary genetic data and data on mesodermal progenitors further imply an interplay of Hh/Ptch and Delta/Notch signaling activity during RMS initiation. In contrast, Wnt signals supposedly suppress RMS formation because RMS multiplicity decreases after inactivation of the Wnt-inhibitor Wif1. Finally, our results strongly suggest that the tumor-initiating event determines the lineage of RMS origin."
https://openalex.org/W2298519042,"Antigen-specific T cell responses can be visualized using MHC:peptide multimers. In cases where robust T cell controls are not readily available to assess the integrity of multimer reagents prior to analyzing limited sample, the ability to assess the structural integrity of MHC multimers before their use in critical experiments would be useful. We present a method to probe the structural integrity of MHC multimers using antibodies specific for conformational determinants. Beads coated with anti-mouse Ig are incubated with conformation-specific mouse monoclonal antibody and then with fluorescently tagged MHC multimer. The ability of the bead to capture the labeled multimer can be measured semi-quantitatively by flow cytometry. In this manner, the correct folding of MHC multimers can be visualized and batches of multimer can be compared for quality control. Because there are multiple conformational epitopes formed by various molecular interactions among heavy chain, peptide, and β2M, this capture assay can assess the fidelity of each aspect of multimer structure, depending on the availability of antibodies. The described approach could be particularly useful for studies using irreplaceable samples, including patient samples collected in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2197888941,"By means of introgressing a loss-of-function mutation in the p22phox gene from the Matsumoto Eosinophilia Shinshu (MES) rat to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), we constructed the SHRSP-based congenic strain lacking the P22PHOX expression (i.e., lacking NADPH oxidases [NOX] activities) (SHRSP.MES-Cyba(mes)/Izm; hereafter referred to as SP.MES). To examine the effects of Nox activities on the focal ischemic injury or stroke, we performed middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in this new congenic strain; the distal MCA was occluded by 561-nm laser-driven photothrombosis. Resting mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower in SP.MES when compared with the control PM0/SHRSP (150±11 mmHg vs. 166±11 mmHg). Cerebral blood flow decreased to 37±13% in SP.MES and 35±17% in PM0/SHRSP at 10 min after MCA occlusion (not significant). Infarct volume determined at 24 h after MCA occlusion in SP.MES was 89±39 mm3, which was not significantly different from 83±35 mm3 in PM0/SHRSP. The distal MCA pattern was more complex in SP.MES (median 3, IQR 3-5) than PM0/SHRSP (median 2, IQR 1-3) (p = 0.001). Because more complex distal MCA is known to produce larger infarction after distal MCA occlusion in SHR, we adjusted for the branching pattern in an ANCOVA. The adjusted mean of infarct volume was significantly smaller in SP.MES compared with that in PM0/SHRSP (67 [95% CI 46 to 87] mm3 vs. 100 [95% CI 82 to 118] mm3, p = 0.032). Elimination of the P22PHOX expression induced complex distal MCA, which would suggest the presence of 'loss of complexity' induced by enhanced oxidative stress in SHRSP; infarct size in SP.MES--when adjusted for distal MCA complexity--was significantly attenuated compared with that in PM0/SHRSP. Therefore, the present results suggest that Nox is harmful for ischemic brain tissue."
