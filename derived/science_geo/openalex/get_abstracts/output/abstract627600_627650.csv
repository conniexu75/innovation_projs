https://openalex.org/W2913972921,"The composition of the human gut microbiota is linked to health and disease, but knowledge of individual microbial species is needed to decipher their biological roles. Despite extensive culturing and sequencing efforts, the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota remains undefined. Here we identify 1,952 uncultured candidate bacterial species by reconstructing 92,143 metagenome-assembled genomes from 11,850 human gut microbiomes. These uncultured genomes substantially expand the known species repertoire of the collective human gut microbiota, with a 281% increase in phylogenetic diversity. Although the newly identified species are less prevalent in well-studied populations compared to reference isolate genomes, they improve classification of understudied African and South American samples by more than 200%. These candidate species encode hundreds of newly identified biosynthetic gene clusters and possess a distinctive functional capacity that might explain their elusive nature. Our work expands the known diversity of uncultured gut bacteria, which provides unprecedented resolution for taxonomic and functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2911725378,"Oligodendrocyte pathology is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases as oligodendrocytes both myelinate and provide metabolic support to axons. In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelination in the central nervous system thus leads to neurodegeneration, but the severity of MS between patients is very variable. Disability does not correlate well with the extent of demyelination1, which suggests that other factors contribute to this variability. One such factor may be oligodendrocyte heterogeneity. Not all oligodendrocytes are the same—those from the mouse spinal cord inherently produce longer myelin sheaths than those from the cortex2, and single-cell analysis of the mouse central nervous system identified further differences3,4. However, the extent of human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity and its possible contribution to MS pathology remain unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing from white matter areas of post-mortem human brain from patients with MS and from unaffected controls. We identified subclusters of oligodendroglia in control human white matter, some with similarities to mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. Notably, some subclusters were underrepresented in MS tissue, whereas others were more prevalent. These differences in mature oligodendrocyte subclusters may indicate different functional states of oligodendrocytes in MS lesions. We found similar changes in normal-appearing white matter, showing that MS is a more diffuse disease than its focal demyelination suggests. Our findings of an altered oligodendroglial heterogeneity in MS may be important for understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis identifies different subclusters of oligodendroglia in white matter from individuals with multiple sclerosis compared with controls, and these differences may be important for understanding disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2950254084,"The large-scale organization of dynamical neural activity across cortex emerges through long-range interactions among local circuits. We hypothesized that large-scale dynamics are also shaped by heterogeneity of intrinsic local properties across cortical areas. One key axis along which microcircuit properties are specialized relates to hierarchical levels of cortical organization. We developed a large-scale dynamical circuit model of human cortex that incorporates heterogeneity of local synaptic strengths, following a hierarchical axis inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived T1- to T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) mapping and fit the model using multimodal neuroimaging data. We found that incorporating hierarchical heterogeneity substantially improves the model fit to functional MRI (fMRI)-measured resting-state functional connectivity and captures sensory-association organization of multiple fMRI features. The model predicts hierarchically organized higher-frequency spectral power, which we tested with resting-state magnetoencephalography. These findings suggest circuit-level mechanisms linking spatiotemporal levels of analysis and highlight the importance of local properties and their hierarchical specialization on the large-scale organization of human cortical dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2913615924,"Intolerance of Uncertainty is a trans-diagnostic process that spans a range of emotional disorders and it is usually measured through the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12. The current study aims at investigating some issues in the assessment of Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) through the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised, a measure adapted from the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 to assess IU across the lifespan. In particular we address the factor structure among a large community sample, measurement invariance across gender, age, and over time, together with reliability and validity of the overall scale and its subscales. The questionnaire was administered to community (N = 761; mean age = 35.86 ± 14.01 years) and undergraduate (N = 163; mean age = 21.16 ± 2.64 years) participants, together with other self-report measures assessing constructs theoretically related to IU. The application of a bifactor model shows that the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised possesses a robust general factor, thus supporting the use of the unit-weighted total score of the questionnaire as a measure of the construct. Furthermore, measurement invariance across gender, age, and over time is supported. Finally, the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised appears to possess adequate reliability and validity. These findings support the unidimensionality of the measure, a conceptually reasonable result in line with the trans-diagnostic nature of Intolerance of Uncertainty. In addition, this study and comparison with published factor structures of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 and of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised identify some issues for the internal structure of the measure. In particular, concern is expressed for the Prospective IU subscale. In light of the promising psychometric properties, the use of the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised as a univocal measure is encouraged in both research and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2911750288,"We have established early-gestation chorionic villus-derived placenta mesenchymal stromal cells (PMSCs) as a potential treatment for spina bifida (SB), a neural tube defect. Our preclinical studies demonstrated that PMSCs have the potential to cure hind limb paralysis in the fetal lamb model of SB via a paracrine mechanism. PMSCs exhibit neuroprotective function by increasing cell number and neurites, as shown by indirect coculture and direct addition of PMSC-conditioned medium to the staurosporine-induced apoptotic human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y. PMSC-conditioned medium suppressed caspase activity in apoptotic SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that PMSC secretome contributes to neuronal survival after injury. As a part of PMSC secretome, PMSC exosomes were isolated and extensively characterized; their addition to apoptotic SH-SY5Y cells mediated an increase in neurites, suggesting that they exhibit neuroprotective function. Proteomic and RNA sequencing analysis revealed that PMSC exosomes contain several proteins and RNAs involved in neuronal survival and development. Galectin 1 was highly expressed on the surface of PMSCs and PMSC exosomes. Preincubation of exosomes with anti-galectin 1 antibody decreased their neuroprotective effect, suggesting that PMSC exosomes likely impart their effect via binding of galectin 1 to cells. Future studies will include in-depth analyses of the role of PMSC exosomes on neuroprotection and their clinical applications.-Kumar, P., Becker, J. C., Gao, K., Carney, R.

https://openalex.org/W2914510880,"The study of microplastic pollution involves multidisciplinary analyses on a large number of microplastics. Therefore, providing an overview of plastic pollution is time consuming and, despite high throughput analyses, remains a major challenge. The objective of this study is to propose a protocol to determine how many microplastics must be analyzed to give a representative view of the particle size distribution and chemical nature, and calculate the associated margin error. Based on microplastic data from Tara Mediterranean campaign, this approach is explained through different examples. In this particular case, the results show that only 3% of the collected microplastics need to be analyzed to give a precise view on the scale of the North West Mediterranean Basin (error <5%), and 17.7% to give an overview manta per manta (error <10%). This approach could be an important practical contribution to microplastic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2911266829,"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia, is thought to be regulated by changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. However, the evidence for this is inconsistent. The high stability and expression of circulating exosomal miRNAs may allow their use as candidate biomarkers. For the discovery phase, exosomes were isolated from the serum of patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) as the controls (n = 5) and with paroxysmal AF (n = 4) and persistent AF (n = 5) for microarray analysis of miRNAs. Forty-five miRNAs were expressed significantly higher (>1.5-fold) in patients with persistent AF, but not in patients with paroxysmal AF, relative to the levels in patients with SVT control. Notably, expression of 5 miRNAs (miRNA-103a, -107, -320d, -486, and let-7b) was elevated by more than 4.5-fold in patients with persistent AF. For the validation phase, miRNAs were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR analysis in exosomes from the serum of patients with SVT control (n = 20) and patients with persistent AF (n = 40). These miRNAs and their target genes were involved in atrial function and structure, oxidative stress, and fibrosis pathways. These findings suggest that serum exosomal miRNAs might be used as novel biomarkers to reflect the progression of AF.-Mun, D., Kim, H., Kang, J.-Y., Park, H., Park, H., Lee, S.-H., Yun, N., Joung, B.

https://openalex.org/W2912943079,"EBV infection of preinvasive nasopharyngeal epithelium is believed to be an initiation step during pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a novel mechanism driving NPC metastasis through the EBV-encoded LMP1-mediated metabolic reprogramming, via activation of IGF1-mTORC2 signaling and nuclear acetylation of the Snail promoter by the PDHE1α, an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism. Mechanistically, EBV-LMP1 increases the cellular secretion of IGF1 which promotes phosphorylation of IGF1R to activate mTORC2/AKT signaling linking glucose metabolism to cell motility. LMP1 expression facilitates translocation of mitochondrial PDHE1α into the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner at Ser293 residue. Functionally, nuclear PDHE1α promotes H3K9 acetylation on the Snail promoter to enhance cell motility, thereby driving cancer metastasis. Importantly, the IGF1/mTORC2/PDHE1α/Snail axis correlates significantly with disease progression and poor prognosis in NPC patients. This study highlights the functional importance of IGF1-mTORC2-PDHE1α signaling mediated by EBV-LMP1 in NPC pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2950923293,"Fluent retrieval and execution of movement sequences is essential for daily activities, but the neural mechanisms underlying sequence planning remain elusive. Here participants learned finger press sequences with different orders and timings and reproduced them in a magneto-encephalography (MEG) scanner. We classified the MEG patterns for each press in the sequence and examined pattern dynamics during preparation and production. Our results demonstrate the “competitive queuing” (CQ) of upcoming action representations, extending previous computational and non-human primate recording studies to non-invasive measures in humans. In addition, we show that CQ reflects an ordinal template that generalizes across specific motor actions at each position. Finally, we demonstrate that CQ predicts participants’ production accuracy and originates from parahippocampal and cerebellar sources. These results suggest that the brain learns and controls multiple sequences by flexibly combining representations of specific actions and interval timing with high-level, parallel representations of sequence position."
https://openalex.org/W2913884839,"Background There is worldwide concern of rapidly increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, there is paucity of resistance surveillance data and updated antibiograms in Africa in general. This study was undertaken in Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) -the largest public tertiary referral centre in East & Central Africa—to help bridge existing AMR knowledge and practice gaps. Methods A retrospective review of VITEK 2 (bioMérieux) records capturing antimicrobial susceptibility data for the year 2015 was done and analysed using WHONET and SPSS. Results Analysis of 624 isolates revealed AMR rates higher than most recent local and international reports. 88% of isolates tested were multi-drug resistant (MDR) whereas 26% were extensively-drug resistant (XDR). E. coli and K. pneumoniae had poor susceptibility to penicillins (8–48%), cephalosporins (16–43%), monobactams (17–29%), fluoroquinolones (22–44%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins, with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems (70% and 27% respectively). S aureus had poor susceptibility to penicillins (3%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (29%) but showed excellent susceptibility to imipenem (90%), vancomycin (97%) and linezolid (99%). Conclusions The overwhelming resistance to commonly used antibiotics heralds a clarion call towards strengthening antimicrobial stewardship programmes and regular AMR regional surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2912179268,"Transmembrane signals initiated by a range of extracellular stimuli converge on members of the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, which relay these signals in target cells. Gq family G proteins comprise Gq, G11, G14, and G16, which upon activation mediate their cellular effects via inositol lipid–dependent and –independent signaling to control fundamental processes in mammalian physiology. To date, highly specific inhibition of Gq/11/14 signaling can be achieved only with FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), two naturally occurring cyclic depsipeptides. To further development of FR or YM mimics for other Gα subunits, we here set out to rationally design Gα16 proteins with artificial FR/YM sensitivity by introducing an engineered depsipeptide-binding site. Thereby we permit control of G16 function through ligands that are inactive on the WT protein. Using CRISPR/Cas9-generated Gαq/Gα11-null cells and loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis along with label-free whole-cell biosensing, we determined the molecular coordinates for FR/YM inhibition of Gq and transplanted these to FR/YM-insensitive G16. Intriguingly, despite having close structural similarity, FR and YM yielded biologically distinct activities: it was more difficult to perturb Gq inhibition by FR and easier to install FR inhibition onto G16 than perturb or install inhibition with YM. A unique hydrophobic network utilized by FR accounted for these unexpected discrepancies. Our results suggest that non-Gq/11/14 proteins should be amenable to inhibition by FR scaffold–based inhibitors, provided that these inhibitors mimic the interaction of FR with Gα proteins harboring engineered FR-binding sites.

https://openalex.org/W2912207490,"Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in cardiovascular center contribute to the pathological processes underlying hypertension. Microglia activation triggers the inflammation and oxidative stress. Melatonin is a documented potent anti-inflammatory regent and antioxidant, the underlying roles of melatonin in regulating microglia activation via mitochondria remain unclear. In present study, we investigated the protective role of melatonin in decreasing M1 phenotype switching via attenuating mitochondrial oxidative damage in dependence on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) pathway in microglia. Prorenin (20 nmol/L; 24 hr) was used to induce inflammation in cultured microglia. Mitochondrial morphology was detected by transmission electron microscope. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by using DCFH-DA fluorescence imaging and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) was evaluated by JC-1 staining. The indicator of the redox status as the ratio of the amount of total NADP+ to total NADPH, and the expression of 6 subunits of NADPH oxidase is measured. The pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing was measured by qPCR. UCP2 and activated AMPKα (p-AMPKα) expression were examined by immunoblot. Melatonin (100 μM) markedly alleviated the M1 microglia phenotype shifting and abnormal mitochondria morphology. Melatonin attenuated prorenin-induced ΔΨm increasing and ROS overproduction. Melatonin decreased the redox ratio (NADP+/NADPH) and the p47phox and gp91phox subunits of NADPH oxidase expression in prorenin-treated microglia. These effects were reversed in the presence of UCP2 siRNA. Our results suggested that the protective effect of melatonin against prorenin-induced M1 phenotype switching via attenuating mitochondrial oxidative damage depending on UCP2 upregulation in prorenin-treated microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2913445153,"Background Recent studies have begun to identify the molecular determinants of inter-individual variability of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in response to exercise training programs. However, we still have an incomplete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying trainability in response to exercise training. Objective We investigated baseline serum and skeletal muscle metabolomics profile and its associations with maximal power output (MPO) gains in response to 8-week of continuous endurance training (ET) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs matched for total units of exercise performed (the TIMES study). Methods Eighty healthy sedentary young adult males were randomized to one of three groups and 70 were defined as completers (> 90% of sessions): ET (n = 30), HIIT (n = 30) and control (CO, n = 10). For the CO, participants were asked to not exercise for 8 weeks. Serum and skeletal muscle samples were analyzed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The targeted screens yielded 43 serum and 70 muscle reproducible metabolites (intraclass > 0.75; coefficient of variation < 25%). Associations of baseline metabolites with MPO trainability were explored within each training program via three analytical strategies: (1) correlations with gains in MPO; (2) differences between high and low responders to ET and HIIT; and (3) metabolites contributions to the most significant pathways related to gains in MPO. The significance level was set at P < 0.01 or false discovery rate of 0.1. Results The exercise programs generated similar gains in MPO (ET = 21.4 ± 8.0%; HIIT = 24.3 ± 8.5%). MPO associated baseline metabolites supported by all three levels of evidence were: serum glycerol, muscle alanine, proline, threonine, creatinine, AMP and pyruvate for ET, and serum lysine, phenylalanine, creatine, and muscle glycolate for HIIT. The most common pathways suggested by the metabolite profiles were aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Conclusion We suggest that MPO gains in both programs are potentially associated with metabolites indicative of baseline amino acid and translation processes with additional evidence for carbohydrate metabolism in ET."
https://openalex.org/W2913684698,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) represents the crucial molecular mediator of key endocrine, glucocorticoid hormone-dependent regulatory circuits, including control of glucose, protein, and lipid homeostasis. Consequently, aberrant glucocorticoid signaling is linked to severe metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperglycemia, all of which also appear upon chronic glucocorticoid therapy for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Of note, long-term glucocorticoid exposure under these therapeutic conditions typically induces glucocorticoid resistance, requiring higher doses and consequently triggering more severe metabolic phenotypes. However, the molecular basis of acquired glucocorticoid resistance remains unknown. In a screen of differential microRNA expression during glucocorticoid-dependent adipogenic differentiation of human multipotent adipose stem cells, we identified microRNA 29a (miR-29a) as one of the most down-regulated transcripts. Overexpression of miR-29a impaired adipogenesis. We found that miR-29a represses GR in human adipogenesis by directly targeting its mRNA, and downstream analyses revealed that GR mediates most of miR-29a's anti-adipogenic effects. Conversely, miR-29a expression depends on GR activation, creating a novel miR-29-driven feedback loop. miR-29a and GR expression were inversely correlated both in murine adipose tissue and in adipose tissue samples obtained from human patients. In the latter, miR-29a levels were additionally strongly negatively correlated with body mass index and adipocyte size. Importantly, inhibition of miR-29 in mice partially rescued the down-regulation of GR during dexamethasone treatment. We discovered that, in addition to modulating GR function under physiologic conditions, pharmacologic glucocorticoid application in inflammatory disease also induced miR-29a expression, correlating with reduced GR levels. This effect was abolished in mice with impaired GR function. In summary, we uncovered a novel GR-miR-29a negative feedback loop conserved between mice and humans, in health and disease. For the first time, we elucidate a microRNA-related mechanism that might contribute to GR dysregulation and resistance in peripheral tissues.-Glantschnig, C., Koenen, M., Gil-Lozano, M., Karbiener, M., Pickrahn, I., Williams-Dautovich, J., Patel, R., Cummins, C.

https://openalex.org/W2914771761,"Promoter methylation plays a vital role in tumorigenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressive genes. Using genome-wide methylation array, we first identified PBX/Knotted Homeobox 2 (PKNOX2) as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. PKNOX2 mRNA expression is largely silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric cancer via promoter methylation. Promoter methylation of PKNOX2 was associated with poor survival in gastric cancer patients. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional studies revealed that PKNOX2 functions as a tumor suppressor. Ectopic PKNOX2 expression inhibited cell proliferation in GC cell lines and suppressed growth of tumor xenografts in mice via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest; and suppressed cell migration and invasion by blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. On the other hand, knockdown PKNOX2 in normal gastric epithelial cells triggered diverse malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, PKNOX2 exerts its tumor suppressive effect by promoting the up-regulation of Insulin like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5 (IGFBP5) and TP53. PKNOX2 binds to the promoter regions of IGFBP5 and TP53 and transcriptionally activated their expression by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR assay. IGFBP5 knockdown partly abrogated tumor suppressive effect of PKNOX2, indicating that the function(s) of PKNOX2 are dependent on IGFBP5. IGFBP5 promoted PKNOX2-mediated up-regulation of p53. As a consequence, p53 transcription target genes were coordinately up-regulated in PKNOX2-expressing GC cells, leading to tumor suppression. In summary, our results identified PKNOX2 as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer by activation of IGFBP5 and p53 signaling pathways. PKNOX2 promoter hypermethylation might be a biomarker for the poor survival of gastric cancer patients."

However, it remains unclear whether movement synchrony rated by humans and movement synchrony identified by automated methods reflect the same construct. To address this issue, video sequences showing movement synchrony of patients and therapists (N = 10) or not (N = 10), were analyzed using motion energy analysis. Three different synchrony conditions with varying levels of complexity (naturally embedded, naturally isolated, and artificial) were generated for time series analysis with windowed cross-lagged correlation/ -regression (WCLC, WCLR). The concordance of ratings (human rating vs. automatic assessment) was computed for 600 different parameter configurations of the WCLC/WCLR to identify the parameter settings that measure movement synchrony best. A parameter configuration was rated as having a good identification rate if it yields high concordance with human-rated intervals (Cohen’s kappa) and a low amount of over-identified data points. Results indicate that 76 configurations had a good identification rate (IR) in the least complex condition (artificial). Two had an acceptable IR with regard to the naturally isolated condition. Concordance was low with regard to the most complex (naturally embedded) condition. A valid identification of movement synchrony strongly depends on parameter configuration and goes beyond the identification of synchrony by human raters. Differences between human-rated synchrony and nonverbal synchrony measured by algorithms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2913918256,"Corolla color in Gentiana lutea L. exhibits a yellow/orange variation. We previously demonstrated that the orange petal color of G. lutea L. var. aurantiaca is predominantly caused by newly synthesized pelargonidin glycosides that confer a reddish hue to the yellow background color, derived from the carotenoids. However, the anthocyanin molecules of these pelargonidin glycosides are not yet fully identified and characterized. Here, we investigated the regulation, content and type of anthocyanins determining the petal coloration of the orange-flowered G. lutea L. var. aurantiaca. Anthocyanins from the petals of G. lutea L. var. aurantiaca were characterized and quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS (High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry) coupled with a diode array detector in flowers at three different stages of development (S1, S3 and S5). Eleven pelargonidin derivatives were identified in the petals of G. lutea L. var. aurantiaca for the first time, but quantitative and qualitative differences were observed at each developmental stage. The highest levels of these pelargonidin derivatives were reached at the fully open flower stage (S5) where all anthocyanins were detected. In contrast, not all the anthocyanins were detected at the budlet stage (S1) and mature bud stage (S3) and those corresponded to more complex pelargonidin derivatives. The major pelargonidin derivatives found at all the stages were pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin 3,5-O-diglucoside and pelargonidin 3-O-rutinoside. Furthermore, the expression of DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase), ANS (anthocyanidin synthase), 3GT (UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase), 5GT (UDP-glucose:flavonoid 5-O-glucosyltransferase) and 5AT (anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase) genes was analyzed in the petals of three developmental stages, showing that the expression level of DFR, ANS and 3GT parallels the accumulation of the pelargonidin glucosides. Overall, this study enhances the knowledge of the biochemical basis of flower coloration in Gentiana species, and lays a foundation for breeding of flower color and genetic variation studies on Gentiana varieties."

Previous studies analyzed only one or two categories of PRF risk factors (preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative ones). The aims of this study were to identify PRF predictors, to assess the length of stay (LoS) in ICU and the 90-day survival according to the PRF in LTx patients. Methods Two classification approaches were used: systematic classification (recipient-related preoperative factors; intraoperative factors; logistic factors; donor factors; postoperative ICU factors; postoperative surgical factors) and patient/organ classification (patient-related general factors; native-liver factors; new-liver factors; kidney factors; heart factors; brain factors; lung factors). Two hundred adult non-acute patients were included. Missing analysis was performed. The competitive role of each factor was assessed. Results PRF occurred in 36.0% of cases. Among 28 significant PRF predictors at univariate analysis, 6 were excluded because of collinearity, 22 were investigated by ROC curves and by logistic regression analysis. Recipient age (OR = 1.05; p = 0.010), female sex (OR = 2.75; p = 0.018), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD, OR = 1.09; p<0.001), restrictive lung pattern (OR = 2.49; p = 0.027), intraoperative veno-venous bypass (VVBP, OR = 3.03; p = 0.008), pre-extubation PaCO2 (OR = 1.11; p = 0.003) and Model for Early Allograft Function (MEAF, OR = 1.37; p<0.001) resulted independent PRF risk factors. As compared to patients without PRF, the PRF-group had longer LoS (10 days IQR 7–18 versus 5 days IQR 4–7, respectively; p<0.001) and lower day-90 survival (86.0% versus 97.6% respectively, p<0.001). Conclusion In conclusion, MELD, restrictive lung pattern, surgical complexity as captured by VVBP, pre-extubation PaCO2 and MEAF are the main predictors of PRF in non-acute LTx patients."
https://openalex.org/W2912569238,"In response to liver injury, the liver undergoes a regeneration process to retain its mass and function. However, the regeneration mechanism has not been fully clarified. This study investigated the role of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), a Hippo-signaling effector, in liver regeneration. We observed that TAZ stimulates liver regeneration after liver injury. After partial hepatectomy (PHx) or carbon tetrachloride damage, TAZ was required for liver regeneration to increase hepatic cell proliferation and resist hepatic apoptosis, which were decreased in liver-specific TAZ knockout (LKO) mice. TAZ stimulated macrophage infiltration, resulting in IL-6 production, which induced liver regeneration. In LKO mice, IL-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, ERK, and PKB was decreased. We also observed that periductal fibrogenesis was significantly increased in LKO mice during liver regeneration after PHx, which was caused by increased hepatic apoptosis. Our results suggest that TAZ stimulates liver regeneration through IL-6-induced hepatocyte proliferation and inhibition of cell death after liver injury.-Kim, A. R., Park, J. I., Oh, H. T., Kim, K.

https://openalex.org/W2914497532,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and envelopment is dependent on cellular autophagy. Previously, we have provided evidence for the extensive lysosomal degradation of HBV virions and the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which is likely controlled by autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP29) has been identified as a protein specifically mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Thus, in the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that SNAP29 is required for the autophagic degradation of HBV virions and HBsAg. We found that silencing SNAP29 significantly increased the number of autophagosomes and concomitantly promoted HBV replication and HBsAg production. Conversely, SNAP29 overexpression decreased HBV production. Consistent with this, SNAP29 modulated HBV production by interacting with vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8) and synergistically regulated HBV replication with Rab7 complexes. Moreover, the production and release of the small HBsAg is strongly regulated by SNAP29 expression, suggesting that its export occurs partly through the autophagic pathway. Our findings provide new evidence, strongly suggesting that autophagic degradation critically determines the production of HBV virions and HBsAg and that this is controlled by the SNAP29-VAMP8 interaction.-Lin, Y., Wu, C., Wang, X., Liu, S., Kemper, T., Li, F., Squire, A., Zhu, Y., Zhang, J., Chen, X., Lu, M.

In this study, we aimed to assess the quality of motile spermatozoa in the context of obesity by analysing their conventional and molecular characteristics as well as their ability to promote early embryonic development. A prospective study was conducted on 128 infertile men divided into three groups: 40 lean, 42 overweight, and 46 obese men. Conventional sperm parameters (concentration, motility and morphology) and sperm molecular status (chromatin composition and integrity, 5-methycytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxycytosine (5-hmC) contents and oxidative stress level) were analysed on raw semen and/or on motile spermatozoa selected by density gradient or swim-up techniques. Morphokinetic analysis of the embryos derived from ICSI was performed using the Embryoviewer software. Our results showed that the motile sperm-enriched fraction from obese men exhibited higher levels of retained histones (p<0.001), elevated percentage of altered chromatin integrity (p<0.001), and decreased contents of 5-hmC (p<0.001), and 5-mC (p<0.05) levels as compared to that from lean men. Importantly, there were no statistically significant correlations between these molecular parameters and the percentages of morphologically normal motile spermatozoa. Regarding embryo morphokinetics, the CC1 (p<0.05) and CC3 (p<0.05) embryonic cell cycles were significantly delayed in the cleavage embryos of the obese group as compared to the embryos of the lean group. Our data is of particular interest because, besides demonstrating the negative impacts of obesity on motile spermatozoa molecular composition, it also highlights the possible risk of disturbing early embryonic cell cycles kinetics in the context of paternal obesity."

In vivo experiments were performed in 2-mo-old atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient/LDL receptor-deficient (ApoE-/-/LDLR-/-) female mice and their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates. In in vitro experiments, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated with 7K. ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice developed hypercholesterolemia accompanied by increased circulating levels of P-selectin and Eng and a disruption of NO metabolism. Functional analysis of the aorta demonstrated impaired vascular reactivity, and Western blot analysis revealed down-regulation of membrane Eng/Smad2/3/eNOS signaling in ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice. 7K increased Eng expression via Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), liver X nuclear receptor, and NF-κB in HAECs. 7K-induced Eng expression was prevented by the treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; 8-{[5-chloro-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) pyridine-4-carbonyl] amino}-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4, 5-dihydrobenzo[g]indazole-3-carboxamide; or by KLF6 silencing. 7K induced increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytic human leukemia promonocytic cell line cells and was prevented by Eng silencing. We concluded that hypercholesterolemia altered Eng expression and signaling, followed by endothelial or vascular dysfunction before formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice. By contrast, 7K increased Eng expression and induced inflammation in HAECs, which was followed by an increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytes via endothelium, which was prevented by Eng inhibition. Thus, we propose a relevant role for Eng in endothelial or vascular dysfunction or inflammation when exposed to cholesterol.-Vicen, M., Vitverova, B., Havelek, R., Blazickova, K., Machacek, M., Rathouska, J., Najmanová, I., Dolezelova, E., Prasnicka, A., Sternak, M., Bernabeu, C., Nachtigal, P.

One HDACi, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), exhibits off-target effects on host gene expression predicted to interfere with induction of HIV transcription. Romidepsin (RMD) has higher potency and specificity for class I HDACs implicated in maintaining HIV provirus in the latent state. More robust HIV reactivation has indeed been achieved with RMD use ex vivo than with SAHA; however, reduction of viral reservoir size has not been observed in clinical trials. Therefore, using RNA-Seq, we sought to compare the effects of SAHA and RMD on gene expression in primary CD4+ T cells. Among the genes whose expression was modulated by both HDACi agents, we identified genes previously implicated in HIV latency. Two genes, SMARCB1 and PARP1, whose modulation by SAHA and RMD is predicted to inhibit HIV reactivation, were evaluated in the major maturation subsets of CD4+ T cells and were consistently either up- or down-regulated by both HDACi compounds. Our results indicate that despite having different potencies and HDAC specificities, SAHA and RMD modulate an overlapping set of genes, implicated in HIV latency regulation. Some of these genes merit exploration as additional targets to improve the therapeutic outcomes of “shock and kill” strategies.

By interfering with the active site of HDAC enzymes, HDACis cause hyperacetylation of histones and chromatin relaxation. HDAC classification into four distinct classes is based on homology to yeast acetylases. HDACs from classes I, II, and IV are Zn2+-dependent enzymes, whereas class III HDACs, called sirtuins, are NAD+-dependent (reviewed in Ref. 9Shirakawa K. Chavez L. Hakre S. Calvanese V. Verdin E.

A number of HDACis have a broad range of action (called pan-HDACis); however, the IC50 values of different HDACs vary. For example, SAHA is active against representative HDACs from classes I, II, and IV; however, it is most potent against HDAC6, a representative of class II (7Wei D.G. Chiang V. Fyne E.

It is therefore plausible that the inhibitory effect of RMD on HIV is not associated with direct inhibition of HDAC6 activity. It is likely that secondary effects on host gene expression following the initial gene activation play an important role in the net achievable level of induction of HIV gene expression following treatment with HDACi. We have previously shown that some of these secondary effects in the case of SAHA represented down-regulation of HIV transcriptional activators and up-regulation of repressors, both at the RNA and protein levels (20White C.H.

The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of RMD on the transcriptome of primary uninfected CD4+ T cells and an in vitro model of HIV latency and to compare the effects of RMD and SAHA on host genes to enhance our understanding of the secondary mechanism of action of these compounds that are relevant to reactivation of latent HIV. A subset of host genes modulated by these two HDACis were assessed as potential targets for improving shock and kill treatment outcomes. Treatment with 1 μm SAHA has been shown previously to result in induction of expression of HIV RNA in the “Spina model” of HIV latency (21Spina C.A. Anderson J. Archin N.M. Bosque A. Chan J.

Here, we have tested the activity of RMD for HIV reactivation in the same model system. To determine the optimal concentration of RMD, cells from the latency model were treated with different concentrations of RMD, and HIV expression (gag RNA) was measured by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We found that RMD had similar activity around a range of doses, with the average peak of activation observed at 15 nm (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting using an antibody against acetylated histone H3 demonstrated that at selected doses, treatment with SAHA or RMD resulted in an increased acetylation of histone H3 (Fig. 1B), confirming that both compounds were active. Paired samples of the model of HIV latency and mock-infected cells, treated with 1 μm SAHA, 15 nm RMD, or their solvent control DMSO for 24 h, were collected for RNA-Seq. With selected treatment conditions, treatment with SAHA or RMD did not reduce cell viability, compared with DMSO treatment (Fig. 2A) as assessed by trypan blue staining. Cell activation was assessed by measuring surface proteins expressed during early (CD69), intermediate (CD25), and late (HLA-DR) stages of T cell activation; cell exhaustion was assessed using surface expression of CD279 (also known as PD-1). In general, the percentage of cells positive for any of these markers, following treatment, was not greater than that for the untreated cells. In the in vitro model of latency, there were significantly more CD69-positive cells in RMD-treated samples, compared with DMSO-treated (average -fold increase 1.6, p = 0.0006). However, this difference appeared to be caused by the exposure to DMSO, which resulted in reduction in frequency of CD69-positive cells, compared with untreated sample (average -fold decrease 1.6, p < 0.0001). On the other hand, exposure of cells to virus during establishment of the in vitro model significantly reduced viability (p < 0.0001) and induced modest T cell activation (CD69 average -fold increase 1.7, p = 0.005) and exhaustion (PD-1 average -fold increase 1.4, p = 0.02). HIV transcription was variably induced in the four sequenced samples, as assessed by ddPCR. Induction of gag RNA ranged from no response in one donor to a 1.85-fold increase with SAHA and a 2.75-fold increase with RMD (Fig. 2B). Similar trends were seen with total polyadenylated (poly(A)) and singly spliced (env) transcripts. Multiply spliced (MS) transcripts were the least responsive in this experiment (Fig. 2B). The degree of HIV reactivation did not appear to correlate with the percentage of latently infected cells. Of the two samples with the most integrants (in 20% of cells), one was the best responder to the HDACi, whereas the other one was the nonresponder (Fig. 2C). Because the frequency of latently infected cells is low in our in vitro model (8–20%), any difference in their response to HDACi would unlikely be detectable, unless it was very robust (i.e. >5–10-fold). However, it is not known whether exposure of cells to virus during the culture period affects the way they respond to HDACi treatment. Because exposure to virus slightly affected the activation status of the cells, we sought to test whether cells in the model of HIV latency differ in response to HDACi, compared with mock-infected cells. A complex contrast approach was used in EdgeR to identify genes, differentially modulated by the two HDACis (see supporting Methods for details). This formal analysis demonstrated that only 6 and 11 genes were differentially modulated by SAHA and RMD, respectively, when responses in mock-infected cells were compared with cells from the HIV latency model (Table S1). These results are consistent with the idea that the effect of exposure to virus on alterations of gene expression induced by HDACi is minimal and that gene modulations were similar in mock-infected cells and the model of HIV latency. One of the differentially modulated genes was cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A/p21), a well-known host factor induced by many HDACi, including SAHA and RMD. Its up-regulation by HDACi mediates growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer cells (22Huang L. Sowa Y. Sakai T. Pardee A.B.

In our study, CDKN1A was highly (-fold increase of 3.6 for SAHA and 3.9 for RMD) and significantly up-regulated in mock-infected cells (false discovery rate corrected p value (FDR) < 0.05) but only minimally up-regulated (-fold increase of 1.28 and FDR > 0.05) in cells from the HIV latency model (Table S1). We next sought to identify human genes modulated by SAHA and RMD in primary CD4+ T cells to better understand what effects on the host may be stimulatory or inhibitory for HIV reactivation. We previously performed a gene expression profiling study, using microarrays coupled with LC-MS to identify genes modulated by SAHA (20White C.H. Johnston H.E. Moesker B. Manousopoulou A. Margolis D.M. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Garbis S.D. Woelk C.H. Beliakova-Bethell N. Mixed effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on the host transcriptome and proteome and their implications for HIV reactivation from latency.Antiviral Res. 2015; 123 (26343910): 78-8510.1016/j.antiviral.2015.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we took advantage of the sensitivity of RNA-Seq technology to detect a greater number of genes not identified previously (Table S1 shows all genes that were detected in this study, with -fold changes and p values). To provide a comparison, this study found 11,596 genes significantly modulated by SAHA (FDR < 0.05) in mock-infected cells of 16,059 total genes detected, whereas the microarray study identified 2,982 genes (20White C.H. Johnston H.E. Moesker B. Manousopoulou A. Margolis D.M. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Garbis S.D. Woelk C.H. Beliakova-Bethell N.

Because many more genes were identified, for the purpose of the subsequent analyses, we have filtered genes based on both significance (FDR < 0.05) and absolute -fold change (>1.5). Under these filtering criteria, in mock-infected cells, 3,440 genes (34.5%) were up-regulated and 2,550 genes (25.6%) were down-regulated in common by both HDACis. In the model of latency, 3,089 genes (31.1%) were up-regulated and 2,506 genes (25.3%) were down-regulated in common by both HDACis. Of the genes modulated in common, the magnitude of response was generally greater in cells treated with RMD than with SAHA (72.3–82.5% of genes had greater responses to RMD, up or down, both in mock-infected cells and in the model of HIV latency). RMD also induced expression changes in a larger number of additional unique genes than did SAHA. For example, with cells from the latency model, RMD up-regulated (FDR < 0.05, -fold change > 1.5) 1,975 genes (19.9%) that did not respond to SAHA, whereas only 405 genes (4.1%) were up-regulated by SAHA and not RMD (Fig. 3). These relationships between treatment responses were similar for the down-regulated genes in cells of the latency model and for all genes modulated in mock-infected cells (Fig. 3). A small fraction of genes appeared to be modulated in opposite directions by SAHA and RMD; 54 genes (0.5%) were up-regulated by RMD and down-regulated by SAHA, and 5 genes (0.1%) were up-regulated by SAHA and down-regulated by RMD. However, these few genes had low -fold changes in general among both mock-infected and latency model compa"
https://openalex.org/W2913732268,"Introduction Cervical cancer prevention is possible through use of the HPV vaccine and Pap tests, yet the vaccine remains underutilized. Methods We obtained publicly-available Twitter data from 2014 using three sampling strategies (top-ranked, simple random sample, and topic model) based on key words related to cervical cancer prevention. We conducted a content analysis of 100 tweets from each of the three samples and examined the extent to which the narratives and frequency of themes differed across samples. Results Advocacy-related tweets constituted the most prevalent theme to emerge across all three sample types, and were most frequently found in the top-ranked sample. A random sample detected the same themes as topic modeling, but the relative frequency of themes identified from topic modeling fell in-between top-ranked and random samples. Discussion Variations in themes uncovered by different sampling methods suggest it is useful to qualitatively assess the relative frequency of themes to better understand the breadth and depth of social media conversations about health. Conclusions Future studies using social media data should consider sampling methods to uncover a wider breadth of conversations about health on social media."
https://openalex.org/W2911940611,"Extensive studies on metastasis-associated proteins, S100A4 and MTA1, have been carried out for over two decades, but correlation of both proteins remains obscure. Here we show evidence for the correlation in angiogenesis. First, silencing of each protein by siRNA-mediated knockdown in mouse endothelial MSS31 cells resulted in the inhibition of tube formation. Unexpectedly, the knockdown of MTA1 affected not only its own expression but also the expression of S100A4, whereas silencing of S100A4 did not affect the MTA1 expression. Additionally, non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) phosphorylation, which was partly controlled by S100A4, was found to be upregulated by knockdown of both proteins in MSS31 cells. Moreover, cycloheximide treatment of MSS31 cells revealed that the rate of S100A4 degradation was accelerated by MTA1 knockdown. This finding, together with our observation that cytoplasmic MTA1, but not nuclear MTA1, was colocalized with S100A4, suggested the involvement of MTA1 in S100A4 stability. The direct in vivo angiogenesis assay showed that both protein siRNAs provoked a significant inhibition of new blood vessel formation induced by angiogenic factors, indicating their anti-angiogenic activities. Treatment of human pancreatic tumor (PANC-1) xenograft in mice with mMTA1 siRNA resulted in tumor regression via suppression of angiogenesis in vivo, as also observed in the case of human prostate cancer xenograft treated with mS100A4 siRNA. Taken together, these data led us to conclude that the MTA1–S100A4–NMIIA axis exists in endothelial cells as a novel pathway in promoting tumor vascular formation and could be a target for suppressing tumor growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2912446836,"Background Non-invasive methods are the first choice for liver fibrosis evaluation in chronic liver diseases, but few studies investigate the ability of combined methods to predict outcomes. Methods 591 chronic hepatitis C patients with baseline liver stiffness (LSM) by FibroScan and hyaluronic acid measurements were identified retrospectively. The patients were grouped by baseline LSM: < 10kPa, 10–16.9kPa, and 17-75kPa. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and liver-related mortality, analyzed using cox regression and competing risk regression models, respectively. Results Median follow-up was 46.1 months. Prevalence of cirrhosis at baseline was 107/591 (18.1%). Median LSM was 6.8kPa (IQR 5.3–11.6) and divided into groups, 404/591 (68.4%) had a LSM < 10kPa, 100/591 (16.9%) had a LSM between 10–16.9kPa and 87/591 (14.7%) had a LSM between 17-75kPa. There were 69 deaths, 27 from liver-related disease. 26 patients developed cirrhosis and 30 developed complications of cirrhosis. The mortality rate in the 17-75kPa group was 9.7/100 person-years, compared to 2.2/100 person-years and 1.1/100 person-years in the 10–16.9kPa and <10kPa groups (p<0.005). Liver-related mortality increased 10-fold for each group (p<0.005). Cirrhotic complications occurred almost exclusively in the 17-75kPa group, with an incidence of 10.3/100 person-years, compared to 1.8/100 person-years and 0.2/100 person-years in the 10–16.9kPa and <10kPa groups (p<0.005). Median hyaluronic acid in the 17-75kPa group was approximately 200ng/mL. Patients with a LSM 17-75kPa had significantly higher risks of death, liver-related death, and complications to cirrhosis if their hyaluronic acid measurement was more than or equal to 200ng/mL at baseline, with hazard ratios of 3.25 (95% CI 1.48–7.25), 7.7 (95% CI 2.32–28), and 3.2 (95% CI 1.35–7.39), respectively. Conclusions The combination of LSM and circulating hyaluronic acid measurements significantly improved prognostic ability, relative to LSM alone. Combined static and dynamic markers of liver fibrosis could provide superior risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2914485887,"Background Anemia and transfusion of blood in the peri-operative period have been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality across a wide variety of non-cardiac surgeries. While tests of coagulation, including the platelet count, have frequently been used to identify patients with an increased risk of peri-operative bleeding, results have been equivocal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of platelet level on outcomes in patients undergoing elective surgery. Materials and methods Retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively-collected clinical data from American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) between 2006–2016. Results We identified 3,884,400 adult patients who underwent elective, non-cardiac surgery from 2006–2016 at hospitals participating in NSQIP, a prospectively-collected, national clinical database with established reproducibility and validity. After controlling for all peri- and intraoperative factors by matching on propensity scores, patients with all levels of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis had higher odds for perioperative transfusion. All levels of thrombocytopenia were associated with higher mortality, but there was no association with complications or other morbidity after matching. On the other hand, thrombocytosis was not associated with mortality; but odds for postoperative complications and 30-day return to the operating room remained slightly increased after matching. Conclusions These findings may guide surgeons in the appropriate use and appreciation of the utility of pre-operative screening of the platelet count prior to an elective, non-cardiac surgery."

https://openalex.org/W2911944101,"In plants, several developmental processes are co-coordinated by cytokinins via phosphorylation dependent processes of the Two-Component System (TCS). An outstanding challenge is to track phosphorelay flow from cytokinin perception to its molecular outputs, of which gene activation plays a major role. To address this issue, a kinetic-based reporter system was expounded to track TCS phosphorelay activity in vivo that can distinguish between basal and cytokinin dependent effects of overexpressed TCS members. The TCS phosphorelay can be positively activated by cytokinin and inhibited by pharmaceuticals or naturally interfering components. In this case we took advantage of the phosphohistidine-phosphatase Arabidopsis Response Regulator (ARR) 22 and investigated its phosphocompetition with other TCS members in regulating promoters of ARR5 and WUS in Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture protoplasts. In congruency with the proposed function of ARR22, overexpression of ARR22 blocked the activation of all B-type ARRs in this study in a TCS dependent manner. Furthermore, this effect could not be mimicked by A-type response regulator overexpression or compensated by AHP overexpression. Compared to other reporter assays, ours mimicked effects previously observed only in transgenic plants for all of the TCS proteins studied, suggesting that it is possible to expose phosphocompetition. Thus, our approach can be used to investigate gene signaling networks involving the TCS by leveraging ARR22 as a TCS inhibitor along with B-type ARR overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2912837833,"The gut-brain peptide neuromedin U (NMU) decreases food intake and body weight and improves glucose tolerance. Here, we characterized NMU as an enteropeptide and determined how it impacts glucose excursion. NMU was expressed predominantly in the proximal small intestine, and its secretion was triggered by ingestion of a mixed meal. Although a single peripheral injection of NMU in C57BL/6NRj mice prevented the rise of glycemia upon an oral but not an intraperitoneal load of glucose, it unexpectedly prevented insulin secretion, only slightly improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, and barely reduced intestinal glucose absorption. Interestingly, peripheral administration of NMU abrogated gastric emptying. NMU receptors 1 and 2 were detected in pyloric muscles and NMU was able to directly induce pyloric contraction in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo in isometric chambers. Using a modified glucose tolerance test, we demonstrate that improvement of oral glucose tolerance by NMU was essentially, if not exclusively, because of its impact on gastric emptying. Part of this effect was abolished in vagotomized (VagoX) mice, suggesting implication of the vagus tone. Accordingly, peripheral injection of NMU was associated with increased number of c-FOS–positive neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract, which was partly prevented in VagoX mice. Finally, NMU kept its ability to improve oral glucose tolerance in obese and diabetic murine models. Together, these data demonstrate that NMU is an enteropeptide that prevents gastric emptying directly by triggering pylorus contraction and indirectly through vagal afferent neurons. This blockade consequently reduces intestinal nutrient absorption and thereby results in an apparent improved tolerance to oral glucose challenge.—Jarry, A.-C., Merah, N., Cisse, F., Cayetanot, F., Fiamma, M.-N., Willemetz, A., Gueddouri, D., Barka, B., Valet, P., Guilmeau, S., Bado, A., Le Beyec, J., Bodineau, L., Le Gall, M.

https://openalex.org/W2911290208,"Background Maternal undernutrition is a leading cause of maternal mortality. Furthermore, health statuses and habits of mothers influence health statuses of newborns as well as healthy habits and mortality of children. The Senegal government is aware of the severity of these issues and has devised a national policy goal of reducing maternal, infant, and adolescent mortality rates by the end of 2018. This study aimed to identify nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and practices of lactating women in Senegal, and determine factors related to nutritional practices to obtain basic data for developing a maternal and child nutrition project. Method This study used a mixed–method approach, collecting data via structured questionnaires administered to lactating women in Senegal and semistructured interviews with seven stake–holders. Questions for stuctured questionnaires were about nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and practices. For the quantitative analysis of the structured questionnaires, data from 171 participants analyzed using independent t-tests, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis. Interview data were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. The questions for the interviews concerned maternal and child nutritional status, causes of undernutrition, and restrictions. Results Factors significantly related to healthy nutritional practices(explaining 27.1% of variance) included having a household (B = 1.03, p = .015) and a mother (B = 0.96, p = .017) with an above primary school education, and being in the 5th quintile of income level (B = 1.24, p = .014). The interviews with seven stakeholders revealed obstructive factors of nutritional management were insufficient nutritional programs within health centers, incomplete national policy on nutrition, lack of general interest in undernutrition-related topics, inadequate economic environment, and the absence of partnerships to produce sustainable solutions. Conclusion Education and income levels, rather than knowledge and attitudes, had a strong relationship with healthy nutritional practices. Therefore, economic factors and educational background must be considered to succeed in Senegalese nutrition projects."

Because both toxicity and prion-like spread of pathogenic tau depend in part on aggregate size, the processes that underlie filament formation and size distribution are of special importance. Here, using a combination of biophysical and computational approaches, we investigated the fibrillation dynamics of the human tau isoform 2N4R. We found that tau filaments engage in a previously uncharacterized secondary process involving end-to-end annealing and that rationalization of empirical aggregation data composed of total protomer concentrations and fibril length distributions requires inclusion of this process along with filament fragmentation. We noted that annealing of 2N4R tau filaments is robust, with an intrinsic association rate constant of a magnitude similar to that mediating monomer addition and consistent with diffusion-mediated protein–protein interactions in the absence of long-range attractive forces. In contrast, secondary nucleation on the surface of tau filaments did not detectably contribute to tau aggregation dynamics. These results indicate that tau filament ends engage in a range of homotypic interactions involving monomers, oligomers, and filaments. They further indicate that, in the case of tau protein, fibril annealing and fragmentation along with primary nucleation and elongation are the major processes controlling filament size distribution.

Secondary nucleation has been predicted to be especially important for creating small, highly diffusible aggregates associated with toxicity (18Tornquist M. Michaels T.C.T. Sanagavarapu K. Yang X.

Together with filament fragmentation, this secondary process may seed aggregation and foster spread of misfolding through the nervous system (19Tanaka M. Collins S.R. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S.

However, in the case of tau protein aggregates, intracellular filaments within the neurofibrillary lesions of Alzheimer’s disease can exceed micrometers in length (21Gray E.G. Paula-Barbosa M.

Moreover, synthetic tau aggregates prepared in vitro also achieve stable length distributions extending to long lengths even under aggregation conditions that are claimed to be isodesmic (9Ramachandran G.

The length distributions observed in situ and in vitro suggest the existence of a distinct, previously uncharacterized secondary process that opposes filament fragmentation by promoting increases in average filament length. A candidate for this interaction is end-to-end annealing, which has been observed in linear assemblies of cytoskeletal protein, including tubulin (23Rothwell S.W. Grasser W.A. Murphy D.B.

In the case of actin, end-to-end annealing is highly favorable and strongly dependent on length (i.e. annealing efficiency decreases as filaments lengthen (28Murphy D.B. Gray R.O. Grasser W.A.

In fact, it is not possible to rationalize F-actin filament length distribution without incorporating both annealing and fragmentation terms into its nucleation-dependent assembly mechanism (25Sept D. Xu J. Pollard T.D. McCammon J.A. Annealing accounts for the length of actin filaments formed by spontaneous polymerization.Biophys.

In the case of vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, modeling studies have shown that end-to-end annealing is obligatory for rationalizing the appearance of long filaments (26Kirmse R.

Because β-sheet edges are especially interaction-prone (29Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Natural β-sheet proteins use negative design to avoid edge-to-edge aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99 (11880627): 2754-275910.1073/pnas.052706099Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), the ends of filamentous cross-β-sheet tau aggregates may be subject to annealing interactions as well. Here, we test this hypothesis with special emphasis on secondary processes that influence tau aggregate size distribution. The results indicate that tau filament ends can anneal and that their propensity to engage in such homotypic interactions is length-dependent. We propose that interactions at tau filament ends are candidate mediators of size-dependent phenomena reported in biological models. To enable selective detection of tau filament populations, two recombinant human 2N4R tau constructs containing N-terminal V5 or FLAG epitopes were engineered. Full-length 2N4R was used as the tau isoform for both constructs because it aggregates efficiently at near physiological conditions of ionic strength, pH, and sulfhydryl reducing conditions (30Zhong Q. Congdon E.E. Nagaraja H.N. Kuret J. Tau isoform composition influences rate and extent of filament formation.J. Biol.

On the basis of immunoblot analysis, tagged proteins strongly and selectively bound their cognate anti-V5 and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2). To test their aggregation propensity, these proteins along with full-length N-terminally His6-tagged (6His-2N4R) and nontagged 2N4R tau were incubated in the presence of Geranine G after which time the products were subjected to transmission EM (TEM) 2The abbreviations used are: TEMtransmission electron microscopySsecondary nucleationFfilament fragmentationAend-to-end annealingNEnucleation–elongationGSAglobal sensitivity analysis. imaging. Geranine G was used as the anionic aggregation inducer because of its ability to drive aggregation of submicromolar full-length 2N4R tau into filaments having mass-per-unit length similar to authentic brain-derived filaments under near-physiological buffer conditions and submicromolar tau concentrations (8Congdon E.E.

The resulting TEM micrographs showed that the presence of an N-terminal tag did not affect aggregation propensity or ∼80-nm filament axial periodicity relative to nontagged 2N4R tau, regardless of whether the tag was composed of His6, V5, or FLAG (Fig. 2). In contrast, only filaments prepared from V5- or FLAG-tagged 2N4R monomers bound cognate anti-V5 and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3). Extensive decoration of filaments with these antibodies obscured filament morphology but preserved observation of length and, in conjunction with 12- or 5-nm gold–conjugated secondary antibodies, provided clear evidence for the presence of V5- or FLAG-tagged 2N4R tau protomers, respectively (Fig. 3).Figure 3Control labelings with immunogold. Recombinant 2N4R tau and N-terminal fusion constructs 6His-2N4R, V5–2N4R, and FLAG-2N4R were induced to aggregate in the presence of Geranine G inducer for 24 h at 37 °C. Samples were then adsorbed onto carbon-coated TEM grids and subjected to immunogold labeling using anti-V5 primary/12-nm gold–conjugated secondary antibodies (A–D) and anti-FLAG primary/5-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies (E–H).

Immediately after mixing, most fibrils were labeled exclusively with 5- or 12-nm gold beads, reflecting the presence of aggregates composed entirely of one construct or the other in the mixture (Fig. 4, A and B). However, after 24-h incubation, double labeling with anti-V5/12-nm gold and anti-FLAG/5-nm gold revealed the presence of fibrils with extended alternate segments of 12- or 5-nm gold, consistent with end-to-end annealing of the two populations (Fig. 4, C–F). In contrast, filaments prepared from equal concentrations of V5- and FLAG-tagged 2N4R monomers stained uniformly with anti-V5/12-nm gold and anti-FLAG/5-nm gold with no sign of alternating segments of 12- or 5-nm gold after 48-h incubation (Fig. 4G). These data indicate that extended alternate staining segments did not arise from selective propagation of tagged monomers at filament ends. The annealing experiment was then repeated using filaments prepared from recombinant 2N4R tau covalently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3, or Cy5 as substrate; octadecyl sulfate as an alternative to Geranine G aggregation inducer (32Chirita C.N. Kuret J. Evidence for an intermediate in tau filament formation.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (14769048): 1704-171410.1021/bi036034bCrossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); and fluorescence microscopy as detection method. When filaments composed of each labeled tau were mixed and incubated for 24 h, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy recorded the presence of fibrils with extended segments of Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3, or Cy5 fluorescence, again consistent with end-to-end annealing among the three filament populations (Fig. 4, H–K). Together, these imaging experiments provide direct evidence for tau filament annealing. Because annealing rate depends on the concentration of filament ends (33Hill T.L. Length dependence of rate constants for end-to-end association and dissociation of equilibrium linear aggregates.Biophys. J. 1983; 44 (6652219): 285-28810.1016/S0006-3495(83)84301-XAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), annealing kinetics are sensitive to acute perturbation of plateau filament length distributions (e.g. by shearing). This approach has been used to estimate annealing rates of actin filaments (24Andrianantoandro E. Blanchoin L. Sept D. McCammon J.A. Pollard T.D. Kinetic mechanism of end-to-end annealing of actin filaments.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312 (11575927): 721-73010.1006/jmbi.2001.5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). When tau filaments composed of His6-tau prepared in the presence of Geranine G for 24 h were incubated for an additional 0–24 h, both median and average length remained constant, consistent with the population attaining aggregation plateau (Fig. 5, A–C). However, when this filament population was sheared to transiently increase the concentration of filament ends (by decreasing filament lengths) prior to the 24-h extended incubation (Fig. 5D), a time-dependent increase in both mean and median filament lengths was observed (Fig. 5E, left axis). The His6-tau protein remained intact throughout shearing and extended incubation periods (Fig. 5F), indicating that the increase did not result from generation of amyloidogenic truncation products (34Wang Y. Garg S. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proteolytic processing of tau.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38 (20658984): 955-96110.1042/BST0380955Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Yin H. Kuret J.

Because filament lengths are inversely proportional to filament concentration at aggregation plateau, length data could be converted into reciprocal filament concentration units (Fig. 5E, right axis). On the basis of regression analysis, the correlation between reciprocal filament end concentration and time was positive and linear throughout the time series (Fig. 5E), in conformance with the integrated rate law for a second-order homotypic association. Under these conditions, the slope of the correlation approximates the rate constant for the process (36Ball D.W. Physical Chemistry.2nd Ed. Cengage Learning, Stamford, CT2014: 696-745Google Scholar). Assuming that end-to-end annealing was the principal process responsible for initial velocity yielded preliminary estimates of apparent association rate constant ranging from 103 to 104 m−1 s−1 for this sheared filament population (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate that 2N4R tau annealing rates are robust and measurable. To rigorously quantify the contribution of annealing and other secondary processes to tau aggregation kinetics, 2N4R tau aggregation time series were fit by an equilibrium nucleation–elongation scheme (8Congdon E.E.

The nucleation component of the primary pathway was constrained to a cluster size of 2 on the basis of previous rate measurements (8Congdon E.E. Kim S. Bonchak J. Songrug T. Matzavinos A. Kuret J.

Therefore, the smallest stable filament corresponded to a trimer, which also is reported to be the minimal size for spontaneous propagation among cells in biological models (5Mirbaha H. Holmes B.B.

The elongation phase was assumed to proceed by adding or losing one monomer at a time from filament ends and to be governed by rate constants that were insensitive to filament length (38Hill T.L.

Exposing small-diameter TG neurons to α-MSH concentration-dependently decreased IA. This α-MSH–induced IA decrease was dependent on the melanocortin type 4 receptor (MC4R) and associated with a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of A-type K+ channel inactivation. Chemical inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with wortmannin or of class I PI3Ks with the selective inhibitor CH5132799 prevented the MC4R-mediated IA response. Blocking Gi/o-protein signaling with pertussis toxin or by dialysis of TG neurons with the Gβγ-blocking synthetic peptide QEHA abolished the α-MSH–mediated decrease in IA. Further, α-MSH increased the expression levels of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and pharmacological or genetic inhibition of p38α abrogated the α-MSH–induced IA response. Additionally, α-MSH significantly increased the action potential firing rate of TG neurons and increased the sensitivity of rats to mechanical stimuli applied to the buccal pad area, and both effects were abrogated by IA blockade. Taken together, our findings suggest that α-MSH suppresses IA by activating MC4R, which is coupled sequentially to the Gβγ complex of the Gi/o-protein and downstream class I PI3K-dependent p38α signaling, thereby increasing TG neuronal excitability and mechanical pain sensitivity in rats. α-Melanocyte–stimulating hormone (α-MSH) has been shown to be involved in nociception, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.

We investigated serum levels of soluble (s)Axl in lupus nephritis (LN) in association with renal disease activity, tissue damage and treatment response. We surveyed 52 patients with International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) class III/IV LN and 20 healthy controls. Renal biopsies were performed at the time of active LN and post-treatment. Patients were classified as clinical responders (CRs) or clinical non-responders based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Improvement by ≥50% in renal activity index scores defined histological responders (HRs). sAxl levels were elevated in patients compared to controls (median: 18.9 ng/mL), both at baseline (median: 45.7; P<0.001) and post-treatment (median: 41.2 ng/mL; P<0.001). Baseline sAxl levels were higher in patients with class IV (median: 47.7 ng/mL) versus class III (median: 37.5 ng/mL) nephritis (P = 0.008), and showed moderate correlations with albuminuria (r = 0.30, P = 0.030) and creatinine (r = 0.35, P = 0.010). Baseline sAxl levels decreased in CRs (P = 0.002) and HRs (P<0.001), but not in non-responders; levels ≥36.6 ng/mL yielded a >5 times higher probability of histology-based response (odds ratio, OR: 5.5; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.2-25.1). High post-treatment sAxl levels were associated with worsening in chronicity index scores (P = 0.025); low levels predicted favourable renal outcome (creatinine ≤88.4 μmol/L) 10 years after the baseline renal biopsy (area under the curve: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54-0.89). In conclusion, sAxl may prove useful as a marker of renal activity, histological response to immunosuppression, and renal damage progression in LN. Persistently high sAxl levels after completion of treatment may be indicative of a need for treatment intensification."
https://openalex.org/W2911919588,"Ischemic retinopathies and optic neuropathies are important causes of vision loss. The neuroprotective effect of erythropoietin (EPO) in ischemic neuronal injury and the expression of EPO and its receptor in retinal tissue have been well documented. However, the exact regulatory mechanism of EPO expression in retinal ischemia still remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of cystine/glutamate antiporter (system xc-) in the regulation of astrocytic EPO expression by using both in vitro and in vivo models. Under hypoxia, the expression of astrocytic system xc- is up-regulated both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of system xc- resulted in depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and decrement of GSH disulfide ratios in human brain astrocytes (HBAs). In HBAs, hypoxia-induced stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif)-2α is nearly completely abolished by inhibition of system xc-. Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of astrocytic EPO expression is suppressed by both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of system xc-. In contrast, basal EPO expression under normoxia is not affected by system xc- modulation. In summary, under hypoxia, increased system xc- acts as the major source of intracellular GSH, which helps in stabilizing Hif-2α and subsequent up-regulation of EPO in astrocytes.-Lee, B. J., Jun, H. O., Kim, J. H., Kim, J. H. Astrocytic cystine/glutamate antiporter is a key regulator of erythropoietin expression in the ischemic retina."
https://openalex.org/W2913715157,"The mitral valve morphology in patients with pectus excavatum (PE) has not been fully investigated. Thirty-five patients with PE, 46 normal controls, and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who underwent 2 leaflet length measurements of Carpentier classification P2 and A2 using a transthoracic echocardiography were retrospectively investigated. The coaptation lengths and depths, papillary muscle tethering length, and mitral annular diameters were also measured. The P2 and A2 lengths were separately compared between 2 groups: older than 16 years and 16 years or younger. Furthermore, the correlations between actual P2 or A2 lengths and Haller computed tomography index, an index of chest deformity, were investigated in patients with PE exclusively. Among subjects older than 16 years, patients with PE had significantly shorter P2, longer A2, shorter copatation depth, and longer papillary muscle tethering length compared with normal controls. Similarly, patients with PE had significantly shorter P2 and shorter coaptation depth even compared with patients with HCM, while no significant difference was found in A2 length and papillary muscle tethering length. The same tendency was noted between 4 normal controls and 7 age- and sex-matched patients with PE ≤ 16 years old. No significant difference regarding A2/P2 ratio was found between patients with PE older and younger than 16 years. No significant correlation between the Haller computed tomography index and actual mitral leaflet lengths in patients with PE older than 16 years was noted; the same was observed for A2/P2 in all patients with PE. In conclusion, the characteristic features of the shorter posterior mitral leaflet, the longer anterior mitral leaflet, the shorter coaptation depth, and the longer papillary muscle tethering length in patients with PE was demonstrated. This finding might provide a clue regarding the etiology of mitral valve prolapse in PE at its possible earliest form."

The effectiveness of IPT depends on 80% or greater adherence to medication. In the current study, we assessed IPT adherence and explored barriers to and facilitators of adherence among eligible child contacts in Kigali, Rwanda.A mixed method study design was used to prospectively assess adherence to IPT among eligible child contacts and its associated factors through a quantitative, observational cohort study, and to explore barriers to and facilitators of adherence to IPT through a descriptive qualitative study.Of the 84 child contacts who started IPT, 74 (88%) had complete adherence and ten (12%) had incomplete adherence. There were no factors (individual characteristics of index cases, households and or health facility characteristics) found to be significantly associated with IPT adherence in the bivariate and multivariate analysis. In the qualitative analysis, we identified factors relating to parents/caregivers, disease, household and health-care providers as major themes determining IPT adherence.There was a high rate of IPT completion in this cohort of eligible child contacts living in Kigali. However, structural factors (poverty and relocation) were found to be the main barriers to IPT adherence that could be addressed by health-care providers."

Identification of vaccine antigens (Ags) by considering Mtb genetic diversity is crucial for the development of improved TB vaccine. MTBK_20640, a new Beijing genotype-specific proline-glutamic acid-family Ag, was identified by comparative genomic analysis. Its immunologic features were characterized by evaluating interactions with dendritic cells (DCs), and immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy were determined against highly virulent Mtb Beijing outbreak Korean Beijing (K) strain and HN878 strain in murine infection model. MTBK_20640 induced DCs via TLR2 and downstream MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, effectively promoting naive CD4-positive (CD4+) T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. Different IFN-γ response was observed in mice infected with Mtb K or reference H37Rv strain. Significant induction of T helper type 1 cell-polarized Ag-specific multifunctional CD4+ T cells and a marked Ag-specific IgG2c response were observed in mice immunized with MTBK_20640/glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion. The immunization conferred long-term protection against 2 Mtb Beijing outbreak strains, as evidenced by a significant reduction in colony-forming units in the lung and spleen and reduced lung inflammation. MTBK_20640 vaccination conferred long-term protection against highly virulent Mtb Beijing strains. MTBK_20640 may be developed into a novel Ag component in multisubunit TB vaccines in the future.-Kwon, K. W., Choi, H.-H., Han, S. J., Kim, J.-S., Kim, W. S., Kim, H., Kim, L.-H., Kang, S.

During 2016, Zika spread as an outbreak to a large part of the country's coastal zones. Methodology The Zika epidemiological surveillance system records cases with clinical symptoms of Zika virus disease (ZVD) and those confirmed by means of a reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. This report includes the suspected and confirmed cases from 2016. Incidence rates were estimated by region and in pregnant women based on the proportion of confirmed cases. Results In total, 43,725 suspected cases of ZVD were reported. The overall incidence of suspected cases of ZVD was 82.0 per 100,000 individuals and 25.3 per 100,000 Zika cases. There were 4,168 pregnant women with suspected symptoms of ZVD, of which infection was confirmed in 1,082 (26%). The estimated incidence rate of ZVD for pregnant women nationwide was 186.1 positive Zika cases per 100,000 pregnant women. Conclusions The incidence of Zika in Mexico is higher than that reported previously in the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance. Positive cases of Zika must be estimated and reported."
https://openalex.org/W2912348164,"The present study aimed to estimate the effect of endurance training, two doses of testosterone, and the combination of these stimuli on the level of the endothelial proteins claudin, occludin, JAM-1, VE-cadherin, ZO-1, ZO-2, and P-glycoprotein in rat spinal cords. Adult male Wistar rats were trained using a motor-driven treadmill for 6 weeks (40–60 min, 5 times per week) and/or were treated for 6 weeks with two doses of testosterone (i.m.; 8 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg body weight). Spinal cords were collected 48 hours after the last training cycle and stored at -80°C. The levels of selected proteins in whole tissue lysates of the spinal cord were measured by western blot. Testosterone-treated trained rats had significantly lower claudin levels than vehicle-treated trained rats. High doses of testosterone resulted in a significant decrease in claudin-5 in untrained rats compared to the control group. Both doses of testosterone significantly reduced occludin levels compared to those in vehicle-treated untrained rats. The JAM-1 level in the spinal cords of both trained and untrained animals receiving testosterone was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The JAM-1 level in the trained group treated with high doses of testosterone was significantly higher than that in the untrained rats treated with 80 mg/kg of testosterone. VE-cadherin levels were decreased in all groups receiving testosterone regardless of endurance training and were also diminished in the vehicle-treated group compared to the control group. Testosterone treatment did not exert a significant effect on ZO-1 protein levels. Testosterone and/or training had no significant effects on ZO-2 protein levels in the rat spinal cords. Endurance training increased P-glycoprotein levels in the rat spinal cords. The results suggest that an excessive supply of testosterone may adversely impact the expression of endothelial proteins in the central nervous system, which, in turn, may affect the blood-brain barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2914908925,"Urban public spaces facilitate social interactions between people, reflecting the shifting functionality of spaces. There is no commonly-held consensus on the quantification methods for the dynamic interplay between spatial geometry, urban movement, and face-to-face encounters. Using anonymized social media check-in records from Shanghai, China, this study proposes pipelines for quantifying physical face-to-face encounter potential patterns through public space networks between local and non-local residents sensed by social media over time from space to space, in which social difference, cognitive cost, and time remoteness are integrated as the physical co-presence intensity index. This illustrates the spatiotemporally different ways in which the built environment binds various groups of space users configurationally via urban streets. The variation in face-to-face interaction patterns captures the fine-resolution patterns of urban flows and a new definition of street hierarchy, illustrating how urban public space systems deliver physical meeting opportunities and shape the spatial rhythms of human behavior from the public to the private. The shifting encounter potentials through streets are recognized as reflections of urban centrality structures with social interactions that are spatiotemporally varying, projected in the configurations of urban forms and functions. The results indicate that the occurrence probability of face-to-face encounters is more geometrically scaled than predicted based on the co-location probability of two people using metric distance alone. By adding temporal and social dimensions to urban morphology studies, and the field of space syntax research in particular, we suggest a new approach of analyzing the temporal urban centrality structures of the physical interaction potentials based on trajectory data, which is sensitive to the transformation of the spatial grid. It sheds light on how to adopt urban design as a social instrument to facilitate the dynamically changing social interaction potential in the new data environment, thereby enhancing spatial functionality and the social well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2911315797,"Crizotinib (CZT) is a potent drug used for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, its circulating concentration variability has been associated with acquired resistance and toxicity, restricting the success of cancer treatment. As such, the development of an assay that monitors CZT plasma concentrations in patients is a valuable tool in cancer treatment. In this study, a hapten of CZT was synthesized by introducing the acetohydrazide moiety as a spacer into the chemical structure of CZT. The chemical structure of the CZT acetohydrazide (hapten) was confirmed by mass, 1H-, and 13C-NMR spectrometric techniques. The hapten was coupled to each of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) proteins by ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide as a coupling reagent. CZT-KLH conjugate was used for immunization and generation of a polyclonal antibody recognizing CZT with high affinity (IC50 = 0.5 ng/mL). The polyclonal antibody was used in the development of an ELISA for determination of CZT. The ELISA involved a competitive binding reaction between CZT, in its samples, and immobilized CZT-BSA conjugate for the binding sites on a limited amount of the anti-CZT antibody. The assay limit of detection was 0.03 ng/mL and the working range was 0.05 - 24 ng/mL. Analytical recovery of CZT from spiked plasma was 101.98 ± 2.99%. The precisions of the assay were satisfactory; RSD was 3.2 - 6.5% and 4.8 - 8.2%, for the intra- and inter-assay precision, respectively. The assay is superior to all the existing chromatographic methods for CZT in terms of its procedure simplicity, convenience, and does not require treatment of plasma samples prior to the analysis. The proposed ELISA is anticipated to effectively contribute to the therapeutic monitoring of CZT in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2911725969,"Purkinje cells (PCs) are more resistant to ischemia than myocardial cells, and are suspected to participate in ventricular arrhythmias following myocardial infarction (MI). Histological studies afford little evidence on the behavior and adaptation of PCs in the different stages of MI, especially in the chronic stage, and no quantitative data have been reported to date beyond subjective qualitative depictions. The present study uses a porcine model to present the first quantitative analysis of the distal cardiac conduction system and the first reported change in the spatial distribution of PCs in three representative stages of MI: an acute model both with and without reperfusion; a subacute model one week after reperfusion; and a chronic model one month after reperfusion. Purkinje cells are able to survive after 90 minutes of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion to a greater extent than cardiomyocytes. A decrease is observed in the number of PCs, which suffer reversible subcellular alterations such as cytoplasm vacuolization, together with redistribution from the mesocardium—the main localization of PCs in the heart of ungulate species—towards the endocardium and perivascular epicardial areas. However, these changes mainly occur during the first week after ischemia and reperfusion, and are maintained in the chronic stages. This anatomical substrate can explain the effectiveness of endo-epicardial catheter ablation of monomorphic ventricular tachycardias in the chronic scar after infarction, and sets a basis for further electrophysiological and molecular studies, and future therapeutic strategies."

Using online automated eye-tracking technology to reduce response demands during a word comprehension test may be advantageous in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).To measure online accuracy of word recognition across eleven semantic categories in preschool children with ASD and in typically developing (TD) children matched for gender and developmental age.Using eye-tracker methodology we measured the relative number of fixations on a target image as compared to a foil of the same category shown simultaneously on screen. This online accuracy measure was considered a measure of word understanding. We tested the relationship between online accuracy and offline word recognition and the effects of clinical variables on online accuracy. Twenty-four children with ASD and 21 TD control children underwent the eye-tracking task.On average, children with ASD were significantly less accurate at fixating on the target image than the TD children. After multiple comparison correction, no significant differences were found across the eleven semantic categories of the experiment between preschool children with ASD and younger TD children matched for developmental age. The ASD group showed higher intragroup variability consistent with greater variation in vocabulary growth rates. Direct effects of non-verbal cognitive levels, vocabulary levels and gesture productions on online word recognition in both groups support a dimensional view of language abilities in ASD.Online measures of word comprehension across different semantic categories show higher interindividual variability in children with ASD and may be useful for objectively monitor gains on targeted language interventions."

We recently reported that intraperitoneal injection of α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) can stimulate the lung invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and does not lead to airway inflammation in WT mice. Other studies indicate that iNKT cells play an important role in inducing regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and peripheral tolerance. Using iNKT cell– knockout mice, functional inactivation of Treg cells, and co-culture experiments in murine asthma models, we investigated the immunoregulatory effects of α-GalCer treatment before allergen sensitization on Th2 cell responses. We also studied whether α-GalCer’s effects require lung Treg cells induced by activated iNKT cells. Our results disclosed that intraperitoneal administration of α-GalCer before allergen sensitization could promote the expansion and suppressive activity of lung CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells. These effects were accompanied by down-regulated Th2 cell responses and decreased immunogenic maturation of lung dendritic cells in WT mice. However, these changes were absent in CD1d−/− mice immunized and challenged with ovalbumin or house dust mites, indicating that the effects of α-GalCer on Treg cells mainly require iNKT cells. Moreover, functional inactivation of Treg cells could reverse the inhibitory ability of this α-GalCer therapy on Th2 cell responses in a murine asthma model.

https://openalex.org/W2912775010,"Background Studies in the non-emergency department (ED) settings have reported the relationships of post-intubation hypertension with poor patient outcomes. While ED-based studies have examined post-intubation hypotension and its sequelae, little is known about, post-intubation hypertension and its risk factors in the ED settings. In this context, we aimed to identify the incidence of post-intubation hypertension in the ED, and to test the hypothesis that repeated intubation attempts are associated with an increased risk of post-intubation hypertension. Methods This study is a secondary analysis of the data from a multicenter prospective observational study of emergency intubations in 15 EDs from 2012 through 2016. The analytic cohort comprised all adult non-cardiac-arrest patients undergoing orotracheal intubation without pre-intubation hypotension. The primary exposure was the repeated intubation attempts, defined as ≥2 laryngoscopic attempts. The outcome was post-intubation hypertension defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure (sBP) of >20% along with a post-intubation sBP of >160 mmHg. To investigate the association of repeated intubation attempts with the risk of post-intubation hypertension, we fit multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for ten potential confounders and patient clustering within the EDs. Results Of 3,097 patients, the median age was 69 years, 1,977 (64.0%) were men, and 991 (32.0%) underwent repeated intubation attempts. Post-intubation hypertension was observed in 276 (8.9%). In the unadjusted model, the incidence of post-intubation hypertension did not differ between the patients with single intubation attempt and those with repeated attempts (8.5% versus 9.8%, unadjusted P = 0.24). By contrast, after adjusting for potential confounders and patient clustering in the random-effects model, the patients who underwent repeated intubation attempts had a significantly higher risk of post-intubation hypertension (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.11–2.18; adjusted P = 0.01). Conclusions We found that 8.9% of patients developed post-intubation hypertension, and that repeated intubation attempts were significantly associated with a significantly higher risk of post-intubation hypertension in the ED."

We included 142 Uyghur children (108 males) under age 14 years with a diagnosis of urolithiasis and 238 Uyghur children (154 males) under age 14 years without a history of urolithiasis as controls. Baseline information and data for serum and urine parameters were obtained from medical records. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to analyze the VDR FokⅠ polymorphisms. In univariate analyses adjusting for age and sex, carbon dioxide combining power (CO2CP) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.19), serum magnesium (Mg) (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03-1.56) and serum chlorine (Cl) (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.97) were related to Uyghur children urolithiasis risk. A multiple logistic regression model showed CO2CP (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.26), levels of uric acid (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01) and serum sodium (Na) (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99) were associated with pediatric urolithiasis.

However, metabolic levels did not differ by FokⅠ genotypes. In our population, CO2CP and levels of uric acid and serum Na as well as polymorphism of the F allele of the VDR FokⅠ may provide important clues to evaluate the risk of urolithiasis in Uyghur children."

We aim to assess the long-term effectiveness of this school-based youth gambling prevention program in Illinois using the data from 2005 to 2009. The intervention included interactive PowerPoint presentations and prevention materials in parent packets. Students aged 8 to 18 years were eligible to participate in the intervention and the questionnaire pre-post knowledge tests (total score 0-9). Students in 5th grade and above also received a gambling behavior screen test using the Modified South Oaks Gambling Screening for Teens (MSOGST) for identifying probable gamblers. Multivariable generalized mixed models were conducted to detect the effects of a 5-year youth gambling prevention program as controlling potential confounders. A total of 16,262 and 16,421 students completed pre-post tests and MSOGST tests, respectively. Of 16,262, half were female, the majority (76.1%) were from senior high school, and 21.3% received the intervention at least twice. The median gap between interventions was 368 days. Students receiving multiple interventions had higher scores on the pre-test as compared to those receiving a single intervention (P<0.001 for all comparisons among groups), and they demonstrated an increasing trend of awareness about gambling over time (P<0.001 for multiple interventions; P = 0.538 for single intervention). The prevalence of problem gambling had decreased among students receiving the intervention twice as compared to receiving the intervention once (7.9% versus 9.4%; OR = 0.89, 95% CL: 0.82-0.97). However, this effect was not confirmed among students receiving the intervention three or more times. In conclusion, the DGAOF program has demonstrated a positive long-term impact on increasing gambling knowledge and partially reducing pathological gamblers through direct training. It suggests that multiple repeated interventions are important for youth gambling prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2911983536,"Orientation and position of small image segments are considered to be two fundamental low-level attributes in early visual processing, yet their encoding in complex natural stimuli is underexplored. By measuring the just-noticeable differences in noise perturbation, we investigated how orientation and position information of a large number of local elements (Gabors) were encoded separately or jointly. Importantly, the Gabors composed various classes of naturalistic stimuli that were equated by all low-level attributes and differed only in their higher-order configural complexity and familiarity. Although unable to consciously tell apart the type of perturbation, observers detected orientation and position noise significantly differently. Furthermore, when the Gabors were perturbed by both types of noise simultaneously, performance adhered to a reliability-based optimal probabilistic combination of individual attribute noises. Our results suggest that orientation and position are independently coded and probabilistically combined for naturalistic stimuli at the earliest stage of visual processing."
https://openalex.org/W2912632879,"Variovorax paradoxus strain TBEA6 is one of the few organisms known to utilize 3,3'-thiodipropionate (TDP) as the only source of carbon and energy. It cleaves TDP to 3-mercaptopropionate (3MP), which is a direct precursor for polythioester synthesis. To establish this process in V. paradoxus TBEA6, it is crucial to unravel its TDP metabolism. Therefore, a proteomic approach with subsequent deletion of interesting genes in the bacterium was chosen. Cells were cultivated with D-gluconate, TDP or 3-sulfinopropionate as the only carbon sources. Proteins with high abundances in gels of cells cultivated with either of the organic sulfur compounds were analyzed further. Thereby, we did not only confirm parts of the already postulated TDP metabolism, but also eight new protein candidates for TDP degradation were detected. Deletions of the corresponding genes (two enoyl-CoA hydratases (Ech-20 and Ech-30), an FK506-binding protein, a putative acetolactate synthase, a carnitinyl-CoA dehydratase, and a putative crotonase family protein) were obtained. Only the deletions of both Ech-20 and Ech-30 led to a TDP negative phenotype. The deletion mutant of VPARA_05510, which encodes the putative crotonase family protein showed reduced growth with TDP. The three genes are located in one cluster with genes proven to be involved in TDP metabolism. Thermal shift assays showed an increased stability of Ech-20 with TDP-CoA but not with TDP. These results indicate that Ech-20 uses TDP-CoA as a substrate instead of TDP. Hence, we postulate a new putative pathway for TDP metabolism. Ech-30 interacts with neither TDP-CoA nor TDP but might interact with other CoA-activated intermediates of the proposed pathway. Further enzyme characterization is necessary to unravel the complete pathway from TDP to 3MP."
