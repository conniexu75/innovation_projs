https://openalex.org/W2079955619,"IN the past, biological interest in selenium has been centred around its toxic role as the cause of ‘alkali disease’ and ‘blind staggers’1 and as a source of industrial poisoning2. However, recent developments suggest a more important role for this element. Thus, it has been shown that selenium is an essential trace element for the rat3 and is stimulatory, if not essential, for the growth of certain plants4. While inorganic selenium compounds are active in these cases, there is evidence that these inorganic selenium compounds are converted biologically into organic compounds, including the selenium analogues of cysteine5, cystine, methionine6 and cystathionine7. The structure of the essential selenium compound or compounds, therefore, remains to be established."

Since the calorie intake of the two groups was identical and the calorie values of the carcasses of the glucagon-treated rats was much lower than that of the controls, the effect of glucagon on the metabolic rate of rats was investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2024617557,IT is possible to obtain evidence for the synthetic pathway of a monosaccharide by determining its isotopic labelling in a suitable polysaccharide which has been produced from a labelled substrate. Experiments were undertaken to determine the synthetic pathway of fucose using a fucose-containing extracellular bacterial polysaccharide which was produced from labelled glucose and methionine as the sole carbon and energy sources.

https://openalex.org/W1975774247,"REMARKABLE similarities have been found between the biological properties of animal viruses containing ribonucleic acid and those of viruses containing deoxyribonucleic acid (such as bacteriophages). The question has thus been raised whether the mechanism of duplication of the two types of virus may involve common steps1. One possibility is that viruses containing ribonucleic acid have an intracellular deoxyribonucleic acid phase. With this point in mind, extensive cytochemical investigations of the changes occurring in the nucleic acids of cells infected by poliomyelitis virus have been carried out."

https://openalex.org/W2078822027,THE composition of the bile pigment which shows direct van den Bergh reaction has been elucidated in recent studies1–3. This pigment is considered to be essentially a mixture of soluble salts of bilirubinyl-bis(β-D-glucosiduronic) and bilirubmyl-mono(β-D-glucosiduronic) acids. The preparation of the insoluble lead salt of the first of these acids has been reported in previous communications3. This precipitation renders possible a concentration of the pigment from aqueous alcoholic solutions of rough material.

Dealing with young rats, they described an inhibition of growth ; but no organ appeared to be especially affected."

https://openalex.org/W2005573268,PHENOLS counteract the antithrombic activity of plasma and serum1. The antithrombic activity is present in a protein fraction which also contains the co-factor required for the anticoagulant effect of heparin2. The antithrombic and the heparin co-factor activity are present in the α-globulin fraction of human plasma3. It was therefore of interest to test the influence of phenols on heparin activity in plasma.

https://openalex.org/W2074629821,WHETHER the effect on the living skin of a constant dose of ultra-violet radiation is the same if given with high intensity in a short pulse as if given with low intensity over a longer period of time has not apparently been recorded. We have therefore examined the tissue injury caused in mouse skin by ultra-violet light of wave-length about 300 mµ when the intensity of the incident light was varied from 1014 to 1021 hv/cm.2 sec.
