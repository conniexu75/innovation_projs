https://openalex.org/W4225424871,"Background COVID-19 vaccination rates among Black Americans have been lower than White Americans and are disproportionate to their population size and COVID-19 impact. This study examined reasons for low vaccination intentions and preferred strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccination. Methods Between November 2020 and March 2021, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 participants who expressed low vaccination intentions in a RAND American Life Panel survey; we also interviewed five stakeholders who represent organizations or subgroups in Black communities that have been highly affected by COVID-19. Results Many interviewees discussed the “wait-and-see” approach, citing that more time and evidence for vaccine side effects and efficacy are needed. Perceived barriers to COVID-19 vaccination included structural barriers to access (e.g., transportation, technology) and medical mistrust (e.g., towards the vaccines themselves, the government, healthcare providers and healthcare systems, and pharmaceutical companies) stemming from historical and contemporary systematic racism against Black communities. Interviewees also discussed strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccines, including acknowledging systemic racism as the root cause for mistrust, preferred messaging content (e.g., transparent messages about side effects), modes, and access points (e.g., a variety of medical and non-medical sites), and trusted information sources (e.g., trusted leaders, Black doctors and researchers). Conclusions These insights can inform ways to improve initial and booster vaccination uptake as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses."
https://openalex.org/W4229049292,"As a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to being exposed to chronic and multiple sources of psychological stress, healthcare workers constitute a vulnerable population. Despite the potential impact of Covid-19 on their psychological and physical health, insufficient attention has been given to their mental well-being. The primary objective of this study was to measure and understand this psychological impact on public sector doctors and nurses in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The secondary objective was to ascertain their perceptions of psychosocial support, specific to Covid-19, within the workplace. This cross-sectional electronic survey was conducted from August to October 2020, following the first surge of the pandemic in the country, and included 312 participants. Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 item and post-traumatic stress was measured by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised version. Measures of employer support were assessed using an adapted closed-ended questionnaire. The participants’ mean age was 36.6± 9.3 years with three quarters being male (n = 234, 75.0%) and predominantly (n = 214, 72.3%) medical doctors. Numbers of participants with depression, anxiety and stress were 121 (51.5%), 111 (47.2%) and 104 (44.3%) respectively, with 38 (16.2%), 50 (21.3%) and 38 (16.2%) in the combined severe/extremely severe range, respectively. On the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, 34 (13.7%) participants were in the severe range. Subjectively, 63.0% felt that their concerns were not ‘heard’, 75.1% did not feel ‘cared for’ and 81.1% and 74.0% did not feel ‘physically’ or ‘psychologically’ supported, respectively. High levels of depression, anxiety, stress and traumatic stress, combined with poor perceptions of employer support, highlight the need to identify and address the psychosocial support needs and expectations of healthcare workers for the duration of the pandemic, as well as for the mental health sequelae post-pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W4225400716,"Purpose The solid tumor microenvironment (TME) drives T cell dysfunction and inhibits the effectiveness of immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-based T cell (CAR T) cells. Early data has shown that modulation of T cell metabolism can improve intratumoral T cell function in preclinical models. Experimental design We evaluated GPC3 expression in human normal and tumor tissue specimens. We developed and evaluated BOXR1030, a novel CAR T therapeutic co-expressing glypican-3 (GPC3)-targeted CAR and exogenous glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) in terms of CAR T cell function both in vitro and in vivo . Results Cell surface expression of tumor antigen GPC3 was observed by immunohistochemical staining in tumor biopsies from hepatocellular carcinoma, liposarcoma, squamous lung cancer, and Merkel cell carcinoma patients. Compared to control GPC3 CAR alone, BOXR1030 (GPC3-targeted CAR T cell that co-expressed GOT2) demonstrated superior in vivo efficacy in aggressive solid tumor xenograft models, and showed favorable attributes in vitro including an enhanced cytokine production profile, a less-differentiated T cell phenotype with lower expression of stress and exhaustion markers, an enhanced metabolic profile and increased proliferation in TME-like conditions. Conclusions Together, these results demonstrated that co-expression of GOT2 can substantially improve the overall antitumor activity of CAR T cells by inducing broad changes in cellular function and phenotype. These data show that BOXR1030 is an attractive approach to targeting select solid tumors. To this end, BOXR1030 will be explored in the clinic to assess safety, dose-finding, and preliminary efficacy (NCT05120271)."
https://openalex.org/W4229063638,"To understand violence on acute mental health units according to staff and service user perspectives and experiences.The collateral damage of violence in acute inpatient mental health settings is wide-ranging, impacting on the health and wellbeing of staff and service users, and detrimental to public perceptions of people who are mentally unwell. Despite international research on the topic, few studies have examined psychiatric unit violence from both staff and service user perspectives.We conducted in-depth interviews with 85 people (42 staff, 43 service users) in four adult acute mental health inpatient units in New Zealand. We undertook a thematic analysis of perspectives on the contributing factors and consequences of violence on the unit.Both staff and service users indicated violence was a frequent problem in acute inpatient units. Four themes regarding the causes of violence emerged: individual service user factors, the built environment, organisational factors, and the overall social milieu of the unit. Staff often highlighted complexities of the system as causal factors. These included the difficulties of managing diverse service user illnesses within an inadequate and unsafe built environment whilst having to contend with staffing issues and idiosyncrasies relating to rule enforcement. In contrast, service users talked of their needs for care and autonomy not being met in an atmosphere of paternalism, boredom due to restrictions and lack of meaningful activities, enforced medication, and physical confinement as precipitants to violence. Two broader themes also emerged, both relating to empathy. Both staff and service users exhibited 'othering' (characterised by a profound lack of empathy) in relation to acutely unwell individuals. Explanations for violent behaviour on the unit differed between groups, with service users being more likely to attribute unwanted behaviour to contextual factors and staff more likely to 'blame' mental illness. The consequences of violence included stress, physical injury, and a culture of fear and stigma.Violence in acute inpatient mental health units in New Zealand is a significant, complex, and unresolved problem negatively impacting the therapeutic mission of these settings. Further in-depth qualitative investigations are urgently required into what is experienced as violence by service users, their view of how violence occurs, the role of fear and power relations, and the contributions of the built and organisational environment to all forms of violence to all unit users. A core function of the acute mental health unit is to offer a therapeutic environment for individuals at their most vulnerable. For this to happen, the unit must be a rewarding place to work, and a safe place to be."
https://openalex.org/W4225374920,"Dementia is a global public health priority and risk reduction is an important pillar of the public health response. While 40% of cases are estimated to be attributable to modifiable health and lifestyle risk factors, public awareness of the evidence is low, limiting peoples’ opportunity to adopt risk-reducing behaviours. To address this gap, we designed, implemented, and evaluated an educational intervention, the Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course (PDMOOC). This mixed-methods study examined the reach and impact of the free and globally available PDMOOC, to assess its potential to provide effective dementia risk reduction education to a broad international audience. Over 100,000 individuals participated in the PDMOOC across seven iterations from 2016 to 2020, with 55,739 of these consenting to participate in research. Their mean age was 49 years (SD = 15), they came from 167 different countries, and the majority were female (86%), had completed post-secondary education (77%), lived in high-income countries (93%) and worked in health care and social assistance (63%). This demographic profile changed across time, with more men, people with higher education and people from low- and middle-income countries participating in recent course iterations. Two-thirds of participants completed the PDMOOC; completion was associated with being aged 50 to 70 years, residing in a high-income country, having tertiary education, and working in the health sector. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the PDMOOC, improved dementia risk reduction understanding and self-efficacy, increased motivation to maintain healthy lifestyles, and, importantly, application of their learning to health behaviour change with the potential to reduce their dementia risk. The PDMOOC educated a large global audience about dementia risk reduction, which contributed to participants making risk-reducing behaviour changes. This suggests MOOCs can be a successful public health strategy to improve dementia risk reduction understanding."
https://openalex.org/W4225413470,"Studies investigating the association between vitamin D and severity of COVID-19 have mixed results perhaps due to immunoassay assessment of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (tD) (the sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D2 [25-OH-D2] and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 [25-OH-D3]). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has high analytical specificity and sensitivity for 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3, and thus enables a more accurate assessment of impact on COVID-19 outcomes.We established reference intervals for 25-OH-D3 and tD using LC-MS/MS. 25-OH-D2, 25-OH-D3 and tD were quantitated for 88 COVID-19 positive and 122 COVID-19 negative specimens. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to test associations in binary variables. T-Tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards were used to test associations between 25-OH-D3 or tD levels and length of stay (LOS). For mortality and ventilation, logistic regression models were used.COVID-19 patients with deficient (<20 ng/mL) levels of 25-OH-D3 had significantly longer LOS by 15.3 days. COVID-19 P patients with deficient (<20 ng/mL) and insufficient (<30 ng/mL) of tD had significantly longer LOS by 12.1 and 8.2 days, respectively. Patients with insufficient levels of tD had significantly longer LOS by 13.7 days. COVID-19 patients with deficient serum 25-OH-D3 levels had significantly increased risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality (OR [95% CI]: 5.29 [1.53-18.24]); those with insufficient 25-OH-D3 had significantly increased risk for requiring ventilation during hospitalization was found at LCMS insufficient cutoff (OR [95% CI]: 2.75 [1.10-6.90]).There is an inverse relationship of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and hospital LOS for COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D status is a predictor for severity of outcomes. LCMS results are useful for assessing the odds of mortality and the need for ventilation during hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W4225373052,"The current UK physical activity guidelines recommend that adults aged 19 to 65 years perform activity to strengthen muscle and bone a minimum of twice weekly. The number of adults meeting strengthening activity guidelines is lower than for aerobic activity, but estimates vary between studies partly due to differences in how muscle-strengthening activity is defined. We aimed to provide estimates for strengthening activity prevalence in English adults based on a nationally representative sample of n = 253,423 18-65-year-olds. We attempted to quantify the variation in estimates attributable to differences in the way strengthening activity is defined. Finally, we aim to provide a brief descriptive epidemiology of the factors associated with strengthening activity. Adults met guidelines for aerobic activity if they reported the activity equivalent to &gt;150 min/week moderate-intensity exercise. Respondents met strengthening guidelines if they reported at least two bouts per week of strengthening activity. We defined strengthening activity, first, according to criteria used in the Health Survey for England (HSE). Second, we counted bouts of strengthening activities for which we could find evidence of health-related benefits (Evidence). Third, we included bouts of strengthening activity as defined in current UK physical activity guidelines (Guideline). Two-thirds (67%) of adults met guidelines for aerobic activity (69% of men, 65% of women). Less than one-third (29% of men and 24% of women) met guidelines for the HSE definition of strengthening activity. Under the Evidence definition, 16% of men and 9% of women met strengthening guidelines. Using the most-stringent definition (Guideline) just 7.3% of men and 4.1% of women achieved the recommendations for strengthening activity. We found females and older adults (50–65 years) were less likely to meet guidelines for aerobic, strengthening, and combined aerobic plus strengthening activity. The prevalence of meeting activity guidelines was lower in adults from more deprived areas (compared with the least deprived); Adults with lower academic qualifications (Level 1) were less likely to meet activity guidelines than those educated to Level 4 (Degree Level) or higher. Having a limiting disability was associated with a lower prevalence of meeting activity guidelines. Associations between socio-demographic measures and the prevalence of adults meeting activity guidelines were stronger for strengthening activity than for aerobic 51(or combined aerobic plus strengthening) activity Compared with aerobic activity, fewer adults engage in strengthening activity regardless of how it is defined. The range in estimates for how many adults meet strengthening activity guidelines can be explained by variations in the definition of ‘strengthening’ that are used and the specific sports or activities identified as strengthening exercise. When strengthening activity is included, the proportion of English adults meeting current physical activity guidelines could be as high as 1 in 3 but possibly as low as just 1 in 20. A harmonized definition of strengthening activity, that is aligned with physical activity guidelines, is required to provide realistic and comparable prevalence estimates."
https://openalex.org/W4229024511,"Why do people prefer one particular COVID-19 vaccine over another? We conducted a pre-registered conjoint experiment (n = 5,432) in France, Germany, and Sweden in which respondents rated the favorability of and chose between pairs of hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines. Differences in effectiveness and the prevalence of side-effects had the largest effects on vaccine preferences. Factors with smaller effects include country of origin (respondents are less favorable to vaccines of Chinese and Russian origin), and vaccine technology (respondents exhibited a small preference for hypothetical mRNA vaccines). The general public also exhibits sensitivity to additional factors (e.g. how expensive the vaccines are). Our data show that vaccine attributes are more important for vaccine preferences among those with higher vaccine favorability and higher risk tolerance. In our conjoint design, vaccine attributes-including effectiveness and side-effect prevalence-appear to have more muted effects among the most vaccine hesitant respondents. The prevalence of side-effects, effectiveness, country of origin and vaccine technology (e.g., mRNA vaccines) determine vaccine acceptance, but they matter little among the vaccine hesitant. Vaccine hesitant people do not find a vaccine more attractive even if it has the most favorable attributes. While the communication of vaccine attributes is important, it is unlikely to convince those who are most vaccine hesitant to get vaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W4229056778,"The objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude of absolute and relative oral health inequality in countries with similar socio-political environments, but differing oral health care systems such as Canada, the United States (US), and the United Kingdom (UK), in the first decade of the new millennium. Clinical oral health data were obtained from the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007-2009, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2008, and the Adult Dental Health Survey 2009, for Canada, the US and UK, respectively. The slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) were used to quantify absolute and relative inequality, respectively. There was significant oral health inequality in all three countries. Among dentate individuals, inequality in untreated decay was highest among Americans (SII:28.2; RII:4.7), followed by Canada (SII:21.0; RII:3.09) and lowest in the UK (SII:15.8; RII:1.75). Inequality for filled teeth was negligible in all three countries. For edentulism, inequality was highest in Canada (SII: 30.3; RII: 13.2), followed by the UK (SII: 10.2; RII: 11.5) and lowest in the US (SII: 10.3; and RII: 9.26). Lower oral health inequality in the UK speaks to the more equitable nature of its oral health care system, while a highly privatized dental care environment in Canada and the US may explain the higher inequality in these countries. However, despite an almost equal utilization of restorative dental care, there remained a higher concentration of unmet needs among the poor in all three countries."
https://openalex.org/W4229067882,"Background In 2016, WHO launched the Global Health Sector Strategy on STIs, 2016–2021 (GHSS) to provide guidance and benchmarks for country achievement by 2020 and four global targets for achievement by 2030. Methods A country survey jointly developed by experienced technical personnel at WHO Headquarters (HQ) and WHO regional offices was reviewed and distributed by WHO regional advisors to 194 WHO Member States in September-March 2020. The survey sought to assess implementation and prioritization of STI policy, surveillance, service delivery, commodity availability, and surveillance based on targets of the GHSS. Results A majority (58%, 112/194) of countries returned a completed survey reflecting current (2019) STI activities. The regions with the highest survey completion rates were South-East Asia Region (91%, 10/11), Region of the Americas (71%, 25/35) and Western Pacific Region (67%, 18/27). Having a national STI strategy was reported by 64% (72/112) and performing STI surveillance activities by 88% (97/110) of reporting countries. Availability of STI services within primary health clinics was reported by 88% of countries (99/112); within HIV clinics by 92% (103/112), and within reproductive health services by 85% (95/112). Existence of a national strategy to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis (EMTCT) was reported by 70% of countries (78/112). Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) monitoring for gonococcal infection (gonorrhoea) was reported by 64% (57/89) of reporting countries with this laboratory capacity. Inclusion of HPV vaccine for young women in the national immunization schedule was reported by 59% (65/110) and availability of cervical cancer screening was reported by 91% (95/104). Stockouts of STI medicines, primarily benzathine penicillin, within the prior four years were reported by 34% (37/110) of countries. Conclusions Mechanisms to support improvements to STI service delivery through national-level policy, commitment, programming and surveillance are needed to operationalize, accelerate and monitor progress towards achievement of the 2030 global STI strategy targets."
https://openalex.org/W4229009772,"Understanding the mechanism of coexistence, where carnivores adapt to humans and vice versa in the shared landscape, is a key determinant of long-term carnivore conservation but is yet to be comprehensively examined. We explored the coexistence mechanism of striped hyena ( Hyaena hyaena) and humans in the shared landscape of Sawai Mansingh Wildlife Sanctuary (SMS WLS), Rajasthan, from November 2019 to March 2021. We used data derived from motion sensors-based surveys, satellite remote sensing images, and household questionnaires to understand socio-ecological, environmental and anthropogenic factors facilitating hyena persistence in the shared landscape. The high density (12 individuals/100 km 2 ) striped hyena in the landscape revealed the coexistence with humans. Being scavengers, they get subsidised food sources and are perceived as low-risk species by humans. Striped hyena minimised temporal activity during the daytime when human activity peaked. However, the highest activity overlap was observed in the agricultural area (Δ1 = 0.39), and likely depicts the high activity due to agricultural practices. While the human settlement was positively associated with the detection of hyenas, the probability of striped hyena captures increased with decreasing distance from human settlement, possibly influenced by high carcass availability, providing the easiest food resources to striped hyena, and allowing them to coexist with humans. This study demonstrates the coexistence of hyenas and humans in the shared landscape supported by mutual benefits, where hyenas benefit from anthropogenic food from scavenging, while humans benefit from waste removal and the non-lethal nature hyenas."
https://openalex.org/W4229049243,"By adopting Agenda 2030, governments agreed to review and report on their approach and action for achievement of sustainable development goals annually through the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development. Health and well-being are at the heart of the United Nations Agenda 2030. Given the social and economic harm that can be done by alcohol, reducing the consumption of alcohol is a pre-requisite to achieve the sustainable development goals. We explored how selected European countries have considered alcohol-related harm as an obstacle to achievement of SDGs and the extent to which they view alcohol policy as a solution to the achievement of sustainable development by analysing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs) submitted to the HLPF between years 2016 and 2020.We developed our own framework with 260 questions reflecting three dimensions of alcohol-harm considerations: indication, action, and evaluation. We analysed 36 VNRs of 32 European countries by first assessing them against the 260 questions to find out how they report on alcohol harm and whether they, in their action, refer to evidence-based, cost-effective alcohol policy solutions. Afterwards we used content analysis to assess the extent to which the countries addressed alcohol related harm, whether they refer to alcohol harm within SDG 3 (good health and well-being) or look beyond the health goal and consider alcohol harm having impact on goals other than the Goal 3.Nine countries (28.1%) did not mention alcohol in their report. Only eight countries (25%) mentioned one or more of the alcohol policy best buys among the actions they are taking to reduce alcohol related harm and only three (9.3%) explicitly elaborated on their impact on goals other than goal 3. Only five countries referred to the agreed indicator 3.5.2 measuring alcohol per capita consumption in the adult population. Many of the remaining countries used a range of terminology rather than alcohol per capita consumption, including ""excessive use of alcohol"", ""heavy use"", ""too much alcohol "", ""harmful alcohol consumption"", ""use among young people"".Alcohol use is, for example, associated with violence (SDG 5 and 16), it contributes to inequalities (SDG 5 and 10), it hinders economic growth (SDG 8), disrupts sustainable consumption (SDG 12) and it adversely impacts environment (SDG 13 and 14). The findings of this study show that these effects are not considered in the design of measures to achieve these goals. Moreover, inaccurate language related to alcohol harm indicates a gap in understanding of extend of alcohol burden and the consequences for sustainable development. So does the choice of ineffective measures to reduce alcohol consumption. Education programs and awareness raising campaigns focusing on individual lifestyle are neither in line with WHO Global Strategy to reduce the harm caused by alcohol that all selected countries adopted in 2010, nor do they reflect the seriousness of the problems related to alcohol use. Effective alcohol policy measures, so called three best buys, are missing from the transformative action that the Agenda 2030 calls for and governments committed to."

Analyzing single point mutations in a protein is crucial to see their impact and to understand the disease mechanism. This has given many biophysical resources, including databases and web-based tools to explore the effects of mutations on the structure and function of human proteins. For a given mutation, each tool provides a score-based outcomes which indicate deleterious probability. In recent years, developments in existing programs and the introduction of new prediction algorithms have transformed the state-of-the-art protein mutation analysis. In this study, we have performed a systematic study of the most commonly used mutational analysis programs (10 sequence-based and 5 structure-based) to compare their prediction efficiency. We have carried out extensive mutational analyses using these tools for previously known pathogenic single point mutations of five different proteins. These analyses suggested that sequence-based tools, PolyPhen2, PROVEAN, and PMut, and structure-based web tool, mCSM have a better prediction accuracy. This study indicates that the employment of more than one program based on different approaches should significantly improve the prediction power of the available methods."
https://openalex.org/W4229007291,"Explanations for police misconduct often center on a narrow notion of ""problem officers,"" the proverbial ""bad apples."" Such an individualistic approach not only ignores the larger systemic problems of policing but also takes for granted the group-based nature of police work. Nearly all of police work is group-based and officers' formal and informal networks can impact behavior, including misconduct. In extreme cases, groups of officers (what we refer to as, ""crews"") have even been observed to coordinate their abusive and even criminal behaviors. This study adopts a social network and machine learning approach to empirically investigate the presence and impact of officer crews engaging in alleged misconduct in a major U.S. city: Chicago, IL. Using data on Chicago police officers between 1971 and 2018, we identify potential crews and analyze their impact on alleged misconduct and violence. Results detected approximately 160 possible crews, comprised of less than 4% of all Chicago police officers. Officers in these crews were involved in an outsized amount of alleged and actual misconduct, accounting for approximately 25% of all use of force complaints, city payouts for civil and criminal litigations, and police-involved shootings. The detected crews also contributed to racial disparities in arrests and civilian complaints, generating nearly 18% of all complaints filed by Black Chicagoans and 14% of complaints filed by Hispanic Chicagoans."
https://openalex.org/W4229041341,"Foodborne diseases have become a serious havoc, where antimicrobial resistance is throwing significant challenges on daily basis. With the increase of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne infection associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, new and effective strategies were needed to control the emergence of vibriosis. Lytic bacteriophages come up as a promising way to resist the pathogenic population in various applications. In this study, a V. parahaemolyticus specific phage vB_VpS_PG28 was isolated from sewage in the seafood market. Results showed vB_VpS_PG28, is strictly a lytic bacteriophage and has a relatively large burst size of 103 plaque-forming units per infected cell. Comparative genomic and bioinformatic analyses proved that vB_VpS_PG28 is a new bacteriophage that had a homologous relation with Vibrio phages of family Siphoviridae, especially with phage VH2_2019, but transmission electron microscopy of vB_VpS_PG28 morphology characterized its morphology is similar to that of Myoviridae family. In silico analysis indicated that the vB_VpS_PG28 genome consists of 82712 bp (48.08% GC content) encoding 114 putative ORFs without tRNA,and any gene associated with resistance or virulence factors has not been found. The bacteriophage in the present study has shown significant outcomes in order to control bacterial growth under in vitro conditions. Thus, we are suggesting a beneficiary agent against foodborne pathogens. Further, to ensure the safe usage of phage oral toxicity testing is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4229056739,"Although the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred on a global scale, governments from different countries adopted different policies and achieved different anti-epidemic effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how the government response affected the transmission scale of COVID-19 on the dynamic perspective.This paper uses a dynamic generalized moment method to research the relationship between the government response and COVID-19 case fatality rate by using panel data from eight countries: China, United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, France, Japan, and South Korea.We have the following findings: 1. Government responses have a significant impact on the scale of COVID-19 transmission. 2. The rate of increase of government responses on the growth rate of COVID-19 case fatality rate has the characteristics of cyclicity and repeatability, that is, with the increase in the growth rate of government responses, the COVID-19 case fatality rate shows the following cyclical motion law: increasing first, reaching the maximum point, and then declining, and finally reaching the minimum point and then rising; ultimately, its convergence becomes 0. The cyclical fluctuations of COVID-19 in the long term may be caused by the decline in the level of government response, the mutation of the virus, and the violation of restrictive policies by some citizens. 3. The government response has a lag in controlling the spread of COVID-19.Since there is a lack of literature on the impact of government responses on the development of COVID-19 from a long-term and dynamic perspective. This paper fills this gap in empirical research. We provide and expand new empirical evidence based on the current literature. This paper provides the basis for government decision-making and will help to formulate the response to other major public health events that may occur in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4229073213,"In South Korea, in 2019, approximately 45.5% of newly-graduated nurses quit their jobs within one year of employment. To better understand the adjustment to nursing practice upon graduation, we developed an online communication skills training program based on nonviolent communication and evaluated its effectiveness. A quasi-experimental design was adopted. The sample included 28 participants in the experimental group and 27 in the control group after one participant in the control group dropped out. The participants were fourth-year nursing students at the K and S University in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, with some clinical training in a hospital setting. Data were analyzed using the χ 2 test, Fisher’s exact test, and independent t-test. Participants’ empathy, communication skills, anger, and self-efficacy were assessed before and after the training, as well as across the two groups. The experimental group showed significantly higher levels of empathy, communication skills, and self-efficacy compared to the control group after the program completion. However, there were no significant differences in anger. This study suggests the effectiveness of the online version of the nonviolent communication training. Therefore, providing this program to nursing students scheduled for graduation may help retain newly-graduated nurses."
https://openalex.org/W4225140257,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a heterotrimer consisting of α-, β-, and γ-subunits. Channel activation requires proteolytic release of inhibitory tracts from the extracellular domains of α-ENaC and γ-ENaC; however, the proteases involved in the removal of the γ-inhibitory tract remain unclear. In several epithelial tissues, ENaC is coexpressed with the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Here, we explored the effect of human TMPRSS2 on human αβγ-ENaC heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We found that coexpression of TMPRSS2 stimulated ENaC-mediated whole-cell currents by approximately threefold, likely because of an increase in average channel open probability. Furthermore, TMPRSS2-dependent ENaC stimulation was not observed using a catalytically inactive TMPRSS2 mutant and was associated with fully cleaved γ-ENaC in the intracellular and cell surface protein fractions. This stimulatory effect of TMPRSS2 on ENaC was partially preserved when inhibiting its proteolytic activity at the cell surface using aprotinin but was abolished when the γ-inhibitory tract remained attached to its binding site following introduction of two cysteine residues (S155C-Q426C) to form a disulfide bridge. In addition, computer simulations and site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that TMPRSS2 can cleave γ-ENaC at sites both proximal and distal to the γ-inhibitory tract. This suggests a dual role of TMPRSS2 in the proteolytic release of the γ-inhibitory tract. Finally, we demonstrated that TMPRSS2 knockdown in cultured human airway epithelial cells (H441) reduced baseline proteolytic activation of endogenously expressed ENaC. Thus, we conclude that TMPRSS2 is likely to contribute to proteolytic ENaC activation in epithelial tissues in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4228998929,"The language used in online discussions affects who participates in them and how they respond, which can influence perceptions of public opinion. This study examines how the term white privilege affects these dimensions of online communication. In two lab experiments, US residents were given a chance to respond to a post asking their opinions about renaming college buildings. Using the term white privilege in the question decreased the percentage of whites who supported renaming. In addition, those whites who remained supportive when white privilege was mentioned were less likely to create an online post, while opposing whites and non-whites showed no significant difference. The term also led to more low-quality posts among both whites and non-whites. The relationship between question language and the way participants framed their responses was mediated by their support or opposition for renaming buildings. This suggests that the effects of the term white privilege on the content of people's responses is primarily affective. Overall, mention of white privilege seems to create internet discussions that are less constructive, more polarized, and less supportive of racially progressive policies. The findings have the potential to support meaningful online conversation and reduce online polarization."
https://openalex.org/W4229004210,"Germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH) is the most devastating neurological complication in premature infants. GM-IVH usually begins in the GM, a highly vascularized region of the developing brain where glial and neuronal precursors reside underneath the lateral ventricular ependyma. Previous studies using human fetal tissue have suggested increased angiogenesis and paucity of pericytes as key factors contributing to GM-IVH pathogenesis. Yet, despite its relevance, the mechanisms underlying the GM vasculature's susceptibility to hemorrhage remain poorly understood. To gain better understanding on the vascular dynamics of the GM, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mouse GM vascular endothelium and pericytes during development. We hypothesize that vascular development of the mouse GM will provide a good model for studies of human GM vascularization and provide insights into the role of pericytes in GM-IVH pathogenesis. Our findings show that the mouse GM presents significantly greater vascular area and vascular branching compared to the developing cortex (CTX). Analysis of pericyte coverage showed abundance in PDGFRβ-positive and NG2-positive pericyte coverage in the GM similar to the developing CTX. However, we found a paucity in Desmin-positive pericyte coverage of the GM vasculature. Our results underscore the highly angiogenic nature of the GM and reveal that pericytes in the developing mouse GM exhibit distinct phenotypical and likely functional characteristics compared to other brain regions which might contribute to the high susceptibility of the GM vasculature to hemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W4229009113,"Objectives The present study aimed to assess the degree of the provision of services for drug-related problems (DRPs) and the factors affecting provision within the community pharmacy setting in Irbid, a large city in Northern Jordan. Methods A cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to community pharmacists in Irbid, Jordan during the period from January to May 2017. The survey is composed of background and practice characteristics, services provided routinely by the community pharmacists to address DRPs, and barriers and facilitators for DRP-reduction services. A summated score quantifying the degree of DRP-reduction service provision was calculated, which included overall scores and scores for the different scales and domains. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and a multivariate linear regression model for factors associated with the high provision of DRP-reduction service. Results Two hundred community pharmacists out of 210 pharmacists approached completed the surveys yielding a response rate of 95.2%. The most frequent DRPs encountered within the routine practice in the community pharmacy were economic aspects (76.0%). The mean total score relating to different DRP-reduction services was 32.9 (58.8%) out of 56 as the maximum possible score. It was estimated that 28.2% of the responding pharmacists provided the service overall (scored more than 50% of the scale). For the assessment, intervention, and referral dimensions, similar percentages of providers of the services were achieved: 59.7%, 61.9%, and 49.0%, respectively. Lower rates of providers were achieved on the documentation scale (12.9%). The lack of recognition of the pharmacist role by physicians was the most commonly reported barrier to effective DRP-reduction services among community pharmacists (78.9%). The ability to receive external guidance was indicated by the majority of surveyed pharmacists (94.5%) as a potential facilitator to DRP-reduction services in this study. Predictors associated with high total scores were the presence of medical records for the patients in the pharmacy, patients contact the pharmacy using email, a high satisfaction in professional relationships with physicians, and pharmacists’ age. Conclusion Even though community pharmacists in this study have been shown to deliver certain activities to address DRPs to a high degree, the overall rate of DRPs services was suboptimal. Community pharmacists reported several barriers that should be taken into consideration to facilitate the role of community pharmacists in providing adequate DRP reduction services to patients."

Malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases often co-exist in endemic countries but the implication of their co-existence on their transmission dynamics and control is poorly understood. The study aims to evaluate the relationships between the incidence of malaria and cases of measles and yellow fever in Africa. Methods The malaria incidence, death due to malaria, measles and yellow fever data were sourced from the WHO database. Poisson and zero-inflated time-trend regression were used to model the relationships between malaria and the two vaccine-preventable diseases. P -values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results A significant negative relationship existed between malaria incidence and measles cases ( P &lt;0.05), however, malaria showed a positive relationship with yellow fever ( P &lt;0.05). The relationships between death due to malaria and measles/yellow fever cases followed similar trends but with a higher level of statistical significance ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusions Malaria varied negatively with measles cases but positively with yellow fever. The relationships observed in this study could be important for the management of malaria and the studied vaccine-preventable diseases. Increase vaccination coverage and/or malaria treatment could modulate the direction of these relationships."

The mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ)22 was used in this study. An online version of the survey was created using Google Surveys, and a link for the survey was generated. As the objective of this study is to assess the users' satisfaction levels about mHealth applications and their intentions to use them in future (in post-Covid-19 times) in Saudi Arabia, all individuals who used or using mHealth applications will be included in this study. At the end of the survey time period, 318 responses were received.Items including 'easy to learn using the app' (mean rating = 3.9), 'easy to find information on the application'(mean rating = 3.9), 'interface of the app' (mean rating = 3.8) were rated to be highly effective by the participants.). However, ability to recover from mistakes while using the applications (mean rating = 2.9), inconsistency in navigation (mean rating = 2.9), and lack of all necessary functions (mean rating = 2.3) were few issues identified. No statistically significant difference of opinions was observed in relation to all sub-scales of usability factor.Although the satisfaction levels are good with respect to mHealth applications, the sudden rise in the mHealth users can be partly linked to the several psychological issues such as anxiety and depression among people and also because of restricted access during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4229056643,"Dysregulated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling contributes to fibrotic liver disease and hepatocellular cancer (HCC), both of which are associated with fatty liver disease. SIRT6 limits fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β signaling through deacetylating SMAD2 and SMAD3 and limits lipogenesis by inhibiting SREBP1 and SREBP2 activity. Here, we showed that, compared to wild-type mice, high-fat diet-induced fatty liver is worse in TGF-β signaling-deficient mice (SPTBN1+/- ) and the mutant mice had reduced SIRT6 abundance in the liver. Therefore, we hypothesized that altered reciprocal regulation between TGF-β signaling and SIRT6 contributes to these liver pathologies. We found that deficiency in SMAD3 or SPTBN1 reduced SIRT6 mRNA and protein abundance and impaired TGF-β induction of SIRT6 transcripts, and that SMAD3 bound to the SIRT6 promoter, suggesting that an SMAD3-SPTBN1 pathway mediated the induction of SIRT6 in response to TGF-β. Overexpression of SIRT6 in HCC cells reduced the expression of TGF-β-induced genes, consistent with the suppressive role of SIRT6 on TGF-β signaling. Manipulation of SIRT6 abundance in HCC cells altered sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity and overexpression of SIRT6 reduced the amount of acetylated SPTBN1 and the abundance of both SMAD3 and SPTBN1. Furthermore, induction of SREBP target genes in response to SIRT6 overexpression was impaired in SPTBN1 heterozygous cells. Thus, we identified a regulatory loop between SIRT6 and SPTBN1 that represents a potential mechanism for susceptibility to fatty liver in the presence of dysfunctional TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4229064987,"Population history reconstruction, using extant genetic diversity data, routinely relies on simple demographic models to project the past through ascending genealogical-tree branches. Because genealogy and genetics are intimately related, we traced descending genealogies of the Québec founders to pursue their fate and to assess their contribution to the present-day population. Focusing on the female and male founder lines, we observed important sex-biased immigration in the early colony years and documented a remarkable impact of these early immigrants on the genetic make-up of 20th-century Québec. We estimated the immigrants' survival ratio as a proportion of lineages found in the 1931-60 Québec to their number introduced within the immigration period. We assessed the effective family size, EFS, of all immigrant parents and their Québec-born descendants. The survival ratio of the earliest immigrants was the highest and declined over centuries in association with the immigrants' EFS. Parents with high EFS left plentiful married descendants, putting EFS as the most important variable determining the parental demographic success throughout time for generations ahead. EFS of immigrant founders appears to predict their long-term demographic and, consequently, their genetic outcome. Genealogically inferred immigrants' ""autosomal"" genetic contribution to 1931-60 Québec from consecutive immigration periods follow the same yearly pattern as the corresponding maternal and paternal lines. Québec genealogical data offer much broader information on the ancestral diversity distribution than genetic scrutiny of a limited population sample. Genealogically inferred population history could assist studies of evolutionary factors shaping population structure and provide tools to target specific health interventions."

The study first discusses the principle and current situation of the emerging Immersive Marketing. Then, it analyzes the Deep Learning (DL) Neural Network (NN) model. Finally, a Personalized Recommendation System (PRS) is designed based on the Immersive Marketing environment using the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. The proposed PRS based on the Immersive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) model has reflected higher advantages over other recommendation systems. The experiment results suggest that Immersive Marketing can fully reflect commodities' essential attributes and characteristics, improve users' shopping experience, and promote sales. Meanwhile, the IGNN-based PRS reported here gives users an elevated and immersive shopping experience and entertainment process. Lastly, the model comparison finds that the proposed IGNN outperforms other models. The optimal model parameters are verified as P@20 and R@20 to gain the highest composite index values. In particular, parameter R@20 gives the model a better performance over P@20.

https://openalex.org/W4229075568,"Deterioration in the quality of a person’s voice and speech is an early marker of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In humans, the neural circuit that supports vocal motor control consists of a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortico loop. The basal ganglia regions, striatum and globus pallidus, in this loop play a role in modulating the acoustic features of vocal behavior such as loudness, pitch, and articulatory rate. In PD, this area is implicated in pathogenesis. In animal models of PD, the accumulation of toxic aggregates containing the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein (αsyn) in the midbrain and striatum result in limb and vocal motor impairments. It has been challenging to study vocal impairments given the lack of well-defined cortico-basal ganglia circuitry for vocalization in rodent models. Furthermore, whether deterioration of voice quality early in PD is a direct result of αsyn-induced neuropathology is not yet known. Here, we take advantage of the well-characterized vocal circuits of the adult male zebra finch songbird to experimentally target a song-dedicated pathway, the anterior forebrain pathway, using an adeno-associated virus expressing the human wild-type αsyn gene, SNCA . We found that overexpression of αsyn in this pathway coincides with higher levels of insoluble, monomeric αsyn compared to control finches. Impairments in song production were also detected along with shorter and poorer quality syllables, which are the most basic unit of song. These vocal changes are similar to the vocal abnormalities observed in individuals with PD."
https://openalex.org/W4225123899,"The discovery of reduced flavin mononucleotide and fatty aldehydes as essential factors of light emission facilitated study of bacterial luminescence. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial luminescence have been studied for more than 60 years, the structure of the bacterial fatty acid reductase complex remains unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the Photobacterium phosphoreum fatty acid reductase complex LuxC-LuxE to a resolution of 2.79 Å. We show that the active site Lys238/Arg355 pair of LuxE is >30 Å from the active site Cys296 of LuxC, implying that catalysis relies on a large conformational change. Furthermore, mutagenesis and biochemical experiments support that the L-shaped cleft inside LuxC plays an important role in substrate binding and reaction. We obtained a series of mutants with significantly improved activity as measured by in vitro bioluminescence assays and demonstrated that the double mutant W111A/F483K displayed the highest activity (370% of the WT). Our results indicated that the activity of LuxC significantly affects the bacterial bioluminescence reaction. Finally, we expressed this mutated lux operon in Escherichia coli but observed that the in vivo concentrations of ATP and NADPH limited the enzyme activity; thus, we conclude that the luminous intensity mainly depends on the level of metabolic energy."

Accordingly, the World Health Organization implemented the #HealthyAtHome program, encouraging people to keep in regular contact with loved ones, stay physically active, and keep a regular routine. The current study aims to examine a micro-longitudinal link between behavioral activation coping strategies (exercise, meditation, relaxation, and social connection) and depressive symptoms among adults who lived alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used 21 biweekly waves of longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between April 2020 and February 2021 (N = 1,280). The multilevel models with correlated random effects were estimated to examine lagged effects of coping strategies (t-1) on depressive symptoms (t). The results showed that exercise was predictive of lower depressive symptoms even after controlling for time-invariant and time-varying covariates. The results showed that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as taking time to exercise, may be beneficial for the mental health of Americans living in single-person households."
https://openalex.org/W4229024029,"With the advent of high-throughput assays, a large number of biological experiments can be carried out. Image-based assays are among the most accessible and inexpensive technologies for this purpose. Indeed, these assays have proved to be effective in characterizing unknown functions of genes and small molecules. Image analysis pipelines have a pivotal role in translating raw images that are captured in such assays into useful and compact representation, also known as measurements. CellProfiler is a popular and commonly used tool for this purpose through providing readily available modules for the cell/nuclei segmentation, and making various measurements, or features, for each cell/nuclei. Single cell features are then aggregated for each treatment replica to form treatment ""profiles"". However, there may be several sources of error in the CellProfiler quantification pipeline that affects the downstream analysis that is performed on the profiles. In this work, we examined various preprocessing approaches to improve the profiles. We consider the identification of drug mechanisms of action as the downstream task to evaluate such preprocessing approaches. Our enhancement steps mainly consist of data cleaning, cell level outlier detection, toxic drug detection, and regressing out the cell area from all other features, as many of them are widely affected by the cell area. Our experiments indicate that by performing these time-efficient preprocessing steps, image-based profiles can preserve more meaningful information compared to raw profiles. In the end, we also suggest possible avenues for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4229034678,"None of the conventional echocardiographic parameters alone predict increased NTproBNP level and symptoms, making diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) very difficult in some cases, in resting condition. We evaluated LA functions by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) on top of conventional parameters in HFpEF and preHF patients with diastolic dysfunction (DD), in order to establish the added value of the LA deformation parameters in the diagnosis of HFpEF.We prospectively enrolled 125 patients, 88 with HFpEF (68±9 yrs), and 37 asymptomatic with similar risk factors with DD (preHF) (61±8 yrs). We evaluated them by NTproBNP, conventional DD parameters, and STE. Global longitudinal strain (GS) was added. LA reservoir (R), conduit (C), and pump function (CT) were assessed both by volumetric and STE. 2 reservoir strain (S) derived indices were also measured, stiffness (SI) and distensibility index (DI).LA R and CT functions were significantly reduced in HFpEF compared to preHF group (all p<0.001), whereas conduit was similarly in both groups. SI was increased, whereas DI was reduced in HFpEF group (p<0.001). By adding LA strain analysis, from all echocardiographic parameters, SR_CT<-1.66/s and DI<0.57 (AUC = 0.76, p<0.001) demonstrated the highest accuracy to identify HFpEF diagnosis. However, by multivariate logistic regression, the model that best identifies HFpEF included only SR_CT, GS and sPAP (R2 = 0.506, p<0.001). Moreover, SR_CT, DI, and sPAP registered significant correlation with NTproBNP level.By adding LA functional analysis, we might improve the HFpEF diagnosis accuracy, compared to present guidelines. LA pump function is the only one able to differentiates preHF from HFpEF patients at rest. A value of SR_CT < -1.66/s outperformed conventional parameters from the scoring system, reservoir strain, and LA overload indices in HFpEF diagnosis. We suggest that LA function by STE could be incorporated in the current protocol for HFpEF diagnosis at rest as a major functional criterion, in order to improve diagnostic algorithm, and also in the follow-up of patients with risk factors and DD, as a prognostic marker. Future studies are needed to validate our findings."
https://openalex.org/W4229048491,"Lung cancer is known to be one of the fatal diseases in the world and is experiencing treatment difficulties. Many treatments have been discovered and implemented, but death rate of patients with lung cancer continues to remain high. Current treatments for cancer such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy have shown considerable results, yet they are accompanied by side effects. One effective method for reducing the cytotoxicity of these treatments is via the use of a nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery strategy with selective silencing effects and non-viral vectors. In this study, a folate (FA) moiety ligand-conjugated poly(sorbitol-co-PEI)-based gene transporter was designed by combining low-molecular weight polyethyleneimine (LMW PEI) and D-sorbitol with FA to form FPS. Since folate receptors are commonly overexpressed in various cancer cells, folate-conjugated nanoparticles may be more effectively delivered to selective cancer cells. Additionally, siOPA1 was used to induce apoptosis through mitochondrial fusion. The OPA1 protein stability level is important for maintaining normal mitochondrial cristae structure and function, conserving the inner membrane structure, and protecting cells from apoptosis. Consequently, when FPS/siOPA1 was used for lung cancer in-vitro and in-vivo , it improved cell viability and cellular uptake."

This research aims to evaluate the competitiveness of South Korea’s trading products and its partner countries’ dependency by implementing a product and partner-based analysis. This research raises questions about the transactional positions of products and trading partners based on the diversification of import-export relations of South Korea. This study utilizes the matrix of products and trading partners from the Korean product export and import data from 1995 to 2015. The research analyzes Korea’s product competitiveness and dependency of trading countries on Korea using the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and a nonlinear iterative method (NIM). The study finds that the products of several manufacturing industries showed a large production scale. From the global perspective, the trade dependency on Korea was high in Asia and in Africa and South America where the portion of underdeveloped or developing countries is relatively large. This research suggests that Korea may face difficulties of continuing growth if it maintains or intensifies its trade relation pattern under the environment of rapidly changing technology and economy. Therefore, diversification and mutual complementarity could be important for the export of promising products and industrial development policy."
https://openalex.org/W4229060469,"Owing to the complicated geometric conditions and increasingly diversified driving environment, freeway curves have become a road section with frequent serious accidents. To ensure safe driving on curves, drivers must first perceive the movement condition and the vehicle's position, and accurately evaluate the characteristics of the road to make the right speed choice. In this process, the perception of speed plays a crucial role. The present study aims to investigate the driver's speed perception characteristics with respect to freeway curves to better understand the driver speed selection mechanism. We first construct six three-dimensional (3D) virtual highway models, which are consistent with the geometric lines and traffic engineering instruments of real freeways. A virtual simulation test is then conducted in a highly immersive environment. After the completion of the simulation experiment, we conduct a field verification experiment, test the actual driving speed and perceived speed of drivers in the same place as the simulation experiment, and verify the effectiveness of the simulation method. Finally, 25 3D curve models of four different types are constructed, and the influence of curve characteristics (e.g., curve radius, curve combination, tangent length between curves) on drivers' speed perception accuracy are tested on the simulation platform. The results show that the driver's perceived speed is lower than the real speed when driving on curves, and the tangent-to-spiral (TS) point is the section where the driver's speed is most underestimated. Radius was the most important factor affecting driver's speed perception, but the tangent length between curves also had a lesser influence. However, the curve combination had no effect on it. Our findings can help researchers and road designers understand the reasons for drivers' speed choice, thus promoting drivers' safety on freeway curves."

Therefore, the current situation represents a considerable clinical threat due to the dearth of antifungal pipelines. Despite a £2.6 billion investment for antifungal research over a 14 year period (18Head M.G. Fitchett J.R. Atun R. May R.C. Systematic analysis of funding awarded for mycology research to institutions in the UK, 1997-2010.BMJ Open. 2014; 4e004129Google Scholar), only limited numbers of novel antifungals are currently undergoing phase II trials (e.g., NCT03583164 and Ibrexafungerp) (19Davis M.R.

One of the main challenges to overcome is the lack of new and well-characterized antifungal targets, which is one of the reasons that the pharmaceutical industry has largely ceased research and development on antifungal agents (20Steinbach W.J.

Taken together, targeting UDP-Glc biosynthesis is likely to elicit antifungal activity through disruption of cell wall integrity, N-glycosylation, and trehalose biosynthesis. As such, disruption of UDP-Glc biosynthesis could be hypothesized to be a likely Achilles’ heel of A. fumigatus. The UDP-Glc biosynthetic pathway starts from the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), yielding glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P), which is subsequently converted to glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1P) by phosphoglucomutase (PGM) (EC 5.4.2.2). UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9) then converts Glc-1P and UTP to UDP-Glc and pyrophosphate. As such, the inhibition of PGM activity could hypothetically limit the supply of Glc-1P and in turn disrupt the biosynthesis of UDP-Glc, suggesting that PGM is a possible antifungal target. To select potential enzymatic protein targets, Wyatt et al. have raised six criteria: essentiality, druggability, assay feasibility, toxicity, resistance potential, and structural information (63Wyatt P.G. Gilbert I.H. Read K.D. Fairlamb A.H. Target validation: linking target and chemical properties to desired product profile.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2011; 11: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Target essentiality is a key prerequisite of drug discovery campaigns. The identification of target essentiality is carried out through genetic and chemical validation. Although genetic studies in Ganoderma lucidum have demonstrated that PGM is essential for fungal growth and cell wall integrity (64Hu Y.R. Li M.J. Wang S.L. Yue S.N. Shi L. Ren A. et al.Ganoderma lucidum phosphoglucomutase is required for hyphal growth, polysaccharide production, and cell wall integrity.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2018; 102: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), physiological functions of A. fumigatus PGM (AfPGM) have not been explored. Therefore, no genetic validation of AfPGM has been reported. To date, chemical validation of AfPGM has been lacking due to the absence of suitable chemical tools (e.g., small molecule inhibitors). Currently, PGM inhibitors are limited to mechanism-inspired inhibitors based upon the sugar phosphate structure of the enzyme substrate (65Regni C. Shackelford G.S. Beamer L.J.

The possession of negatively charged phosphate groups reduces cell membrane permeability of such inhibitors (68Chakrabarti A.C. Deamer D.W.

(Clifton, N.J.). 2015; 1266: 29-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), reducing the attractiveness of mechanism-inspired inhibitors for further follow-up studies. Currently, no other types of inhibitors against PGM have been reported. As such, chemical validation of AfPGM is hampered by the lack of suitable tool inhibitors. Moreover, the PGM ortholog in human (HsPGM) is indispensable for human health as missense mutations in HsPGM lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (71Stiers K.M. Kain B.N. Graham A.C.

Biol. 2016; 428: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To avoid toxicity, any putative PGM inhibitor must exhibit exquisite selectivity to AfPGM over HsPGM. AfPGM shares 53% sequence similarity compared to HsPGM and, therefore, achieving selectivity of inhibitors can only be achieved with the help of a high-resolution crystal structure of AfPGM. PGM proteins belong to the α-phosphohexomutase family, members of which exhibit a heart-shaped structure composed of four domains (I, II, III, and IV) (71Stiers K.M. Kain B.N. Graham A.C. Beamer L.J.

P2X7 is a unique member of the P2X receptor family with many properties that differ from other subtypes in terms of primary sequence, the architecture of N- and C-terminals, and channel function. Here, we suggest that the observed lengthened β2- and β3-sheets and their linker (loop β2,3), encoded by redundant sequences, play an indispensable role in the activation of the P2X7 receptor. We show that deletion of this longer structural element leads to the loss of P2X7 function. Furthermore, by combining mutagenesis, chimera construction, surface expression, and protein stability analysis, we found that the deletion of the longer β2,3-loop affects P2X7 surface expression but, more importantly, that this loop affects channel gating of P2X7. We propose that the longer β2,3-sheets may have a negative regulatory effect on a loop on the head domain and on the structural element formed by E171 and its surrounding regions. Understanding the role of the unique structure of the P2X7 receptor in the gating process will aid in the development of selective drugs targeting this subtype.

Among them, P2X7 has many features that differ from other P2X subtypes, such as the fact that P2X7 requires very high concentrations of ATP for activation and has an EC50 value (the concentration that produces half of the maximal response) of approximately 0.3 to 1 mM under normal physiological conditions (2 mM extracellular Ca2+ and 1 mM extracellular Mg2+), whereas the EC50 values of other subtypes are generally around 0.5 to 10 μM (8North R.A. Surprenant A. Pharmacology of cloned P2X receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In terms of the channel desensitization of P2X receptors, P2X1 and P2X3 desensitize very quickly (milliseconds) after saturating ATP applications, whereas P2X2 and P2X4 are relatively slow (seconds); P2X7 does not desensitize at all (9Jarvis M.F.

The aforementioned unique properties make P2X7 considered as the most special member of the P2X family compared to other subtypes. P2X7 receptors are involved in many physiopathological functions, particularly its expression in lymphocytes, macrophages, and microglia, and its role in the immune response (13Di Virgilio F.

It has been shown that P2X7 receptors are required for the establishment of long-lived memory CD8+ cells (14Borges da Silva H. Beura L.K. Wang H. Hanse E.A. Gore R.

P2X7 receptors are expressed in neutrophils, and their activation leads to activation of nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome and secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (15Karmakar M. Katsnelson M.A. Dubyak G.R. Pearlman E. Neutrophil P2X7 receptors mediate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion in response to ATP.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), indicating that P2X7 receptors are closely associated with inflammation. P2X7 plays a role in allograft transplant rejection, and inhibition of the P2X7 receptor or the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome contributes to the induction of graft tolerance (16Amores-Iniesta J.

P2X7 in the central nervous system is involved in the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (17Chen X. Hu J. Jiang L. Xu S. Zheng B.

The first crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4 (zfP2X4) receptor was determined in 2009 (25Kawate T. Michel J.C. Birdsong W.T. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of the ATP-gated P2X4 ion channel in the closed state.Nature. 2009; 460: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and the structures of several other P2X subtypes have been determined in the last decade (26Hattori M.

S. A. 2018; 115: 4939-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional (3D) structure of the P2X receptor and the way that each subunit is folded are essentially the same for all subtypes: each P2X subtype exhibits a ""chalice""-like trimeric structure containing a large hydrophilic extracellular structural domain, two transmembrane helices and intracellular termini, and the individual subunits of each P2X subtype resemble “dolphins”. Nevertheless, the gating differences between P2X subtypes are not fully understood, especially the unique P2X7 receptor. In addition to its function and properties being specific among P2X subtypes, the structure of P2X7 is unique, starting with the long intracellular N- and C-terminals of P2X7. The C-terminus of P2X7 is involved in regulating many functions of the P2X7 receptor, including protein–protein interactions, phosphorylation, and post-translational modifications (33Costa-Junior H.M. Sarmento Vieira F. Coutinho-Silva R. C terminus of the P2X7 receptor: treasure hunting.Purinergic Signal. 2011; 7: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to other P2X receptors, the C-terminus of P2X7 has a unique cysteine-rich region called the ""C-cys anchor"" that prevents P2X7 receptor desensitization (30McCarthy A.E. Yoshioka C. Mansoor S.E.

The N-terminal of P2X7 is important for Ca2+-influx (35Liang X. Samways D.S. Wolf K. Bowles E.A. Richards J.P. Bruno J. et al.Quantifying Ca2+ current and permeability in ATP-gated P2X7 receptors.J.

P2X7 receptor activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 independently of Ca2+ influx.Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, despite binding the U-shape of ATP and key residues recognized by ATP (K64, K66, T189, N292, R294 and K311, rP2X7 numbering) are conserved in the P2X receptor family, but recent structures have shown that the ATP-binding pocket of the P2X7 receptor is narrower than that of the human P2X3 (hP2X3) receptor (29Mansoor S.E. Lu W. Oosterheert W. Shekhar M. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E. X-ray structures define human P2X(3) receptor gating cycle and antagonist action.Nature. 2016; 538: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30McCarthy A.E. Yoshioka C. Mansoor S.E. Full-length P2X7 structures reveal how palmitoylation prevents channel desensitization.Cell. 2019; 179: 659-670.e613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, P2X7 is structurally unique in many ways compared to other subtypes, and all of these unique structural elements are associated with functions that distinguish it from other subtypes. Here, we find another unique structural element of P2X7. By comparison of structure and sequence, we found that the β2 and β3 sheets of P2X7 and their linker (loop β2,3) are longer compared to other subtypes. The question of whether the longer β2,3-sheet and loop β2,3 of the P2X7 receptor have a unique function compared to other P2X receptor subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we show that the redundant sequence between the P2X7 receptor β2,3 and its corresponding structural elements plays an important role in both expression and channel gating of the P2X7 receptor, which is unique among the P2X family. Sequence alignment analysis of the P2X receptor family revealed that residues 73 to 80 of the P2X7 receptor are redundant compared to other subtypes (Fig. 1C). In the recently determined resting-state structure of rP2X7 (PDB ID: 6U9V), no stable conformation of this region was observed in this disordered region; however, in the open state, this region folded into a longer β2,3 in the cryo-electron microscopic (Cryo-EM) structure of the P2X7 receptor than that of the P2X3 receptor (Fig. 1, A and B and PDB IDs: 6U9W and 5SVK). The superposition of the resting and open states showed that the longer β2,3 region shifted to the right in the open state (Fig. 1, A and B). To verify whether the longer β2,3 structure in the P2X7 receptor is necessary for channel function, we deleted residues 73 to 80 and obtained Δ(73–80). Δ(73–80) mutant significantly reduced the 1 mM ATP-induced currents (70.9 ± 57.8 and 250 ± 61 pA/pF, for Δ(73–80) and wildtype, WT, n = 4 and 13, respectively, p < 0.01, Δ(73–80) versus WT; Fig. 2, A and B). We also performed a smaller deletion of this fragment and obtained three truncations, Δ(73–74), Δ(75–76), and Δ(77–80), where Δ(73–74) dramatically decreased the function of the channel. However, mutations in N73A and N74A at individual positions did not have as strong an effect as that caused by deleting both of them (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, the EC50 values of Δ(73–80) (208.7 ± 22.6 μM), Δ(73–74) (1762.3 ± 5.8 μM), Δ(75–76) (335.4 ± 88.2 μM), E73A (33.9 ± 1.7 μM), and N74A (26.6 ± 0.2 μM) were significantly changed compared to rP2X7 WT (98.5 ± 37.3 μM) (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that this redundant structure may not facilitate interactions with surrounding residues through individual amino acids but rather participate in channel gating together as an integrated whole. In addition to gating modulation, there are many factors that can affect the maximum current of a channel. First, we analyzed the membrane expression of these mutants. We found that Δ(73–80), Δ(73–74), Δ(75–76), and Δ(77–80) had significantly reduced numbers of membrane proteins (Fig. 3, A and B), which suggests that the reduction in the maximum currents of Δ(73–80), Δ(73–74), and Δ(75–76) channels may be caused by the reduction in surface expression of channels. However, there was no significant difference in the surface expression of these mutants, such as Δ(73–74), whose maximum current density was significantly reduced, but whose membrane expression was the same as that of E73A and N74A (maximum current density of E73A and N74A was only slightly lower or not different from that of WT, Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, the surface/total ratio was also calculated (Fig. 3C) and correlation analysis showed no correlation between surface/total ratio and current density (R2 = 0.48, p = 0.08, Pearson's correlation, Fig. 3D). These results indicate that some reduction in membrane expression did not contribute mainly to the reduction in the maximum current density of the mutants. In addition, we treated cells transfected with rP2X7 WT and Δ(73–80) with cyclohexanone (20 μg/ml) for different times to see if there was an effect on protein stability. Even after 10 h of cyclohexanone treatment, the amount of protein was not affected (Fig. 3, E and F). Once factors of protein surface expression and stability were excluded, we inferred that the reduction in the maximum current may be caused by gating changes in the channel due to the lack of the longer β2,3 structure of P2X7. The β2,3-sheet in the structure of each P2X receptor is sandwiched between the upper body domain of the same subunit and the head domain of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the conformation of the β2,3-sheet of rP2X7 changed considerably from the resting state to the open state. In the resting state, the exact conformation cannot be seen due to insufficient resolution, but it should not be a stable β-sheet (30McCarthy A.E. Yoshioka C. Mansoor S.E. Full-length P2X7 structures reveal how palmitoylation prevents channel desensitization.Cell. 2019; 179: 659-670.e613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, residues 73 to 80 of rP2X7 may have a loose loop-like secondary structure in the resting state, while in the open state, they form a rigid β-sheet (Fig. 1A). Notably, the longer region (residues 73–80) of the β2,3-sheet in P2X7 is closer to the upper body domain of the same subunit than that of other subtypes (Fig. 1, A and B). The superposition of the resting and open state structures of rP2X7 revealed that the conformation of the loop 168 to 175 (loop 1) in the upper body domain of the same subunit changed significantly, while the longer β2,3 shifted to the right, as evidenced by the apparent flip-flopping of the side chains of amino acids A170, E171, and E172 (Fig. 4A). We further mutated each of these three amino acids and found that mutation of E171A significantly reduced the function of the channel (3.5 ± 1.4 and 314 ± 79 pA/pF for E171A and WT, respectively, p < 0.01, E171A versus WT; Fig. 4, B and C) even when the concentration of ATP was increased to 30 mM and it did not further increase the current density (2.1 ± 1.5 pA/pF for E171A, saturated ATP). E171D, a mutation with more similar side chain properties, still significantly impaired channel activation of rP2X7, suggesting a rigid requirement of this position for rP2X7 activation (112 ± 42, 151 ± 60, and 173 ± 62 pA/pF after the treatment of 1, 10, and 30 mM ATP, respectively, in E171D; Fig. 4D). E171D significantly changed the apparent ATP affinity of rP2X7 (EC50 = 127 ± 41 and 752 ± 18 μM for rP2X7 WT and E171D, respectively; Fig. 4E). In addition, Western blot experiments showed that E171A did not cause abnormal surface expression of rP2X7 (Fig. 4, F and G). These results suggest that residue E171 in the region adjacent to the longer β2,3 region (residues 73–80) is also critical for the gating process of P2X7. Does E171, like the longer β2,3 redundant region, has a unique effect on the maximum current of rP2X7 compared to other members of the P2X family? To explore this idea, we performed a sequence alignment analysis and found that E171 is highly conserved in the P2X family (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we performed the same point mutation in the identical position for other P2X subtypes. There are no or only small ATP-induced currents in the P2X5 and P2X6 subtypes, and thus, no mutations were made to these two subtypes. In P2X1 to P2X4, mutations at this position resulted in significant changes (∼10-fold) in the EC50 values of P2X1, P2X3, and P2X4 (EC50 = 0.67 ± 0.03 and 4.39 ± 0.84 μM for P2X1 WT and E168A, respectively; 0.48 ± 0.31 and 0.64 ± 0.24 μM for P2X3 WT and E156A, respectively; 7.04 ± 4.41 and 52.0 ± 18.6 μM for P2X4 WT and E168A, respectively; Fig. 5, B, F and H). For the P2X2 subtype, mutation E167A did not affect the EC50 of ATP (EC50 = 24.0 ± 7.8 and 27.5 ± 3.9 μM for P2X2 WT and E167A, respectively; Fig. 5D). Unlike P2X7, none of the mutations in these subtypes altered the maximum current density of ATP (Fig. 5, C, E, G and I), suggesting that E171 of rP2X7 plays a different role in channel function than other subtypes, at least for P2X1-4. Although both β2,3 and E171 in rP2X7 affect channel gating and both are specific to the P2X7 subtype, whether the two are interrelated needs further verification. To address this issue, we explored the effects of these two regions of P2X7 on channels in different species, including human P2X7 (hP2X7), panda P2X7 (pdP2X7), dog (dP2X7), guinea pig P2X7 (gpP2X7), mouse P2X7 (mP2X7), bovine P2X7 (bP2X7), and chicken P2X7 (ckP2X7). In these genes, ckP2X7 has a different sequence, i.e., it does not have a longer β2,3-sheet like other P2X7, and the identical E171 position is Q159 (Fig. 6A). As expected, the mutant ckP2X7Q159A does not affect the maximum current of this channel (353 ± 121 and 387 ± 164 pA/pF for ckP2X7Q159A and ckP2X7WT, respectively; p > 0.05, ckP2X7Q159A versus ckP2X7WT; Fig. 6, B and C). Since other species have the longer β2,3 and a conserved glutamate at the same position as 171, we deleted the redundant region of β2,3 and mutated residues at the corresponding positions of E171 in these species to obtain pdP2X7Δ(73-80), pdP2X7E171A, hP2X7Δ(73-80), hP2X7E171A, dP2X7Δ(73-80), dP2X7E171A, gpP2X7Δ(73-80), gpP2X7E171A, mP2X7Δ(73-80), mP2X7E171A, bP2X7Δ(75-82), and bP2X7E173A. Removing the redundant sequence, pdP2X7Δ(73-80), does not affect the maximum current of this channel, and therefore, the mutation in pdP2X7E171A does not affect the maximum current either (325 ± 55 and 260 ± 59 pA/pF for pdP2X7E171A and pdP2X7WT, respectively; pdP2X7E171A versus pdP2X7WT, p > 0.05; Fig. 6, D and E). As well, the surface/total expression ratios of pdP2X7Δ(73-80) and pdP2X7E171A were comparable to that of pdP2X7WT(Fig. 7, A–C). In contrast, deletions corresponding to rP2X7 are similar in the other five species: mutations corresponding to the β2,3 redundant region and E171 position both significantly affect the maximum current of the P2X7 channel in these species (28.3 ± 10.7, 3.5 ± 2.6, and 74.9 ± 35.4 pA/pF for hP2X7Δ(73-80), hP2X7E171A, and hP2X7WT, respectively, p < 0.01, n = 11, 7, and 7, Fig. 6, F and G; 73.1 ± 52.7, 65.0 ± 36.7, and 222 ± 72 pA/pF for dP2X7Δ(73-80), dP2X7E171A, and dP2X7WT, respectively, p < 0.01, n = 6, 4, and 5, Fig. 6, H and I; 0.54 ± 0.54, 41.3 ± 28.5, and 356 ± 100 pA/pF for gpP2X7Δ(73-80), gpP2X7E171A, and gpP2X7WT, respectively, p < 0.01, n = 3, 4, and 3, Fig. 6, J and K; 91.3 ± 20.5, 5.8 ± 3.4, and 146 ± 12 pA/pF for mP2X7Δ(73-80), mP2X7E171A, and mP2X7WT, respectively, p < 0.05, n = 4, 4, and 4, Fig. 6, L and M; 1.5 ± 1.7, 4.4 ± 3.2, and 185 ± 53 pA/pF for bP2X7Δ(75-82), bP2X7E173A, and bP2X7WT, respectively, p < 0.01, n = 4, 3, and 3, Fig. 6, N and O). In addition, we examined the membrane expression-to-total expression ratios of other three different species of P2X7 (dP2X7, mP2X7, and bP2X7) and their corresponding mutants (dP2X7Δ(73-80), mP2X7Δ(73-80), and bP2X7Δ(75-82)) by Western blot. dP2X7Δ(73-80) membrane expression was somewhat decreased compared to WT (Fig. 7, D–F). However, there was no significant difference between mP2X7Δ(73-80) and bP2X7Δ(75-82) and WT (Fig. 7, G–L). These results suggest that the deletion of the longer β2,3 in P2X7 causes a decrease in membrane expression (as in rP2X7) that varies among species. Based on the aforementioned results, there is a relationship between these two structural elements, i.e., when the redundant region influences the maximum current, the E171 position also has an effect; when there is no redundant region or the redundant region has no effect on the maximum current, then the E171 also has no effect. Moreover, this linkage does not appear to be strongly associated with redundant regions affecting protein membrane expression or not. Next, we investigated the mechanism of the interrelationship between the β2,3 redundant region and E171. Since the β2,3 redundant region/E171 of pdP2X7 and rP2X7 have a diametrically opposed role in the channel activation and the crystal or cryo-EM structures of both have been determined, we used both species of P2X7 for the following studies. rP2X7 structural superposition in the resting and open states showed that hydrogen bonding interactions were formed between R294 and E171 in both the resting and open states, except that in the resting state R294....E171 salt bridge is positioned further away from the ATP-binding site than in the open state (Fig. 8A). In this process, ATP attracts R294, prompting E171 to move and its side chain orientation to change, resulting in the R294...E171 salt bridge as a whole toward the ATP-binding site, further leading to the aforementioned conformational flip of E171 in the loop 1 (residues 168–175, rP2X7 numbering) (Fig. 8A). In addition, the head domain movement of the P2X7 receptor is upward upon ATP binding, and there is a clear positional shift in a segment of the loop structure in the head domain (which we call loop 2, residues 121–139, rP2X7 numbering), in contrast to that of other subtypes. Interestingly, in the apo structure of the pdP2X7 receptor, the position of E171 and the conformation of loop 2 are similar to the open structure of rP2X7, but different from that of the resting state (Fig. 8B). The difference led us to speculate that the redundant β2,3 structure could facilitate the conformational transition from the resting to the open state of E171 and surrounding structural elements in the rP2X7 receptor and that the differences between rat and panda species may be caused by sequence differences in the β2,3-sheet. Therefore, we replaced the β2,3 region of rP2X7 with the corresponding region of pdP2X7 to construct rP2X7CH1 (Fig. 8C). Such a replacement resulted in a certain reduction in the maximum channel current (82.9 ± 35.4 and 204 ± 57 pA/pF for rP2X7CH1 and rP2X7WT, respectively, p < 0.01, rP2X7CH1 versus rP2X7WT, n = 7 and 6; Fig. 8, D and E).

https://openalex.org/W4225405241,"Since its identification in 2019, Covid-19 has spread to become a global pandemic. Until now, vaccination in its different forms proves to be the most effective measure to control the outbreak and lower the burden of the disease on healthcare systems. This arena has become a prime target to criminal networks that spread counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines across the supply chain mainly for profit. Counterfeit vaccines provide false sense of security to individuals, heightens the risk of exposure and outbreak of the virus, and increase the risk of harm linked to Covid-19 infection. Moreover, the increase in counterfeit vaccines feeds hesitancy towards vaccination and erodes the trust in mass immunisation programmes. It is therefore of paramount importance to work on rapid and reliable methods for vaccine authentication. Subsequently this work utilised a portable and non-destructive near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic method for authentication of Covid-19 vaccines. A total of 405 Covid-19 vaccines samples, alongside their main constituents, were measured as received through glass vials. Spectral quality and bands were inspected by considering the raw spectra of the vaccines. Authentication was explored by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the multiplicative scatter correction-first derivative spectra. The results showed that NIR spectra of the vaccine featured mainly bands corresponding to the mRNA active ingredient. Fewer bands corresponded to the excipients and protein spectra. The vaccines NIR spectra were strongly absorbing with maximum absorbances up to 2.7 absorbance units and that differentiated them from samples containing normal saline only (constituent reported for counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines). Clustering based on PCA offered optimal authentication of Covid-19 vaccines when applied over the range of 9000–4000 cm -1 These findings shed light on the potential of using NIR for analysing Covid-19 vaccines and presents a rapid and effective initial technique for Covid-19 vaccine authentication."
https://openalex.org/W4229004017,"Scientific research in Saudi Arabia's universities has undergone significant changes in recent years with the speed of higher education expansion and the opening of new universities. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to existing data analysis processes to enhance pattern recognition and to support advanced data analysis. This study aimed to investigate the obstacles to activating the role of university instructors and students in joint scientific research. The study also aimed to evaluate joint scientific research between university teachers and students in universities, as well as the mechanisms for activating joint scientific research among male and female students in health and humanities science within Saudi universities, to enhance creation and invention achievements. To determine the obstacles to activating scientific research roles between students and tutors in Saudi universities using AI, a simple random sampling technique was adopted for this study. A well-structured questionnaire was administered to 250 respondents affiliated with universities in Saudi Arabia. The data collected were statistically analyzed with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. The results of this study revealed that the objectives of joint scientific research between university teachers and students in universities have a significant positive predictor of obstacles to activating the role of teachers in joint scientific research with students in Saudi universities. The study also showed that there was a statistically significant correlation (p value = 0.00) between each of the variables."

In this study we investigate whether chemically defined spent media (CDSM) waste from cell culture bioprocess can be recycled and used as a feed in secondary microbial fermentation to produce new recombinant protein products. Our results show that CDSM supplemented with 2% glycerol supported a specific growth rate of E . coli cultures equivalent to that achieved using a nutritionally rich microbiological media (LB). The titre of recombinant protein produced following induction in a 4-hour expression screen was approximately equivalent in the CDSM fed cultures to that of baseline, and this was maintained in a 16-hr preparative fermentation. To understand the protein production achieved in CDSM fed culture we performed a quantitative analysis of proteome changes in the E . coli using mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed significant upregulation of protein synthesis machinery enzymes and significant downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. We conclude that spent cell culture media, which represents 100s of millions of litres of waste generated by the bioprocessing industry annually, may be valorized as a feed resource for the production of recombinant proteins in secondary microbial fermentations.

https://openalex.org/W4229067245,"Background Smokeless tobacco (ST) products are widely used throughout the world and contribute to morbidity and mortality in users through an increased risk of cancers and oral diseases. Bacterial populations in ST contribute to taste, but their presence can also create carcinogenic, Tobacco-Specific N -nitrosamines (TSNAs). Previous studies of microbial communities in tobacco products lacked chemistry data (e.g. nicotine, TSNAs) to characterize the products and identify associations between carcinogen levels and taxonomic groups. This study uses statistical analysis to identify potential associations between microbial and chemical constituents in moist snuff products. Methods We quantitatively analyzed 38 smokeless tobacco products for TSNAs using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and nicotine using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Moisture content determinations (by weight loss on drying), and pH measurements were also performed. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial composition, and additionally measured total 16S bacterial counts using a quantitative PCR assay. Results Our findings link chemical constituents to their associated bacterial populations. We found core taxonomic groups often varied between manufacturers. When manufacturer and flavor were controlled for as confounding variables, the genus Lactobacillus was found to be positively associated with TSNAs. while the genera Enteractinococcus and Brevibacterium were negatively associated. Three genera ( Corynebacterium , Brachybacterium , and Xanthomonas ) were found to be negatively associated with nicotine concentrations. Associations were also investigated separately for products from each manufacturer. Products from one manufacturer had a positive association between TSNAs and bacteria in the genus Marinilactibacillus . Additionally, we found that TSNA levels in many products were lower compared with previously published chemical surveys. Finally, we observed consistent results when either relative or absolute abundance data were analyzed, while results from analyses of log-ratio-transformed abundances were divergent."

https://openalex.org/W4225402543,"The Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion to individuals with adults under 138 percent of the federal poverty level led to insurance coverage for millions of Americans in participating states. This study investigates Medicaid expansion’s potential spillover participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly the Food Stamp Program). In addition to providing public insurance, the policy connects individuals to SNAP, affecting social determinants of health such as hunger. We use difference-in-differences regression to estimate the effect of the Medicaid expansion on SNAP participation among approximately 414,000 individuals from across the United States. The Current Population Survey is used to answer the main research question, and the SNAP Quality Control Database allows for supplemental analyses. Medicaid expansion produces a 2.9 percentage point increase (p = 0.002) in SNAP participation among individuals under 138 percent of federal poverty. Subgroup analyses find a larger 5.0 percentage point increase (p = 0.002) in households under 75 percent of federal poverty without children. Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) are a category of individuals with limited access to SNAP. Although they are a subset of adults without children, we found no spillover effect for ABAWDs. We find an increase in SNAP households with $0 income, supporting the finding that spillover was strongest for very-low-income individuals. Joint processing of Medicaid and SNAP applications helps facilitate the connection between Medicaid expansion and SNAP. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that Medicaid expansion does more than improve access to health care by connecting eligible individuals to supports like SNAP. SNAP recipients have increased access to food, an important social determinant of health. Our study supports reducing administrative burdens to help connect individuals to safety net programs. Finally, we note that ABAWDs are a vulnerable group that need targeted program outreach."
https://openalex.org/W4225415225,"Background Bed occupancy in the ICU is a major constraint to in-patient care during COVID-19 pandemic. Diagnoses of acute respiratory infection (ARI) by general practitioners have not previously been investigated as an early warning indicator of ICU occupancy. Methods A population-based central health care system registry in the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain, was used to analyze all diagnoses of ARI related to COVID-19 established by general practitioners and the number of occupied ICU beds in all hospitals from Catalonia between March 26, 2020 and January 20, 2021. The primary outcome was the cross-correlation between the series of COVID-19-related ARI cases and ICU bed occupancy taking into account the effect of bank holidays and weekends. Recalculations were later implemented until March 27, 2022. Findings Weekly average incidence of ARI diagnoses increased from 252.7 per 100,000 in August, 2020 to 496.5 in October, 2020 (294.2 in November, 2020), while the average number of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19-infected patients rose from 1.7 per 100,000 to 3.5 in the same period (6.9 in November, 2020). The incidence of ARI detected in the primary care setting anticipated hospital occupancy of ICUs, with a maximum correlation of 17.3 days in advance (95% confidence interval 15.9 to 18.9). Interpretation COVID-19-related ARI cases may be a novel warning sign of ICU occupancy with a delay of over two weeks, a latency window period for establishing restrictions on social contacts and mobility to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19. Monitoring ARI cases would enable immediate adoption of measures to prevent ICU saturation in future waves."
https://openalex.org/W4229035385,"The Simple Shoulder Test (SST) is a simple and short patient-reported outcome measuring functional limitations of the affected shoulder in patients with shoulder dysfunction. Although it is widely used in different clinical cultures, literature review to date revealed that the SST has not been yet translated nor validated in the Arabic language.To translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Arabic version of the Simple Shoulder Test (SST).A forward-backward translation method was adopted. One hundred and forty-one patients with shoulder pain were recruited for psychometric analysis based on the inclusion criteria. The test-retest reliability of the Arabic SST (ASST), pain, disability and total scores were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The construct validity of the ASST was tested by Spearman rank coefficients through comparing the Arabic SST scores to the severity of shoulder pain measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Arabic version of the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Internal consistency was assessed by the Cronbach's alpha.One hundred and forty participants (60 males and 80 females) with a mean (Standard Deviation) age of 39.3 (4.9) years participated in the study. The ICCs for score of ASST were reported high; pain 0.84 (0.78-0.93), disability 0.96 (0.93-0.97) and total score 0.95 (0.91-0.97). Similarly, the Cronbach α values for the ASST scores were also of high values with regards to pain (0.89), disability (0.94), and total score (0.97) respectively. Comparing the scores between the first and the second use of the ASST revealed no statistically significant mean differences of -1.9 (95% CI-3.61 to 0.17).The Arabic-translated version of the SST showed high reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity based on substantial correlations of the ASST with Arabic SPADI and VAS. We recommend the Arabic version of the SST for the evaluation of Arabic-speaking patients with shoulder dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4229048400,"A 180-day experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of density on sex differentiation, sexual dimorphism, cortisol level, and stress related gene expression. Yellow perch, Perca flavescens, with initial mean body weight of 0.03 ± 0.001 g were reared in three different stocking densities: 1, 2, and 4 fish/L, termed as low (LD), moderate (MD), and high (HD) density, respectively, in a flow-through tank system. Results showed no significant differences in sex ratio in all density groups compared to normal population 1:1, and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) appeared when male and female were as small as the mean size reaching 11.5 cm and 12.3 cm in total length (TL) or 13.2g and 16.9g in body weight (BW), respectively. This female-biased sexual growth dimorphism was more pronounced in LD, although it was observed across all density groups. A significantly higher condition factor (K) of females than males in the LD group, and significantly higher R values of LD and MD than HD with the length/weight (L/W) linear relationships in females, were observed. Parallelly, fish reared in LD showed significantly higher mean body weight than those in the MD and HD groups, but there were no significant differences between the MD and HD. Similar results were also observed in all the other parameters of weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), condition factor (K), and survival. These findings suggested that high density not only affected growth itself, but also affected SSD, growth trajectory or body shape, and general wellbeing in fish, especially in females. There were no significant differences in gonadosomatic index (GSI) and viscerosomatic index (VSI) among all the density groups; however, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) of LD was significantly higher than MD and HD, suggesting high density affected liver reserves or functions. Physiologically, plasma cortisol level was significantly highest in the LD among all groups, followed by MD, and lowest in HD. At the molecular level, the expression of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes involved in cellular stress were significantly upregulated in the HD group. The most significantly downregulated expression of these genes was consistently observed in the MD when compared to the LD and HD groups. In conclusion, increasing density induced chronic stress in yellow perch without affecting sex differentiation, but negatively affected expression of stress-related genes and mobilization of liver reserve, resulting in poorer wellbeing and reduced SSD, growth, and survival."
https://openalex.org/W4229067959,"Context During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were imposed on visits in hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada in an effort to reduce the risk of viral exposure by minimizing face-to-face contact in order to protect patients, visitors and staff. These measures led to social isolation for patients. In order to reduce this isolation, CHUM (the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, a teaching hospital) shifted from in-person visits to courtesy telephone calls delivered by volunteers from CHUM’s Volunteers, Recreation and Leisure Department. Objectives To study: (1) the contribution made by these calls to reducing isolation and their limitations, (2) how the calls can be improved, and (3) whether they should be maintained, based on the views of patients and volunteers. Methodology This study examined two populations. The first one consisted of 189 adult patients hospitalized at CHUM who received a courtesy phone call from a volunteer and the second one consisted of the 25 CHUM volunteers who made these calls. Quantitative data were collected from patients and volunteers through questionnaires and a Smartsheet. The patient questionnaire evaluated isolation, the courtesy phone calls, the relationship of trust with the volunteer and sociodemographic questions. The volunteer questionnaire evaluated the appropriateness of the technology for the intervention, the support and training received, the impacts of the courtesy phone call on both the patients and the volunteers, an experience report and sociodemographic information. In addition, a focus group was held with 7 volunteers. Then the verbatim were transcribed and analyzed using QDA miner software. Results From April 27, 2020 to September 5, 2020 more than 11,800 calls were made, mainly concerning hospitalization conditions or home follow-ups (n = 83), and relationships with relatives, friends, and family (n = 79). For 73.6% of hospitalized patients, the courtesy calls from volunteers were a good response to their needs, and 72% of volunteers agreed. 64.5% of patients felt less isolated and 40% of volunteers felt useful. Conclusion Our data suggest that patients felt less isolated during their hospitalization because of the courtesy calls made by the volunteers, that smartphones could also be used for video calls and, finally, that maintaining this type of service seems as relevant after as during a pandemic to provide social interactions to people isolated for medical reasons."
https://openalex.org/W4229070892,"Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks are used as biomaterials for next-generation sequencing of cancer panels. Cross-contamination is detected in approximately 5% of the DNA extracted from FFPE samples, which reduces the detection rate of genetic abnormalities. There are no effective methods available for processing FFPE blocks that prevent cells from mixing with other specimens. The present study evaluated 897 sheets that could potentially prevent cell transmission but allow for the movement of various solvents used in FFPE blocks. According to the International Organization for Standardization and Japanese Industrial Standards, six requirements were established for the screening of packing sheets: 1) filter opening ≤5 μm, 2) thickness ≤100 μm, 3) chemical resistance, 4) permeability ≥1.0 × 10 −3 cm/s, 5) water retention rate &lt;200%, and 6) cell transit test (≤2 cells/10 high-power fields). Polyamide, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene/polyethylene composite sheets met all criteria. A pocket, which was designed to wrap the tissue uniformly, was made of these sheets and was found to effectively block the entry of all cell types during FFPE block processing. Using a sheet pocket, no single cell from the cell pellet could pass through the outer layer. The presence or absence of the sheet pocket did not affect hematoxylin and eosin staining. When processing FFPE blocks as a biomaterial for next-generation sequencing, the sheet pocket was effective in preventing cross-contamination. This technology will in part support the precise translation of histopathological data into genome sequencing data in general pathology laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W4229082968,"Damage from infestations of Lymantria dispar L. in oak-dominated stands and southern pine beetle ( Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann) in pine-dominated stands have far exceeded impacts of other disturbances in forests of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain over the last two decades. We used forest census data collected in undisturbed and insect-impacted stands combined with eddy covariance measurements made pre- and post-disturbance in oak-, mixed and pine-dominated stands to quantify how these infestations altered forest composition, structure and carbon dynamics in the Pinelands National Reserve of southern New Jersey. In oak-dominated stands, multi-year defoliation during L . dispar infestations resulted in &gt; 40% mortality of oak trees and the release of pine saplings and understory vegetation, while tree mortality was minimal in mixed and pine-dominated stands. In pine-dominated stands, southern pine beetle infestations resulted in &gt; 85% mortality of pine trees but had minimal effect on oaks in upland stands or other hardwoods in lowland stands, and only rarely infested pines in hardwood-dominated stands. Because insect-driven disturbances are both delaying and accelerating succession in stands dominated by a single genus but having less effect in mixed-composition stands, long-term disturbance dynamics are favoring the formation and persistence of uneven age oak-pine mixedwood stands. Changes in forest composition may have little impact on forest productivity and evapotranspiration; although seasonal patterns differ, with highest daily rates of net ecosystem production (NEP) during the growing season occurring in an oak-dominated stand and lowest in a pine-dominated stand, integrated annual rates of NEP are similar among oak-, mixed and pine-dominated stands. Our research documents the formation of mixedwood stands as a consequence of insect infestations in the mid-Atlantic region and suggests that managing for mixedwood stands could reduce damage to forest products and provide greater continuity in ecosystem functioning."
