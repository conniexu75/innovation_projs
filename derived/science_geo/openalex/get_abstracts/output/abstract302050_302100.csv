https://openalex.org/W1990484481,"The Trustees of the Carnegie Institution, founded at the City of Washington by the munificence of the well-known philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie, at their annual meeting in December, 1903, took the necessary steps to establish what is now to be known as the ”Department of International Research in Terrestrial Magnetism.“ An allotment of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) was made, with the expectation that, if the proposed work should be successfully organized, a similar sum would be granted annually for the period requisite to carry out successfully the plan submitted by the writer and published in Year Book No. 2 of the Carnegie Institution.

The Executive Committee at its meeting in February, 1904, considered the organization of this Department, and it was decided to ask the writer to be the Director of the Department, his function to be the planning and directing of the proposed work. This trust he has accepted. Arrangements have been made so that the direction of the magnetic survey and the magnetic observatories of the United States, under the Coast and Geodetic Survey, remains likewise in his charge."
