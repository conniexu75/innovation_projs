https://openalex.org/W4210572996,"The biosynthesis of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has thus far been examined in neurons where it is expressed at very low levels, in an activity-dependent fashion. In humans, BDNF has long been known to accumulate in circulating platelets, at levels far higher than in the brain. During the process of blood coagulation, BDNF is released from platelets, which has led to its extensive use as a readily accessible biomarker, under the assumption that serum levels may somehow reflect brain levels. To identify the cellular origin of BDNF in platelets, we established primary cultures of megakaryocytes, the progenitors of platelets, and we found that human and rat megakaryocytes express the BDNF gene. Surprisingly, the pattern of mRNA transcripts is similar to neurons. In the presence of thapsigargin and external calcium, the levels of the mRNA species leading to efficient BDNF translation rapidly increase. Under these conditions, pro-BDNF, the obligatory precursor of biologically active BDNF, becomes readily detectable. Megakaryocytes store BDNF in α-granules, with more than 80% of them also containing platelet factor 4. By contrast, BDNF is undetectable in mouse megakaryocytes, in line with the absence of BDNF in mouse serum. These findings suggest that alterations of BDNF levels in human serum as reported in studies dealing with depression or physical exercise may primarily reflect changes occurring in megakaryocytes and platelets, including the ability of the latter to retain and release BDNF.

The functional relevance of BDNF in humans is firmly established following the discovery of polymorphisms and loss-of-allele mutations associated with deficits ranging from subtle memory alterations (3.Egan M.F. Kojima M. Callicott J.H. Goldberg T.E. Kolachana B.S. Bertolino A. Zaitsev E. Gold B. Goldman D. Dean M. Lu B. Weinberger D.R.

The cDNA sequence of BDNF predicts that like other cystine-knot proteins, BDNF is first synthesized as a precursor protein, referred to as pro-BDNF ensuring the proper formation of disulfide bridges and of a biologically active, mature neurotrophin (5.Leibrock J. Lottspeich F. Hohn A. Hofer M. Hengerer B. Masiakowski P. Thoenen H. Barde Y.A.

Numerous experiments with various artificial expression systems have confirmed this view, in line with the results of early experiments with nerve growth factor (7.Suter U. Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. Two conserved domains in the NGF propeptide are necessary and sufficient for the biosynthesis of correctly processed and biologically active NGF.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). So far, only a very small number of studies have been performed addressing the question of the biosynthesis, storage, and secretion of endogenous BDNF (8.Matsumoto T. Rauskolb S. Polack M. Klose J. Kolbeck R. Korte M. Barde Y.A. Biosynthesis and processing of endogenous BDNF: CNS neurons store and secrete BDNF, not pro-BDNF.Nat.

Neuronal release of proBDNF.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As a result of the scarcity of the protein in neurons, most studies used instead overexpression paradigms, leading to uncertainties as to whether the processing of pro-BDNF takes place within neurons or also in the extracellular space following the secretion of pro-BDNF. Human platelets contain between 100–1,000-fold more BDNF than brain tissue when brain and platelets are compared on a protein basis (10.Yamamoto H. Gurney M.E.

As it appears unlikely that the biosynthesis of BDNF takes place in platelets, we established primary cultures of megakaryocytes (Mks), the progenitors of platelets. Beyond questions related to the biosynthesis of endogenous BDNF and to the productive expression of its gene in non-neuronal cells, the question of the origin of BDNF in human blood and serum is of wider interest. Indeed, BDNF levels in human serum are widely used as a biomarker speculated to somehow reflect brain levels. Thus, countless studies have reported decreased BDNF levels in serum in mood disorders, including depression (13.Munkholm K. Vinberg M. Kessing L.V. Peripheral blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor in bipolar disorder: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.Mol. Psychiatry. 2016; 21: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although by contrast physical exercise has been found to increase them (14.Szuhany K.L. Bugatti M. Otto M.W.

For recombinant proteins, BDNF produced in Escherichia coli was from Amgen/Regeneron partners (Tarrytown, NY). Cleavage-resistant mouse pro-BDNF and the BDNF pro-peptide were produced in COS-7 cells transfected with the corresponding cDNA (15.Dieni S. Matsumoto T. Dekkers M. Rauskolb S. Ionescu M.S. Deogracias R. Gundelfinger E.D. Kojima M. Nestel S. Frotscher M. Barde Y.A. BDNF and its pro-peptide are stored in presynaptic dense core vesicles in brain neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Stem cell factor and thrombopoietin (TPO) were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Interleukin-1β (IL1-β) was from Miltenyi Biotec (Bisley, Surrey, UK). Human recombinant fibrinogen was from EMD-Millipore (Calbiochem; Darmstadt, Germany). The mouse monoclonal anti-BDNF 3C11 was from Icosagen (Tartu, Estonia). BDNF antibodies directed against mature BDNF recognize the mouse, rat, and human protein with equal affinity as the corresponding amino acid sequence is identical. The mouse monoclonal anti-pro-BDNF H100G was from GeneCopoeia Inc. (Rockville, MD). The monoclonal anti-BDNF#9 was used as described (15.Dieni S. Matsumoto T. Dekkers M. Rauskolb S. Ionescu M.S. Deogracias R. Gundelfinger E.D. Kojima M. Nestel S. Frotscher M. Barde Y.A. BDNF and its pro-peptide are stored in presynaptic dense core vesicles in brain neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The chicken anti-β-actin Ab13822, the rabbit anti-platelet factor (PF4) Ab129183, and the goat anti-chicken HRP-conjugated secondary antibody Ab97135 were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The donkey anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). Alexa Fluor-488 donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor-594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and phalloidin-TRITC were purchased from Invitrogen. Hanks' balanced salt solution, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, HEPES, fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Cellgro SCGM medium was from Cellgenic (Freiburg, Germany). All other reagents, including thapsigargin and ionomycin, were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK). Approximately 10-week-old CD1 or C57BL/6 mice and Wistar rats were sacrificed by rising CO2 inhalation and blood subsequently drawn by cardiac puncture using acid citric dextrose-B tubes (BD Vacutainer, BD; Plymouth, UK). Femurs and tibias of CD1 or C57BL/6 mice and Wistar rats were removed, and bone marrow was extracted by flushing the bones with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.38% sodium citrate, 1 mm adenosine, 2 mm theophylline, and 5% heat-inactivated FBS. After lysis of the red cells, the suspension was passed through a 40-μm strainer, and the pellet was resuspended in culture medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) containing 25 ng/ml stem cell factor and TPO. After 6–7 days of culture in vitro, mature Mks were purified on a 1.5–3% bovine serum albumin gradient and cultured in Cellgro SCGM medium for up to 16 h. Hippocampi and lungs were dissected and kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Human samples, both neonatal cord blood and adult peripheral blood, were obtained after securing informed consent following a protocol approved by the National Research Ethics Service. CD34-positive cells (≥98%) were isolated by magnetic cell sorting, cultured for 10 days in Cellgro SCGM medium containing TPO and IL1-β, and analyzed by flow cytometry with 70–90% CD41a+ and 20–60% CD42a+ cells representing committed progenitors and mature Mks, respectively. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained from either animal or human samples by centrifugation of acid citric dextrose-B tubes at 200 × g for 20 min in the presence of prostaglandin-E1 (1 μm) and apyrase (1 unit/ml) to prevent cellular activation. Platelets were pelleted from platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at 1,100 × g for 10 min and lysed immediately. Platelets and Mks were lysed for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture mix, 10 μm 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate, 10 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After sonication (1 pulse, 50% amplitude), insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. Proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gradient gels containing SDS (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the semi-dry Trans-Blot unit (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK). To allow the detection of the BDNF pro-peptide (15.Dieni S. Matsumoto T. Dekkers M. Rauskolb S. Ionescu M.S. Deogracias R. Gundelfinger E.D. Kojima M. Nestel S. Frotscher M. Barde Y.A. BDNF and its pro-peptide are stored in presynaptic dense core vesicles in brain neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the membranes were fixed after transfer with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated for 2 h with blocking solution (3% blocking reagent (Invitrogen) and 3% BSA in TBS-T) and then probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-BDNF 3C11 (1:2,000), anti-pro-BDNF H1001G (1:1,000), or chicken anti-β-actin (1:2,000). Binding of primary antibodies was visualized with donkey anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) or goat anti-chicken HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000). Chemiluminescence was developed using the Lumi Glo Reverse Western blotting substrate (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Care was taken in all experiments to ensure that the signal was well within the linear range, and densitometry was carried out using ImageJ software. BDNF sandwich ELISA was performed using a combination of monoclonal antibodies as described previously (16.Kolbeck R. Bartke I. Eberle W. Barde Y.A. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the nervous system of wild-type and neurotrophin gene mutant mice.J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1930-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Streptavidin high binding capacity coated white plates (Pierce) were incubated overnight at room temperature with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-BDNF antibody 1 conjugated with biotin (Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotinylation kit EZ-Link, Pierce) in coating buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.2). Following an overnight incubation, the plates were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (washing buffer) and then blocked for 2 h with 4% BSA in PBS. To each well 150 μl of incubation buffer (0.1 m KH2PO4, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.6) were added, followed by 50 μl of sample or BDNF standard. Mk lysates or recombinant BDNF were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-BDNF antibody 9 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (activated peroxidase kit, EZ-Link Plus, Pierce). Mk lysates were used at 1:3 in 0.1% Triton X-100 PBS (PBT). To test for a potential release of BDNF from Mks into their incubation medium, purified Mks were cultured on a 24-well plate and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2, in CellGro SCGM medium containing 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-BDNF antibody 9. The standard curve was established in a parallel plate using various concentrations of recombinant BDNF incubated for 2 days in the same culture medium without cells. The limit of detection is 1.25 pg of BDNF per well. After 2 days, the corresponding media (Mks and standard curve) were collected and incubated for 3 h on a rotating platform followed by a rinse with washing buffer. BM chemiluminescence ELISA substrate POD (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was added, and luminescence was measured with a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG labtech). Both standards and samples were determined in triplicate. Mks were cultured on 200 μg/ml human fibrinogen-coated coverslips for 6 h (mouse and rat Mks) or 36 h (human MKs), fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Mks were then blocked with blocking solution (10% donkey serum in PBT) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution at the following final concentrations/dilutions: 1:500 rabbit anti-PF4 and 10 μg/ml mouse anti-BDNF antibody 9. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, coverslips were washed three times with PBT and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibodies used at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution or phalloidin/TRITC (at 1:50 dilution in blocking solution). After further washing with PBT, labeled coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with DAPI-containing mounting medium. Images were acquired at ×63 magnification using a confocal microscope (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss). Co-localization coefficient between BDNF and PF4 was determined using the Zeiss co-localization coefficient software (ZEN black 2011), which utilizes the Manders overlap coefficient equation to quantify overlapping pixels. At least 15 cells per sample were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted from animal tissue (dissected hippocampi or lungs) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and cells (mouse, rat, and human MKs) using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, including a DNase treatment. Human RNA samples from hippocampus or lung were obtained from Clontech. cDNA was prepared from 1,250 ng of total RNA using random hexamers (Promega) and SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). To analyze expression of mouse, rat, and human BDNF exon-specific transcripts, cDNA was amplified with 35–40 cycles of PCR using an annealing temperature of 57–60 °C for all primer combinations (primers listed in Table 1). Real time quantitative PCR was performed on the StepOne system (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen) using TaqMan probes and primers for mouse, rat, and human BDNF exon-specific transcripts or BDNF coding sequence along with the housekeeping genes GAPDH and rRNA18S (Applied Biosystem, Invitrogen, primers listed in Table 2). To compare the expression levels of the BDNF mRNA coding sequence between species, SYBR® master mix (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen) was used together with the corresponding primers (Table 2). Relative BDNF gene expression levels were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method and the housekeeping genes for normalization. The expression of proprotein convertases in rat Mks was analyzed using primers as described previously (17.Kwok S.C. Chakraborty D. Soares M.J. Dai G. Relative expression of proprotein convertases in rat ovaries during pregnancy.J.

All statistical tests were paired t test, one-tailed. To determine whether BDNF can be detected in Mks, we established primary cultures of mouse, rat, and human Mks and analyzed their content by Western blotting using a BDNF monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing BDNF and not NGF or NT4, under conditions where both are recognized by their corresponding antibodies (data not shown). A strong signal corresponding to the expected size of the monomer of mature BDNF was detected in both rat and human but not in mouse Mks (Fig. 1A). Note that pro-BDNF is barely detectable under these conditions, with only a faint band detected in human Mks. As a control, we also analyzed the BDNF content of platelets purified from the corresponding species and confirmed the presence of considerable amounts of BDNF in human platelets, with substantial levels also detected in rat but not in mouse platelets (Fig. 1B). This result with platelets is in agreement with previous conclusions using immunoassay determinations with the serum prepared from these three species (18.Radka S.F. Holst P.A. Fritsche M. Altar C.A. Presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain and human and rat but not mouse serum detected by a sensitive and specific immunoassay.Brain Res. 1996; 709: 122-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We then explored whether BDNF would be localized in α-granules, the storage compartment of a number of growth factors in the Mk lineage. A BDNF-specific signal was found to extensively co-localize with PF4, also designated CXCl4, one of the most abundant α-granule proteins (Fig. 1C). A distinct BDNF signal could also be seen in the tips of the proplatelet-forming human Mks (Fig. 1D, arrows), consistent with the notion that BDNF is transferred from Mks to platelets. As a control for the specificity of the BDNF signal in these immunostaining experiments, we used mouse Mks. When incubated with the corresponding antibodies under the same experimental conditions as rat and human Mks, PF4, but not BDNF, was detected (Fig. 1C). The lack of any detectable BDNF in mouse platelets is not a feature specific to CD1 mouse strain that we used in most of our experiments, as the C57BL/6 strain led to identically negative results, both in Mks and platelets. We note that in a recent highly sensitive and quantitative proteomic analysis of C57BL/6 platelet extracts, no BDNF could be detected (19.Zeiler M. Moser M. Mann M. Copy number analysis of the murine platelet proteome spanning the complete abundance range.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13: 3435-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Quantification of the BDNF levels in rat Mks by ELISA indicated that their lysates contain 1.40 ± 0.13 ng/mg protein (mean ± S.E., n = 6). We also attempted to determine whether proplatelet-forming Mks release BDNF into the medium by incubating the cells with HRP-conjugated BDNF monoclonal antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). After 2 days of incubation with the BDNF capture antibody, we failed to detect any release of BDNF into the Mk-conditioned medium, suggesting that the bulk of BDNF is transferred into platelets and not released into the medium. This result is consistent with the previous work indicating that both in rats and humans the levels of BDNF are far higher in serum than in plasma, suggesting that the bulk of BDNF in serum results from platelet degranulation (18.Radka S.F. Holst P.A. Fritsche M. Altar C.A. Presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain and human and rat but not mouse serum detected by a sensitive and specific immunoassay.Brain Res. 1996; 709: 122-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To determine whether the BDNF biosynthetic machinery is expressed in Mks, we isolated RNA from mature platelet-forming mouse, rat, and human Mks. Significant levels of BDNF mRNAs were detected in both rat and in human cells (Fig. 2A). In four separate experiments, the total mRNA levels in both species were found to be about 200-fold higher in rat and human, compared with mouse Mks. All known BDNF transcripts present in RNA extracted from Mks of the three species were analyzed and compared with RNA extracted from the hippocampus and the lung as neuronal and non-neuronal reference tissues of the corresponding species (Fig. 2A). The results of these experiments revealed a neuronal pattern of mRNA expression in both rat and human Mks, with a prominent inclusion of exon I and IV transcripts. Notably, exon I-containing transcripts have recently been shown to markedly increase Bdnf mRNA translatability (20.Koppel I. Tuvikene J. Lekk I. Timmusk T. Efficient use of a translation start codon in BDNF exon I.J. Neurochem. 2015; 134: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By contrast, these typical neuronal transcripts were undetectable in the mouse (Fig. 2A). The levels of all main transcripts were also assessed in the three species by real time PCR (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Transcriptional analysis of BDNF in mouse, rat, and human megakaryocytes. Conventional (A) and real time quantitative (B) PCR using exon-specific primers with RNA extracted from mature cultured Mks, adult hippocampus (Hippo), and lung are shown. Note that in the mouse, the neuron-specific transcripts, including exon I and IV, are not detected and that by contrast the transcript pattern resembles the non-neuronal pattern observed in lung tissue. The converse is the case with RNA extracted from rat and human Mks with transcript patterns, including exon I and IV, that are characteristic of a neuronal pattern as illustrated with the hippocampus. Unless indicated as non-significant (n.s.), all values are mean values ± S.E. in triplicates and based on three independent experiments, at p < 0.001 (paired t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In neurons, increased levels of cytoplasmic calcium have long been known to activate Bdnf transcription by activating promoters I and IV in particular (21.West A.E.

As Mks are devoid of voltage-activated calcium channels, the addition of thapsigargin to non-electrically excitable cells such as Mks offered an opportunity to test whether the corresponding Bdnf promoters are also responsive to calcium levels in Mks. Thapsigargin is a selective inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, secondarily leading to the opening of stored-operated calcium channels at the cell surface and increased levels of cytoplasmic calcium (22.Cheng K.T. Ong H.L. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. Contribution of TRPC1 and Orai1 to Ca2+ entry activated by store depletion.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2011; 704: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We found that at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3A), thapsigargin massively activates transcription in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). This increase was primarily accounted for by contributions from exons I, IV, and IXa and to a lesser extent exon VI (Fig. 3C). We then tested whether complexing extracellular calcium would decrease the thapsigargin-induced transcriptional activation of Bdnf and found that 2.5 mm EGTA completely blocked the inductive effects of thapsigargin as assessed both by primers corresponding to the protein coding sequence or by exon-specific primers (Fig. 3C). To further test the notion that intracellular calcium levels regulate Bdnf transcription, we tested the effects of the calcium ionophore ionomycin. When added to mature Mk cultures for 4 h, it increased the levels of Bdnf mRNA by 10.50 ± 1.85-fold (n = 3, mean ± S.E.). As still very little is known about the biosynthesis of endogenous BDNF in any cell type, we were then curious to see how the Mk translation"

Here, we report that exosomes are able to modify the radiation response of the head and neck cancer cell lines BHY and FaDu. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium of irradiated as well as non-irradiated head and neck cancer cells by serial centrifugation. Quantification using NanoSight technology indicated an increased exosome release from irradiated compared to non-irradiated cells 24 hours after treatment. To test whether the released exosomes influence the radiation response of other cells the exosomes were transferred to non-irradiated and irradiated recipient cells. We found an enhanced uptake of exosomes isolated from both irradiated and non-irradiated cells by irradiated recipient cells compared to non-irradiated recipient cells. Functional analyses by exosome transfer indicated that all exosomes (from non-irradiated and irradiated donor cells) increase the proliferation of non-irradiated recipient cells and the survival of irradiated recipient cells. The survival-promoting effects are more pronounced when exosomes isolated from irradiated compared to non-irradiated donor cells are transferred. A possible mechanism for the increased survival after irradiation could be the increase in DNA double-strand break repair monitored at 6, 8 and 10 h after the transfer of exosomes isolated from irradiated cells. This is abrogated by the destabilization of the exosomes. Our results demonstrate that radiation influences both the abundance and action of exosomes on recipient cells. Exosomes transmit prosurvival effects by promoting the proliferation and radioresistance of head and neck cancer cells. Taken together, this study indicates a functional role of exosomes in the response of tumor cells to radiation exposure within a therapeutic dose range and encourages that exosomes are useful objects of study for a better understanding of tumor radiation response."
https://openalex.org/W2307663672,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an underestimated, yet important risk factor for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Even after initial total recovery of renal function, some patients develop progressive and persistent deterioration of renal function and these patients are more likely to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Animal models are indispensable for unravelling the mechanisms underlying this progression towards CKD and ESRD and for the development of new therapeutic strategies in its prevention or treatment. Ischemia (i.e. hypoperfusion after surgery, bleeding, dehydration, shock, or sepsis) is a major aetiology in human AKI, yet unilateral ischemia-reperfusion is a rarely used animal model for research on CKD and fibrosis. Here, we demonstrate in C57Bl/6J mice, by both histology and gene expression, that unilateral ischemia-reperfusion without contralateral nephrectomy is a very robust model to study the progression from acute renal injury to long-term tubulo-interstitial fibrosis, i.e. the histopathological hallmark of CKD. Furthermore, we report that the extent of renal fibrosis, in terms of Col I, TGFβ, CCN2 and CCN3 expression and collagen I immunostaining, increases with increasing body temperature during ischemia and ischemia-time. Thus, varying these two main determinants of ischemic injury allows tuning the extent of the long-term fibrotic outcome in this model. Finally, in order to cover the whole practical finesse of ischemia-reperfusion and allow model and data transfer, we provide a referenced overview on crucial technical issues (incl. anaesthesia, analgesia, and pre- and post-operative care) with the specific aim of putting starters in the right direction of implementing ischemia in their research and stimulate them, as well as the community, to have a critical view on ischemic literature data."
https://openalex.org/W2308836456,"Red blood cells (RBCs) can be used for vascular delivery of encapsulated or surface-bound drugs and carriers. Coupling to RBC prolongs circulation of nanoparticles (NP, 200 nm spheres, a conventional model of polymeric drug delivery carrier) enabling their transfer to the pulmonary vasculature without provoking overt RBC elimination. However, little is known about more subtle and potentially harmful effects of drugs and drug carriers on RBCs. Here we devised high-throughput in vitro assays to determine the sensitivity of loaded RBCs to osmotic stress and other damaging insults that they may encounter in vivo (e.g. mechanical, oxidative and complement insults). Sensitivity of these tests is inversely proportional to RBC concentration in suspension and our results suggest that mouse RBCs are more sensitive to damaging factors than human RBCs. Loading RBCs by NP at 1:50 ratio did not affect RBCs, while 10–50 fold higher NP load accentuated RBC damage by mechanical, osmotic and oxidative stress. This extensive loading of RBC by NP also leads to RBCs agglutination in buffer; however, addition of albumin diminished this effect. These results provide a template for analyses of the effects of diverse cargoes loaded on carrier RBCs and indicate that: i) RBCs can tolerate carriage of NP at doses providing loading of millions of nanoparticles per microliter of blood; ii) tests using protein-free buffers and mouse RBCs may overestimate adversity that may be encountered in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2310328221,"Although the mechanisms linking cardiopulmonary diseases to ambient fine particles (PM2.5) are still unclear, inflammation and oxidative stress play important roles in PM2.5-induced injury. It is well known that inflammation and oxidative stress could be restricted by vitamin E (Ve) or omega-3 fatty acids (Ω-3 FA) consumption. This study investigated the effects of Ve and Ω-3 FA on PM2.5-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells. The underlying mechanisms linking PM2.5 to vascular endothelial injury were also explored. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with 50 μg/mL PM2.5 in the presence or absence of different concentrations of Ve and Ω-3 FA. The inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were determined. The results showed that Ve induced a significant decrease in PM2.5-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde (MDA) in supernatant and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytoplasm decreased by Ve, while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity elevated. The inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) also reduced by Ve. Moreover, Ω-3 FA played the same role on decreasing the inflammation and oxidative stress. IL-6 and TNF-α expressions were significantly lower in combined Ve with Ω-3 FA than treatment with Ve or Ω-3 FA alone. The Ve and Ω-3 FA intervention might abolish the PM2.5-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in vascular endothelial cells. There might be an additive effect of these two nutrients in mediating the PM2.5-induced injury in vascular endothelial cells. The results suggested that inflammation and oxidative stress might be parts of the mechanisms linking PM2.5 to vascular endothelial injury."

In this work, we characterized the secondary structure of Arabidopsis group 4 LEA proteins. We found that they are disordered in aqueous solution, with high intrinsic potential to fold into α-helix. We demonstrate that complete dehydration is not required for these proteins to sample ordered structures because milder water deficit and macromolecular crowding induce high α-helix levels in vitro, suggesting that prevalent conditions under water deficit modulate their conformation. We also show that the N-terminal region, conserved across all group 4 LEA proteins, is necessary and sufficient for conformational transitions and that their protective function is confined to this region, suggesting that folding into α-helix is required for chaperone-like activity under water limitation.

https://openalex.org/W2303309988,"Emotion-regulation strategies are understood to influence food intake. This study examined the neurophysiological underpinnings of negative emotion processing and emotion regulation in individuals with excess weight compared to normal-weight controls. Fifteen participants with excess-weight (body mass index >25) and sixteen normal-weight controls (body mass index 18–25) performed an emotion-regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were exposed to 24 negative affective or neutral pictures that they were instructed to Observe (neutral pictures), Maintain (sustain the emotion elicited by negative pictures) or Regulate (down-regulate the emotion provoked by negative pictures through previously trained reappraisal techniques). When instructed to regulate negative emotions by means of cognitive reappraisal, participants with excess weight displayed persistently heightened activation in the right anterior insula. Decreased responsivity was also found in right anterior insula, the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during negative emotion experience in participants with excess weight. Psycho-physiological interaction analyses showed that excess-weight participants had decreased negative functional coupling between the right anterior insula and the right dlPFC, and the bilateral dmPFC during cognitive reappraisal. Our findings support contentions that excess weight is linked to an abnormal pattern of neural activation and connectivity during the experience and regulation of negative emotions, with the insula playing a key role in these alterations. We posit that ineffective regulation of emotional states contributes to the acquisition and preservation of excess weight."
https://openalex.org/W2307436788,"Upon activation, platelets release plasma membrane-derived microparticles (PMPs) exposing phosphatidylserine on their surface. The functions and clearance mechanism of these microparticles are incompletely understood. As they are pro-coagulant and potentially pro-inflammatory, rapid clearance from the circulation is essential for prevention of thrombotic diseases. The tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAMs) and their ligands protein S and Gas6 are involved in the uptake of phosphatidylserine-exposing apoptotic cells in macrophages and dendritic cells. Both TAMs and their ligands are expressed in the vasculature, the functional significance of which is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how vascular TAMs and their ligands may mediate endothelial uptake of PMPs. PMPs, generated from purified human platelets, were isolated by ultracentrifugation and labeled with biotin or PKH67. The uptake of labeled microparticles in the presence of protein S and Gas6 in human aortic endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was monitored by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and confocal/electron microscopy. We found that both endothelial cell types can phagocytose PMPs, and by using TAM-blocking antibodies or siRNA knockdown of individual TAMs, we show that the uptake is mediated by endothelial Axl and Gas6. As circulating PMP levels were not altered in Gas6(-/-) mice compared with Gas6(+/+) mice, we hypothesize that the Gas6-mediated uptake is not a means to clear the bulk of circulating PMPs but may serve to locally phagocytose PMPs generated at sites of platelet activation and as a way to effect endothelial responses."
https://openalex.org/W2307216193,"The stabilization of slopes by vegetation has been a topical issue for many years. Root mechanical characteristics significantly influence soil reinforcement; therefore it is necessary to research into the indicators of root tensile properties. In this study, we explored the influence of root moisture content on tensile resistance and strength with different root diameters and for different tree species. Betula platyphylla, Quercus mongolica, Pinus tabulaeformis, and Larix gmelinii, the most popular tree species used for slope stabilization in the rocky mountainous areas of northern China, were used in this study. A tensile test was conducted after root samples were grouped by diameter and moisture content. The results showedthat:1) root moisture content had a significant influence on tensile properties; 2) slightly loss of root moisture content could enhance tensile strength, but too much loss of water resulted in weaker capacity for root elongation, and consequently reduced tensile strength; 3) root diameter had a strong positive correlation with tensile resistance; and4) the roots of Betula platyphylla had the best tensile properties when both diameter and moisture content being controlled. These findings improve our understanding of root tensile properties with root size and moisture, and could be useful for slope stabilization using vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2312719028,"The dynamical process of epidemic spreading has drawn much attention of the complex network community. In the network paradigm, diseases spread from one person to another through the social ties amongst the population. There are a variety of factors that govern the processes of disease spreading on the networks. A common but not negligible factor is people’s reaction to the outbreak of epidemics. Such reaction can be related information dissemination or self-protection. In this work, we explore the interactions between disease spreading and population response in terms of information diffusion and individuals’ alertness. We model the system by mapping multiplex networks into two-layer networks and incorporating individuals’ risk awareness, on the assumption that their response to the disease spreading depends on the size of the community they belong to. By comparing the final incidence of diseases in multiplex networks, we find that there is considerable mitigation of diseases spreading for full phase of spreading speed when individuals’ protection responses are introduced. Interestingly, the degree of community overlap between the two layers is found to be critical factor that affects the final incidence. We also analyze the consequences of the epidemic incidence in communities with different sizes and the impacts of community overlap between two layers. Specifically, as the diseases information makes individuals alert and take measures to prevent the diseases, the effective protection is more striking in small community. These phenomena can be explained by the multiplexity of the networked system and the competition between two spreading processes."

Elevated levels of aldosterone activate Akt, and, in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), correlate with pulmonary arteriole thickening, which suggests that mTORC1 regulation by aldosterone may mediate adverse pulmonary vascular remodeling. We hypothesized that aldosterone-Raptor signaling induces abnormal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) survival patterns to promote PAH. Remodeled pulmonary arterioles from SU-5416/hypoxia-PAH rats and monocrotaline-PAH rats with hyperaldosteronism expressed increased levels of the Raptor target, p70S6K, which provided a basis for investigating aldosterone-Raptor signaling in human PASMCs. Aldosterone (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) increased Akt/mTOR/Raptor to activate p70S6K and increase proliferation, viability, and apoptosis resistance in PASMCs. In PASMCs transfected with Raptor-small interfering RNA or treated with spironolactone/eplerenone, aldosterone or pulmonary arterial plasma from patients with PAH failed to increase p70S6K activation or to induce cell survival in vitro Optimal inhibition of pulmonary arteriole Raptor was achieved by treatment with Staramine-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol that was formulated with Raptor-small interfering RNA plus spironolactone in vivo, which decreased arteriole muscularization and pulmonary hypertension in 2 experimental animal models of PAH in vivo Up-regulation of mTORC1 by aldosterone is a critical pathobiologic mechanism that controls PASMC survival to promote hypertrophic vascular remodeling and PAH.-Aghamohammadzadeh, R., Zhang, Y.-Y., Stephens, T.

Under strong species sorting during colonisation and later by the restrictive environmental filter, traits that are not adaptive in subterranean habitats may be filtered out. We tested whether cave communities were assembled by the restrictive regime propitiated by permanent darkness or by competitive exclusion due to resource scarcity. When compared to surface communities, the restrictive subterranean regime would lead to lower functional diversity and phenotypic clustering inside the caves, and the opposite should be expected in the case of competitive exclusion. Using isopods (Oniscidea) as model taxa, we measured several niche descriptors of taxa from surface and cave habitats, used a multivariate measure of functional diversity, and compared their widths. We found phenotypic overdispersion and higher functional diversity in cave taxa when compared to surface taxa. On the one hand, the dry climate outside of caves hampered the survival of several taxa and their ecological strategies, not viable under severe desiccation risk, culminating in the clustering of functional traits. In contrast, this restriction does not occur inside of caves, where isopods find favourable conditions under lower predation pressures and more amenable environmental parameters that allow occupation and subsequent diversification. Our results showed that, at least for some taxa, caves may not be such a harsh environment as previously thought. The high functional diversity we found inside caves adds an additional reason for the conservation of these sensitive environments."
https://openalex.org/W2320492669,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an important mediator of pulmonary fibrosis. In blood and multiple tumor types, autotaxin produces LPA from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) via lysophospholipase D activity, but alternative enzymatic pathways also exist for LPA production. We examined the role of autotaxin (ATX) in pulmonary LPA production during fibrogenesis in a bleomycin mouse model. We found that bleomycin injury increases the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid levels of ATX protein 17-fold. However, the LPA and LPC species that increase in BAL of bleomycin-injured mice were discordant, inconsistent with a substrate-product relationship between LPC and LPA in pulmonary fibrosis. LPA species with longer chain polyunsaturated acyl groups predominated in BAL fluid after bleomycin injury, with 22:5 and 22:6 species accounting for 55 and 16% of the total, whereas the predominant BAL LPC species contained shorter chain, saturated acyl groups, with 16:0 and 18:0 species accounting for 56 and 14% of the total. Further, administration of the potent ATX inhibitor PAT-048 to bleomycin-challenged mice markedly decreased ATX activity systemically and in the lung, without effect on pulmonary LPA or fibrosis. Therefore, alternative ATX-independent pathways are likely responsible for local generation of LPA in the injured lung. These pathways will require identification to therapeutically target LPA production in pulmonary fibrosis.—Black, K. E., Berdyshev, E., Bain, G., Castelino, F. V., Shea, B. S., Probst, C.

One possible reason is that many studies failed to consider and properly adjust the factor of surgical experience in the context. We conducted this study to clarify the role of surgical experience on MIOR and associated outcome. 538 consecutive intracranial aneurysm surgeries performed on 501 patients were enrolled in this study. Various potential predictors of MIOR were evaluated with stratified analysis and multivariate logistic regression. The impact of surgical experience and MIOR on outcome was further studied in a logistic regression model with adjustment of each other. The outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale one year after the surgery. Surgical experience and preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were identified as independent predictors of MIOR. Experienced neurovascular surgeons encountered fewer cases of MIOR compared to novice neurosurgeons (MIOR, 18/225, 8.0% vs. 50/313, 16.0%, P = 0.009). Inexperience and MIOR were both associated with a worse outcome. Compared to experienced neurovascular surgeons, inexperienced neurosurgeons had a 1.90-fold risk of poor outcome. On the other hand, MIOR resulted in a 3.21-fold risk of unfavorable outcome compared to those without it. Those MIOR cases managed by experienced neurovascular surgeons had a better prognosis compared with those managed by inexperienced neurosurgeons (poor outcome, 4/18, 22% vs. 30/50, 60%, P = 0.013)."

Most existing methods are unable to incorporate information about the underlying physical environment, leading to poor performance in excluding areas that are not used. Using radio-telemetry data from sea otters, we developed and evaluated a new algorithm for estimating home ranges (hereafter Permissible Home Range Estimation, or ""PHRE"") that reflects habitat suitability. We began by transforming sighting locations into relevant landscape features (for sea otters, coastal position and distance from shore). Then, we generated a bivariate kernel probability density function in landscape space and back-transformed this to geographic space in order to define a permissible home range. Compared to two commonly used home range estimation methods, kernel densities and local convex hulls, PHRE better excluded unused areas and required a smaller sample size. Our PHRE method is applicable to species whose ranges are restricted by complex physical boundaries or environmental gradients and will improve understanding of habitat-use requirements and, ultimately, aid in conservation efforts."

Activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway has been demonstrated to confer protection against environmental insults and prevent disease or inhibit the progression of diseases related to oxidative stress. In an attempt to identify novel improved Nrf2 inducers for systemic protection against tissue damage by environmental insults, we identified artemisitene as a novel Nrf2 activator using antioxidant responsive element luciferase assay in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further studies suggest that artemisitene activates Nrf2 by decreasing Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its stability. In Nrf2 wild-type mice, systemic administration of artemisitene strongly inhibits bleomycin-induced lung damage. Artemisitene represents a novel class of Nrf2 inducer, and artemisitene-based therapeutic approach targeting Nrf2 may also provide antioxidant protection for humans against tissue damage by toxic chemicals.-Chen, W., Li, S., Li, J., Zhou, W., Wu, S., Xu, S., Cui, K., Zhang, D.

Under this scenario, chemical cues from the host habitat (not related to the host) represent poor indicators of host location. Hence, it is unlikely that naïve females show a strong response to host habitat cues, which would become important only if the parasitoids learn to associate such cues to the host presence. This concept does not consider that habitats can vary in profitability or host nutritional quality, which according to the optimal foraging theory and the preference-performance hypothesis (respectively) could shape the way in which parasitoids make use of chemical cues from the host habitat. We assessed innate preference in the fruit fly parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata among chemical cues from four host habitats (apple, fig, orange and peach) using a Y-tube olfactometer. Contrary to what was predicted, we found a hierarchic pattern of preference. The parasitism rate realized on these fruit species and the weight of the host correlates positively, to some extent, with the preference pattern, whereas preference did not correlate with survival and fecundity of the progeny. As expected for a parasitoid foraging for generalist hosts, habitat preference changed markedly depending on their previous experience and the abundance of hosts. These findings suggest that the pattern of preference for host habitats is attributable to differences in encounter rate and host quality. Host habitat preference seems to be, however, quite plastic and easily modified according to the information obtained during foraging."

Here, we investigate lymphatic growth dynamics and marker expression in atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. The prolymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGF-C, was elevated in atherosclerotic aortic walls. Despite increased VEGF-C, we found that adventitial lymphatics regress during the course of formation of atherosclerosis (P < 0.01). Similar to lymphatic regression, the number of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1+) macrophages decreased in the aortic adventitia of apoE-/- mice with atherosclerosis (P < 0.01). Intimai lymphatics in the atherosclerotic lesions exhibited an atypical phenotype, with the expression of podoplanin and VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) but not of LYVE-1 and prospero homeobox protein 1. In the aortas of atherosclerotic animals, we found markedly increased soluble VEGFR-2. We hypothesized that the elevated soluble VEGFR-2 that was found in the aortas of apoE-/- mice with atherosclerosis binds to and diminishes the activity of VEGF-C. This trapping mechanism explains, despite increased VEGF-C in the atherosclerotic aortas, how adventitial lymphatics regress. Lymphatic regression impedes the drainage of lipids, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and immune cells. Insufficient lymphatic drainage could thus exacerbate atherosclerosis formation. Our study contributes new insights to previously unknown dynamic changes of adventitial lymphatics.

To pursue this aim, two approaches were applied in nine rfMRI networks: First, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1) was assessed for the mean functional connectivity maps across the entire network and a region of interest (ROI). Second, the ratio of overlap between Z-thresholded connectivity maps for each network was assessed. We quantified between-session functional reproducibility of rfMRI for 20 patients with stable MS and 14 healthy controls (HC). Nine rfMRI networks (RSNs) were examined at baseline and after 3 months of follow-up: three visual RSNs, the default-mode network, sensorimotor-, auditory-, executive control, and the left and right fronto-parietal RSN. ROI analyses were constrained to thresholded overlap masks for each individual (Z>0) at baseline and follow-up.In both stable MS and HC mean functional connectivity across the entire network did not reach acceptable ICCs for several networks (ICC<0.40) but we found a high reproducibility of ROI ICCs and of the ratio of overlap. ROI ICCs of all nine networks were between 0.98 and 0.99 for HC and ranged from 0.88 to 0.99 in patients with MS, respectively. The ratio of overlap for all networks was similar for both groups, ranging from 0.60 to 0.75.Our findings attest to a high reproducibility of rfMRI networks not only in HC but also in patients with stable MS when applying ROI analysis. This supports the utility of rfMRI to monitor functional changes related to disease progression or therapeutic interventions in MS."

This felid is thought to exist at low population densities throughout its range, yet no estimates of its abundance exist, hampering assessment of its conservation status. To investigate the distribution and abundance of marbled cats we conducted intensive, felid-focused camera trap surveys of eight forest areas and two oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Study sites were broadly representative of the range of habitat types and the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance and fragmentation present in contemporary Sabah. We recorded marbled cats from all forest study areas apart from a small, relatively isolated forest patch, although photographic detection frequency varied greatly between areas. No marbled cats were recorded within the plantations, but a single individual was recorded walking along the forest/plantation boundary. We collected sufficient numbers of marbled cat photographic captures at three study areas to permit density estimation based on spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses. Estimates of population density from the primary, lowland Danum Valley Conservation Area and primary upland, Tawau Hills Park, were 19.57 (SD: 8.36) and 7.10 (SD: 1.90) individuals per 100 km2, respectively, and the selectively logged, lowland Tabin Wildlife Reserve yielded an estimated density of 10.45 (SD: 3.38) individuals per 100 km2. The low detection frequencies recorded in our other survey sites and from published studies elsewhere in its range, and the absence of previous density estimates for this felid suggest that our density estimates may be from the higher end of their abundance spectrum. We provide recommendations for future marbled cat survey approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2304547156,"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and its signaling have been identified in several human cancers, and increased levels of its expression appear to correlate with disease progression and metastasis. However, the role of SHH in bone destruction associated with oral squamous cell carcinomas is still unclear. In this study we analyzed SHH expression and the role played by SHH signaling in gingival carcinoma-induced jawbone destruction. From an analysis of surgically resected lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma mandible samples, we found that SHH was highly expressed in tumor cells that had invaded the bone matrix. On the other hand, the hedgehog receptor Patched and the signaling molecule Gli-2 were highly expressed in the osteoclasts and the progenitor cells. SHH stimulated osteoclast formation and pit formation in the presence of the receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in CD11b+ mouse bone marrow cells. SHH upregulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, NFATc1, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and Cathepsin K expression in RAW264.7 cells. Our results suggest that tumor-derived SHH stimulated the osteoclast formation and bone resorption in the tumor jawbone microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2306527509,"Conformational and functional flexibility promote protein evolvability. High evolvability allows related proteins to functionally diverge and perhaps to neostructuralize. p53 is a multifunctional protein frequently referred to as the Guardian of the Genome-a hub for e.g. incoming and outgoing signals in apoptosis and DNA repair. p53 has been found to be structurally disordered, an extreme form of conformational flexibility. Here, p53, and its paralogs p63 and p73, were studied for further insights into the evolutionary dynamics of structural disorder, secondary structure, and phosphorylation. This study is focused on the post gene duplication phase for the p53 family in vertebrates, but also visits the origin of the protein family and the early domain loss and gain events. Functional divergence, measured by rapid evolutionary dynamics of protein domains, structural properties, and phosphorylation propensity, is inferred across vertebrate p53 proteins, in p63 and p73 from fish, and between the three paralogs. In particular, structurally disordered regions are redistributed among paralogs, but within clades redistribution of structural disorder also appears to be an ongoing process. Despite its deemed importance as the Guardian of the Genome, p53 is indeed a protein with high evolvability as seen not only in rearranged structural disorder, but also in fluctuating domain sequence signatures among lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2309916821,"New nonnucleoside analogs are being developed as part of a multi-drug regimen to treat hepatitis C viral infections. Particularly promising are inhibitors that bind to the surface of the thumb domain of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B). Numerous crystal structures have been solved showing small molecule non-nucleoside inhibitors bound to the hepatitis C viral polymerase, but these structures alone do not define the mechanism of inhibition. Our prior kinetic analysis showed that nonnucleoside inhibitors binding to thumb site-2 (NNI2) do not block initiation or elongation of RNA synthesis; rather, they block the transition from the initiation to elongation, which is thought to proceed with significant structural rearrangement of the enzyme-RNA complex. Here we have mapped the effect of three NNI2 inhibitors on the conformational dynamics of the enzyme using hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics. All three inhibitors rigidify an extensive allosteric network extending >40 Å from the binding site, thus providing a structural rationale for the observed disruption of the transition from distributive initiation to processive elongation. The two more potent inhibitors also suppress slow cooperative unfolding in the fingers extension-thumb interface and primer grip, which may contribute their stronger inhibition. These results establish that NNI2 inhibitors act through long range allosteric effects, reveal important conformational changes underlying normal polymerase function, and point the way to the design of more effective allosteric inhibitors that exploit this new information."
https://openalex.org/W2310065104,"Dynamical malaria models can relate precipitation to the availability of vector breeding sites using simple models of surface hydrology. Here, a revised scheme is developed for the VECTRI malaria model, which is evaluated alongside the default scheme using a two year simulation by HYDREMATS, a 10 metre resolution, village-scale model that explicitly simulates individual ponds. Despite the simplicity of the two VECTRI surface hydrology parametrization schemes, they can reproduce the sub-seasonal evolution of fractional water coverage. Calibration of the model parameters is required to simulate the mean pond fraction correctly. The default VECTRI model tended to overestimate water fraction in periods subject to light rainfall events and underestimate it during periods of intense rainfall. This systematic error was improved in the revised scheme by including the a parametrization for surface run-off, such that light rainfall below the initial abstraction threshold does not contribute to ponds. After calibration of the pond model, the VECTRI model was able to simulate vector densities that compared well to the detailed agent based model contained in HYDREMATS without further parameter adjustment. Substituting local rain-gauge data with satellite-retrieved precipitation gave a reasonable approximation, raising the prospects for regional malaria simulations even in data sparse regions. However, further improvements could be made if a method can be derived to calibrate the key hydrology parameters of the pond model in each grid cell location, possibly also incorporating slope and soil texture."

This dataset was applied to determine lake surface areas in Mongolia. A total of 73 lakes greater than 6.25 km2in area were selected, and 28 of these lakes were used to evaluate detection errors. The minimum composite NDVI showed a better detection performance on lake water pixels than did the official MODIS 16-day 250 m NDVI based on a maximum composite method. The overall lake area detection performance based on the 15-day minimum composite NDVI showed -2.5% error relative to the Landsat-derived lake area for the 28 evaluated lakes. The errors increased with increases in the perimeter-to-area ratio but decreased with lake size over 10 km(2). The lake area decreased by -9.3% at an annual rate of -53.7 km(2) yr(-1) during 2000 to 2011 for the 73 lakes. However, considerable spatial variations, such as slight-to-moderate lake area reductions in semi-arid regions and rapid lake area reductions in arid regions, were also detected. This study demonstrated applicability of MODIS 250 m reflectance data for biweekly monitoring of lake area change and diagnosed considerable lake area reduction and its spatial variability in arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia. Future studies are required for explaining reasons of lake area changes and their spatial variability."

https://openalex.org/W2309549964,"Background There is a scarcity of data on the association of sexual violence and women's subsequent obstetric outcomes. Our aim was to investigate whether women exposed to sexual violence as teenagers (12–19 years of age) or adults present with different obstetric outcomes than women with no record of such violence. Methods We linked detailed prospectively collected information on women attending a Rape Trauma Service (RTS) to the Icelandic Medical Birth Registry (IBR). Women who attended the RTS in 1993–2010 and delivered (on average 5.8 years later) at least one singleton infant in Iceland through 2012 formed our exposed cohort (n = 1068). For each exposed woman's delivery, nine deliveries by women with no RTS attendance were randomly selected from the IBR (n = 9126) matched on age, parity, and year and season of delivery. Information on smoking and Body mass index (BMI) was available for a sub-sample (n = 792 exposed and n = 1416 non-exposed women). Poisson regression models were used to estimate Relative Risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Compared with non-exposed women, exposed women presented with increased risks of maternal distress during labor and delivery (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01–2.79), prolonged first stage of labor (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03–1.88), antepartum bleeding (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.22–3.07) and emergency instrumental delivery (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00–1.34). Slightly higher risks were seen for women assaulted as teenagers. Overall, we did not observe differences between the groups regarding the risk of elective cesarean section (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61–1.21), except for a reduced risk among those assaulted as teenagers (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34–0.93). Adjusting for maternal smoking and BMI in a sub-sample did not substantially affect point estimates. Conclusion Our prospective data suggest that women with a history of sexual assault, particularly as teenagers, are at increased risks of some adverse obstetric outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2307048283,"Adipose tissue expansion occurs through a combination of hypertrophy of existing adipocytes and generation of new adipocytes via the process of hyperplasia, which involves the proliferation and subsequent differentiation of preadipocytes. Deficiencies in hyperplasia contribute to adipose tissue dysfunction and the association of obesity with chronic cardiometabolic diseases. Thus, increased understanding of hyperplastic pathways may be expected to afford novel therapeutic strategies. We have reported that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 promotes proliferation and differentiation of human preadipocytes and recently demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) is a central, proximal effector. Herein, we describe the identification and characterization of carboxypeptidase X (CPX)-1, a secreted collagen-binding glycoprotein, as a novel downstream effector in human primary and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome preadipocytes. CPX-1 expression increased after treatment of preadipocytes with FGF-1, BAMBI knockdown, or induction of differentiation. CPX-1 knockdown compromised preadipocyte differentiation coincident with reduced collagen expression. Furthermore, preadipocytes differentiated on matrix derived from CPX-1 knockdown cells exhibited reduced Glut4 expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Finally, CPX-1 expression was increased in adipose tissue from obese mice and humans. Collectively, these findings establish CPX-1 as a positive regulator of adipogenesis situated downstream of FGF-1/BAMBI that may contribute to hyperplastic adipose tissue expansion via affecting extracellular matrix remodeling.— Kim, Y.-H., Barclay, J.

https://openalex.org/W2307487874,"Moths use their sense of smell to find food sources, mating partners and oviposition sites. For this they possess a family of odorant receptors (ORs). Some ORs are used by both sexes whereas others have sex-specific roles. For example, male moths possess ORs specifically tuned to sex pheromones produced by conspecific females. Here we identify sets of ORs from the antennae of New Zealand endemic leafroller moths Planotortrix octo (48 ORs) and P. excessana (47 ORs) using an RNA-Seq approach. Two orthologous ORs show male-biased expression in the adult antennae of both species (OR7 and OR30) and one other OR in each species was female-biased in its expression (PoctOR25, PexcOR14) by qPCR. PAML analysis conducted on male-biased ORs indicated positive selection acting on the male-biased OR7. The fact that OR7 is likely under positive selection, that it is male-biased in its expression and that its orthologue in C. obliquana, CoblOR7, responds to sex pheromone components also utilised by Planotortrix species, suggests that this receptor may also be important in sex pheromone reception in Planotortrix species."

Despite increasing deforestation, the Caribbean region of Nicaragua plays an important role in the survival or extinction of large mammal populations in Central America given that it still retains core areas of habitat for large mammal species. The proposed interoceanic canal project that would bisect the southern half of this Caribbean region represents a new threat that, combined with an advancing agricultural frontier, could affect populations of large mammal species such as jaguars, white-lipped peccaries, and Baird's tapirs. We used occupancy models to examine the relative occupancy probabilities for an assemblage of terrestrial mammals in the south Caribbean region of Nicaragua to identify current core areas for our study species and conduct a preliminary evaluation of the potential impacts of the proposed interoceanic canal. We modeled a community level distribution of eight species with varying levels of sensitivity to human encroachment and a range of habitat associations. Our model results reveal three priority areas for terrestrial mammal conservation in our study area. The mapped predictions show that the only remaining area of suitable habitat for large mammals in the path of the proposed interoceanic canal is a relatively thin strip of forest that runs along the Caribbean Coast. In light of these findings, we propose five recommendations that will help ensure the conservation of this area of the proposed canal route as suitable habitat for our study species."

However, chronic activation of NK cells can induce a hyporesponsive state. The molecular basis of the mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of this hyporesponsive condition are unknown, thus an easy and reproducible mechanism able to induce hyporesponsiveness on human NK cells would be very useful to gain understanding of this process. Human NK cells treated with ionomycin lose their ability to degranulate and secrete IFN-γ in response to a variety of stimuli, but IL-2 stimulation can compensate these defects. Apart from reductions in the expression of CD11a/CD18, no great changes were observed in the activating and inhibitory receptors expressed by these NK cells, however their transcriptional signature is different to that described for other hyporesponsive lymphocytes."

BDD and non-clinical, yet high-BIC participants have demonstrated a local visual processing bias, characterised by reduced inversion effects. To examine whether this bias is a potential marker of BDD, the visual processing of individuals across the entire BIC continuum was examined. Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ; quantified BIC) scores were expected to correlate with higher discrimination accuracy and faster reaction times of inverted stimuli, indicating reduced inversion effects (occurring due to increased local visual processing). Additionally, an induced global or local processing bias via Navon stimulus presentation was expected to alter these associations. Seventy-four participants completed the DCQ and upright-inverted face and body stimulus discrimination task. Moderate positive associations were revealed between DCQ scores and accuracy rates for inverted face and body stimuli, indicating a graded local bias accompanying increases in BIC. This relationship supports a local processing bias as a marker for BDD, which has significant assessment implications. Furthermore, a moderate negative relationship was found between DCQ score and inverted face accuracy after inducing global processing, indicating the processing bias can temporarily be reversed in high BIC individuals. Navon stimuli were successfully able to alter the visual processing of individuals across the BIC continuum, which has important implications for treating BDD."

Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F12 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5 μm dexamethasone, and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin). Transfection of FXYD5 and silencing of FXYD4 were previously described (9Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H.

H1299 cells (human non small cell lung carcinoma) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin). Silencing of endogenous FXYD5 in H1299 cells was previously described (19Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. Modulation of cell polarization by the Na+-K+-ATPase-associated protein FXYD5 (dysadherin).Am.

Cells were grown until confluent in 12-well plates and allowed to continue proliferation for an additional 4 days to allow polarization of the epithelial layer. The medium was replaced by 0.5 ml of full medium ± LPS, TNFα, and other reagents. After an additional 24-h incubation, medium was removed, and aliquots were assayed for secreted CCL2 using either mouse or human MCP-1 ELISA Kit (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated from cultured cells using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed from the poly(A)+ tail using a Super-Script II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were set up using the Power SYBR Green PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were normalized to the abundance of GAPDH mRNA.

In brief: confluent monolayers were surface biotinylated by a 10-min incubation at 4 °C with 1.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce cat. no. 21331) in PBS without calcium or magnesium. The unbound biotin was quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS, and cells were lysed by rocking for 1 h at 4 °C in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, and 20 mg/ml pepstatin A), unless stated otherwise. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, 2–10% of the volume was taken as “total protein” sample, and the rest (∼700 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl streptavidin agarose resin slurry (Pierce cat. no. 20353). The agarose beads were then washed, and streptavidin-bound proteins were eluted by incubation with SDS sample buffer (cell surface fraction). Total and cell surface proteins were resolved electrophoretically on 7.5% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Bio Rad cat no. 161-0171) and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Bio Rad cat. no. 170-4157) 8–10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All experiments were approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of PBS or LPS (6 mg/kg in 50 μl of PBS) as described (20Wang H.L. Akinci I.O. Baker C.M. Urich D. Bellmeyer A. Jain M. Chandel N.S.

BAL was performed through a 20-gauge angiocath ligated into the trachea via tracheostomy. 1 ml of PBS was slowly instilled into the lungs and then carefully aspirated three times (23Mutlu G.M.

Ambient particulate matter accelerates coagulation via an IL-6-dependent pathway.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2952-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). BAL was centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm to remove cells and used to determine cytokines. Mouse CCL2 and TNFα were determined using ELISA kits from Thermo Scientific and eBiosciences, respectively. The assay was done by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). 12-well plates of parental and M1+FXYD5 cells were transfected with a total of 1.8 μg/well of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-LUC promoter-reporter plasmid, together with 360 ng/well of pRL-TK (Renilla) plasmid, using JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids were obtained from the Forchheimer Plasmid Collection of the Weizmann Institute. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h and lysed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured by a Modulus Microplate Luminometer (Promega). Confluent M1 WT and M1+FXYD5 cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with LPS-FITC (1 μg/ml) in growth medium. Pre-incubated cells were washed with PBS, and then 100 nm LPS was added for another 30 min. The cells were recorded by confocal microscopy (Olympus) with 5-min intervals. The binding of LPS-FITC to M1 cells was analyzed by ImageJ. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., and significance was calculated by one way ANOVA + Dunnetts's multiple comparisons test using Kaleidagraph version 4.1. Our laboratory has studied the effects of FXYD5 in the M1 model epithelium (9Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. FXYD5 (dysadherin) regulates the paracellular permeability in cultured kidney collecting duct cells.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2011; 301: F1270-F1F80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. Modulation of cell polarization by the Na+-K+-ATPase-associated protein FXYD5 (dysadherin).Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 306: C1080-C1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). M1 cells originate from the FXYD5-expressing mouse kidney collecting duct, but the isolated cell line lacks FXYD5. Transfecting them with FXYD5 cDNA (M1+FXYD5) results in its association with the Na,K-ATPase and evokes effects of FXYD5 on cell-cell contact, cytoskeletal organization, and cell adhesion and polarization (9Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. FXYD5 (dysadherin) regulates the paracellular permeability in cultured kidney collecting duct cells.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2011; 301: F1270-F1F80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. Modulation of cell polarization by the Na+-K+-ATPase-associated protein FXYD5 (dysadherin).Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 306: C1080-C1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Untreated M1 cells do not secrete a significant amount of CCL2 irrespective of the expression of FXYD5. Such secretion could largely be induced by treating cells with 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h (Fig. 1A). LPS-induced CCL2 secretion was FXYD5- dependent, as M1+FXYD5 cells secreted at least 5-fold more CCL2 than the non-transfected cells. This was also matched by a higher abundance of CCL2 mRNA (Fig. 1B). Previously we have demonstrated that M1 cells constitutively express FXYD4, which is suppressed by the expression of FXYD5 (19Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. Modulation of cell polarization by the Na+-K+-ATPase-associated protein FXYD5 (dysadherin).Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 306: C1080-C1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the above effect is due to FXYD4 down-regulation rather than FXYD5 expression, we have also measured LPS-induced CCL2 secretion in FXYD4 silenced cells. Such silencing does not cause up-regulation of any other FXYD protein (19Lubarski I. Asher C. Garty H. Modulation of cell polarization by the Na+-K+-ATPase-associated protein FXYD5 (dysadherin).Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 306: C1080-C1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1A, inhibiting the expression of FXYD4 in M1 cells does not elevate CCL2 secretion. Fig. 1C summarizes the LPS dose response in M1+FXYD5 cells. Maximal induction of CCL2 in M1+FXYD5 cells is achieved at 100–300 ng/ml, similar to that previously reported (24Anand A.R. Bradley R. Ganju R.K. LPS-induced MCP-1 expression in human microvascular endothelial cells is mediated by the tyrosine kinase, Pyk2 via the p38 MAPK/NF-κB-dependent pathway.Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LPS activation and initiation of pro-inflammatory events occur rapidly after LPS interacts with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (25Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. Toll-like receptor-4 mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced signal transduction.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). As a first step in understanding the differential CCL2 secretion, we analyzed the surface binding of LPS in M1 WT versus M1+FXYD5 cells by measuring the kinetics of competitive LPS binding with FITC-LPS conjugate. The curves observed in Fig. 2A show no variance in FITC-LPS release between both cells lines. Also, no significant changes were observed in TLR4 mRNA (Fig. 2B). The fact that FXYD5 has no effect on LPS-TLR4 interaction suggests that the step affected by this protein is postreceptor binding. LPS activates a broad range of signaling pathways including the NF-κB and MAPK cascades (26Oeckinghaus A. Ghosh S. The NF-κB family of transcription factors and its regulation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a000034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar), and also the PI3K pathway (27Mendes Sdos S. Candi A. Vansteenbrugge M. Pignon M.-R. Bult H. Boudjeltia K.Z. Munaut C. Raes M. Microarray analyses of the effects of NF-κB or PI3K pathway inhibitors on the LPS-induced gene expression profile in RAW264.7 cells: synergistic effects of rapamycin on LPS-induced MMP9-overexpression.Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether FXYD5 regulates the LPS-induced CCL2 secretion by modulating any of these pathways, we pre-incubated M1+FXYD5 cells with QNZ (NF-κB inhibitor), and with Wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor). The results in Fig. 3A demonstrate that while Wortmannin had no effect on CCL2 secretion, QNZ reduces it almost completely, suggesting that CCL2 secretion in M1+FXYD5 is mediated through NF-κB pathway. However, NF-κB was equally induced in WT M1 and M1+FXYD5 cells when assessed by an NF-κB dual luciferase reporter assay, shortly after LPS activation (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that while NF-κB is necessary for the LPS-induced CCL2 secretion, its initial activation is not dependent on the presence of FXYD5. The fact that FXYD5 has no influence on the main LPS stimulatory steps suggests that its differential regulation is on downstream mediators. Closer examination of the kinetics of the LPS-induced increase in CCL2 mRNA indicates that in non-transfected cells LPS evokes a relatively fast increase in mRNA, which peaks at 2 h and then decays back to background level. In M1+FXYD5 cells, on the other hand, the effect builds up slower, but is more sustained (Fig. 4A). The mRNA data are supported by CCL2 protein secretion, as shown in Fig. 4B. While in M1 WT cells, CCL2 accumulates earlier and remains constant, in M1+FXYD5 cells, the secretion occurs later, but remains continuous, as shown by protein accumulation up to 24 h. The above data suggest an additional, FXYD5-dependent activation phase, only in M1+FXYD5 cells. LPS induces a wide range of parallel signaling pathways that can trigger a potential autocrine stimulatory loop or act as feedback inhibitors to control late LPS-responsive genes, and our data suggest that one of those pathways may be regulated by the presence of FXYD5. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine with important roles in control of immune and inflammatory responses as well as cell cycle proliferation and apoptosis (28Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Tumor necrosis factor, other cytokines and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) whose expression is also increased by LPS (29Amiot F. Fitting C. Tracey K.J. Cavaillon J.M. Dautry F. Lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine cascade and lethality in LT α/TNF α-deficient mice.Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 864-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows that the levels of TNFα mRNA are elicited equally by LPS treatment in WT M1 and M1+FXYD5 cells. The above data are matched by secreted protein, detected in growth medium (Fig. 5B). M1 WT and M1+FXYD5 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of TNFα and analyzed for secreted CCL2. The effect of TNFα on CCL2 secretion was only observed in M1+FXYD5, and not in WT M1 cells (Fig. 5C). We then aimed to identify the FXYD5 differentiated step in TNFα mediated CCL2 secretion. TNFα exerts its biological functions via interactions with two distinct receptors, designated TNFR1 and TNFR2 (30Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. The TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies: integrating mammalian biology.Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar). The TNFα effects on NF-κB activation occurs predominantly through TNFR1 (31McFarlane S.M. Pashmi G. Connell M.C. Littlejohn A.F. Tucker S.J. Vandenabeele P. MacEwan D.J. Differential activation of nuclear factor-κB by tumour necrosis factor receptor subtypes. TNFR1 predominates whereas TNFR2 activates transcription poorly.FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the expression pattern of TNFR1 in WT M1 versus M1+FXYD5 cells. Fig. 6A shows that TNFR1 is expressed approximately at the same level in total cell lysates (lower panel); however it is translocated to the plasma membrane only in the presence of FXYD5 (upper panel). In agreement with the results, the levels of TNFR1 mRNA are comparable in WT M1 and M1+FXYD5 (Fig. 6B). To further verify that the FXYD5-induced increase in CCL2 secretion is a result of the second phase activation mediated through TNFα receptor, we blocked the receptor with anti-TNFR1 antibody (E-20) (32Rowlands D.J. Islam M.N. Das S.R. Huertas A. Quadri S.K. Horiuchi K. Inamdar N. Emin M.T. Lindert J. Ten V.S. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya J. Activation of TNFR1 ectodomain shedding by mitochondrial Ca2+ determines the severity of inflammation in mouse lung microvessels.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1986-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6C). WT M1 and M1+FXYD5 cells were pre-incubated either with anti-TNFR1 for 1 h or with diluent, followed by 8 h LPS treatment. In M1+FXYD5 cells, in the presence of the TNFR1 antibody the production of CCL2 was decreased by more than 40%, while in M1 WT cells, in agreement with the absence of the receptor, the addition of the antibody does not significantly modify the secretion of CCL2. The above data are matched by inhibition of CCL2 mRNA, observed 4 h following LPS stimulation (Fig. 6D). The partial reduction of CCL2 secretion could be explained by incomplete inhibition of TNFR1 receptor by the antibody, due to experimental limitation. This was supported by partial activation of the TNFR1 receptor by TNFα in the presence of the same concentration of anti-TNFR1 (Fig. 6E). Nevertheless, the existence of additional pathways that stimulate CCL2 secretion in M1+FXYD5 cannot be completely ruled out. Next, we tested the generality of the above phenomenon by measuring CCL2 secretion in the non-small lung carcinoma H1299 cells, which natively express FXYD5, and in H1299 cells where FXYD5 was silenced by transfection with a specific shRNA. H1299 cells were not responsive to external LPS irrespective of the FXYD5 expression (data not shown). However CCL2 secretion was strongly induced by TNFα, and silencing of FXYD5 al"

https://openalex.org/W2307187289,"Early identification of impending illness during widespread exposure to a pathogenic agent offers a potential means to initiate treatment during a timeframe when it would be most likely to be effective and has the potential to identify novel therapeutic strategies. The latter could be critical, especially as antibiotic resistance is becoming widespread. In order to examine pre-symptomatic illness, African green monkeys were challenged intranasally with aerosolized Yersinia pestis strain CO92 and blood samples were collected in short intervals from 45 m till 42 h post-exposure. Presenting one of the first genomic investigations of a NHP model challenged by pneumonic plague, whole genome analysis was annotated in silico and validated by qPCR assay. Transcriptomic profiles of blood showed early perturbation with the number of differentially expressed genes increasing until 24 h. By then, Y. pestis had paralyzed the host defense, as suggested by the functional analyses. Early activation of the apoptotic networks possibly facilitated the pathogen to overwhelm the defense mechanisms, despite the activation of the pro-inflammatory mechanism, toll-like receptors and microtubules at the port-of-entry. The overexpressed transcripts encoding an early pro-inflammatory response particularly manifested in active lymphocytes and ubiquitin networks were a potential deviation from the rodent models, which needs further verification. In summary, the present study recognized a pattern of Y. pestis pathogenesis potentially more applicable to the human system. Independent validation using the complementary omics approach with comprehensive evaluation of the organs, such as lungs which showed early bacterial infection, is essential."

https://openalex.org/W2311337072,"In this work we investigated the between-colony spatial, behavioural and trophic segregation of two sub-populations of the elusive Macaronesian shearwaters Puffinus baroli breeding only ~340 km apart in Cima Islet (Porto Santo Island) and Selvagem Grande Island. Global location sensing (gls) loggers were used in combination with the trophic ecology of tracked individuals, inferred from the isotopic signatures of wing feathers. Results suggest that these two Macaronesian shearwater sub-populations do segregate during the non-breeding period in some 'sub-population-specific' regions, by responding to different oceanographic characteristics (habitat modelling). Within these disparate areas, both sub-populations behave differently (at-sea activity) and prey on disparate trophic niches (stable isotope analysis). One hypothesis would be that each sub-population have evolved and adapted to feed on particular and 'sub-population-specific' resources, and the segregation observed at the three different levels (spatial, behavioural and trophic) might be in fact a result of such adaptation, from the emergence of 'cultural foraging patterns'. Finally, when comparing to the results of former studies reporting on the spatial, behavioural and trophic choices of Macaronesian shearwater populations breeding on Azores and Canary Islands, we realized the high ecological plasticity of this species inhabiting and foraging over the North-East Atlantic Ocean."

Each snake had multiple granulomas and locally extensive regions of pallor evident in the hypaxial and intercostal musculature along the body. Lesions in two individuals were also associated with vertebral and rib fractures. Histological examination revealed granulomas scattered throughout skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and fractured bone. These were composed of dense aggregates of microsporidian spores surrounded by a mantle of macrophages. Sequences (ssrRNA) were obtained from lesions in three sea snakes and all revealed 99% similarity with Heterosporis anguillarum from the Japanese eel (Anguillarum japonica). However, ultrastructural characteristics of the organism were not consistent with those of previous descriptions. Electron microscopic examination of skeletal muscle revealed large cysts (not xenomas) bound by walls of fibrillar material (Heterosporis-like sporophorocyst walls were not detected). The cysts contained numerous mature microsporidian spores arranged in small clusters, sometimes apparently within sporophorous vesicles. The microspores were monomorphic, oval and measured 2.5–3.0 μm by 1.6–1.8 μm. They contained isofilar polar filaments with 11 (infrequently 9–12) coils arranged in two ranks. This is the first published report of a microsporidian infection in hydrophiid sea snakes. This discovery shows microsporidia with molecular affinities to Heterosporis anguillarum but ultrastructural characters most consistent with the genus Pleistophora (but no hitherto described species). Further studies are required to determine whether the microsporidian presented here belongs to the genus Heterosporis, or to a polymorphic species group as suggested by the recognition of a robust Pleistophora/Heterosporis clade by molecular studies. The gross and histological pathology associated with these infections are described."

However, the relationship between angle of head-tilt and airway patency has not been defined. Our objective was to define an optimal head-tilt position for airway patency in neonates (age: 0–28 days) and young infants (age: 29 days–4 months). We performed a retrospective study of head and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of neonates and infants to define the angle of head-tilt for airway patency. We excluded those with an artificial airway or an airway malformation. We defined head-tilt angle a priori as the angle between occipito-ophisthion line and ophisthion-C7 spinous process line on the sagittal MR images. We evaluated medical records for Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) and exposure to sedation during MRI. We analyzed MRI of head and neck regions of 63 children (53 neonates and 10 young infants). Of these 63 children, 17 had evidence of airway obstruction and 46 had a patent airway on MRI. Also, 16/63 had underlying HIE and 47/63 newborn infants had exposure to sedative medications during MRI. In spontaneously breathing and neurologically depressed newborn infants, the head-tilt angle (median ± SD) associated with patent airway (125.3° ± 11.9°) was significantly different from that of blocked airway (108.2° ± 17.1°) (Mann Whitney U-test, p = 0.0045).

A 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance of the renal arteries was performed before RD and after 6-month. We quantified the vessel sharpness of both renal arteries using a quantitative analysis tool (Soap-Bubble®). In 17 patients we assessed the maximal and minimal cross-sectional area of both arteries, peak velocity, mean flow, and renal artery distensibility. In a subset of patients wall shear stress was assessed with computational flow dynamics. Neither renal artery sharpness nor renal artery distensibility differed significantly. A significant increase in minimal and maximal areas (by 25.3%, p = 0.008, and 24.6%, p = 0.007, respectively), peak velocity (by 16.9%, p = 0.021), and mean flow (by 22.4%, p = 0.007) was observed after RD. Wall shear stress significantly decreased (by 25%, p = 0.029). These effects were observed in blood pressure responders and non-responders. Conclusions RD is not associated with adverse effects at renal artery level, and leads to an increase in cross-sectional areas, velocity and flow and a decrease in wall shear stress."

We additionally consider various factors such as income, age, employment and family structure that are generally considered to affect the decision to choose temporary housing as victims’ solution for their displacement. Empirical results indicate that, ceteris paribus, as the degree of attachment increases, victims are more likely to apply for the temporary housing but attachment does not affect the timing of application. On the other hand, the victims who actively seek information and are able to collect higher quality information are less likely to apply for the temporary housing and if they do apply then they apply relatively later."
https://openalex.org/W2302683678,"Development of reporter systems for in vivo examination of IFN-β induction or signaling of type I interferon (IFN-I) pathways is of great interest in order to characterize biological responses to different inducers such as viral infections. Several reporter mice have been developed to monitor the induction of both pathways in response to different agonists. However, alternative strategies that do not require transgenic mice breeding have to date not been reported. In addition, detection of these pathways in vivo in animal species other than mice has not yet been addressed. Herein we describe a simple method based on the use of an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV8-3xIRF-ISRE-Luc) containing an IFN-β induction and signaling-sensitive promoter sequence controlling the expression of the reporter gene luciferase. This vector is valid for monitoring IFN-I responses in vivo elicited by diverse stimuli in different organs. Intravenous administration of the vector in C57BL/6 mice and Syrian hamsters was able to detect activation of the IFN pathway in the liver upon systemic treatment with different pro-inflammatory agents and infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV). In addition, intranasal instillation of AAV8-3xIRF-ISRE-Luc showed a rapid and transient IFN-I response in the respiratory tract of mice infected with the influenza A/PR8/34 virus lacking the NS1 protein. In comparison, this response was delayed and exacerbated in mice infected with influenza A/PR/8 wild type virus. In conclusion, the AAV8-3xIRF-ISRE-Luc vector offers the possibility of detecting IFN-I activation in response to different stimuli and in different animal models with no need for reporter transgenic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2304848102,"Herd behaviour in financial markets is a recurring phenomenon that exacerbates asset price volatility, and is considered a possible contributor to market fragility. While numerous studies investigate herd behaviour in financial markets, it is often considered without reference to the pricing of financial instruments or other market dynamics. Here, a trader interaction model based upon informational cascades in the presence of information thresholds is used to construct a new model of asset price returns that allows for both quiescent and herd-like regimes. Agent interaction is modelled using a stochastic pulse-coupled network, parametrised by information thresholds and a network coupling probability. Agents may possess either one or two information thresholds that, in each case, determine the number of distinct states an agent may occupy before trading takes place. In the case where agents possess two thresholds (labelled as the finite state-space model, corresponding to agents' accumulating information over a bounded state-space), and where coupling strength is maximal, an asymptotic expression for the cascade-size probability is derived and shown to follow a power law when a critical value of network coupling probability is attained. For a range of model parameters, a mixture of negative binomial distributions is used to approximate the cascade-size distribution. This approximation is subsequently used to express the volatility of model price returns in terms of the model parameter which controls the network coupling probability. In the case where agents possess a single pulse-coupling threshold (labelled as the semi-infinite state-space model corresponding to agents' accumulating information over an unbounded state-space), numerical evidence is presented that demonstrates volatility clustering and long-memory patterns in the volatility of asset returns. Finally, output from the model is compared to both the distribution of historical stock returns and the market price of an equity index option."
https://openalex.org/W2309746768,"Sciatic nerve entrapment can occur as post-operative complication of perineal hernia repair when sacrotuberous ligament is incorporated during hernia deficit closure. This results in sciatic sensory loss and paralysis of the hind leg. This study investigated the spatial relationship of sciatic nerve and sacrotuberous ligament and their surface topographic projection of 68 cadavers (29 Beagles and 39 Taiwanese mongrels) with various heights (25-56 cm). By gross dissection, the sacrotuberous ligament and sciatic nerve were exposed and their distance in between was measured along four parts (A, B, C, D) of sacrotuberous ligament. The present study revealed that the C was the section of sacrotuberous ligament where the sciatic nerve and the sacrotuberous ligament are closest to each other. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between C and height of the dogs. From the present study, we found that the C in smaller dogs has the shortest distance between the sciatic nerve and the sacrotuberous ligament, and thus the most vulnerable to sciatic nerve entrapment, and needs to be avoided or approached cautiously during perineal hernia repair."
https://openalex.org/W2310292731,"The I-domain is a genetic insertion in the phage P22 coat protein that chaperones its folding and stability. Of 11 acidic residues in the I-domain, seven participate in stabilizing electrostatic interactions with basic residues across elements of secondary structure, fastening the β-barrel fold. A hydrogen-bonded salt bridge between Asp-302 and His-305 is particularly interesting as Asp-302 is the site of a temperature-sensitive-folding mutation. The pKa of His-305 is raised to 9.0, indicating the salt bridge stabilizes the I-domain by ∼4 kcal/mol. Consistently, urea denaturation experiments indicate the stability of the WT I-domain decreases by 4 kcal/mol between neutral and basic pH. The mutants D302A and H305A remove the pH dependence of stability. The D302A substitution destabilizes the I-domain by 4 kcal/mol, whereas H305A had smaller effects, on the order of 1–2 kcal/mol. The destabilizing effects of D302A are perpetuated in the full-length coat protein as shown by a higher sensitivity to protease digestion, decreased procapsid assembly rates, and impaired phage production in vivo. By contrast, the mutants have only minor effects on capsid expansion or stability in vitro. The effects of the Asp-302–His-305 salt bridge are thus complex and context-dependent. Substitutions that abolish the salt bridge destabilize coat protein monomers and impair capsid self-assembly, but once capsids are formed the effects of the substitutions are overcome by new quaternary interactions between subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2304925004,"This paper analyzes numerical simulations of the trajectories of magnetic beads in a microchannel, with a nearby permanent cubical magnet, under different flow and magnetic conditions. Analytically derived local fluid velocities and local magnetic forces have been used to track the particles. A centered position and a lateral position of the magnet above the microchannel are considered. The computed fractions of deposited particles on the walls are compared successfully with a new theoretically derived criterion that imposes a relation between the sizes of the magnet and the microchannel and the particle Stokes and Alfvén numbers to obtain the complete deposition of the flowing particles on the wall. In the cases in which all the particles, initially distributed uniformly across the section of the microchannel, are deposited on the walls, the simulations predict the accumulation of the major part of particles on the wall closest to the magnet and near the first half of the streamwise length of the magnet."
https://openalex.org/W2305753184,"Background & Objectives Expertise of registered dietitians (RDs) is important for health guidance but has been poorly evaluated. We evaluated the kind of RD expertise that would improve their skills. Design, Setting, Participants, Measurements This study was a post-hoc analysis of our randomized controlled trial, which compared the weight change between participants using the web-based self-disclosure health support and those using the email health support. Healthy men and women aged 35–64 years with a body mass index (BMI) of > = 24.5 kg/m2 were recruited for this study. We evaluated the relationship of RD expertise indicators including the duration of working as an RD, the experience of health counseling, and membership in the Japan Dietetic Association (JDA) with the weight loss of study participants. The primary endpoint was the change in body weight. Comparison of changes in body weight by the RD expertise indicators was evaluated using analysis of covariance. Results A total of 175 participants were eligible for analyses. Changes in body weight were significantly greater when they were supported by the RDs in the routine counseling group than when supported by the RDs in the non-routine counseling group (-1.8 kg versus -0.4 kg, fully adjusted P = 0.0089). Duration of working as an RD and JDA membership did not significantly affect changes in body weight. Conclusions Among some indices of RD experience, the experience of providing routine experience of health counseling was associated with weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W2305041788,"Expectancy for an upcoming musical chord, harmonic expectancy, is supposedly based on automatic activation of tonal knowledge. Since previous studies implicitly relied on interpretations based on Western music theory, the underlying computational processes involved in harmonic expectancy and how it relates to tonality need further clarification. In particular, short chord sequences which cannot lead to unique keys are difficult to interpret in music theory. In this study, we examined effects of preceding chords on harmonic expectancy from a computational perspective, using stochastic modeling. We conducted a behavioral experiment, in which participants listened to short chord sequences and evaluated the subjective relatedness of the last chord to the preceding ones. Based on these judgments, we built stochastic models of the computational process underlying harmonic expectancy. Following this, we compared the explanatory power of the models. Our results imply that, even when listening to short chord sequences, internally constructed and updated tonal assumptions determine the expectancy of the upcoming chord."
