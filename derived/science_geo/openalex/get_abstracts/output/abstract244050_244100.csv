https://openalex.org/W2094106458,"THE quasi-stellar object identified1 with the radio source 4C 05.34 has been recently observed spectroscopically by us at Kitt Peak National Observatory and has been found to have a redshift of z = 2.877, a value considerably higher than that of any quasi-stellar object reported so far. The largest previous values were z = 2.358 for 4C 25.05 (ref. 2) and, possibly, z = 2.38 for 5C 02.56 (ref. 3)."

https://openalex.org/W1987162808,LARVAE of three species of Renocera in North America and of Knutsonia lineata (Fall√©n) in Europe seem to be the only insects known to kill and feed exclusively on bivalve molluscs. Apparently the only other association known between insects and clams concerns a chironomid fly larva (Glyptotendipes ? paripes Edwards) found between the shell and mantle of a large bivalve (Anodonta cygnea L.) in Yorkshire1.

https://openalex.org/W2067726164,"WHILE not disagreeing with Girdler et al.'s basic premise of thinning and breaking up of the African plate, I cannot see how the increase in age of rift faulting and vulcanicity of the East African rift valleys away from the rift can be compared with the increase in age of islands on the oceanic floor away from mid-oceanic ridges. The latter phenomena can be explained by crustal movement away from the mid-oceanic ridge, which remains the centre of seismic activity, whereas in East Africa there is certainly no corresponding increase in age of rocks away from the rift valleys. Could not the apparent increase in age of seismic activity away from the centres of the rift valleys be explained more simply ?"

Measurements have been made using the 300 m diameter radio telescope at Arecibo at radio frequencies of 73.8, 111.5, 196.5, 318.0 and 606.0 MHz."
