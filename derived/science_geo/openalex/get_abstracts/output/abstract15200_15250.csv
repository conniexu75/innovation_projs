https://openalex.org/W1559899200,"Four proteins active in blood coagulation have long been known to require vitamin K for their proper biosynthesis: factors II, VII, IX, and X. This paper describes the purification of a hitherto unrecognized vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein from bovine plasma. The biosynthesis of this protein is interfered with by the vitamin K antagonist Dicoumarol. The molecular weight of the protein is approximately 56,000 and, like factor X, it has two polypeptide chains. The light chain binds Ca2+. Its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence is homologous to the NH2-terminal sequences of the other vitamin K-dependent proteins and it contains vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. The biological function of this protein is unknown."

It causes the disappearance of a mitotic apparatus or prevents one from forming if added at early stages. Maytansine does not affect formation of the mitotic organizing center but does inhibit in vitro polymerization of tubulin. Maytansine and vincristine inhibit in vitro polymerization of tubulin at about the same concentrations, but vincristine is about 100 times less effective as an inhibitor of cleavage in marine eggs."

https://openalex.org/W1544769636,"Abstract Glycoproteins of the human erythrocyte membrane were labeled with tritiated sodium borohydride after oxidation of terminal galactosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues with galactose oxidase. After separation of the polypeptides on polyacrylamide slab gels, a scintillator was introduced into the gel, and the radioactive proteins were visualed by autoradiography (fluorography). The following results were obtained. (a) The erythrocyte membrane contains at least 20 glycoproteins, many of which are minor components. (b) The carbohydrate of all the labeled glycoproteins is exposed only to the outside, since no additional glycoproteins can be labeled in isolated unsealed ghosts. (c) The membrane contains two major groups of glycoproteins. The first group of proteins contains sialic acids linked to the penultimate galactosyl/N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues, which are efficiently labeled only after pretreatment with neuraminidase. The second group has terminal galactosyl/N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues which can be easily labeled without neuraminidase treatment. The glycoproteins from fetal erythrocytes all belong to the first group, whereas only five glycoproteins of erythrocytes from adults belong. (d) Trypsin cleaves the proteins containing sialic acids, and fragments containing carbohydrate remain tightly bound and exposed in the membrane. (e) Pronase cleaves Band 3 in addition to the sialic acid containing glycoproteins, but most of the glycoproteins still remain unmodified in the membrane. (f) No difference is seen between membrane glycoproteins from cells of different ABH blood groups."

https://openalex.org/W1538807883,"The hypoglycemic agent 3-mercaptopicolinic acid inhibits gluconeogenesis from lactate by isolated, perfused livers from fasted rats and guinea pigs. A 3-mercaptopicolinate concentration of 50 muM caused a sharp decrease in glucose synthesis, with virtually complete inhibition at 100 muM. This inhibitory effect was reversed completely when 3-mercaptopicolinate was removed and the rate of glucose synthesis returned to normal values within 2 min. Oxygen consumption was not altered, even at the highest concentration of inhibitor. Gluconeogenesis from glycerol by guinea pig liver was blocked completely by 100 muM 3-mercaptopicolinate but was inhibited only partially in rat liver. After removal of the inhibitor glucose synthesis returned to levels higher than noted before the addition of this compound. The formation of P-enolpyruvate bu isolated guinea pig liver mitochondria metabolizing alpha-ketoglutarate (State 3) was inhibited markedly by 3-mercaptopicolinate, but malate conversion to P-enolpyruvate was considerably less sensitive. Kinetic studies with purified P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase from rat liver cytosol indicate that 3-mercaptopicolinate is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both oxalacetate and MnGTP2-, and that simulataeous saturation with both substrates does not diminish this inhibition. The inhibitory effects of 3-mercaptopicolinate occur primarily by decreasing the rate of product formation while having relatively minor effects on the apparent Michaelis constants for substrates. Inhibition constants for slope and intercept effects ranged from 3 to 9 muM 3-mercaptopicolinate, and the inhibition patterns were dependent on the concentration of free Mn2+ present. Comparison of the inhibition constants with the observed inhibition of gluconeogenesis in livers perfused with 3-mercaptopicolinate supports the contention that P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is the site of action of this inhibitor. The possibility that 3-mercaptopicolinate inhibition occurs by binding either free or bound manganese was eliminated by determination of the dissociation constant of 0.51 mM for the manganese-3-mercaptopicolinate complex. In addition, no tightly bound, slowly exchanging metal was bound to purified enzyme protein. These results suggest that 3-mercaptopicolinate inhibits by the removal of a tightly bound, rapidly exchanging metal ion other than Mn2+."

https://openalex.org/W1480651372,"Two isozymes of horse liver aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde, NAD oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.1.3)), F1 and F2, have been purified to homogeneity using salt fractionation followed by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The specific activities of the two isozymes in a pH 9.0 system with propionaldehyde as substrate were approximately 0.35 and 1.0 mumol of NADH/min/mg of protein for the F1 and F2 isozymes, respectively. The multiporosity polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular weights of the F1 and F2 isozymes were approximately 230,000 and 240,000 respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave subunit molecular weight estimates of 52,000 and 53,000 for the F1 and F2 isozymes, respectively. The amino acid compositions of the two isozymes were found to be similar; the ionizable amino acid contents being consistent with the electrophoretic and chromatographic behavior of the two isozymes. Both isozymes exhibited a broad aldehyde specificity, oxidizing a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and utilized NAD as coenzyme, but at approximately 300-fold higher coenzyme concentration could use NADP. The F1 isozyme exhibited a very low Km for NAD (3 muM) and a higher Km for acetaldehyde (70 muM), while the F2 isozyme was found to have a higher Km for NAD (30 muM) and a low Km for acetaldehyde (0.2 muM). The two isozymes showed similar chloral hydrate and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibition characteristics, but the F1 isozyme was found to be several orders of magnittude more sensitive to disulfiram, a physiological inhibitor of acetaldehyde oxidation. Based on its disulfiram inhibition characteristics, it has been suggested that the F1 isozyme may be the primary enzyme for oxidizing the acetyldehyde produced during ethanol oxidation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1553720565,"A growing body of evidence implicates epoxide metabolites of mutagenic and carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons as either the only species, or one of the contributing species responsible for these adverse effects. Selective induction of epoxide hydratase(s) catalyzing the transformation of epoxides to electrophilically unreactive dihydrodiols, under conditions not leading to increases in monooxygenase(s) responsible for epoxide formation would, therefore, be of interest. All inducers of rat hepatic epoxide hydratase (determined with [7-3H]styrene oxide as substrate) which have been discovered also induced monooxygenase (determined with benzo(a)pyrene as substrate) suggesting a possible common biosynthetic control of these enzymes. The enzyme levels observed in different sexes and at different stages of the ontogenetic development, possibly dependent on endogenous inducers, strengthened this view. No sex difference is epoxide hydratase activity was observed in young rats (1 to 5 days old) while epoxide hydratase levels were about 3-fold higher in adult males than in females, which was remarkably similar to the behavior of monooxygenase. Moreover, the prenatal development of epoxide hydratase and monooxygenase appeared to be similar--although the low enzyme levels precluded accurate determinations of the latter. Although different types of known monooxygenase inducers all led to epoxide hydratase induction in adult rat liver, their effect of epoxide hydratase and monooxygenase could be dissociated by transplacental treatment. Dissociation was clearest with inducers of the polycyclic hydrocarbon type which led to great induction of monooxygenase while epoxide hydratase remained unchanged. The increases in monooxygenase activity were very different when determined by two methods based on different principles, demonstrating that at least two monooxygenases are involved in oxidative metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene, and that the control of epoxide hydratase is not under common control with either of them."
https://openalex.org/W1519993436,"Several analogues of the biologically active fragment of bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH), based on the sequence of the NH2-terminal 34 amino acids, were prepared by solid phase synthesis and bioassayed in the in vitro adenylyl cyclase assay to provide further information concerning structure-activity relations in parathyroid hormone. In two analogues both methionines of the natural hormone were replaced with the sulfur-free and closely isosteric amino acid norleucine (Nle). The synthetic analogue [Nle-8, Nle-18]bPTH-(1-34) was highly active in the in vitro rat adenylyl cyclase bioassay, thus demonstrating that neither of the methionines, found in the native sequence, is indispensable for biological activity. Tyrosine was substituted for phenylalanine at position 34 in the synthesis of two other hormone analogues, [Try-34]bPTH-(1-34) and [Nle-8,Nle-18,Tyr-34]bPTH-(1-34). Both derivatives were exposed to conventional iodination procedures involving use of the oxidant chloramine T. Although iodination of [Try-34]bPTH-(1-34) resulted in virtually complete loss of biological activity, [Nle-8,Nle-18,Tyr-34]-bPTH-(1-34), which lacks methionine, could be exposed to oxidants and labeled efficiently with iodine with retention of nearly complete biological activity. These findings confirm that the loss of biological activity after oxidation of bPTH, as previously observed with the native hormone, is indeed attributable to the oxidation lability of methionine rather than to any other modifications. This sulfur-free, radioiodinated, biologically active analogue of parathyroid hormone may prove useful in studies of interaction of the hormone with the membrane receptors of target tissues and in studies of the metabolism of parathyroid hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1568690000,"Proteins of Friend leukemia cells induced to form large amounts of hemoglobin by dimethylsulfoxide treatment were compared with proteins from noninduced cells by high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 98% of more than 500 proteins separated by this technique were qualitatively and quantitatively the same in both cell populations. Changes representing more than 50% of the control cell amount were detected in six non-histone chromosomal proteins, two nucleoplasmic proteins, and three cytoplasmic proteins. It is concluded that dimethylsulfoxide induces an extremely specific pattern of erythroid differentiation in these cells, which should be susceptible to detailed analysis. Comparison of protein patterns from Friend leukemia cells and HeLa cells revealed electrophoretic identity of approximately 20% of cytoplasmic proteins and 50% of non-histone chromosomal proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1608252222,"RNA was transcribed from chromatin isolated from chick oviduct and spleen by using RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli. RNA was also transcribed from whole chick DNA using E. coli RNA polymerase. DNA complementary to ovalbumin messenger RNA (cDNAov) was then used as a hybridization probe to estimate the concentration of ovalbumin messenger RNA sequences (mRNAov) in these in vitro transcripts. Although chromatin from unstimulated chick oviduct was capable of substantial RNA synthesis, no detectable mRNAov sequences could be found in the transcript. Likewise, mRNAov sequences could not be found in RNA synthesized from spleen chromatin using E. coli RNA polymerase. However, chromatin from estrogen-stimulated chick oviducts was capable of supporting synthesis of ovalbumin mRNA. We estimate that approximately 0.01% of the RNA synthesized from estrogen-stimulated chromatin was mRNAov sequences. When RNA synthesized from chick DNA was tested with the cDNAov probe, mRNAov sequences could be detected in a concentration of approximately 10% that found in the RNA transcript from estrogen-stimulated chromatin. This was as expected if the ovalbumin gene is considered to be in the or derepressed region of the estrogen-stimulated oviduct chromatin. Chromatin isolated from chicks withdrawn from hormone for 12 days was only capable of supporting mRNAov synthesis in vitro at a level of 5 to 10% of that observed in chromatin prepared from estrogen-stimulated chicks, thus indicating the requirement for estrogen to maintain the ovalbumin gene in the available or open state in the majority of oviduct cells. These data militate against post-transcriptional control as the primary mechanism of steroid hormone regulation of specific mRNA synthesis in the chick oviduct system, and favor primary gene derepression as the most likely mechanism for estrogen induction of ovalbumin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1555743056,"In our two-phase reaction system taurodexycholate prevents the adsorption of pancreatic lipase B to the nonaqueous phase. Our data are consistent with a mechanism for this reaction which involves the cooperative formation of an enzyme-(bile salt)4 complex in solution with a dissociation constant of 1.4 X 10(-15)M4. Whereas the free enzyme is readily adsorbed to a bile salt-substrate-covered surface, the complex is not. Thus, the inhibition of substrate hydrolysis occurs because enzyme and substrate are separated physically. The protein cofactor, colipase, reverses the inhibitory effects of bile salt by providing a high affinity binding site at the interface for the lipase-(bile salt)4 complex. Steady state and presteady state kinetic data are consistent with the formation of a complex with a 1/1, lipase/colipase, ratio, and a dissociation constant of 0.4 to 2.8 X 10(-9)M. The rate of adsorption of lipase to adsorbed colipase appears to be controlled by diffusion through the unstirred layer with a second order rate constant of 1.3 X 10(6)M-1S-1."
https://openalex.org/W1594366702,"24R,24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is capable of inducing a minimal intestinal calcium transport response in chicks when compared to an equal amount of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. 1,24,25-Trihydroxyvitamin D3 is also less active than 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and its activity is much shorter lived than that of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. A comparison of the metabolism of 25-hydroxy[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxy[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 in the rat and chick shows that 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 disappear at least 10 times more rapidly from the blood and intestine of chicks. Furthermore, examination of the excretory products from both of these species demonstrates that chicks receiving a single dose of 24,25-dihydroxy[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 excrete 66% of the total radioactivity by 48 hours, whereas rats receiving the same dose excrete less than one-half that amount. These results demonstrate that 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is considerably less biologically active in the chick than in the rat, probably due to more rapid metabolism and excretion."

https://openalex.org/W1668488797,"Abstract The molecular organization of surface galactose residues in glycoproteins of the intact myelin sheath was investigated using the enzymatic membrane probe, galactose oxidase. Rat spinal cords treated under physiological conditions with this nonpermanent probe were labeled specifically in galactose residues by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride. The enzymatically modified proteins from isolated myelin were analyzed electrophoretically and their specific radioactivities determined. Results indicated tritium label associated with a surprising variety of high molecular weight proteins. The most extensively labeled peak corresponded to the major myelin glycoprotein as indicated by the coincidence of tritium label with that of [14C]fucose used as an internal marker for the glycoproteins. The radioactivity associated with this protein was 1.1 to 2.7 times higher after treatment with galactose oxidase when compared to reduction in the absence of the enzyme and 1.4 to 4.8 times higher when oxidized and reduced after prior treatment with neuraminidase. The results suggest a complex heterogeneity of minor glycoproteins associated with isolated myelin. It is concluded that from this complexity of glycoproteins, a major glycoprotein is at least partially localized on the external surface of either the intact myelin sheath or the closely associated oligodendroglial plasma membrane. Such a localization of this glycoprotein and the probable localization of the other glycoproteins enhances their potential role in specific interactions in the process of mpyelination or myelin maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2229703472,"Tetranitromethane reaction with intact ovine lutropin and its isolated subunits was studied using spectrophotometric measurements, amino acid analysis, and isolation of tyrosyl peptides. Tyrosyl residues in the beta subunit (beta37, beta59) did not react with tetranitromethane in the intact hormone, but were nitrated in the isolated subunit. The sequence and extent of reaction of tetranitromethane with the tyrosyl residues in the alpha subunit was alpha21 = alpha92 = alpha93 (in intact hormone or isolated subunit) greater than alpha 41 (reacted in isolated subunit only) greater than alpha 30 (reacted in isolated subunit in 8 M urea only). Polymerization was observed as a side reaction in agreement with previous studies. The degree of polymerization appeared to be related to both primary sequence and tertiary structure, and for lutropin had the relation: alpha subunit (93% polymerized) greater than intact hormone greater than beta subunit (less than 40%). Polymerization observed with vasopressin was significantly greater than with oxytocin; for these peptides the tyrosine residues in the monomeric product were converted to 3-nitrotyrosine. Neither 3-nitrotyrosine nor tyrosine was detected in the polymerized by-products. In the tetranitromethane reaction with intact ovine lutropin, other reaction products charcterized by absorption spectra were found. Peptides isolated from these products lacked the characteristic 428 nm abosrption maxima of 3-nitrotyrosyl peptides and showed instead absorption in the 310 to 350 nm region. Similar products from tetranitromethane reactions with di- and tripeptides containing tyrosine have been observed previously (Boyd, N.D., and Smith, D.B. (1971) Can. J. Biochem, 49, 154-161), but they have not been studied in proteins. A possible relationship to the polymerization side reaction is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1603485721,"Abstract Palmitylcarnitine oxidation by isolated liver mitochondria has been used to investigate the interaction of fatty acid oxidation with malate, glutamate, succinate, and the malate-aspartate shuttle. Mitochondria preincubated with fluorocitrate were added to a medium containing 2mM ATP and ATPase. This system, characterized by a high energy change, allowed titration of respiration to any desired rate between States 4 and 3 (Chance, B., and Williams, G. R. (1956) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 17, 65-134). When respiration (reference, with palmitylcarnitine and malate as substrates) was set at 75% of State 3, the oxidation of palmitylcarnitine was limited by acetoacetate formation. The addition of malate or glutamate approximately doubled the rate of beta oxidation. Malate circumvented this limitation by citrate formation, but the effect of glutamate apparently was due to enhancement of the capacity for ketogenesis. The rate of beta oxidation was curtailed when malate and glutamate were both present. This curtailment was more pronounced when the malate-aspartate shuttle was fully reconstituted. Among the oxidizable substrates examined, succinate was most effective in inhibiting palmitylcarnitine oxidation. Mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratios were correlated positively with suppression of beta oxidation. The degree of suppression of beta oxidation by the malate-aspartate shuttle (NADH oxidation) or by succinate oxidation was dependent on the respiratory state. Both substrates extensively reduced mitochondrial NAD+ and markedly suppressed beta oxidation as respiration approached State 4. Calculations of the rates of flux of hydrogen equivalents through beta oxidation show that the suppression of beta oxidation by glutamate or by the malate-aspartate shuttle is accounted for by increased flux of reducing equivalents through mitochondrial malic dehydrogenase. This increased Flux is accompanied by an increase in the steady state NADH/NAD+ ratio and a marked decrease in the synthesis of citrate. The alpha-glycerophosphate shuttle was reconstituted with mitochondria isolated from rats treated with L-thyroxine. This shuttle was about equal to the reconstructed malate-aspartate shuttle in supression of palmitylcarnitine oxidation. This interaction could not be demonstrated in euthyroid animals owing to the low activity of the mitochondrial alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. It is concluded that beta oxidation can be regulated by the NADH/NAD+ ratio. The observed stimulation of flux through malate dehydrogenase both by glutamate and by the malate-aspartate shuttle results in an increased steady state NADH/NAD+ ratio, and is linked to a stoichiometric outward transport of aspartate. We suggest, therefore, that some of the reducing pressure exerted by the malate-aspartate shuttle and by glutamate plus malate is provided through the energy-linked, electrogenic transport of aspartate out of the mitochondria. These results are discussed with respect to the mechanism of the genesis of ethanol-induced fatty liver."
https://openalex.org/W1522613634,"Abstract The third amino acid sequence of a high potential iron-sulfur protein, that of the non-sulfur purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa, has been determined. It consists of a single polypeptide chain of 74 amino acid residues, which is slightly smaller than the high potential iron-sulfur proteins from the sulfur purple bacteria Chromatium vinosum (85 residues) and Thiocapsa pfennigii (81 residues). The sequence of the gelatinosa protein is similar to the C. vinosum and T. pfennigii proteins with 38% and 37% identically matching residues, although six gaps are proposed for the comparison (the C. vinosum and T. pfennigii proteins have 44% identically matching residues out of 73 positions compared with only one 4-residue gap). Only 17 redisues, including the 4 cystein residues essential for binding the four-iron-sulfur chromophore, are invariant in the three known sequences. A discussion of the role of conserved residues in maintenance of the three-dimensional structure and in electron transport is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1481456642,"When cod fish muscle oxalacetate decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxylation of oxalacetate in the presence of NaBH4, L-lactate results from the reduction of enzyme-bound pyruvate. However, D-lactate results when borohydride reduces the binary enzyme-pyruvate complex formed by adding pyruvate from solution, as reported by others. This observation suggests that there are alternate mechanisms for reduction that are either kinetically or sterically determined for the E-pyruvate forms produced in the two directions. In the process of investigating the mechanism of reduction, the cod fish muscle decarboxylase was discovered to be identical with pyruvate kinase. Decarboxylase activity appears to take place at a site which overlaps the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site on this enzyme, as discussed in the following paper. Crystalline rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase also contains significant decarboxylase activity indicating that the two reactions may be structurally related functions. In the presence of K+, orthophosphate, or ATP the rabbit muscle enzyme catalyzes the detritiation of enzyme-bound pyruvate formed during decarboxylation before release of pyruvate from the enzyme, in analogy with the detritiation of pyruvate formed from P-[3-3/]enolpyruvate in the kinase reaction. This observation is consistent with the formation of an enolpyruvate intermediate common to the kinetic pathways of both reactions. Since the decarboxylase reac.tion is completely stereospecific, within the limits of detection, going with retention of configuration, the protonation of the enolpyruvate intermediate is completely determined by the enzyme as is the case with the enolpyruvate intermediate generated from P-enolpyruvate in the kinase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1496069463,"The reactions of horse globin reconstituted with proto-, deutero-, and mesoheme have been examined by equilibrium and kinetic methods. In virtually all reactions studied, mesohemoglobin displays the more extreme functional behavior, whereas deuterohemoglobin exhibits behavior which is either very similar to native hemoglobin or intermediate between the two. Our kinetic and equilibrium results indicate that the primary effect of heme modification on the functional properties of hemoglobin is to alter the intrinsic reactivities of the deoxy and liganded conformations. Heme modification does not, however, result in substantial alterations in the conformational equilibrium between the two states. Simple inductive electronic effects of the 2- and 4-substituents of the heme moiety in deutero- and mesohemoglobin are apparently not sufficient to explain the observed equilibrium and kinetic properties completely, which indicates that steric effects of these substituents may also play a role in determining the functional behavior of the hemoglobin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1501070768,"A number of halo carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids were substrate-competitive inhibitors of glutamate decarboxylase, with bromosuccinate, 3-bromopropionate, and iodoacetate having the highest affinity for the enzyme. Some of the halo acids also inactivated the apoenzyme. Bromopyruvate at relatively low concentrations inactivated the apoenzyme irreversibly. The rate of the inactivation of the apodecarboxylase was proportional to bromopyruvate at low concentration and approached a constant rate of inactivation at high bromopyruvate concentration. These data are consistent with a two-step inactivation process in which an enzyme-bromopyruvate complex is formed followed by inactivation. The concentration of bromopyruvate giving the half-maximum rate of inactivation was 6.9 mM, and the maximum rate of inactivation was 1.75 min-1 at pH 4.6 and 23 degrees. Much faster rates of inactivation were obtained at pH 5.96 and 6.44. Phosphate, an inhibitor of pyrisoxal-P binding to the apoenzyme, competitively inhibited the inactivation of the apoenzyme by bromopyruvate. In addition, bromopyruvate inhibited the rate of pyridoxal-P binding to the apoenzyme. Kinetics of the incorporation of bromo[2-14C]pyruvate indicated that complete inactivation was obtained when 1.2 mol of radioactive residue were covalently bound per subunit of apoenzyme. Amino acid analyses demonstrated that a cysteinyl residue was alkylated by the bromopyruvate. The bromopyruvate was evidently interacting nincovalently with a cationic group at or near the pyridoxal-P-binding site, and then was alkylating a nearby cysteinyl residue."
https://openalex.org/W1561823626,"The enzyme from cod fish muscle that catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate and is homogeneous by several criteria contains very significant pyruvate kinase activity. For every unit of decarboxylase activity (0.90 unit/mg) there are 235 units of pyruvate kinase activity (212 units/mg). The inability to separate the two activities by a variety of physical techniques indicates that both are due to a single enzyme protein. Improtantly, the two activities appear to take place at the same or overlapping sites on the enzyme. Phosphoenolpyruvate and 4-ethyloxalacetate are strong linear competitive inhibitors of the decarboxylase activity with respect to oxalacetate having dissociation constants of 3.2 and 10.2 muM, respectively, while 4-ethyloxalacetate is a linear competitive inhibitor of the pyruvate kinase activity with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate, Ki - 13.5 muM. In addition, both activities exhibit sigmoidal kinetics for substrates. The differential influence of effectors on substrate cooperativity for the two reactions indicates that the decarboxylase reaction may be an important tool for studying allosteric mechanisms in this enzyme."

The fully nitrated oLHalpha (pentaatyrosyl oLH) combined poorly with oLHbeta and only 20 to 25% was obtained as the recombined product. The various nitrated LH and recombined LH derivatives containing separately nitrated subunits were tested for their potency in an in vitro radioligand assay and their in vivo biological potency in the ovarian ascorbic acid depletion assay. In the radioligand assay, the monoatyrosyl oLH and the oLHalpha + diatyrosyl oLHbeta were the most active derivatives and had about the same competitive inhibtion curves as that of oLHalpha + oLHbeta. Diatyrosyl oLH had intermediate native potency and the triatyrosyl oLH, tetraatyrosyl oLH + OLHbeta, and pentaatyrosyl oLHalpha + oLHbeta were the least active derivatives in this series. No tetranitromethane-modified LH derivative in our study was completely devoid of the specific binding activity in the radioligand assay. At a dosage of 1000-fold excess over the 125I-labeled oH, all the preparations tested in this series completely inhibited the specific binding of 125I-labeled oLH to the hormone receptors in rat testis preparations. In the in vivo ovarian ascorbic acid depletion assay, both the monoatyrosyl oLH and oLHalpha + diatyrosyl oLHbeta retained about 50% of its original activity; the diatyrosyl oLH and triatyrosyl oLH had about 10% of the activity and the recombined products of tetraatyrosyl oHalpha + oLHbeta and pentaatyrosyl oLHalpha + oLHbeta showed virtually no activity. Based on the results obtained from this paper and the preceding paper, the role of the individual tyrosine residues in oLH is assessed."

The plot of the magnitude of the potassium accumulation against the clamped membrane potential yields an N-shaped relation similar to the ""steady state"" current-voltage relation. The accumulation studies confirm a strong inward-going (anomalous) potassium rectification."
https://openalex.org/W1507151963,"Hemoglobin tetramers which cannot split into alphabeta dimers, because they are covalently cross-linked between the beta chains across the polyphosphate binding site, form complexes with haptoglobin. The reaction is biphasic as measured by fluorescence quenching and peroxidase activity. A complex in which one of the alpha beta dimers of the cross-linked hemoglobin is bound to one of the sites in the divalent haptoglobin molecule, is formed reversibly during the initial fast phase. In the subsequent slower step, this product then either polymerizes, adds another cross-linked hemoglobin molecule or, in the presence of excess haptoglobin, combines with a second haptoglobin molecule. This latter complex, in which two haptoglobin molecules are bridged by a cross-linked hemoglobin tetramer, can still combine with normal alpha beta dimers at the vacant haptoglobin combining sites. In spite of the very low oxygen affinity of the cross-linked hemoglobin, combination with haptoglobin shifts if oxygen affinity to the very high value of the normal hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex."
https://openalex.org/W1582507187,"A two-dimensional electrophoresis method has been developed which solubilizes erythrocyte membrane proteins, and which resolves the components of the band that migrates in detergent gels as if its molecular mass were 95,000 daltons. This method uses gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate in the first dimension and phenol, aqueous urea, and acetic acid in the second dimension. The 95,000 dalton band is known to contain several different membrane proteins, including those associated with anion transport, glucose transport, and (Na+,K+) transport. Two-dimensional electrophoresis resolved this band into one major spot and several minor ones. Pronase digestion of whole erythrocytes, followed by preparation of ghosts and two-dimensional electrophoresis, showed that only the major component of this band was digested by pronase."
https://openalex.org/W1721319478,"Transfer RNAs, isolated from Escherichia coli F cells infected with T5 bacteriophage, were charged with radioactive amino acids and used in RNA-DNA hybridization studies to detect and locate T5 tRNA cistrons in the T5 DNA chromosome. Hybridization of 14 3H-aminoacyl-tRNA species, including purified T5 [35S]Met-tRNAm and [35S]Met-tRNAf, to the separated strands of T5+ DNA indicates that most, if not all, of the T5 tRNAs are transcribed from the continuous heavy strand of T5 DNA. Heteroduplex mapping of eight mutant T5 DNA deletions has enabled us to locate and determine the size of these deleted segments. By correlating this information with the presence and absence of specific tDNA sequences in these mutants, as determined by tRNA-DNA hybridization, we were able to define the physical limits of four tDNA-containing loci along the T5 DNA molecule. A physical map for 15 tRNA species examined indicates that the structural genes for these tRNAs are clustered within a segment length of T5 DNA that represents approximately 11.2% of the total wild type T5 DNA. The existence of the deletion mutants indicates that T5 tRNAs are dispensable for T5 replication under the growth conditions and for the host employed."
https://openalex.org/W1591584453,"Acetyl-coenzyme A: 13-sophorosyloxydocosanoic acid (Glc2HDA) acetyltransferase was purified 14-fold in low yield from Candida bogoriensis cells. The enzyme catalyzes acetylation of the 6' and 6 positions of the sophorosyl group, producing the 13-[2'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy]-docosanoic acid 6',6-diacetate (Ac2Glc2HDA) and monoacetate (AcGlc2HDA) in a product ratio of 5:1. Neither the purification steps nor heat denaturation studies indicated separation of the first and second acetylation steps. The acetyltransferase has a molecular weight of about 500,000 as determined by gel filtration on a Sepharose 4-B column. It shows a pH optimum range from 7 to 9, is strongly inhibited by 1 mM concentrations of the sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), but only partly inhibited by 10 mM iodoacetamide. It has an apparent Km of 30 muM for acetyl-CoA, utilizes propionyl-CoA at 45% the rate of acetyl-CoA, and utilizes longer chain acyl-CoA derivatives much less efficiently. The critical micelle concentrations of the C. bogoriensis glycolipids in pH 7.7 phosphate buffer were estimated by pinacyanol chloride binding as follows: Glc2HDA, 50 mum; AcGlc2HDA, 30 muM; Ac2Glc2HDA, 12 muM. The Stokes radius of Ac2Glc2HDA micelles was 22 A as estimated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-150. Glc2HDA was a much better acceptor than its methyl ester in the acetyltransferase assay. A plateau in the Glc2HDA saturation curve at 50 muM and a corresponding break in the reciprocal plot at this concentration indicate the enzyme utilizes the monomeric form of this lipid as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1518374946,"Abstract Clonal line NN hamster astroblasts and clonal line N18 neuroblasts were treated with phospholipase C-free, protease-free, and hemolysin-free Clostridium perfringens sialidase, at a low level (5 X 10(-3) units/ml) so as to maintain cell intactness and to avoid spurious protein effects. A rapid, regular release of sialic acid was achieved. An approximately 9-fold increase in ecto-pyrophosphatase activity could be brought about by action of C. perfringens sialidase for 10 min. Since the sialidase preparations were employed at a level which gave a very low concentration of extraneous protein, and the preparations were free of demonstrable phospholipase C and protease activities, these effects appear to relate specifically to removal of cell surface sialic acid. Neutral p-nitrophenyl phosphatase was activated under the same conditions, but activity remained low compared with pyrophosphatase. Progress curves for activation of the two enzymes were dissimilar. Ecto-pyrophosphatase of NN and N18 cells had an absolute requirement for Mg2+ both before and after removal of cell surface sialic acid. In the presence of near optimum Mg2+ (5 mM), other divalent cations were inhibitory at a low level (10(-1)mM). The effect of Mg2+ concentration, as well as inorganic pyrophosphate concentration, upon ecto-pyrophosphatase activity was shown to obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the control activity and for the sialidase-enhanced activity of both cell types. Km for Mg2+ and for pyrophosphate remained constant upon ecto-pyrophosphatase enhancement by sialic acid removal; increase in enzymatic activity was accounted for entirely by an increase in Vmax."

https://openalex.org/W2033940235,The frequency distribution curve of the erythrocyte sedimentation rates obtained from a population of 3523 normal females was compared with the distribution found in 544 patients with benign breast disease and that for 385 patients with carcinoma of the breast. No significant difference was found between the normal female population and patients with benign lesions of the breast. This was in contrast to the distorted distribution curve of erythrocyte sedimentation rates exhibited by the population of patients having malignant breast lesions. An unknown substance present in the blood plasma of the cancer patients appears to be responsible for the abnormal sedimentation rate phenomenon.
https://openalex.org/W1521280353,"Two enzymes have been isolated from Candida bogoriensis which catalyze the hydrolysis of 13-sophorosyloxydocosanoic acid (Glc2HDA) esters obtained from this organism. The 6',6-diacetyl derivative of Glc2HDA (Ac2Glc2HDA) is hydrolyzed by an acetylesterase (EC 3.1.1.6) which has been purified 1300-fold. The acetylesterase has a molecular weight of 35,000 estimated from gel filtration, and is much more active with p-nitrophenyl acetate than with the acetylated glycolipid. The rate of hydrolysis increases with Ac2Glc2HDA concentration until a plateau is reached at a concentration of about 40 muM, near the critical micelle concentration of this glycolipid. These kinetic data are interpreted as an enzyme specificity for the monomeric, but not the micellar form of the glycolipid. The acetylesterase is inhibited by 0.1 to 10 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 5 mM p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, but only slightly by 5 mM iodoacetamide. The methyl ester of Ac2Glc2HDA is hydrolyzed by at least two carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1) which differ in size according to gel filtration. Their molecular weights are estimated as 140,000 for carboxyesterase A and 40,000 for carboxyesterase B. Both carboxylesterases were purified over 20-fold, and carboxylesterase A was characterized further. Carboxylesterase A activity was inhibited completely by 0.1 to 10 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate and by 10 mM p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but only slightly by lower concentrations of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or by N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide. The carboxylesterase A preparation also acted as a thioesterase with palmityl-CoA (palmityl-CoA hydrolase, EC 3.1.2.2), showing the following approximate relative activities: palmityl-CoA, 100; octanoyl-CoA, 90; methyl Glc2HD, 22; butyryl-CoA, 18; methyl AcGlc2HD, 15; methyl Ac2Glc2HD, 10; and acetyl-CoA, O. Methyl Ac2Glc2HD showed some substrate inhibition at higher concentrations, but neither methyl Ac2Glc2HD nor palmityl-CoA approached enzyme saturation until well above their critical micelle concentrations, indicating hydrolysis of the micellar substrate was occurring. The carboxylesterase and palmityl-CoA hydrolase activities were destroyed in a parallel fashion by heat denaturation, and each substrate inhibited the action of the preparation on the other substrate, but the preparation has not been purified sufficiently to establish with certainty that both activities reside in the same protein."
https://openalex.org/W1507371110,"The effect of inert coordination complexes of chromium (III) with various nucleotides on the catalytic activity of rat liver pyruvate carboxylase was determined. The chromium nucleotides are effective initial inhibitors of pyruvate carboxylase and the inhibition becomes more severe with time. The initial rate decreases for several minutes, reaching a new slower rate that is then maintained until considerable net reaction occurs. Incubation of the enzyme with chromium nucleotides in the presence of Mg2+ and HCO3- causes maximal inhibition of the reaction and linear initial rates are then observed. This effect is similar to that found with yeast hexokinase (Dannenberg, K.D., and Cleland, W.W. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 28-39). The specificity of the carboxylase toward the nucleotide complexes suggests that the alpha and beta nucleotide phosphates are as important as the gamma phosphate in binding to the enzyme. A stable pyruvate carboxylase chromium nucleotide complex was not observed. These results are quite different from those found with yeast hexokinase where a stable complex between CrATP, sugar, and enzyme is found and hexokinase appears to be specific toward the beta, gamma phosphates of its nucleotide substrates."
