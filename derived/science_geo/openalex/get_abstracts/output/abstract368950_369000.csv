https://openalex.org/W2148795627,"Background Characteristic symptoms of malaria include recurrent fever attacks and neurodegeneration, signs that are also found in patients with a hyperactive Nalp3 inflammasome. Plasmodium species produce a crystal called hemozoin that is generated by detoxification of heme after hemoglobin degradation in infected red blood cells. Thus, we hypothesized that hemozoin could activate the Nalp3 inflammasome, due to its particulate nature reminiscent of other inflammasome-activating agents. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that hemozoin acts as a proinflammatory danger signal that activates the Nalp3 inflammasome, causing the release of IL-1β. Similar to other Nalp3-activating particles, hemozoin activity is blocked by inhibiting phagocytosis, K+ efflux and NADPH oxidase. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of hemozoin results in acute peritonitis, which is impaired in Nalp3-, caspase-1- and IL-1R-deficient mice. Likewise, the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria is dampened in Nalp3-deficient mice infected with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, while parasitemia remains unchanged. Significance/Conclusions The potent pro-inflammatory effect of hemozoin through inflammasome activation may possibly be implicated in plasmodium-associated pathologies such as cerebral malaria."
https://openalex.org/W1989126478,"Background Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) have been isolated from a variety of connective tissues, and are commonly called “mesenchymal stem cells” (MSCs). A stem cell is defined as having robust clonal self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential. Accordingly, the term “MSC” has been criticised, as there is little data demonstrating self-renewal of definitive single-cell-derived (SCD) clonal populations from a mesenchymal cell source. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that a tractable MPC population, human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs), was capable of multilineage differentiation in vitro and, more importantly, contributed to rapid connective tissue healing in vivo by producing bone, cartilage and fibrous stroma. Furthermore, HUCPVCs exhibit a high clonogenic frequency, allowing us to isolate definitive SCD parent and daughter clones from mixed gender suspensions as determined by Y-chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization. Conclusions/Significance Analysis of the multilineage differentiation capacity of SCD parent clones and daughter clones enabled us to formulate a new hierarchical schema for MSC self-renewal and differentiation in which a self-renewing multipotent MSC gives rise to more restricted self-renewing progenitors that gradually lose differentiation potential until a state of complete restriction to the fibroblast is reached."
https://openalex.org/W2106775387,"The spatial unity between self and body can be disrupted by employing conflicting visual-somatosensory bodily input, thereby bringing neurological observations on bodily self-consciousness under scientific scrutiny. Here we designed a novel paradigm linking the study of bodily self-consciousness to the spatial representation of visuo-tactile stimuli by measuring crossmodal congruency effects (CCEs) for the full body.We measured full body CCEs by attaching four vibrator-light pairs to the trunks (backs) of subjects who viewed their bodies from behind via a camera and a head mounted display (HMD). Subjects made speeded elevation (up/down) judgments of the tactile stimuli while ignoring light stimuli. To modulate self-identification for the seen body subjects were stroked on their backs with a stick and the felt stroking was either synchronous or asynchronous with the stroking that could be seen via the HMD. We found that (1) tactile stimuli were mislocalized towards the seen body (2) CCEs were modulated systematically during visual-somatosensory conflict when subjects viewed their body but not when they viewed a body-sized object, i.e. CCEs were larger during synchronous than during asynchronous stroking of the body and (3) these changes in the mapping of tactile stimuli were induced in the same experimental condition in which predictable changes in bodily self-consciousness occurred.These data reveal that systematic alterations in the mapping of tactile stimuli occur in a full body illusion and thus establish CCE magnitude as an online performance proxy for subjective changes in global bodily self-consciousness."
https://openalex.org/W2074818274,"Functional connectivity of in vitro neuronal networks was estimated by applying different statistical algorithms on data collected by Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs). First we tested these “connectivity methods” on neuronal network models at an increasing level of complexity and evaluated the performance in terms of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and PPC (Positive Precision Curve), a new defined complementary method specifically developed for functional links identification. Then, the algorithms better estimated the actual connectivity of the network models, were used to extract functional connectivity from cultured cortical networks coupled to MEAs. Among the proposed approaches, Transfer Entropy and Joint-Entropy showed the best results suggesting those methods as good candidates to extract functional links in actual neuronal networks from multi-site recordings."
https://openalex.org/W2084963424,"All vertebrate cells regulate their cell volume by activating chloride channels of unknown molecular identity, thereby activating regulatory volume decrease. We show that the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel TMEM16A together with other TMEM16 proteins are activated by cell swelling through an autocrine mechanism that involves ATP release and binding to purinergic P2Y2 receptors. TMEM16A channels are activated by ATP through an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and a Ca2+-independent mechanism engaging extracellular-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2). The ability of epithelial cells to activate a Cl− conductance upon cell swelling, and to decrease their cell volume (regulatory volume decrease) was dependent on TMEM16 proteins. Activation of ICl,swell was reduced in the colonic epithelium and in salivary acinar cells from mice lacking expression of TMEM16A. Thus TMEM16 proteins appear to be a crucial component of epithelial volume-regulated Cl− channels and may also have a function during proliferation and apoptotic cell death.

Regulation of cell volume is fundamental to all cells, particularly during cell growth and division. External hypotonicity leads to cell swelling and subsequent activation of volume-regulated chloride and potassium channels, to release intracellular ions and to re-shrink the cells, a process termed regulatory volume decrease (RVD) 3The abbreviations used are: RVDregulatory volume decreaseAVDapoptotic volume decreaseDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidMTSET[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonateCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseHEKhuman embryonic kidneyCFPACcystic fibrosis pancreatic epithelial cellRTreverse transcriptasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterWTwild type.

Volume-regulated chloride currents (ICl,swell) have dual functions during cell proliferation as well as apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), preceding apoptotic cell death (2Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Manabe K. Mori S. Nabekura T. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 448: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although ICl,swell is activated in swollen cells to induce RVD, AVD takes place under normotonic conditions to shrink cells (3Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E.

Early work suggested intracellular Ca2+ as an important mediator for activation of ICl,swell and volume-regulated K+ channels (5Hoffmann E.K. Simonsen L.O. Lambert I.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 78: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas subsequent studies only found a permissive role of Ca2+ for activation of ICl,swell (6Pedersen S.F. Prenen J. Droogmans G.

(Oxf.). 2006; 187: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar. In addition, a plethora of factors and signaling pathways have been implicated in activation of ICl,swell, making cell volume regulation an extremely complex process (reviewed in Refs. 1Stutzin A. Hoffmann E.K. Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2006; 187: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Physiol.

These factors include intracellular ATP, the cytoskeleton, phospholipase A2-dependent pathways, and protein kinases such as extracellular-regulated kinase ERK1/2 (reviewed in Refs. 1Stutzin A.

Previous approaches in identifying swelling-activated Cl− channels have been unsuccessful or have produced controversial data. Thus none of the previous candidates such as pICln, the multidrug resistance protein, or ClC-3 are generally accepted to operate as volume-regulated Cl− channels (reviewed in Refs. 8Jentsch T.J.

Notably, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) had been shown in earlier studies to influence ICl,swell and volume regulation (10Vennekens R. Trouet D. Vankeerberghen A.

The variable properties of ICl,swell suggest that several gene products may affect ICl,swell in different cell types. regulatory volume decrease apoptotic volume decrease 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator extracellular signal-regulated kinase human embryonic kidney cystic fibrosis pancreatic epithelial cell reverse transcriptase small interfering RNA fluorescence-activated cell sorter wild type. The TMEM16 transmembrane protein family consists of 10 different proteins with numerous splice variants that contain 8–9 transmembrane domains and have predicted intracellular N- and C-terminal tails (13Katoh M.

TMEM16A (also called ANO1) is required for normal development of the murine trachea (14Rock J.R. Futtner C.R. Harfe B.D. Dev.

Interestingly, members of the TMEM16 family have been suggested to play a role in osmotolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Takizawa P.A. DeRisi J.L. Wilhelm J.E. Vale R.D. Science. 2000; 290: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Here we show that TMEM16 proteins also contribute to ICl,swell and regulatory volume decrease. Cell lines from human embryonic kidney (HEK293), human colon carcinoma (HT29), and human cystic fibrosis pancreatic epithelial (CFPAC) cells were cultured as described (22Kunzelmann K. Allert N. Kubitz R. Breuer W.V. Cabantchik Z.I. Normann C. Schumann S. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 428: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). cDNA for mouse TMEM16B was purchased from ImaGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany; clone name IRAVp968H1167D). cDNA for human TMEM16A were cloned into pcDNA3.1 V5-His (Invitrogen) from the total RNA of 16HBE-14o cells (bronchial epithelium; kindly provided by Prof. D. Gruenert, CPMRI, San Francisco, CA) by RT-PCR using the primers 5′-AAAAGCGGCCGCGGCCACGATGAGGGTC-3′ and 5′-AAATCTAGAAACAGGACGCCCCCGTGGTA-3′. All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. 16HBE-14o cells express a TMEM16A isoform containing exons a, b, and c according to Caputo et al. (18Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells using standard methods (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen). All experiments were performed 48 h after the transfection. Protein was isolated from transfected HEK293 cells in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate sodium, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and was separated by 7% SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Munich, Germany) using a semi-dry transfer unit (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (dilution from 1:2000 to 1:5000) overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized using a suitable (horseradish peroxidase) conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:30000) and ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare). Protein bands were detected on a FujiFilm LAS-3000. Cells were grown on coverslips that were mounted in a perfused bath on the stage of an inverted microscope (IM35, Zeiss) and kept at 37 °C. Cells and acini isolated from mouse glands were allowed to settle onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. The bath was perfused continuously with Ringer solution at about 10 ml/min. For activation of volume-dependent Cl− currents, isotonic Ringer bath solution (mm: NaCl 145, KH2PO4 0.4, K2HPO4 1.6, d-glucose 6, MgCl2 1, calcium gluconate 1.3, pH 7.4) was changed to isotonic control solution in which 50 mmol/liter of NaCl was replaced by 100 mmol/liter of mannitol. Subsequently, mannitol (50, 75, and 100 mmol/liters) was removed to produce extracellular hypotonicity of −50, −75, and −100 mosmol/liter, i.e. 17, 25, and 33% hypotonicity. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the fast whole cell configuration. Patch pipettes had an input resistance of 2–4 MΩ, when filled with an intracellular like “physiological” solution containing (mm) KCl 30, potassium gluconate 95, NaH2PO4 1.2, Na2HPO4 4.8, EGTA 1, calcium gluconate 0.758, MgCl2 1.034, d-glucose 5, ATP 3, pH was 7.2. The Ca2+ activity was 0.1 μm. We choose this solution because it enabled normal swelling/shrinkage behavior and allowed for direct comparison of results from patch clamping and volume measurements. The access conductance was measured continuously and was 30–140 nS. Currents (voltage clamp) and voltages (current clamp) were recorded using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC 7, List Medical Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany), the LIH1600 interface and PULSE software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) as well as Chart software (AD Instruments, Spechbach, Germany). Data were stored continuously on a computer hard disc and analyzed using PULSE software. In regular intervals, membrane voltage (Vc) was clamped in steps of 10 mV from −50 to +50 mV relative to resting potential. Membrane conductance Gm was calculated from the measured current (I) and Vc values according to Ohm law. Generation of a null allele of Tmem16a and TMEM16A knock-out animals has been described previously (14Rock J.R. Futtner C.R. Harfe B.D. Dev. Biol. 2008; 321: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Pups (1–4 days) were sacrificed with Isofluran (Baxter, Germany). The pancreas and submandibular glands were removed and epithelial cells were dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline composed of Collagenase VIII (Sigma). Tracheas were dissected, opened longitudinally on the opposite side of the cartilage-free zone, and transferred immediately into an ice-cold buffer solution. Stripped colon was put into ice-cold Ringer bath solution containing amiloride (10 μm) and indomethacin (10 μm). For activation of volume-dependent Cl− currents, isotonic Ringer bath solution was changed to isotonic control solution in which 50 mmol/liter of NaCl was replaced by 100 mmol/liter of mannitol. Subsequently, mannitol was removed to produce extracellular hypotonicity of −100 mosmol/liter, i.e. 33% hypotonicity. Tissues were mounted into a microperfused Ussing chamber with a circular aperture of 0.785 mm2. Luminal and basolateral sides of the epithelium were perfused continuously at a rate of 5 ml/min. Bath solutions were heated to 37 °C, using a water jacket. Experiments were carried out under open circuit conditions. Data were collected continuously using PowerLab (AD Instruments, Australia). Values for transepithelial voltages (Vte) were referred to the serosal side of the epithelium. Transepithelial resistance (Rte) was determined by applying short (1 s) current pulses (ΔI = 0.5 μA). Rte and equivalent short circuit currents (ISC) were calculated according to Ohm law (Rte = ΔVte/ΔI, ISC = Vte/Rte). TMEM16A was cloned from airway epithelial cells (16HBE14o-), corresponding to isoform abc (18Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). TMEM16A-K610A, TMEM16A-S967A, and TMEM16A-S970A were produced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Expression of mRNAs encoding all 10 human TMEM16 proteins were examined in HEK293, HT29, and CFPAC cells by standard RT-PCR using real time and additional primers (name, accession number: sense, antisense): hTMEM16C, NM_031418.2, 5′-TCAGAGCAGAAGGCTTGATG-3′, 5′-AAACATGATATCGGGGCTTG-3′; hTMEM16D, NM_178826.2, 5′- TGACTGGGATTTGATAGACTGG-3′, 5′-GCTTCAAACTGGGGTCGTAT-3′; hTMEM16GL, NM_001001891.3, 5′-GCTCTGTGGTGATCGTGGT-3′, 5′-GGCACGGTACAGGATGATAGA-3′; hTMEM16GS, NM_001001666.3, 5′-GGCTCTTACGGGAGCACAG-3′, 5′-CAAACGAGGACGAAGTCGAT-3′; and hTMEM16K, NM_018075.3, 5′-CAGGGTCTTCAAACGTCCAT-3′, 5′-TCATCGTTTCAAAAGCCAACT-3′. Expression of TMEM16A, TMEM16F, TMEM16H, and TMEM16J were suppressed by two independent sets of siRNA. Duplexes of 25 nucleotides of siRNA were designed and synthesized by Invitrogen and Santa Cruz. siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine (1 μg/μl) and cells were examined 48 or 72 h after transfection. Suppression of expression of TMEM16A, TMEM16F, TMEM16H, and TMEM16J was verified by real time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 or HT29 cells using NucleoSpin RNA II columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random primer and RT (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, Promega). The oligonucleotide primers were designed for real time PCR as following (name, accession number, sense and antisense primer): hTMEM16A, NM_018043.4, 5′-CCTCACGGGCTTTGAAGAG-3′, 5′-CTCCAAGACTCTGGCTTCGT-3′; hTMEM16B, NM_020373.1, 5′-TGGATGTGCAACAATTGAAGA-3′, 5′-GCATTCTGCTGGTCACACAT-3′; hTMEM16E, NM_213599.1, 5′-TGGAAACATTAAAGAAGCCATTTA-3′, 5′-GAGTTTGTCCGAGCTTTTCG-5′; hTMEM16F, NM_001025356.1, 5′-AGGAATGTTTTGCTACAAATGGA-3′, 5′-GTCCAAGGTTTTCCAACACG-3′; hTMEM16H, NM_020959.1, 5′-GGAGGACCAGCCAATCATC-3′, 5′-TGCTCGTGGACAGGGAAC-3′; hTMEM16J, NM_001012302.2, 5′-CAAACCCCAGCTGGAACTC-3′, 5′-GGATCCGGAGGCTCTCTT-3′; and β-actin, NM_001101, 5′-CAACGGCTCCGGCATGTG-3′, 5′-CTTGCTCTGGGCCTCGTC-3′. Real time PCR was performed in a Light Cycler (Roche), using the Quanti Tect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Each reaction contained 2 μl of Master Mix (including Taq polymerase, desoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, and SYBR Green buffer), 1 pm of each primer sense and antisense, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 μl of cDNA. After activation of the Taq polymerase for 10 min at 94 °C cDNA was amplified by 15 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 55 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C, for 50 cycles. The amplification was followed by a melting curve analysis to control the PCR products. Analysis of the data were performed using Light Cycler software 3.5.3. Standard curves for transmembrane proteins mRNA and β-actin mRNA were produced by using cDNA of transfected HEK cells at different dilutions. The ratio of the amount of transmembrane protein to β-actin mRNA was calculated for each sample and analysis was performed in triplicate. For cell volume measurements, HEK293 cells were loaded with 2 μg of calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) and 0.025% pluronic in a standard bath solution (Ringer) for 30–60 min at 37 °C. Analysis was done at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and and emission wavelength of 520–550 nm. Cell swelling and RVD were observed for 10–15 min after applying hypotonic bath solution. To produce extracellular hypotonicity, isotonic Ringer bath solution was changed to isotonic control solution in which 50 mmol/liter of NaCl was replaced by 100 mmol/liter of mannitol. Subsequently, mannitol was removed to reduce extracellular hypotonicity by 100 mosmol/liter (33% hypotonicity). Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection of HEK293 cells with cDNAs encoding P2Y2 and hTMEM16A and 72 h after transfection with siRNA targeting TMEM16 family members or scrambled. All the compounds were dissolved in bath solutions and their effect on cell swelling was analyzed after 5–10 min incubation. Cell volume of HEK293 cells was also assessed by flow cytometry (Prof. Mathias Mack, University Hospital Regensburg) before (t = 0) and 30 s (t = 0.5 min) and 5 min (t = 5 min) after swelling, which was induced by reduction of the solution osmolarity to ⅓. In flow cytometry experiments, HEK293 cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and the average volume of 30,000 cells per condition determined. All compounds (ionomycin, carbachol, ATP, tamoxifen, DIDS, suramin, 1,2- bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-AM, U0126, staurosporine, CFTRinh-172, apyrase, MTSET, and cyclopiazonic acid) were of highest available grade of purity and were from Sigma or Merck. The anti-hTMEM16A was a generous gift from Prof. van de Rijn (Dept. of Pathology, Stanford University). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. For activation of volume-dependent Cl− currents, isotonic Ringer bath solution was changed to isotonic control solution in which 50 mmol/liter of NaCl was replaced by 100 mmol/liter of mannitol. Subsequently, mannitol (50, 75, and 100 mmol/liter) was removed to produce extracellular hypotonicity of −50, −75, and −100 mosmol/liter, i.e. 17, 25, and 33% hypotonicity. RVD due to swelling activation of ion channels is an initial event that was assessed by analysis of the initial volume decrease. RVD indicates the initial rate of regulatory volume decrease or initial RVD rate, RVDi(%) = (Vmax − Vmin)/(Vmax − Vo) × 100% (20Altamirano J. Brodwick M.S. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Initial rate of RVD in hepatocytes is controlled by extracellular ATP (21Pafundo D.E. Mut P. Pérez Recalde M.

Student's t test (for paired or unpaired samples as appropriate) and analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Because TMEM16A has been shown to be a major component of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel, we examined the contribution of TMEM16A to swelling-activated whole cell currents (ICl,swell) in a human pancreatic cell line (CFPAC) that lacks expression of the CFTR Cl− channel (22Kunzelmann K.

CFPAC cells express TMEM16A, -F, and -H and show pronounced activation of whole cell Cl− currents when exposed to hypotonic bath solution (22Kunzelmann K. Allert N. Kubitz R. Breuer W.V. Cabantchik Z.I. Normann C. Schumann S. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 428: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Activation of whole cell currents was suppressed by siRNA for TMEM16A, but not by siRNA knockdown of CLC3, ClCA1, and CLCA4, which are also expressed in CFPAC cells (Fig. 1C). This result was confirmed in the human colonic epithelial cell line HT29, which also expresses TMEM16A, -F, -H, and -J (Fig. 2A). ICl,swell was activated upon exposure to increasing extracellular hypotonicity (17, 25, and 33%, Fig. 2B, arrows). Partial removal of Cl− from the extracellular bath solution (Fig. 2, white bars, 30 mm Cl−) reduced ICl,swell and depolarized Vm by 9.1 ± 0.8 mV (n = 7), indicating activation of Cl− conductance by hypotonic bath solution. Importantly, activation of ICl,swell was reduced by siRNA-TMEM16A (Fig. 2, B and C). Finally, the role of TMEM16A for ICl,swell was examined in HEK293 cells, which also express endogenous TMEM16 proteins (Fig. 3A). Equal to HT29 and CFPAC cells, ICl,swell was activated upon exposure to hypotonic bath solution (Fig. 3B). Partial removal of Cl− from the extracellular bath solution reduced ICl,swell and depolarized Vm by 8.2 ± 0.9 mV (n = 7). Most important, ICl,swell was inhibited by siRNA-TMEM16A (Fig. 3, B and C).FIGURE 2Activation of ICl,swell in HT29 cells requires TMEM16A channels.

Activation of whole cell conductance by hypotonic bath solution (GHypo) was potently inhibited by the inhibitor of TMEM16A currents, DIDS (100 μm) (16Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), the specific inhibitor of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents CACCinh-A01 (23de la Fuente R. Namkung W. Mills A. Verkman A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and tamoxifen (100 μm) (Fig. 4C). We further confirmed the role of TMEM16 proteins for swelling-activated Cl− currents by overexpression of exogenous TMEM16A or TMEM16B, another Ca2+-activated Cl− channel and member of the TMEM16 family (24Pifferi S. Dibattista M. Menini A. Pflugers Arch. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of both TMEM16 proteins augmented swelling-activated Cl− currents in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4D). This suggests that several TMEM16 proteins may contribute to swelling-activated Cl− currents. We therefore knocked down endogenous TMEM16F, -H, and -J individually or simultaneously, each by two different batches of siRNA, which in each case significantly reduced ICl,swell (Fig. 4E). Because knockdown of each TMEM16 protein caused a non-additive reduction in ICl,swell, this may suggest that TMEM16 proteins hetero-oligomerize to form swelling-activated Cl− channels. In preliminary studies we found that endogenous volume-activated Cl− channels in HEK293 cells were potently suppressed by expression of K610K-TMEM16A, a TMEM16A mutant that produced very little Cl− conductance. 4J. Almaça, Y. Tian, F. Aldehni, J. Ousingsawat, P. Kongsuphol, J. R. Rock, B. D. Harfe, R. Schreiber, and K. Kunzelmann, unpublished data. Coexpression of G-protein-coupled receptors has been shown to increase Ca2+-activated Cl− currents produced by TMEM16A (16Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Although P2Y2 receptors are expressed endogenously in HEK293 cells, additional expression of exogenous purinergic P2Y2 receptors further increased swelling-activated whole cell currents in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). Intracellular ATP and swelling-induced ATP release from cells has been identified as an important factor for RVD (25Franco R. Panayiotidis M.I. de la Paz L.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 216: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that ATP binds to purinergic P2Y2 receptors and activates TMEM16A (16Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). We found that blockage of P2Y2 receptors with 100 μm suramin largely reduced swelling-activated whole cell currents (Fig. 5, B and C), confirming the role of P2Y2 signaling for ICl,swell. Because ATP release is obviously a critical factor for activation of ICl,swell, we exposed the cells to hypotonic bath solution in the presence of the ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase, or removed ATP from the pipette filling solution, which both significantly reduced ICl,swell (Fig. 5C). Moreover, TMEM16A has been shown to be inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET, which reacts with three cysteine residues in the putative pore forming loop of TMEM16A (16Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H. Cho Y. Shim W.S. Park S.P. Lee J. Lee B. Kim B.M. Raouf R. Shin Y.K. Oh U. Nature. 2008; 455: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). MTSET also blocked swelling-activated whole cell currents in HEK293 cells. Remarkably, the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibited ICl,swell thus clearly implying a role of this kinase for activation of TMEM16 channels (Fig. 5C). Notably, also ATP, i.e. Ca2+-activated whole cell currents, were reduced by U0126 (data not shown). We further examined the contribution of Ca2+ and ERK1/2 for activation of ICl,swell and Ca2+-dependent activation of TMEM16A by ATP, using a Ca2+-free solution (in patch pipette and bath) and by mutating two potential C-terminal ERK1/2 consensus sides (Ser967 and Ser970) in TMEM16A. We found that eliminating Ca2+ abolished activation of TMEM16A by ATP and inhibited ICl,swell (Fig. 5D). Mutating Ser967 to alanine inhibited ATP-activated currents, whereas mutating Ser970 to alanine inhibited both ATP-activated Cl− currents (TMEM16A) and ICl,swell (Fig. 5D). Thus both swelling activation and ATP-dependent activation of TMEM16A use Ca2+ and ERK1/2 as intracellular messengers. Although ICl,swell requires ERK1/2 for activation, Ca2+ has only a permissive function (26Chen B. Nicol G. Cho W.K. J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 215: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Van der Wijk T. De Jonge H.R. Tilly B.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ATP release by swollen cells may activate ERK1/2 at very low local extracellular ATP concentrations, and may thereby induce swelling-activated Cl− conductance, as reported earlier (27Van der Wijk T. De Jonge H.R. Tilly B.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that ATP and cell swelling target the same Cl− channel, we applied ATP before and after exposure to hypotonic bath solution (paired experiments). We observed that after activation of ICl,swell, ATP-induced (Ca2+ dependent) whole cell currents were largely reduced (Fig. 5, E and F). Similar non-additive effects of ATP and cell swelling on whole cell Cl− conductance were observed in HT29 cells (data not shown). To further confirm the role of TMEM16 channels for ICl,swell and RVD we loaded HEK293 cells with the fluorescence dye calcein (28Adam G. Ousingsawat J. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Pflügers Arch. 2005; 449: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hypotonic bath solution induced cell swelling and decreased calcein fluorescence, which was followed by a 98% recovery after 20 min, indicating RVD (Fig. 6A). Recovery from swelling was reduced in cells treated with siRNA-TMEM16A (42% after 20 min). Similarly inhibition of P2Y2 receptors by suramin, or application of the Cl− channel blockers tamoxifen and DIDS, or apyrase, all significantly reduced RVD (Fig. 6, A and B). These results obtained in single cell measurements were confirmed by FACS analysis of a larger number of cells. HEK293 cells treated with scrambled siRNA increased their cell volume, which returned to control values within 5 min of exposure to hypotonic bath solution (Fig. 6C). In contrast, cells treated with siRNA for TMEM16A did not return to their initial volume, demonstrating reduced RVD. Notably, overexpression of P2Y2 receptors together with TMEM16A reduced the cell volume of HEK293 cells under control conditions. Overexpression of P2Y2 receptors probably sensitizes HEK293 cells toward extracellular ATP, thus P2Y2/TMEM16A expressing cells activate Cl− channels more rapidly and therefore tend to reduce their cell volume. Moreover, their large RVD capacity counteracts any tendency to swell and therefore the cells show only a small increase in cell volume when exposed to hypotonic bath solution (Fig. 6C). We determined the rate of recovery from cell swelling and found that not only TMEM16A but also the other TMEM16 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells contribute to RVD, as demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of the individual TMEM16 proteins (Fig. 6D). It has been reported earlier that cell shrinkage due to opening of ion channels not only occurs during hypotonic swelling, but also in normotonic solution, when cells go into apoptotic cell death (2Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Manabe K. Mori S. Nabekura T. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 448: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Lang F. Ritter M. Gamper N. Huber S. Fillon S. Tanneur V. Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Gulbins E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). AVD is an initial step during apoptosis, which can be induced by compounds such as staurosporin (29Lang F. Ritter M. Gamper N. Huber S. Fillon S. Tanneur V. Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Gulbins E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). When we exposed HEK293 cells to staurosporin we observed a decrease in cell volume, indicating AVD (Fig. 6E). In contrast, knockdown of TMEM16A with two independent siRNAs significantly reduced AVD, suggesting that TMEM16A is important for both cell volume regulation (RVD) and AVD. TMEM16A is expressed at high levels in the submandibular gland and to a lower degree in hepatocytes (14Rock J.R. Futtner C.R. Harfe B.D. Dev. Biol. 2008; 321: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Schroeder B.C. Cheng T. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 2008; 134: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) (Unigene data base). We examined activation of ICl,swell in freshly isolated acinar cells from submandibular glands and in hepatocytes of 1–4-day-old WT (+/+) mouse pups and compared the results with those obtained in cells from mice lacking expression of TMEM16A (−/−). Exposure to hypotonic solution of submandibular acinar cells from +/+ animals activated a whole cell current that was essentially absent in cells from −/− animals (Fig. 7, A and C). Thus the volume-activated whole cell conductance was almost abolished in submandibular gland cells from −/− mice (Fig. 7C). In hepatocytes ICl,swell was of similar magnitude in both cells from +/+ and −/− animals, however, currents activated in −/− cells showed a different time dependence, suggesting some contribution of TMEM16A to ICl,swell also in hepatocytes (30Lan W.Z. Abbas H. Lam H.D. Lemay A.M. Hill C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G221-G229Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Volume-activated Cl− currents have also been identified previously in the basolateral membrane of colonic epithelial cells (31Diener M. Nobles M. Rummel W. Pflügers Arch. 1992; 421: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Opening of basolateral Cl− channels due to exposure to hypotonic bath solution reduced the lumen negative transepithelial voltage (Vte) in the distal colonic epithelium (Fig. 7F). In contrast the distal colon from TMEM16A−/− animals showed little changes when exposed to hypotonic solution, and thus swelling-induced short circuit currents were significantly reduced in the TMEM16A−/− colon (Fig. 7, F and G). Taken together the data clearly indicate that TMEM16A channels contribute to volume-regulated Cl− currents in native mouse epithelial cells. The present results suggest that volume-regulated Cl− channels may be composed of different members of the TMEM16 family, probably in a tissue-specific manner, thus giving rise to variable properties of ICl,swell in different cell types and tissues (9Fürst J. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Bottà G. Jakab M. Mayer M. Garavaglia L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmüller S. Wöll E. Paulmichl M. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As these channels also control apoptotic cell shrinkage, they may affect cell survival, which could explain the role of these proteins in tumor development (13Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2168497148,"Background The importance of dopamine (DA) for prefrontal cortical (PFC) cognitive functions is widely recognized, but its mechanisms of action remain controversial. DA is thought to increase signal gain in active networks according to an inverted U dose-response curve, and these effects may depend on both tonic and phasic release of DA from midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings We used patch-clamp recordings in organotypic co-cultures of the PFC, hippocampus and VTA to study DA modulation of spontaneous network activity in the form of Up-states and signals in the form of synchronous EPSP trains. These cultures possessed a tonic DA level and stimulation of the VTA evoked DA transients within the PFC. The addition of high (≥1 µM) concentrations of exogenous DA to the cultures reduced Up-states and diminished excitatory synaptic inputs (EPSPs) evoked during the Down-state. Increasing endogenous DA via bath application of cocaine also reduced Up-states. Lower concentrations of exogenous DA (0.1 µM) had no effect on the up-state itself, but they selectively increased the efficiency of a train of EPSPs to evoke spikes during the Up-state. When the background DA was eliminated by depleting DA with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, or by preparing corticolimbic co-cultures without the VTA slice, Up-states could be enhanced by low concentrations (0.1–1 µM) of DA that had no effect in the VTA containing cultures. Finally, in spite of the concentration-dependent effects on Up-states, exogenous DA at all but the lowest concentrations increased intracellular current-pulse evoked firing in all cultures underlining the complexity of DA's effects in an active network. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these data show concentration-dependent effects of DA on global PFC network activity and they demonstrate a mechanism through which optimal levels of DA can modulate signal gain to support cognitive functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2097556395,"Background Using tools to act on non-food objects—for example, to make other tools—is considered to be a hallmark of human intelligence, and may have been a crucial step in our evolution. One form of this behaviour, ‘sequential tool use’, has been observed in a number of non-human primates and even in one bird, the New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides). While sequential tool use has often been interpreted as evidence for advanced cognitive abilities, such as planning and analogical reasoning, the behaviour itself can be underpinned by a range of different cognitive mechanisms, which have never been explicitly examined. Here, we present experiments that not only demonstrate new tool-using capabilities in New Caledonian crows, but allow examination of the extent to which crows understand the physical interactions involved. Methodology/Principal Findings In two experiments, we tested seven captive New Caledonian crows in six tasks requiring the use of up to three different tools in a sequence to retrieve food. Our study incorporated several novel features: (i) we tested crows on a three-tool problem (subjects were required to use a tool to retrieve a second tool, then use the second tool to retrieve a third one, and finally use the third one to reach for food); (ii) we presented tasks of different complexity in random rather than progressive order; (iii) we included a number of control conditions to test whether tool retrieval was goal-directed; and (iv) we manipulated the subjects' pre-testing experience. Five subjects successfully used tools in a sequence (four from their first trial), and four subjects repeatedly solved the three-tool condition. Sequential tool use did not require, but was enhanced by, pre-training on each element in the sequence (‘chaining’), an explanation that could not be ruled out in earlier studies. By analyzing tool choice, tool swapping and improvement over time, we show that successful subjects did not use a random probing strategy. However, we find no firm evidence to support previous claims that sequential tool use demonstrates analogical reasoning or human-like planning. Conclusions/Significance While the ability of subjects to use three tools in sequence reveals a competence beyond that observed in any other species, our study also emphasises the importance of parsimony in comparative cognitive science: seemingly intelligent behaviour can be achieved without the involvement of high-level mental faculties, and detailed analyses are necessary before accepting claims for complex cognitive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W1979681812,"There are three types of cell death; apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. The possibility that activation of the macroautophagy (autophagy) pathway may increase beta cell death is addressed in this study. Increased autophagy was present in pancreatic islets from Pdx1(+/-) mice with reduced insulin secretion and beta cell mass. Pdx1 expression was reduced in mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells by delivering small hairpin RNAs using a lentiviral vector. The MIN6 cells died after 7 days of Pdx1 deficiency, and autophagy was evident prior to the onset of cell death. Inhibition of autophagy prolonged cell survival and delayed cell death. Nutrient deprivation increased autophagy in MIN6 cells and mouse and human islets after starvation. Autophagy inhibition partly prevented amino acid starvation-induced MIN6 cell death. The in vivo effects of reduced autophagy were studied by crossing Pdx1(+/-) mice to Becn1(+/-) mice. After 1 week on a high fat diet, 4-week-old Pdx1(+/-) Becn1(+/-) mice showed normal glucose tolerance, preserved beta cell function, and increased beta cell mass compared with Pdx1(+/-) mice. This protective effect of reduced autophagy had worn off after 7 weeks on a high fat diet. Increased autophagy contributes to pancreatic beta cell death in Pdx1 deficiency and following nutrient deprivation. The role of autophagy should be considered in studies of pancreatic beta cell death and diabetes and as a target for novel therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2123524329,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus associated with both HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), which is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease, and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP is known to be as follows: HTLV-1-infected T cells trigger a hyperimmune response leading to neuroinflammation. However, the HTLV-1-infected T cell subset that plays a major role in the accelerated immune response has not yet been identified.Here, we demonstrate that CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T cells are the predominant viral reservoir, and their levels are increased in HAM/TSP patients. While CCR4 is known to be selectively expressed on T helper type 2 (Th2), Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in healthy individuals, we demonstrate that IFN-gamma production is extraordinarily increased and IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and Foxp3 expression is decreased in the CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T cells of HAM/TSP patients as compared to those in healthy individuals, and the alteration in function is specific to this cell subtype. Notably, the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+)Foxp3(-) T cells is dramatically increased in HAM/TSP patients, and this was found to be correlated with disease activity and severity.We have defined a unique T cell subset--IFN-gamma(+)CCR4(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells--that is abnormally increased and functionally altered in this retrovirus-associated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2099600724,"Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that are sensitive to pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ. IFN-γ-inducible murine p47 GTPases have been demonstrated to function in resistance to chlamydia infection in vivo and in vitro. Because the human genome does not encode IFN-γ-inducible homologues of these proteins, the significance of the p47 GTPase findings to chlamydia pathogenesis in humans is unclear. Here we report a pair of IFN-γ-inducible proteins, the human guanylate binding proteins (hGBPs) 1 and 2 that potentiate the anti-chlamydial properties of IFN-γ. hGBP1 and 2 localize to the inclusion membrane, and their anti-chlamydial functions required the GTPase domain. Alone, hGBP1 or 2 have mild, but statistically significant and reproducible negative effects on the growth of Chlamydia trachomatis, whilst having potent anti-chlamydial activity in conjunction with treatment with a sub-inhibitory concentration of IFN-γ. Thus, hGBPs appear to potentiate the anti-chlamydial effects of IFN-γ. Indeed, depletion of hGBP1 and 2 in cells treated with IFN-γ led to an increase in inclusion size, indicative of better growth. Interestingly, chlamydia species/strains harboring the full-length version of the putative cytotoxin gene, which has been suggested to confer resistance to IFN-γ was not affected by hGBP overexpression. These findings identify the guanylate binding proteins as potentiators of IFN-γ inhibition of C. trachomatis growth, and may be the targets of the chlamydial cytotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2060911649,"Impaired epithelial barrier function plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon-γ (IFNγ), are believed to be prominently involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn disease. Treatment of T84 intestinal epithelial cells with IFNγ severely impairs their barrier properties measured as transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) or permeability and reduces the expression of tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). However, little is known about the signaling events that are involved. The cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), is activated in response to cellular stress, as occurs during inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible role for AMPK in mediating IFNγ-induced effects on the intestinal epithelial barrier. We found that IFNγ activates AMPK by phosphorylation, independent of intracellular energy levels. Inhibition of AMPK prevents, at least in part, the IFNγ-induced decrease in TER. Furthermore, AMPK knockdown prevented the increased epithelial permeability, the decreased TER, and the decrease in occludin and ZO-1 caused by IFNγ treatment of T84 cells. However, AMPK activity alone was not sufficient to cause alterations in epithelial barrier function. These data show a novel role for AMPK, in concert with other signals induced by IFNγ, in mediating reduced epithelial barrier function in a cell model of chronic intestinal inflammation.

Geller S.A. Greenstein A.J. Marin R.H. Gordon R.E. Aufses Jr., A.H. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1983; 78: 355-364PubMed Google Scholar) leads to increased exposure of the immune system to commensal bacteria. Along with possible genetic defects in bacterial sensing, this might contribute to a dysregulated immune response leading to further epithelial damage and active episodes of IBD (4Wehkamp J. Schmid M. Fellermann K. Stange E.F. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 77: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Epithelial barrier dysfunction in CD is characterized by alterations in intercellular tight junctions (5Zeissig S. Bürgel N. Günzel D. Richter J. Mankertz J. Wahnschaffe U. Kroesen A.J. Zeitz M. Fromm M. Schulzke J.D. Gut. 2007; 56: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), as well as by an excessive loss of water and salt into the lumen. An important immunological marker in CD is the existence of excessively high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon gamma (IFNγ) (6Fuss I.J. Neurath M. Boirivant M. Klein J.S. de la Motte C. Strong S.A. Fiocchi C. Strober W. J.

IFNγ treatment of intestinal epithelial cell monolayers severely compromises their barrier integrity. Most importantly from a functional perspective, IFNγ causes a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and increases epithelial permeability (7Madara J.L. Stafford J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 8Watson C.J. Hoare C.J. Garrod D.R. Carlson G.L. Warhurst G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5221-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These defects closely resemble observations in CD, where there is a disruption of intercellular tight junctional complexes. This effect is due to disruption of the apical actin cytoskeleton in conjunction with decreased expression, as well as increased internalization, of important tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (8Watson C.J.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2009; 29: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, induction of epithelial apoptosis by IFNγ is believed to contribute little to barrier dysfunction (12Bruewer M. Luegering A. Kucharzik T. Parkos C.A. Madara J.L. Hopkins A.M. Nusrat A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). IFNγ also induces further alterations in epithelial function that include reduced expression of various ion transporters and associated decreases in epithelial ion transport (13Bertelsen L.S. Eckmann L. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 286: G157-G165Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Sugi K. Musch M.W. Field M. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1393-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite the influence of IFNγ on a number of epithelial functions, relatively little is known about intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating its effects following receptor activation. Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) in mediating IFNγ-induced effects on epithelial barrier function (11Boivin M.A. Roy P.K. Bradley A. Kennedy J.C. Rihani T. Ma T.Y. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2009; 29: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15McKay D.M. Watson J.L. Wang A. Caldwell J. Prescott D. Ceponis P.M. Di Leo. V. Lu J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to be the only regulatory pathway involved. Indeed, increased expression of receptors for tumor necrosis factor core family members, such as the tumor necrosis factor receptor and LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxin, shows inducible expression and competes with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes), can also occur in response to IFNγ and lead to changes in intestinal barrier function (16Taylor C.T.

The effects of IFNγ in intestinal epithelial cells resemble, at least in part, those of the cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Upon activation, AMPK restores intracellular ATP levels by stimulating energy-producing pathways, such as glucose uptake (19Fryer L.G. Hajduch E. Rencurel F. Salt I.P. Hundal H.S. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1978-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and glycolysis, while inhibiting energy-consuming pathways, such as the synthesis of fatty acids or triglycerides (20Marsin A.S.

Trans. 2002; 30: 1064-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In the intestine, energy-consuming processes include epithelial ion transport, and, indeed, AMPK has been shown to decrease intestinal ATP-consuming ion transport as well as the synthesis of various proteins (22Hallows K.R.

Moreover, it has previously been demonstrated that ion transport processes are suppressed in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients (24Greig E.R. Boot-Handford R.P. Mani V. Sandle G.I. J.

Riecken E.O. Schulzke J.D. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 915: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). AMPK is usually activated in response to cellular stress that depletes intracellular ATP and elevates the AMP:ATP ratio (27Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 28Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). AMPK-activating conditions include oxidative stress (29Choi S.L. Kim S.J. Lee K.T. Kim J. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Soo Kim S. Ha J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), hypoxia (30Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Further, binding of AMP to AMPK makes AMPK a better substrate for upstream kinase activation, resulting in phosphorylation of the catalytic α-subunit of AMPK on the Thr172 residue and subsequently in a 50- to 100-fold activation of the enzyme (32Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A number of upstream kinases for AMPK have been identified, with LKB1 (33Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr.

However, recent studies also indicate that PI3K can activate AMPK (38Huang N.L. Chiang S.H. Hsueh C.H. Liang Y.J. Chen Y.J. Lai L.P. Int. J.

The goal of this study was to determine whether AMPK mediates IFNγ-induced alterations in intestinal epithelial barrier function. We found that IFNγ activates AMPK in intestinal epithelial cells and AMPK inhibition prevents, at least in part, IFNγ-induced barrier dysfunction. Our data indicate a novel role for the cellular energy sensor, AMPK, in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier properties in a cell model of chronic inflammation. These findings may have implications for barrier function in the setting of chronic inflammatory processes, such as IBD. Human IFNγ (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), Compound C (Calbiochem), LY294002 (Calbiochem), carbachol (Sigma), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Sigma), rabbit anti-lamin A/C-antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-phospho-AMPKα (Thr172) antibody, rabbit anti-AMPK-α antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody, and rabbit anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA) were obtained from the sources noted. Mouse anti-claudin-2 antibody, mouse anti-claudin-4 antibody, rabbit-anti-occludin antibody, and mouse-anti-ZO-1 antibody were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and acquired commercially. Human colonic T84 epithelial cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 as described previously (40Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. Cells were separated by trypsinization, and 1 × 106 cells were seeded onto either 12- or 30-mm Millicell-HA semipermeable filter supports (Millipore, Bedford, MA). When seeded on filters, T84 cells develop monolayers with the polarized phenotype of native intestinal epithelial cells (41Madara J.L. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Before treatment, cells were cultured for 8–14 days. According to its receptor localization, IFNγ (1000 units/ml) was added basolaterally while Compound C (50 μm) and LY294002 (20 μm) were added bilaterally. After stimulation, T84 cells were washed three times with ice-cold Ringer's solution (140 mm Na+, 5.2 mm K+, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 0.8 mm Mg2+, 120 mm Cl−, 25 mm HCO3−, 2.4 mm H2PO4−, 0.4 mm HPO42−, 10 mm glucose) and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA in PBS) for 45 min. T84 cells were scraped from the filters, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. Cell lysate supernatants were assayed for protein content using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). An aliquot of each lysate was mixed with an equal amount of 2× gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 4 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 1% blocking solution, and an appropriate concentration of primary antibody was added in 1% blocking buffer over night. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (1% TBST) for 1 h, horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-mouse- or anti-rabbit-IgG-antibody (BD Biosciences) in 1% blocking solution (1:2500) was added for 30 min, and membranes were washed for 1 h with 1% TBST. Finally, immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed by using Image software (National Institutes of Health). T84 cells were seeded on 0.6-cm2 semi-permeable filter supports for 8–10 days. After treatment, cells were washed twice with warm Ringer's solution. Cellular ATP levels were assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, equal volumes of Ringer's and CellTiter-Glo reagent were added apically to lyse the cells. After 10-min shaking, cells were scraped off the filters, and luminescence was read with open range settings on a SpectraMax Fluorescence Microplate reader using the SoftMax Pro v5 software (both from Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To normalize cellular ATP levels, the cellular double strand DNA content was analyzed using the Quant-itTM Pico Green dsDNA Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T84 cells were seeded onto either 12- or 30-mm semi-permeable filter supports (pore size, 0.45 μm) and cultured for ∼10 days until the TER was at least 900 Ohm.cm2. The TER of each monolayer was then assessed before and after treatment using a voltohmeter (WPI, Sarasota, FL) and companion electrodes (Millipore). To normalize the variation in the absolute TER values of each monolayer, the data are expressed as the percentage of pre-treatment TER values (15McKay D.M. Watson J.L. Wang A. Caldwell J. Prescott D.

After treatment, T84 cell monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers with a window area of 0.6 cm2 and bathed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Ringer's solution at 37 °C. Using short-circuit current (Isc) the monolayers were continuously voltage-clamped to zero potential difference. Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before baseline Isc and conductance were assessed. Changes in Isc (ΔIsc) under these conditions are exclusively due to changes in electrogenic chloride secretion (43Cartwright C.A. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and were measured for a period of 20 min after stimulation with carbachol (100 μm, basolaterally). Conductance was calculated according to Ohm's law as mS/cm2. 2 × 106 T84 cells were seeded 3 days before transfection and grown to 50–70% confluency in T75 flasks. Three different annealed Silencer pre-designed siRNA oligonucleotides targeting AMPKα1 were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). For transfection reactions, 100 pmol of each of the three gene-specific siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into T84 cells using the Amaxa nucleofector system (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, T84 cells were cultured on filter membranes for 48 h before further treatment. A nonspecific control siRNA SMARTpool (100 pmol, Upstate Biotechnology/Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) was used as a negative control. Transepithelial permeability was assessed by measuring the flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran, 10 kDa, Sigma) across T84 cell monolayers. Following treatment, T84 cells were washed (3×) with Ringer's solution and incubated in Ringer's solution for 30 min at 37 °C to equilibrate. FITC-dextran (1 mg/ml) was added to the apical side of the monolayer. 1 h later, 100 μl of the basolateral solution was removed, and fluorescence of FITC-dextran in this compartment was detected using excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm. T84 cells were seeded onto 12-mm Millicell-HA filters for 2 days after siRNA transfection and before stimulation. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 10% Formalin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed (3×) with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were blocked with 20% donkey serum (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h and washed with PBS once. Mouse anti-ZO-1 antibody (1 μg/ml) in 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS was applied overnight. Cells were washed (3×) with PBS and secondary Alexa-488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (excitation/emission maxima at 495/519 nm, Molecular Probes) was added in a 1:500 dilution in 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed (3×) with PBS, incubated with Hoechst 33258 (excitation/emission maxima at 352/461 nm, Molecular Probes) in PBS (1:500) for 20 min at room temperature, and washed four times with PBS. Finally, the cells on the filter membrane were transferred onto glass slides and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal system on a Zeiss Axioscope 2 Upright Microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Data were analyzed using the Zeiss LSM 5 Image Examiner software. Data are presented as means ± S.E. for a series of n experiments. Data are expressed as raw data, arbitrary units or as a percentage of the respective control. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test unless otherwise noted. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. To study whether the cellular energy sensor, AMPK, participates in IFNγ-induced effects on epithelial barrier function, we initially investigated whether IFNγ activates AMPK. Polarized monolayers of T84 cells were treated with IFNγ at a concentration of 1000 units/ml for 0.5–72 h. At this concentration, IFNγ has been shown to exert significant effects on intestinal epithelial cell barrier properties (7Madara J.L. Stafford J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 44Fish S.M. Proujansky R. Reenstra W.W. Gut. 1999; 45: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 45Uribe J.M. McCole D.F. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G923-G931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a previous study by Sasaki et al. (46Sasaki T. Hiwatashi N. Yamazaki H. Noguchi M. Toyota T. Gastroenterol. Jpn. 1992; 27: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), cultured biopsies from patients with active CD were shown to release IFNγ at levels as high as ∼1000 units/ml/mg of tissue, although the mean level was 75 ± 215 units/ml/mg of tissue. So, although the majority of our data were generated using 1000 units/ml (100 ng/ml) of IFNγ (in contrast to a number of other studies that used 10 or 20 ng/ml IFNγ), the experimental use of this concentration is not unreasonable. IFNγ treatment for 6 h caused maximal activation of AMPK in human T84 intestinal epithelial cells as assessed by phosphorylation of Thr172 of the AMPK catalytic α1-subunit, which is an established marker of AMPK activation (47Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Representative Western blots showed that IFNγ stimulated AMPK activation as early as 30 min after treatment; thereafter phosphorylation increased in a time-dependent manner reaching a peak at 6 h (Fig. 1A). Thereafter AMPK phosphorylation declined in a time-dependent manner almost to control levels by 48 and 72 h of IFNγ treatment (Fig. 1B). To assess concentration-dependent effects of IFNγ on the phosphorylation of AMPK, we administered 10, 100, and 1000 units/ml IFNγ for 6 h, the time point showing a maximal IFNγ effect on AMPK phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1C, a concentration of 1000 units/ml IFNγ caused the strongest increase in AMPK phosphorylation in our cell model, whereas reduced effects were seen with of 10 and 100 units/ml IFNγ. Furthermore, the pharmacological AMPK inhibitor, Compound C (CC, 50 μm), which competes with intracellular ATP for binding to AMPK (48Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar), prevented the IFNγ-induced activation of AMPK (Fig. 1D). In a separate and as yet unpublished study, we generated a concentration curve for the inhibitory effect of CC on AMPK activation and observed peak inhibition with a dose of 50 μm CC (data not shown). Therefore, we used this inhibitor concentration for subsequent experiments. Of note, 50 μm CC is at the lower end of the standard range for AMPK inhibition in epithelial cells: Walker et al. (23Walker J. Jijon H.B. Churchill T. Kulka M. Madsen K.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 285: G850-G860Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) used 75 μm CC in their T84 cell studies and Woollhead et al. (49Woollhead A.M. Baines D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5158-5168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) used 80 μm CC in their studies in lung epithelial cells, although lower doses may be required for other cell types such as endothelial cells (50Blume C. Benz P.M. Walter U. Ha J. Kemp B.E. Renné T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4601-461250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because AMPK is usually activated by declining levels of intracellular ATP, we next investigated if AMPK activation in response to IFNγ was dependent on the intracellular ATP level. T84 cells were treated with IFNγ for 0.5–72 h. Treatment with H2O2 (100 μm; 30 min, bilaterally) was used as a positive control to deplete ATP (51DuVall M.D. Guo Y. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1313-C1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, IFNγ treatment had no significant effect on intracellular ATP at any time point. Although the cellular ATP level declined somewhat within 3 h of IFNγ treatment, this effect was not significant and therefore unlikely to explain IFNγ-induced AMPK activation, which occurred as early as 30 min after addition of IFNγ. Additionally, long term treatment with IFNγ for up to 72 h did not significantly alter the cellular ATP level, correlating with a lack of AMPK phosphorylation at these time points. In contrast, H2O2 significantly reduced ATP levels within 30 min (Fig. 2). These data indicate that IFNγ activates AMPK independent of changes in intracellular ATP. Long term treatment with IFNγ decreases TER across T84 cell monolayers. Because AMPK is activated by IFNγ, our next goal was"

Saliva is thought to be essential for the superior oral wound healing, but the involved mechanism is still unclear. We have previously discovered that a human-specific peptide, histatin, might be implicated in the wound-healing properties of saliva. Here we report that histatin enhances reepithelialization in a human full-skin wound model closely resembling normal skin. The peptide does not stimulate proliferation but induces cell spreading and migration, two key initiating steps in reepithelialization. Activation of cells by histatin requires a G-protein-coupled receptor that activates the ERK1/2 pathway. Using a stepwise-truncation method, we determined the minimal domain (SHREFPFYGDYGS) of the 38-mer-parent peptide that is required for activity. Strikingly, N- to C-terminal cyclization of histatin-1 potentiates the molar activity ̃1000-fold, indicating that the recognition of histatin by its cognate receptor requires a specific spatial conformation of the peptide. Our results emphasize the importance of histatin in human saliva for tissue protection and recovery and establish the experimental basis for the development of synthetic histatins as novel skin wound-healing agents.—Oudhoff, M.

https://openalex.org/W2052103041,"Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a prototypic family member of CCCH-type tandem zinc-finger domain proteins that regulate mRNA destabilization in eukaryotic cells. TTP binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-untranslated region of certain mRNAs, including tumor necrosis factor α, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and immediate early response 3, thereby facilitating their ARE-mediated decay. Expression of TTP is up-regulated by a variety of agents, including inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α, a prominent activator of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors. Accordingly, TTP is involved in the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB through promoting mRNA degradation. We describe here a novel, ARE-mediated decay-independent function of TTP on the termination of NF-κB response: TTP suppresses the transcriptional activity of NF-κB-dependent promoters independent of its mRNA-destabilizing property. In TTP knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, lack of TTP leads to enhanced nuclear p65 levels, which is associated with the up-regulation of specific, ARE-less NF-κB target genes. We find that attenuation of NF-κB activity is at least in part due to an interference of TTP with the nuclear import of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor. This novel role of TTP may synergize with its mRNA-degrading function to contribute to the efficient regulation of proinflammatory gene expression.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that this phosphoprotein is composed of a tandem zinc-finger structure, as well as its reported nuclear localization, initially led to the assumption that it might function as a transcriptional regulator (8DuBois R.N.

However, investigations over the last decade have demonstrated that TTP binds to and accelerates the degradation of mRNAs exhibiting high turnover rates (e.g. cytokines, growth factors, or proto-oncogenes) (11Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mRNAs are characterized by AU-rich element (ARE) motifs in their 3′- untranslated regions that serve as docking sites for RNA-binding proteins. TTP was shown to bind a subset of these AREs, and the nonamer UUAUUUAUU was identified as the minimal complete binding site (13Worthington M.T. Pelo J.W. Sachedina M.A. Applegate J.L. Arseneau K.O. Pizarro T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48558-48564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The motif is recognized by the tandem CCCH-type zinc-finger domain of TTP, and the integrity of this domain has been shown to be indispensable for mRNA degradation because a single mutation within either zinc-finger abolishes the ARE binding activity (14Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). TTP exhibits no enzymatic activity itself but recruits various components of the basic RNA decay machinery via its N- and C-terminal domains (15Hau H.H. Walsh R.J. Ogilvie R.L. Williams D.A.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs is regulated mainly by extracellular cues. Typically, TTP target mRNAs are degraded rapidly in unstimulated cells but become transiently stabilized in response to activation. Several signaling pathways were shown to be involved in the control of ARE-mediated decay, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-MK2 pathway which accounts for direct phosphorylation of mouse TTP in response to lipopolysaccharide. Importantly, this phosphorylation stabilizes the TTP protein but abrogates its ability to degrade mRNAs, resulting in the accumulation of the known target tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (17Chrestensen C.A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 25: S1-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), is up-regulated in TTP knock-out (ko) mice, leading to a complex syndrome of inflammatory arthritis (21Taylor G.A. Carballo E.

In addition to TNFα, the turnover of several other mRNAs is controlled by TTP, including granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, cyclooxygenase-2, immediate early response 3, as well as the interleukins IL-2, -3, -6, and -10 (11Carballo E.

One of the main signaling pathways triggered by TNFα is the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB comprises a family of transcription factors (p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2)) that form homo- and heterodimers, as well as the inhibitory subunits IκBα, -β, and -ϵ. Engagement of TNF receptor superfamily members leads to the activation of the classical NF-κB signaling cascade via recruitment of adaptor proteins (FADD (Fas-associated death domain), TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain), and TRAFs (TNF receptor-associated factors)) to the cytoplasmic part of the receptor complex (25Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). The TRAF·receptor-interacting protein complex subsequently recruits and activates TAK1, leading to further activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (26Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). IKKs in turn phosphorylate IκBs, thus promoting their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This results in unmasking of the NF-κB/p65 nuclear localization signal (NLS), enabling its nuclear translocation. p65 contains a classical monopartite NLS, which is characterized by 4–6 basic amino acid residues, and it has been shown that the karyopherin importin α3 specifically binds the p65-NLS (27Fagerlund R. Kinnunen L. Köhler M. Julkunen I. Melén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15942-15951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas importin β is responsible for docking to the nuclear pore complex. Nevertheless, it is not well established so far how nuclear shuttling of the known diversity of transcription factors is selectively timed and regulated, but the variety of differently structured nuclear localization signals is known to contribute to the specific recognition by various karyopherins (28Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32–33: 76-83Crossref Google Scholar, 29Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Besides the tight regulation of p65 nuclear import, further activation of NF-κB is achieved through posttranslational modifications. For example, phosphorylation of serine-threonine residues in either the N-terminal Rel homology domain of p65, which accounts for dimerization and DNA binding, or the C-terminal transcriptional activation domains (TA1 and TA2), is linked to enhanced binding of coactivator proteins, increased nuclear localization and stability, as well as to supporting the connection with the basal transcriptional apparatus (reviewed in reference 30Campbell K.J. Perkins N.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 1087-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, other signaling pathways and transcription factors, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) or CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), often act in cooperation with NF-κB to contribute to the expression of inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the recruitment of nuclear coactivators, acting mainly on chromatin relaxation (e.g. the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 and the nuclear kinase MSK1), is a critical step in building an “enhanceosome” to modulate general levels of gene expression (31Vanden Berghe W. De Bosscher K. Boone E. Plaisance S. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32091-32098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We show here that TTP attenuates NF-κB activity independently of its ability to destabilize mRNAs in human and murine cells. Further, we demonstrate that TTP interferes with NF-κB activation at least in part by impairing nuclear translocation of p65 leading to the selective regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. These findings reveal a previously unknown function of TTP and suggest that this protein might play a broader role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes.

Human mycTTP was generated by PCR from the RZPD clone IRAK p961M0614Q2 and ligated into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pCMV-myc (Clontech). MycTZF (amino acids 97–173) and mycC124R were generated by subcloning and in vitro mutagenesis, respectively. Oligonucleotide sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cords as described (37Zhang W.J. Wojta J. Binder B.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and maintained in medium 199 (Lonza) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone, 5 units/ml heparin, and 25 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Promocell). HEK 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (38Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MEF as well as HUVEC were transfected using the polyethyleneimine method (39Baker A. Saltik M. Lehrmann H. Killisch I. Mautner V. Lamm G. Christofori G. Cotten M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of TTP was performed using the Stealth® custom siRNA pool for TTP (Invitrogen). The sequences are given in supplemental Table 1. HEK 293 cells were grown in 24-well plates, MEF and HUVEC in 12-well plates. Cells were transfected as described with the indicated reporter and/or expression plasmids using 4 μg of total DNA. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 16 h prior to harvesting. All experiments were performed in triplicate and are representative of at least three independent experiments. Luciferase values were normalized for cotransfected β-galactosidase or GFP and are illustrated as mean fold induction. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean. Differences between samples were analyzed using a paired Student's t test. Two-tailed probability values of <0.05 and <0.01 were considered significant and highly significant, respectively. p values are given within the figure legends. For p65 nuclear translocation and IκBα degradation, cells were grown and transfected in 6-cm (HEK 293 cells) or 10-cm dishes (MEF). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα (mouse or human rTNFα; R&D Systems) for the indicated time points. Cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere (40Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Carmona E.M. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1405-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For determination of total p65, cells were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences), and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with the first antibody overnight (4 °C). The following antibodies were used: α-myc (sc-40), α-β-actin (sc-1616), α-p65 (sc-109), α-IκBα (sc-203), and α-SP1 (sc-59), all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. α-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from Chemicon (monoclonal antibody 374). The α-TNFα blocking antibody (AF-410-NA; R&D Systems) was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The α-TTP antibody was kindly provided by P. Kovarik. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies α-rabbit IgG, α-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and α-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as secondary reagents. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (West Pico, Pierce & ECL Detection Reagents; Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis of nuclear p65 levels was done using the background-corrected integrated densities of the p65 bands normalized to the SP-1 bands assessed by ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated Lab Tek II chamber slides (Nunc), transfected with either empty vector or mycTTP, and stimulated 24 h later with 20 ng/ml TNFα for the indicated times. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunostaining of p65 was done using the rabbit α-p65 antibody (sc-109, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mycTTP was detected with mouse α-myc antibody (sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by goat α-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and APC goat α-mouse (BD Biosciences) secondary reagents at dilutions of 1:5000 and 1:500, respectively. For NFAT translocation, cells were transfected with GFP-NFATc and mycTTP expression vectors as described above and stimulated with ionomycin (500 mm final concentration; Sigma). Total RNA was isolated from either HEK 293 cells or MEF grown in 6-well plates using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer's recommendations. Real time PCR was performed in a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using SYBR Green for detection. Experiments were done in triplicate, and the relative amount of mRNA was calculated using the Pfaffl method and normalization to β2- micoglobulin. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean. Primer sequences are given in supplemental Table 1. Our investigations of negative feedback regulators and potential contributors to the resolution phase of the inflammatory process resulted in the observation that TTP has the capacity to suppress the transcriptional activity of different promoters of inflammatory genes. TTP reduced basal as well as TNFα-stimulated luciferase expression driven by the human IL-8 (Fig. 1A) or tissue factor promoter (Fig. 1B) in HEK 293 cells. These promoters contain binding sites for various transcription factors, including C/EBP, activator protein-1, SP-1, and NF-κB. To gain mechanistic insight into which transcription factor or signaling pathway was affected by TTP, we used a truncated version of the IL-8 promoter containing only one NF-κB site ∼100 bp upstream of the transcriptional start. This modified promoter responded similarly to TTP as did the full-length promoters (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the NF-κB site accounted for TTP sensitivity. Consequently, we analyzed a minimal artificial promoter containing a multimerized NF-κB binding site and observed that it was also potently inhibited by TTP (Fig. 2A). These findings could be reproduced in other cell types such as HeLa and HUVEC (data not shown). Conversely, the lack of TTP generates conditions of a “preactivated” state in ko fibroblasts, reflected by a ∼10-fold higher basal NF-κB level in TTP-deficient cells (Fig. 2B, left). Furthermore, knock-down of endogenous TTP in HUVEC by RNA interference enhanced NF-κB activity (Fig. 2B, right), recapitulating the situation observed in TTP ko MEF. Similar results were obtained in HEK 293 cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). The functionality of the siRNA was verified on the mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein level (supplemental Fig. 1A, bottom panels). In addition, reconstitution of TTP expression by transient transfection into TTP ko cells resulted in a 5×NF-κB activity that was comparable with that observed in WT cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). Importantly, TTP did not decrease the basal and induced transcriptional activity of either minimal SP-1 or p53 or NFAT-dependent promoters, as shown in Fig. 2D, demonstrating specificity and ruling out possible effects on the reporter plasmids. Additionally, we did not observe any influence of TTP on the degradation of luciferase mRNA (supplemental Fig. 1C). Together, this demonstrates that TTP specifically interferes with transcriptional activation triggered by the transcription factor NF-κB.FIGURE 2Specificity toward NF-κB activity. A, HEK 293 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by a minimal NF-κB promoter containing five NF-κB binding sites (5×NF-κB-luc; top), and luciferase activity was analyzed as described in Fig. 1. **, p < 0.01, compared with the respective empty vector (EV) samples. B, lack of TTP triggers NF-κB activity. Left, 5×NF-κB promoter activity was analyzed in WT versus TTP ko MEF. Luciferase levels were normalized to cotransfected β-galactosidase. Right, HUVEC were transfected with the 5×NF-κB-luc reporter along with a siRNA directed against TTP (siTTP) or a scrambled control (Scr), and luciferase activity normalized to coexpressed GFP was assessed 48 h after transfection. **, p < 0.01, compared with WT (left) or the scrambled control (right). C, real time PCR analysis of TTP mRNA levels normalized to β2-microglobulin in HUVEC was done 48 h after transfection with either siTTP or the scrambled control used in B. A representative experiment is shown. D, TTP does not bias NF-κB-independent promoters. HEK 293 cells were transfected with a SP-1 (left), a p53 (center), or a NFAT promoter-dependent (right) luciferase reporter gene in the presence (TTP) or absence of TTP (EV). Luciferase activities were analyzed in the absence (control) or presence of cotransfected SP-1, p53, or NFAT expression plasmids, respectively. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, compared with the respective empty vector samples.

Activation of NF-κB by TRAF2 or TAK1/TAB1, acting upstream of the IKK complex, did not result in the abrogation of TTP-mediated NF-κB inhibition (Fig. 3A). Moreover, TTP also potently inhibited IKK2- and even NF-κB/p65-mediated activation of the 5×NF-κB reporter in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that it acts downstream or at the level of p65. In addition, overexpression of p65 did not impede TTP action in WT or in reconstituted ko MEF (supplemental Fig. 2A). Further examination of TTP effects on p65-induced IL-8 promoter activity (supplemental Fig. 2B) confirmed the results obtained for the artificial NF-κB promoter. Increasing amounts of p65 expression levels could not overcome the TTP-mediated inhibition (Fig. 3C), and in addition, attenuation of NF-κB activity occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). We observed 50% inhibition of p65-mediated luciferase activity at ∼7 ng of cotransfected TTP. Because overexpression of p65 might bypass its natural regulation through the IκBs, we examined a possible influence of TTP on IκBα degradation. We found that TTP did not prevent TNFα-induced IκBα degradation, neither in HEK 293 cells after overexpression (Fig. 3E, top), nor was it altered in TTP ko compared with WT MEF (Fig. 3E, bottom). Another important step prior to transcriptional activation by NF-κB is the recruitment of nuclear coactivators, such as CBP/p300 or activating kinases like MSK1, into the transcriptional activation complex. Analysis of these nuclear signaling components in transient transfection experiments, using the respective expression vectors, revealed that neither of them could dampen the inhibitory TTP effect (Fig. 3F). To exclude that TTP affects p65 mRNA or protein, we analyzed these levels in HEK 293 cells after TTP overexpression (supplemental Fig. 2C, left) and in TTP k"
https://openalex.org/W1973310873,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease of significant morbidity and mortality in both human and animals in endemic areas. There is no vaccine towards the bacterium available in the market, and the efficacy of many of the bacterium's surface and secreted proteins are currently being evaluated as vaccine candidates.With the availability of the B. pseudomallei whole genome sequence, we undertook to identify genes encoding the known immunogenic outer membrane protein A (OmpA). Twelve OmpA domains were identified and ORFs containing these domains were fully annotated. Of the 12 ORFs, two of these OmpAs, Omp3 and Omp7, were successfully cloned, expressed as soluble protein and purified. Both proteins were recognised by antibodies in melioidosis patients' sera by Western blot analysis. Purified soluble fractions of Omp3 and Omp7 were assessed for their ability to protect BALB/c mice against B. pseudomallei infection. Mice were immunised with either Omp3 or Omp7, subsequently challenged with 1x10(6) colony forming units (cfu) of B. pseudomallei via the intraperitoneal route, and examined daily for 21 days post-challenge. This pilot study has demonstrated that whilst all control unimmunised mice died by day 9 post-challenge, two mice (out of 4) from both immunised groups survived beyond 21 days post-infection.We have demonstrated that B. pseudomallei OmpA proteins are immunogenic in mice as well as melioidosis patients and should be further assessed as potential vaccine candidates against B. pseudomallei infection."
https://openalex.org/W2060634231,"Background Among birds, corvids and parrots are prime candidates for advanced cognitive abilities. Still, hardly anything is known about cognitive similarities and dissimilarities between them. Recently, exclusion has gained increasing interest in comparative cognition. To select the correct option in an exclusion task, one option has to be rejected (or excluded) and the correct option may be inferred, which raises the possibility that causal understanding is involved. However, little is yet known about its evolutionary history, as only few species, and mainly mammals, have been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested ravens and keas in a choice task requiring the search for food in two differently shaped tubes. We provided the birds with partial information about the content of one of the two tubes and asked whether they could use this information to infer the location of the hidden food and adjust their searching behaviour accordingly. Additionally, this setup allowed us to investigate whether the birds would appreciate the impact of the shape of the tubes on the visibility of food. The keas chose the baited tube more often than the ravens. However, the ravens applied the more efficient strategy, choosing by exclusion more frequently than the keas. An additional experiment confirmed this, indicating that ravens and keas either differ in their cognitive skills or that they apply them differently. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that corvids and parrots may perform differently in cognitive tasks, highlighting the potential impact of different selection pressures on the cognitive evolution of these large-brained birds."

Biological membrane fusion is the regulated rearrangement of the lipids in two apposed sealed membranes to form one bilayer while mixing lumenal contents without leakage or lysis. It is fundamental for intracellular vesicular traffic, cell growth and division, regulated secretion of hormones and other blood proteins, and neurotransmission and thus has attracted wide and sustained study (1Jahn R.

Stable membrane proximity (docking) does not suffice for fusion.

These studies frequently employed liposomes or proteoliposomes of simple lipid composition, suggesting that fusion may not have stringent requirements of lipid head group species. However, each of these model fusion reactions is accompanied by substantial lysis (12Burgess S.W. McIntosh T.J. Lentz B.R.

We have studied membrane fusion with the vacuole (lysosome) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (reviewed in Ref. 16Ostrowicz C.W. Meiringer C.T. Ungermann C. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fusion of isolated vacuoles requires the Rab Ypt7p, 4 SNAREs (Vam3p, Vti1p, Vam7p, and Nyv1p), the SNARE chaperones Sec17p (α-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein)/Sec18p (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) and the hexameric HOPS complex (17Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and key “regulatory” lipids including ERG, phosphoinositides, and DAG (18Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HOPS interacts physically or functionally with each component of this fusion system. HOPS stably associates with Ypt7p in its GTP-bound state (19Seals D.F. Eitzen G. Margolis N. Wickner W.T. Price A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9402-9407Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). One HOPS subunit, Vps33p, is a member of the Sec1-Munc18 family of SNARE-binding proteins, and HOPS exhibits direct affinity for SNAREs (17Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W.

Cell. 2008; 19: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HOPS also has direct affinity for phosphoinositides (17Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The SNAREs on isolated vacuoles are in cis-complexes, which are disassembled by Sec17p, Sec18p, and ATP (24Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Docking requires Ypt7p (25Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and HOPS (17Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). During docking, vacuoles are drawn against each other until each has a substantial membrane domain tightly apposed to the other. Each of the proteins (26Wang L. Seeley E.S. Wickner W. Merz A.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and lipids (18Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) required for fusion becomes enriched in a ring-shaped microdomain, the “vertex ring,” which surrounds the two tightly apposed membrane domains. Not only do the proteins depend on each other, in a cascade fashion, for vertex ring enrichment, and the lipids depend on each other for their vertex ring enrichment as well, but the lipids and proteins are mutually interdependent for their enrichment at this ring-shaped microdomain (18Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Wang L. Merz A.J. Collins K.M. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fusion occurs around the ring, joining the two organelles. The fusion of vacuoles bearing physiological fusion constituents does not cause measurable organelle lysis, although fusion supported exclusively by higher levels of SNARE proteins is accompanied by massive lysis (28Starai V.J. Jun Y. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13551-13558Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in accord with model liposome studies (14Dennison S.M. Bowen M.E. Brunger A.T. Lentz B.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1661-1675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus fusion microdomain assembly and the coordinate action of SNAREs with other proteins and lipids to promote fusion without lysis are central topics in membrane fusion studies. Reconstitution of fusion with pure components allows chemical definition of essential elements of this biologically important reaction. Although SNAREs can drive a slow fusion of PC/PS proteoliposomes (29Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H.

Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The omission of either DAG, ERG, or phosphoinositide from the liposomes caused a marked reduction in fusion (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We now report that PE and PA are also necessary for rapid and efficient fusion, function in distinct manners, and are required for efficient assembly of newly formed SNARE complexes by the SNARE chaperones Sec17p/Sec18p and HOPS. Three yeast vacuolar SNAREs, Vam3p, Vti1p, and Nyv1p, were produced in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (Novagen) and purified as described previously (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W.

For Vam7p (yeast vacuolar Qc-SNARE), the GST and linker sequences upstream of VAM7 were deleted from the expression vector for GST-Vam7p (18Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J.

During the lipid mixing reactions, NBD fluorescence was monitored. For calculating the ratios of NBD fluorescence, F/F0, the fluorescence just before the Sec17p/Sec18p/HOPS addition (at 0 min) was used for F0, except in Fig. 6, where the lowest values during the initial 10-min incubation were used for F0.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 4-SNARE RPL reactions (100 μl each, 450 μm donor RPLs) in RB150, with 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 90 μm diC8-PI3P, 1.2 μm His6-Sec17p, 1.0 μm His6-Sec18p, and 55 nm HOPS-GST were incubated at 27 °C for 30 min, placed on ice for 10 min, and mixed with 400 μl of 50% Histodenz (Sigma) in RB150 to a final Histodenz concentration of 40%, then transferred to 11 × 60 mm tubes, overlaid with 1.5 ml of 35% Histodenz in RB150, 2 ml of 30% Histodenz in RB150, and 200 μl of RB150, and centrifuged (SW60Ti, 55,000 rpm, 3 h, 4 °C). RPLs, which floated, were harvested in 400 μl from the top of the gradients and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies against Vti1p, Vam7p, Sec17p, Sec18p, and Vps33p. RPL lipid mixing reactions (20 μl each), which had been prepared with Qabc-SNARE RPLs, R-SNARE RPLs, diC8-PI3P, and SNARE chaperones, as described above, were incubated at 27 °C for 40 min while monitoring NBD fluorescence, then transferred to 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice and left for 10 min. The RPL reactions were mixed with αVam3p (5 μl each, 1.7 μm final), incubated on ice for 10 min, further mixed with 230 μl each of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in RB150 with 1% Triton X-100, and nutated at 4 °C for 30 min. The Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with 500 μl each of RB150 with 1% Triton X-100 three times. Vam3p and Nyv1p bound to the Protein A-Sepharose beads were eluted from the beads with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Membrane fusion can be assayed by the resultant lipid mixing. Two sets of liposomes are prepared, one bearing NBD-PE and sufficient rhodamine-PE to quench the NBD fluorescence and another set of liposomes that have neither of these fluorophores. Upon fusion, dilution of the fluorophores by lipid mixing relieves the quenching, and the resulting NBD fluorescence is a measure of fusion (35Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes, which bear the four vacuolar SNAREs, will fuse when given purified HOPS, Sec17p, Sec18p, and ATP if they are composed of vacuolar lipids (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We express the fusion as F/Fo, the fluorescence F at each time normalized for the fluorescence immediately before the addition of soluble SNARE and SNARE chaperones, Fo. At the end of each incubation, detergent is added and the maximally dequenched NBD fluorescence, Fm, is measured (calculated values of [F − Fo/Fm − Fo] × 100% are presented in the figure legends). The vacuolar lipid composition is PC, PE, PI, PS, CL, PA, ERG, DAG, PI3P, and PI(4,5)P2 (18Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53186-53195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fusion was shown to be depressed ∼50% by the omission of DAG and to be even more depressed by omission of ERG, PI(4,5)P2, or PI3P (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We now report that PA and PE have important and distinct roles in fusion as well. SNARE proteoliposomes were prepared by the dialysis method of detergent removal from mixed micellar solutions, which bore all four SNAREs, the R-SNARE Nyv1p alone, the two integral Qab-SNAREs Vti1p and Vam3p, or all three Qabc-SNAREs (supplemental Fig. S1, A–D) and lipid mixtures ranging in complexity from PC alone to the complete vacuolar lipid mixture except for phosphoinositides (Table 1); diC8-PI3P can be added independently (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and will fulfill all the roles of phosphoinositides for fusion. 4Mima, J., and Wickner, W. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press. In all cases, the level of reconstitution of SNAREs was unaffected by the lipid composition (supplemental Fig. S1). Nevertheless, as shown below, lipid composition has a profound effect on fusion. Proteoliposomes with all four vacuolar SNAREs and the complete vacuole lipid mixture were incubated with diC8-PI3P, then mixed with Sec17p, Sec18p, and HOPS to initiate rapid and complete fusion (Fig. 1A, open circles), as reported.4 Omission of three of the acidic lipids, PS, PA, and CL, caused a 14-fold reduction in the initial rate of fusion (filled squares), which was further reduced 2.3-fold by the omission of small headgroup lipids ERG and DAG (filled diamonds). Removal of PI from this mixture abolished fusion entirely; we therefore determined whether PI, or another lipid, would optimally complement PC and PE for fusion. PA was optimal for this function, and rapid fusion was seen with RPLs bearing PC, PE, and PA (filled circles). Other acidic (PS) or small headgroup (DAG and ERG) lipids could not substitute for PA at all. Thus PC, PE, PA, and PI3P are a minimal set of lipids for reconstitution of fusion; the single omission of any of the latter three of this set causes drastic loss of fusion (Fig. 1A). Were PA and PE only important for fusion with a minimal lipid composition, or did they also have an important role in the complex, complete vacuolar lipid mixture? The rapid initial rate of fusion characteristic of the complete lipid mixture (Fig. 1A, open circles) was diminished 2.9-fold by the single omission of PA and 9.8-fold by the single omission of PE. Although there is some redundancy to lipid function, optimal fusion requires both of these lipids. To determine whether the lipid mixing between proteoliposomes bearing four vacuolar SNAREs and PC, PE, PA, and PI3P in the presence of the SNARE chaperones Sec17p/Sec18p and HOPS represents authentic fusion between sealed membrane compartments or lysis and re-annealing, we exploited a published assay (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G.

Acta. 2000; 1467: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that uses the membrane-impermeable reductant dithionite (S2O42−). The fluorescence donor proteoliposomes in our fusion reactions have NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE on both outer and inner monolayers. Exposure of these proteoliposomes to dithionite reduced the NBD-PE to N-7-amino-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-PE, destroying its fluorescence (Fig. 1B, filled circles, −32 to −26 min). The NBD-PE on the inner monolayer of these sealed proteoliposomes, though inaccessible to S2O42−, remained strongly quenched by rhodamine-PE. After 32 min, the S2O42− in this solution is fully oxidized and can no longer destroy the NBD fluorescence (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Addition of the HOPS, Sec17p, and Sec18p SNARE-chaperones triggered lipid mixing. An identical mixture of proteoliposomes and diC8-PI3P was incubated in parallel but without S2O42−, then mixed with S2O42− only 6 min before the addition of SNARE chaperones (open circles). Although the S2O42− in this second sample was largely active at the time of chaperone-triggered lipid mixing (30Mima J. Hickey C.M. Xu H. Jun Y. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), mixing-induced dequenching occurred at the same rate in each sample, showing that this lipid mixing was accompanied by maintenance of a sealed membrane, which excluded the S2O42− reductant. We next determined whether PE or PA were required for the steady-state association of peripherally bound fusion proteins to the proteoliposomal membrane. 4-SNARE proteoliposomes were mixed with diC8-PI3P or control buffer, and then fusion was initiated with a mixture of the three SNARE chaperones (Sec17p, Sec18p, and HOPS). After 30 min, proteoliposomes were re-isolated by flotation and assayed by immunoblot for bound Vti1p (an integral membrane SNARE, as control) or peripheral membrane proteins Vam7p, Sec17p, Sec18p, and HOPS (Fig. 2). HOPS (detected via its Vps33p subunit), Sec18p, Sec17p, and Vam7p associated with proteoliposomes of PC, PE, and PA (lane 8, no PI3P; lane 9, with PI3P) to a similar extent as with proteoliposomes bearing the complete vacuolar mixture (lanes 12 and 13). Omission of PE from the minimal mixture had little effect on the association of peripheral membrane proteins (lanes 6 and 7), but omission of PA (lanes 4 and 5) or substitution of PS for PA (lanes 10 and 11) reduced the level of bound Sec18p and HOPS (Fig. 2, C and D). Fusion between 4-SNARE-RPLs was diminished by reduced Sec18p or HOPS (Fig. S2). Purified HOPS has direct affinity for protein-free liposomes bearing PA in addition to its affinity for protein-free liposomes bearing phosphoinositides (17Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The requirements for PE and PA for fusion were even more strict when the proteoliposomes, which were assayed for fusion, bore separate SNARE populations (Fig. 3). With 3Q- and 1R-SNARE proteoliposomes, chaperone-dependent fusion was seen with PC/PE/PA proteoliposomes in the presence of diC8-PI3P (Fig. 3A), but omission of either PE (Fig. 3B) or PA (Fig. 3C), or substitution of PS for PA (Fig. 3D), abolished fusion. However, when the two integral membrane Qab-SNAREs were on the acceptor proteoliposomes and the soluble Qc-SNARE Vam7p was added along with SNARE chaperones (Fig. 4), even PC/PE/PA proteoliposomes, which were supplemented with PI3P, 600 nm Vam7p, and the SNARE chaperones, could not support fusion (Fig. 4A), although the full vacuolar lipid mix supported fusion well (Fig. 4B). Excess Vam7p (6 μm) could support mixing of lipids between PC/PE/PA SNARE proteoliposomes with PI3P, but this was independent of SNARE chaperones and showed little response to their addition (data not shown).FIGURE 4The minimal lipids do not support fusion with Qab-SNARE RPLs, R-SNARE RPLs, and exogenous Qc-SNARE Vam7p."
https://openalex.org/W2003252351,"Oxidative stress (OS), through excessive and/or chronic reactive oxygen species (ROS), is a mediator of diabetes-related damages in various tissues including pancreatic beta-cells. Here, we have evaluated islet OS status and beta-cell response to ROS using the GK/Par rat as a model of type 2 diabetes.Localization of OS markers was performed on whole pancreases. Using islets isolated from 7-day-old or 2.5-month-old male GK/Par and Wistar control rats, 1) gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR; 2) insulin secretion rate was measured; 3) ROS accumulation and mitochondrial polarization were assessed by fluorescence methods; 4) antioxidant contents were quantified by HPLC. After diabetes onset, OS markers targeted mostly peri-islet vascular and inflammatory areas, and not islet cells. GK/Par islets revealed in fact protected against OS, because they maintained basal ROS accumulation similar or even lower than Wistar islets. Remarkably, GK/Par insulin secretion also exhibited strong resistance to the toxic effect of exogenous H(2)O(2) or endogenous ROS exposure. Such adaptation was associated to both high glutathione content and overexpression (mRNA and/or protein levels) of a large set of genes encoding antioxidant proteins as well as UCP2. Finally, we showed that such a phenotype was not innate but spontaneously acquired after diabetes onset, as the result of an adaptive response to the diabetic environment.The GK/Par model illustrates the effectiveness of adaptive response to OS by beta-cells to achieve self-tolerance. It remains to be determined to what extend such islet antioxidant defenses upregulation might contribute to GK/Par beta-cell secretory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2151322297,"Matrix metalloproteinases are maintained in an inactive state by a bond between the thiol of a conserved cysteine in the prodomain and a zinc atom in the catalytic domain. Once this bond is disrupted, MMPs become active proteinases and can act on a variety of extracellular protein substrates. In vivo, matrilysin (MMP7) activates pro-alpha-defensins (procryptdins), but in vitro, processing of these peptides is slow, with about 50% conversion in 8-12 h. Similarly, autolytic activation of promatrilysin in vitro can take up to 12-24 h for 50% conversion. These inefficient reactions suggest that natural cofactors enhance the activation and activity of matrilysin. We determined that highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG), such as heparin, chondroitin-4,6-sulfate (CS-E), and dermatan sulfate, markedly enhanced (>50-fold) the intermolecular autolytic activation of promatrilysin and the activity of fully active matrilysin to cleave specific physiologic substrates. In contrast, heparan sulfate and less sulfated forms of chondroitin sulfate did not augment matrilysin activation or activity. Chondroitin-2,6-sulfate (CS-D) also did not enhance matrilysin activity, suggesting that the presentation of sulfates is more important than the overall degree of sulfation. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that promatrilysin bound heparin (K(D), 400 nm) and CS-E (K(D), 630 nm). Active matrilysin bound heparin (K(D), 150 nm) but less so to CS-E (K(D), 60 microm). Neither form bound heparan sulfate. These observations demonstrate that sulfated GAGs regulate matrilysin activation and its activity against specific substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2060086778,"Horizontal gene transfer has been occasionally mentioned in eukaryotic genomes, but such events appear much less numerous than in prokaryotes, where they play important functional and evolutionary roles. In yeasts, few independent cases have been described, some of which corresponding to major metabolic functions, but no systematic screening of horizontally transferred genes has been attempted so far. Taking advantage of the synteny conservation among five newly sequenced and annotated genomes of Saccharomycetaceae, we carried out a systematic search for HGT candidates amidst genes present in only one species within conserved synteny blocks. Out of 255 species-specific genes, we discovered 11 candidates for HGT, based on their similarity with bacterial proteins and on reconstructed phylogenies. This corresponds to a minimum of six transfer events because some horizontally acquired genes appear to rapidly duplicate in yeast genomes (e.g. YwqG genes in Kluyveromyces thermotolerans and serine recombinase genes of the IS607 family in Saccharomyces kluyveri). We show that the resulting copies are submitted to a strong functional selective pressure. The mechanisms of DNA transfer and integration are discussed, in relation with the generally small size of HGT candidates. Our results on a limited set of species expand by 50% the number of previously published HGT cases in hemiascomycetous yeasts, suggesting that this type of event is more frequent than usually thought. Our restrictive method does not exclude the possibility that additional HGT events exist. Actually, ancestral events common to several yeast species must have been overlooked, and the absence of homologs in present databases leaves open the question of the origin of the 244 remaining species-specific genes inserted within conserved synteny blocks."
https://openalex.org/W2003741525,"Pericellular proteolysis by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) plays a pivotal role in tumor cell invasion. Localization of MT1-MMP at the invasion front of cells, e.g. on lamellipodia and invadopodia, has to be regulated in coordination with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, little is known about how such invasion-related actin structures are regulated at the sites where MT1-MMP localizes. During analysis of MT1-MMP-associated proteins, we identified a heretofore uncharacterized protein. This protein, which we call p27RF-Rho, enhances activation of RhoA by releasing it from inhibition by p27(kip1) and thereby regulates actin structures. p27(kip1) is a well known cell cycle regulator in the nucleus. In contrast, cytoplasmic p27(kip1) has been demonstrated to bind GDP-RhoA and inhibit GDP-GTP exchange mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. p27RF-Rho binds p27(kip1) and prevents p27(kip1) from binding to RhoA, thereby freeing the latter for activation. Knockdown of p27RF-Rho expression renders cells resistant to RhoA activation stimuli, whereas overexpression of p27RF-Rho sensitizes cells to such stimulation. p27RF-Rho exhibits a punctate distribution in invasive human tumor cell lines. Stimulation of the cells with lysophosphatidic acid induces activation of RhoA and induces the formation of punctate actin structures within foci of p27RF-Rho localization. Some of the punctate actin structures co-localize with MT1-MMP and cortactin. Down-regulation of p27RF-Rho prevents both redistribution of actin into the punctate structures and tumor cell invasion. Thus, p27RF-Rho is a new potential target for cancer therapy development."

Furthermore, we recently found that Fyn phosphorylates CRMP1 and that this phosphorylation is involved in Reelin signaling (4Yamashita N. Uchida Y. Ohshima T. Hirai S. Nakamura F. Taniguchi M.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the relationship between Fyn and CRMP2 in Sema3A signaling and the tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) of CRMPs remain unknown. Here, we show that Fyn phosphorylates CRMP2 at Tyr32. Using a phospho-specific antibody against Tyr32, we determined that the residue is phosphorylated in vivo. A nonphosphorylated mutant CRMP2Y32F inhibits Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation by Fyn at Tyr32 is involved in Sema3A signaling. Antibodies used were: anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and 4G10, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Fyn antibody (3Arimura N. Ménager C. Kawano Y. Yoshimura T. Kawabata S. Hattori A. Fukata Y. Amano M. Goshima Y. Inagaki M. Morone N. Usukura J. Kaibuchi K. Mol. Cell.

Anti-CRMP2 monoclonal antibody (C4G) was kindly provided by Dr. Yasuo Ihara (Doshisha University). Anti-pCRMP (Y32), the rabbit polyclonal antibody against CRMP2 phosphorylated at Tyr32, was raised against synthetic phosphopeptide (CNDDQSFpYADIYME: amino acids 26–38 plus cysteine for conjugation). The antiserum and preimmune serum were purified with protein A beads. The purified preimmune serum was used as negative control for antiserum. TO-PRO-3 iodide (Invitrogen) was used for nuclei staining. Rat CRMP2 mutants were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis. Each mutant was generated with two primers as follows: CRMP2Y32F (5′-atctacatggaagatgggttgat-3′ and 5′-atctgcaaagaaggactggtcatcattcac-3′), CRMP2Y36F (5′-atcttcatggaagatgggttgatcaag-3′ and 5′-atctgcatagaaggactggtcatcattcac-3′), CRMP2Y182F (5′-tcttcgaagtactgagcgtgatccg-3′ and 5′-acttcgaagatctgggaatccgtcag-3′), and CRMP2Y479F (5′-gactggctgagctgaggggggtccct-3′ and 5′-gactccttgccttgatgcgtttgaacacaaagtcagggaa-3′). The mutated codons (Tyr to Phe) are bold. The underlines show a new generated restriction site to distinguish the mutants from wild-type (wt) (Y32F and Y36F:EcoRV, Y182F:Csp45I, and Y479F:SalI). PCR was performed using Myc-tagged CRMP2 as the template DNA and 5′-phosphorylated primers. After finishing the reaction, the template DNA was restricted by DpnI. The PCR products were self-ligated. In the Y182F mutant, the DpnI-digested PCR fragment was restricted by Csp45I and self-ligated. CRMP2Y32F/Y36F was generated using CRMP2Y36F with the CRMP2Y32F primer set. CRMP2Y32F/Y182F was generated using the CRMP2Y182F mutant as the template and the Y32F primer set. CRMP2 deletion mutants and N-terminal GST fusion vectors of CRMP2wt and the Y32F mutant were also constructed by PCR. GFP-Fes expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Yanagi (Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science). HEK293T cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/6-cm dish. After 2 days, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of expression vectors. After 1–2 days of incubation, the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, and 50 μm leupeptin). The lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody for 2 h on ice and then incubated with protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with the Nonidet P-40 buffer, the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with various antibodies. GST fusion proteins (Fyn and N-terminal mutants of CRMP2wt and CRMP2Y32F) were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain and purified. An 18-μl (5-μg) sample of CRMP2wt or Y32F N-terminal fragment and 2 μl (1 μg) of Fyn were mixed with 10 μl of 4× reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of an ATP mixture (75 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm ATP). After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) (1/2500) or anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody (1/1000). COS-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. The next day, the cells were transfected with Neuropilin1 (NRP1), PlexinA2, Fyn, and CRMP2-Myc, incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and then replated at 5 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish. After 24 h, the transfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h. The cells were lysed in the Nonidet P-40 buffer at the indicated time after the application of 3 nm Sema3A. The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody (1/1000). The same membrane was reblotted with anti-Myc antibody. Recombinant herpes simplex virus preparations and infections of chick embryonic day 7 (E7) DRG explants were performed as described previously (19Sasaki Y. Cheng C. Uchida Y. Nakajima O. Ohshima T.

Growth cone collapse assays using chick DRGs were performed with purified recombinant chick Sema3A (collapsin-His6) as described previously (19Sasaki Y. Cheng C. Uchida Y. Nakajima O. Ohshima T.

The E13.5 C57BL6 mouse embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4 °C. In E18.5 and adult mice, we performed perfusion fixation. After 24 h, the tissues were replaced in a 20% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h and thereafter in OCT compound. Sections were cut with a cryostat (16 μm). The sections were permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked by 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody (1/200) and preimmune control serum (1/200) were used with anti-NeuN (1/200), anti-Tuj1 (1/500), or anti-calbindin (1/500) antibody. Then, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a antibody (1/1000) was used as a second antibody. Nuclei were stained by TO-PRO-3. Finally, they were analyzed using Leica confocal microscope SP5. We reported previously that CRMP1 was phosphorylated by Fyn and this phosphorylation was involved in Reelin signaling (4Yamashita N. Uchida Y. Ohshima T. Hirai S. Nakamura F. Taniguchi M. Mikoshiba K. Honnorat J. Kolattukudy P. Thomasset N. Takei K. Takahashi T. Goshima Y. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13357-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We first examined whether other CRMP family members are phosphorylated by Fyn. Each Myc-tagged CRMP family member proteins (CRMP1–5) was expressed with or without constitutively active Fyn (FynCA) in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. All CRMP family members were phosphorylated by Fyn in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1, top). The tyrosine-phosphorylated CRMPs did not exhibit mobility shift on immunoblotting (Fig. 1, middle). To determine the physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of the CRMP family, we tried to identify the phosphorylation site(s). We constructed three partial fragments of CRMP2: CRMP2-(1–212), CRMP2-(213–572), and CRMP2-(415–572). These CRMP2 fragments and FynCA were coexpressed in HEK293T cells. Among these mutants, the N-terminal fragment CRMP2-(1–212) was highly phosphorylated (Fig. 2). Another two fragments, CRMP2-(213–572) and CRMP2-(415–572), were also moderately phosphorylated. These findings suggest that N-terminal region CRMP2-(1–212) contains major phosphorylation site(s). To elucidate the phosphorylated tyrosine residue(s) in CRMP2, we used a Web-based program, NetPhos (20Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar), which predicts phosphorylation sites for several kinases. Three tyrosine residues, Tyr32, Tyr36, and Tyr182, were predicted as the phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–212) of CRMP2 (Fig. 3A). In the C-terminal region (amino acids 213–572), three additional residues, Tyr251, Tyr290, and Tyr479, were predicted. Tyr479 of CRMP4 has been proposed previously as a phosphorylation site for tyrosine kinases (9Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Tyr479 of CRMP2 is phosphorylated by Src family tyrosine kinase Yes (18Varrin-Doyer M. Vincent P. Cavagna S. Auvergnon N. Noraz N. Rogemond V. Honnorat J. Moradi-Améli M. Giraudon P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13265-13276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We thus generated six point mutants of CRMP2, CRMP2Y32F, Y36F, Y182F, Y479F, Y32F/Y36F, and Y32F/Y182F. The Tyr (Y) residues in these mutants were replaced by Phe (F). These mutants were coexpressed with FynCA in HEK293T cells. Among them, the CRMP2Y32F mutant showed an ∼60% reduction in phosphorylation level compared with the wt (Fig. 3B). The remaining signal may be due to additional minor phosphorylation site(s). The phosphorylation of CRMP2 by Fes tyrosine kinase was reduced in Y32F mutants (Fig. 3C). The mutation of Tyr36 or Tyr479 did not alter the level of tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby suggesting that these residues are not major phosphorylation sites for Fyn or Fes. Introduction of an anti-CRMP2 antibody against amino acid residues 30–48 into DRG neurons blocks Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse response (1Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Because the epitope contains Tyr32, we focused on Tyr32 phosphorylation of CRMP2 (Fig. 4A). We performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified CRMP2 and Fyn to prove the direct phosphorylation by Fyn. To minimize the effect of other phosphorylation sites besides Tyr32, we constructed another mutant, GST-tagged CRMP2-(1–69). This mutant and Fyn were expressed and purified from E. coli. We performed an in vitro kinase assay using these purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, CRMP2wt-(1–69) was phosphorylated by Fyn. The phosphorylation of CRMP2Y32F-(1–69) was barely detectable. These results indicate that Tyr32 is one of the major phosphorylation sites in CRMP2 by Fyn (Fig. 4B). For further analysis of the function of Tyr32 phosphorylation in vivo, we prepared a rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-pCRMP (Y32), that recognizes the phosphorylated CRMP2 at Tyr32. To examine the specificity of this antibody, we performed an in vitro kinase assay and immunoblot analysis with anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody. A time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of CRMP2wt-(1–69) at Tyr32 was detected with this antibody. However, the phosphorylation of the Y32F mutant was not detectable (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined whether this antibody cross-reacts with other CRMP family members. The amino acid sequence of CRMP2 antigen (amino acids 25–39) is identical to that of CRMP4 (Fig. 4A). As expected, this antibody reacted with the phosphorylated forms of CRMP2 and CRMP4 (Fig. 5B). This antibody also weakly cross-reacted with phosphorylated CRMP1 (Fig. 5B). Thus, pCRMP (Y32) antibody reacts with the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CRMP2 or CRMP4 and reacts to a lesser extent with that of CRMP1. This result suggests that Fyn also phosphorylates CRMP1 and CRMP4 at Tyr32. We confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the CRMP4Y32F mutant by Fyn was markedly reduced. These results indicate that Fyn phosphorylates CRMP4 at Tyr32 (data not shown). Using this anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody, we examined the variation of phosphorylation levels of Tyr32 in developmental stages of the mouse spinal cord and brain. The spinal cord and brain lysates from several developmental stages were immunoblotted with anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody. In the spinal cord, the tyrosine phosphorylation was observed from E13.5 to postnatal day 0. In the brain, the tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr32 was observed at E18.5 and continued to adulthood (Fig. 5, C and D). Among the adult brain regions that were tested, the highest level of phosphorylated CRMP at Tyr32 was detected in the cerebellum (Fig. 5E). Immunohistochemical analysis at E13.5 sections around the spinal cord revealed that white matter of the spinal cord and DRG were stained with anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody (Fig. 6A). Anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody signals were colocalized with the antibody signals of anti-NeuN or Tuj1 neuronal markers. The level of phosphorylated CRMP2 at Tyr32 was also high in the fimbria of hippocampus at E18.5, which is a prominent band of white matter (Fig. 6B). In the adult brain, the highest level was seen in the molecular layer and the Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum (Fig. 6C). We also stained E13.5 sections with anti-CRMP2 antibody and found that the pattern of the immunofluorescence signals was similar to that obtained with anti-pCRMP (Y32) antibody (data not shown). To examine whether Tyr32 phosphorylation of CRMP2 is involved in Sema3A signaling, we examined whether Sema3A induces phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Tyr32 in COS-7 cells expressing PlexinA2/NRP1, Fyn, and CRMP2. We found that the stimulation induced the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Tyr32 (Fig. 7A). To determine the physiological significance of Tyr32 phosphorylation of CRMP2 in Sema3A signaling, we introduced the nonphosphorylated mutant CRMP2Y32F in DRG neurons using herpes simplex virus gene transfer. Overexpression of the CRMP2Y32F mutant significantly suppressed Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse response, whereas that of CRMP2wt did not show any effects (Fig. 7, B and C). In this study, we determined that the phosphorylation site of CRMP2 by Fyn and Fes is Tyr32. In the CRMP2Y32F mutant, the phosphorylation of CRMP2 by Fyn was markedly suppressed (Fig. 3). The remaining phosphorylation in CRMP2Y32F suggests the presence of another minor phosphorylation site(s). Our data showing that the CRMP2Y32F mutant suppressed Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse (Fig. 7) support the involvement of phosphorylation in Sema3A signaling. Based on crystal structure analyses of CRMP1 and CRMP2, the N-terminal region (amino acids 15–69) forms a small β-sheet that is relatively flexible (21Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Stenmark P. Ogg D. Flodin S. Flores A. Kotenyova T. Nyman T. Nordlund P. Kursula P. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 906-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the residues 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, and 56 are substituted with Ala in CRMP1, the CRMP1 mutant behaves as the constitutively active form in COS-7 cell contraction assay (21Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Deo et al. (21Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) conclude that the N-terminal β-sheet domain acts as negative regulator of basal CRMP activity. Anti-CRMP2 antibody blocks Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse for antigen amino acids 30–48 but not 475–491 (1Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Because Tyr32 is included in the negative regulator domain, the phosphorylation at Tyr32 may act as a trigger for CRMP2 activation. The C-terminal region of CRMP2 has the Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated by Cdk5 (Ser522), GSK3β (Ser518, Thr514, and Thr509), and Rho kinase (Thr555) (2Yoshimura T. Kawano Y.

Some of these phosphorylations are involved in Sema3A signaling. The N-terminal region and the C-terminal region may cooperate and regulate the activation of CRMP2. Fes has also been shown to be a mediator of Sema3A signaling (16Mitsui N. Inatome R. Takahashi S. Goshima Y. Yamamura H. Yanagi S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fes associates with and phosphorylates the CRMP2·CRMP5 complex. In COS-7 cells, Fes mediates Sema3A-induced cell contraction and CRMP2·CRMP5 phosphorylation (16Mitsui N. Inatome R. Takahashi S. Goshima Y. Yamamura H. Yanagi S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Introduction of a kinase-negative mutant of Fes to DRG neurons suppresses Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse (16Mitsui N. Inatome R. Takahashi S. Goshima Y. Yamamura H. Yanagi S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the DRG neurons of fyn-deficient mice, Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse is attenuated (19Sasaki Y. Cheng C. Uchida Y. Nakajima O. Ohshima T. Yagi T. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. Kishida R. Kudo Y. Ohno S. Nakamura F. Goshima Y. Neuron. 2002; 35: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Fyn and Fes phosphorylate CRMP2 at Tyr32 (Fig. 3). Fyn and Fes may be involved in Sema3A signaling through Tyr32 phosphorylation of CRMP2. Fer, a Fes homolog, also phosphorylates CRMP2 and mediates Sema3A signaling (17Shapovalova Z. Tabunshchyk K. Greer P.A. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the related kinase, Fyn, Fes, and Fer mediate Sema3A signaling through phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Tyr32. Each of these kinases may have distinct roles in mediating a wide variety of biological actions of Sema3A at different developmental stages and brain regions. What is the role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of CRMPs in Sema3A signaling? One possibility is that CRMP2 may be recruited to Cdk5 or adaptor proteins through its tyrosine phosphorylation. Several proteins have a phosphotyrosine-binding domain, such as a SH2 domain. A candidate is α2-chimaerin. α2-Chimaerin has an SH2 domain and Rac GTPase-activating protein domain and is also involved in Sema3A signaling (11Brown M. Jacobs T. Eickholt B. Ferrari G. Teo M. Monfries C. Qi R.Z. Leung T. Lim L. Hall C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8994-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The GTPase-activating protein inactive mutant of α2-chimaerin and SH2 domain mutant of α2-chimaerin inhibit Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse (11Brown M. Jacobs T. Eickholt B. Ferrari G. Teo M. Monfries C. Qi R.Z. Leung T. Lim L. Hall C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8994-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2-chimaerin associates with CRMP2 after orthovanadate treatment in N1E-115 cells. α2-Chimaerin also interacts with the Cdk5·p35 complex (11Brown M. Jacobs T. Eickholt B. Ferrari G. Teo M. Monfries C. Qi R.Z. Leung T. Lim L. Hall C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8994-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). α2-Chimaerin may associate with CRMP2 phosphorylated at Tyr32 and recruit CRMP2 to the Cdk5·p35 complex. CRMP1–4 can accelerate Sema3A-induced COS-7 cell contraction (21Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although CRMP3 can enhance Sema3A-induced COS-7 cell contraction, neither Tyr32 nor Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in the C terminus are conserved in CRMP3. This fact raises the possibility that CRMP3 may mediate the signal via another phosphorylation site(s) and/or by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. What is the in vivo role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of CRMPs? One apparent role is the intracellular signaling of axon guidance. Our data showing that the CRMP2Y32F mutant suppressed Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse (Fig. 7, B and C) support involvement of the phosphorylation in the Sema3A signaling. The Tyr32-phosphorylated CRMPs are abundant in spinal cord, DRG, and fimbria of the hippocampus, which is the axon bundle structure (Fig. 6B). This also supports the involvement of Tyr32 phosphorylation in axon guidance molecule signaling. CRMP2 is expressed in oligodendrocyte and neurons. Sema3A-induced branching of oligodendrocytes is blocked by anti-CRMP2 antibody (23Ricard D. Rogemond V. Charrier E. Aguera M. Bagnard D. Belin M.F. Thomasset N. Honnorat J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7203-7214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Fyn has been implicated in myelination (24Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). CRMP2 may play a role in oligodendrocyte development. The highest level of phosphorylation at Tyr32 is also observed in the adult mice cerebellum (Fig. 5E). The biological role of the phosphorylation in this region is currently unknown. The immunostaining of pCRMP (Y32) was also abundant in axon-bundled structures (Fig. 6B). This may reflect concentrated, tyrosine-phosphorylated CRMP2 in the axonal cytoplasm. It has been shown that CRMP2 is involved in axonal transport of tubulin dimers (5Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). If the staining reflects the former case, it raises the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in the regulation of axonal transport. In fact, Sema3A facilitates axonal transport, and this facilitation is blocked by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is attenuated in fyn-deficient mouse DRG (25Li C. Sasaki Y. Takei K. Yamamoto H. Shouji M. Sugiyama Y. Kawakami T. Nakamura F. Yagi T. Ohshima T. Goshima Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6161-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both Tau and CRMP2 have Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites around a tubulin-binding domain (5Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Ménager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). It has been shown that hyperphosphorylated Tau and CRMP2 accumulate in neurofibrillary tangles in brains affected with Alzheimer disease (13Uchida Y. Ohshima T. Sasaki Y. Suzuki H. Yanai S.

Tau is phosphorylated by Fyn at Tyr18 (26Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar), and this property is quite similar to that of CRMP2. Taken together, the phosphorylation on Tyr32 of CRMP2 may have some relevance to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. In conclusion, the current data demonstrate that CRMP2 is phosphorylated at Tyr32 and this phosphorylation mediates signal transduction of Sema3A. Further work is necessary to determine the physiological significance of CRMP2 phosphorylation at Tyr32.

https://openalex.org/W2120423141,"Hepatic gene transfer, in particular using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, has been shown to induce immune tolerance to several protein antigens. This approach has been exploited in animal models of inherited protein deficiency for systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins. Adequate levels of transgene expression in hepatocytes induce a suppressive T cell response, thereby promoting immune tolerance. This study addresses the question of whether AAV gene transfer can induce tolerance to a cytoplasmic protein.AAV-2 vector-mediated hepatic gene transfer for expression of cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) was performed in immune competent mice, followed by a secondary beta-gal gene transfer with E1/E3-deleted adenoviral Ad-LacZ vector to provoke a severe immunotoxic response. Transgene expression from the AAV-2 vector in approximately 2% of hepatocytes almost completely protected from inflammatory T cell responses against beta-gal, eliminated antibody formation, and significantly reduced adenovirus-induced hepatotoxicity. Consequently, approximately 10% of hepatocytes continued to express beta-gal 45 days after secondary Ad-LacZ gene transfer, a time point when control mice had lost all Ad-LacZ derived expression. Suppression of inflammatory T cell infiltration in the liver and liver damage was linked to specific transgene expression and was not seen for secondary gene transfer with Ad-GFP. A combination of adoptive transfer studies and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated induction of Treg that actively suppressed CD8(+) T cell responses to beta-gal and that was amplified in liver and spleen upon secondary Ad-LacZ gene transfer.These data demonstrate that tolerance induction by hepatic AAV gene transfer does not require systemic delivery of the transgene product and that expression of a cytoplasmic neo-antigen in few hepatocytes can induce Treg and provide long-term suppression of inflammatory responses and immunotoxicity."

ASICs are activated by extracellular acidosis, and protons act as ligands triggering channel opening (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

Disruption of the accn2 gene (which encodes ASIC1) dramatically reduces proton-gated currents in central neurons and alters a variety of behaviors, including fear, learning, and memory (5Wemmie J.A.

Like all members of the DEG/ENaC family, individual ASIC subunits have two transmembrane regions separated by a large cysteine-rich extracellular region. Three ASIC subunits associate to form homomeric or heteromeric channels with distinct biophysical characteristics (11Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E.

Specifically, ASIC1a homomeric channels activate at pH values much closer to neutral pH compared with ASIC2a homomeric channels. The high affinity proton sensitivity of ASIC1a plays a prominent role in acidosis-induced neuronal death, and modulators that alter the pH dose response of ASIC1a affect neuronal sensitivity to prolonged acidosis (8Xiong Z.G.

For example, the neuroprotective venom peptide PcTx1 increases the proton sensitivity of the ASIC1a channel, allowing the channel to desensitize at neutral pH and become unresponsive to subsequent acidic shifts in pH (16Chen X.

The large extracellular region of ASIC1a is thought to be the site of proton/modulator interaction and governs the characteristics of channel gating (10Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms defining ASIC1a activation and the protein domains that are responsible for the apparent proton sensitivity of ASIC1a remain unclear. Here, we used chimeras containing specific regions from both ASIC1a and ASIC2a to identify the specific protein regions that confer high affinity proton sensing, PcTx1 sensitivity, and calcium modulation to ASIC1a. Human ASIC1a- and ASIC2a-encoding cDNAs in the pMT3 mammalian expression vector have been described previously (19Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These sequences correspond to GenBankTM accession number NM_001095 for human ASIC1a and NM_001094 for human ASIC2a. Chimeras were generated using overlap extension PCR (21Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The specific locations of chosen chimeric break points in human ASIC1a or ASIC2a are shown in Fig. 1A and are as follows: “KR” is immediately preceding transmembrane region 1 (TM1) at K42 (1a) or R42 (2a); “FP” is at the conserved extracellular FPAVT sequence at F87 (1a) or F86 (2a); “KA” is at the conserved KANF sequence at K141(1a) or K140(2a); “FN” is at the conserved FNSG sequence at F197 (1a) or F196 (2a); “CN” is at the conserved CNCR sequence at C323 (1a) or C320 (2a); “TR” is at the third conserved TRY sequence at T370(1a) or T367(2a); and “LL” is just before transmembrane region two (TM2) at L431 (1a) and L428 (2a). When reported throughout, the numbering refers to the locations of corresponding residues in ASIC1a. Chimeras were cloned into pMT3 using unique restriction sites engineered into the PCR primers. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed on human ASIC1a using the QuikChange® kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). All inserts were fully sequenced prior to electrophysiological analysis (Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). Qiagen Midi or Maxi prep kits (Valencia, CA) were used to prepare plasmid DNA for oocyte injection. Unfertilized oocytes were harvested from wild-type oocyte positive Xenopus laevis females from Xenopus I (Dexter, MI) using standard procedures (22Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ASIC expression plasmids at a 50–100 ng/μl concentration were injected into oocyte nuclei (located beneath the animal pole) using a PV820 Pneumatic Picopump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). For co-expression studies, plasmids were injected at a 1:1 ratio (50 ng/μl of each construct). Oocytes were allowed to incubate at 18 °C for 18–72 h before experiments were performed. Macroscopic currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique at a holding potential of −60 mV. Electrodes (0.5–2 megaohms) were filled with 3 m KCl. Current was recorded using a Warner oocyte OC-725 clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and either a Powerlab 4SP digitizer with CHART software (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) or an Axon Digidata 1200 digitizer and pCLAMP-8 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The standard bath solution contained 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, 5 mm MES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and was pH-adjusted with 1 n HCl or 1 n NaOH. The pH of the standard bath solution was 7.4 unless otherwise indicated. Oocytes were placed in a bath chamber (500 μl), and acid applications were made using pump-driven perfusion directed toward the oocyte with a bath solution exchange rate of 2–3 ml/s (5 ml total). The cells were maintained in pH 7.4 for at least 2 min between acid applications to allow the cells to recover from desensitization. To minimize current run down, the peak current amplitude of evoked current from acidic test pH applications was normalized to the average of the peak current amplitudes evoked from saturating acidic pH (pH 3.0 or 5.0) applied before and after the test pH. PcTx1-containing venom from the tarantula Psalmopoeus cambridgei was purchased from SpiderPharm (Yarnell, AZ) and diluted to 1:3,333–1:5,000 for experiments. The pH0.5 was calculated by fitting the data from individual pH dose-response experiments within each oocyte using the equation, I/IpHmax = 1/(1 + (EC50/[H+])n) = 1/(1 + 10n(pH − pH0.5)), where n is the Hill coefficient. EC50 and pH0.5 are the proton concentration and pH yielding half of the saturating peak current amplitude (IpHmax), respectively. The pHmax was determined as a saturating test pH for all channels within the experimental group. This was either pH 3.0 or pH 5.0. The Hill coefficient was 4.4 ± 0.46 (n = 18) for ASIC1a and 1.3 ± 0.05 ASIC2a (n = 13). Generally, the Hill coefficient correlated with the pH0.5 of mutant channels, with those showing smaller Hill coefficients also displaying a lower pH0.5. However, the variability in the calculated Hill coefficient of ASIC1a limited significance substantially. To quantify desensitization, IGOR (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR) was used to fit the decay phase of acid-activated currents to a single exponential equation, I = k0 + k1·e−t/τ. The τ of desensitization (τd) was calculated in seconds from the fitted curve. Two-tailed paired or unpaired t tests were done to analyze statistical significance as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. ASIC1a is activated by pH 6.7 and shows a pH of half-maximal activation (pH0.5) of ∼6.5. This pH0.5 corresponds to an EC50 for protons of 316 nm. ASIC2a requires a pH below 6.0 for activation, displays a pH0.5 of ∼3.9, and has an apparent EC50 for protons of 126 μm. Thus, ASIC1a requires an almost 400-fold lower proton concentration for half-maximal activation compared with ASIC2a. To identify the protein regions responsible for this difference in apparent proton affinity, chimeras were constructed with different segments of ASIC1a and ASIC2a sequence (Fig. 1A). All chimeras produced transient proton-gated currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A pH dose response was assessed for each construct, and the pH0.5 (the pH of half-maximal activation) was calculated. Substitution of several regions of ASIC1a with ASIC2a sequence affected the pH0.5. In particular, exchanging the region N-terminal to the “FP” site altered the pH0.5 slightly (see chimeras 2FP1, 1KR2, and 1FP2) (Fig. 1B). However, two other protein regions showed a more prominent role in defining the apparent proton sensitivity of ASIC1a. First, substitution of the region between amino acids 87 and 197 (1FP2FN1) of ASIC1a with ASIC2a sequence resulted in a dramatic reduction in the pH0.5 (Fig. 1B). Second, substitution in the region between amino acids 323 and 431 (1CN2LL1) of ASIC1a substantially diminished the proton dose response. Alternatively, exchanging the N-terminal region before amino acid 87 (2KR1), the C-terminal region after amino acid 431 (1LL2, 2LL1), or the middle region between amino acids 197 and 323 of ASIC1a with ASIC2a sequence (1FN2CN1) did little to alter the proton sensitivity. To further define the important residues within these regions, chimeras containing only part of the regions 87–197 and 323–431 were generated. Exchanging only region 141–197 of ASIC1a with ASIC2a sequence (chimera 1KA2FN1) recapitulated the proton dose response of chimera 1FP2FN1 in which the entire 87–197 region was exchanged (Fig. 1B). However, exchanging the region between 87 and 141 (1FP2KA1) showed a pH0.5 indistinguishable from ASIC1a. Furthermore, exchanging just the N-terminal area of amino acids 323–370 (1CN2TR1) resulted in a chimera with a pH dose response indistinguishable from the chimera in which the entire region was exchanged (Fig. 1B). Exchanging amino acids 370–431 (1TR2LL1) also reduced the apparent proton sensitivity slightly. Thus, amino acids within regions 141–197 and 323–370 appear to play a dominant role in specifying the pH dose response of ASIC1a, with residues 323–370 being the most important. Exchanging the region between amino acids 323 and 370 of ASIC1a with ASIC2a sequence decreased the pH0.5 from 6.5 to 3.8, a more than 400-fold decrease in apparent proton sensitivity. There are 11 amino acids within this region that differ between ASIC1a and ASIC2a. To determine which amino acids are important for proton sensitivity, individual amino acids in ASIC1a were converted to the corresponding amino acids in ASIC2a (Fig. 2A). Y342H, D347E, D351G, F352L, V354A, and the double mutant E364R/M365T all displayed smaller relative currents in response to pH 6.5, and their pH0.5 was substantially smaller compared with ASIC1a (Fig. 2B). However, the lowest pH0.5 elicited from these single mutants was 6.19, and none of these single mutations decreased pH sensitivity to the level of 1CN2TR1 (pH0.5 = 3.8), suggesting that changes in multiple amino acids are responsible for the effect of exchanging all amino acids between 323 and 370 with ASIC2a sequence. To determine whether combining mutations could decrease the pH0.5 further, subunits with multiple mutations were constructed and analyzed (Fig. 2B). Only when all 11 substitutions were made was the pH0.5 of 1CN2TR1 recapitulated. These results probably indicate that all of these residues contribute to high affinity proton sensing of ASIC1a. Amino acids with negatively charged side chains have been hypothesized to play a role in determining proton binding (23Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We reasoned that because both ASIC1a and ASIC2a are activated by protons (albeit at different concentrations), conserved acidic residues might be necessary for proton-dependent gating. Therefore, we tested the effect of mutation of acidic residues within region 323–370 that are conserved between ASIC1a and ASIC2a (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, ASIC1a mutants with alterations in acidic residues Glu340, Glu344, and Glu355 displayed a normal proton dose response. However, D357A displayed a decreased response to pH 6.5 solutions (Fig. 3B). Quantification of the pH0.5 revealed that D357A showed a relatively large decrease in pH0.5 (5.92 ± 0.06 for D357A (n = 7, p = 8.5 × 10−14 compared with ASIC1a) (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with D357N, suggesting that the charge of the aspartic acid side chain is important. The D357A mutation showed the largest change in pH dose response of any single mutation examined in these studies. We reasoned that the region surrounding Asp357 might play a prominent role in defining the pH sensitivity of ASIC1a. Since our previous results indicated that E355A and Q358S did not alter pH sensitivity (Figs. 2B and 3C), we tested mutations that more significantly affected the amino acids. Surprisingly, mutants E355K and Q358E showed increased current in response to pH 6.7 application (Fig. 3D). Further quantification revealed that the proton dose response of these mutant channels was shifted such that the pH0.5 was greater than ASIC1a (Fig. 3E). The pH0.5 for E355K was 6.64 ± 0.02 (n = 8, p = 0.003 compared with ASIC1a), and the pH0.5 of Q358E was 6.66 ± 0.03 (n = 7, p = 0.00032 compared with ASIC1a). We also assessed the impact of K356A mutation and determined that pH sensitivity was slightly reduced, although the data narrowly reached statistical significance. (pH0.5 of K356A = 6.48 ± 0.02, n = 8, p = 0.049 compared with ASIC1a) (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that the area around Asp357 plays an important role in the pH dose response of ASIC1a. ASIC1a sequences between amino acids 87–197 and 323–431 are required for high affinity proton sensing. To determine whether either region is sufficient, we analyzed ASIC2a chimeras with ASIC1a sequence within these regions (Fig. 4A). The presence of ASIC1a sequence in the region between 87 and 197 alone did not increase the apparent proton sensitivity of ASIC2a. When the region of ASIC2a between 323 and 431 was exchanged with ASIC1a sequence, the pH sensitivity was increased (pH0.5 of 2CN1LL2 = 4.43 ± 0.10, n = 6, p = 0.0003 compared with ASIC2a). Replacing regions 141–197 and 323–370 (2KA1FN2CN1TR2) increased the pH0.5, but only to 5.48 ± 0.05, n = 3. However, when both regions 87–197 and 323–431 of ASIC2a were exchanged with ASIC1a sequence (2FP1FN2CN1LL2), the chimera displayed a dramatic increase in proton sensitivity (pH0.5 of 2FP1FN2CN1LL2 = 6.17 ± 0.07, n = 7, p = 1 × 10−6 compared with ASIC2a) (Fig. 4A). Although this chimera was still less sensitive than ASIC1a (p = 0.0005), these results suggest that ASIC1a sequence in the region between amino acid 87 and 197 as well as the region between 323 and 431 is sufficient to confer high affinity proton sensing and a pH0.5 higher than 6.0. Our data indicate that two regions of ASIC1a must be present for a pH0.5 greater than 6.0. These results suggest that these regions may interact to determine the pH sensitivity of ASIC1a. Functional ASIC channels are formed by association of three ASIC subunits. Thus, the interaction between these regions could be within the same subunit (intrasubunit), or one region of a subunit could interact with the other region from another subunit (intersubunit). To determine whether intersubunit interactions between these two regions affect pH sensitivity of ASICs, we co-expressed chimeras 2FP1FN2 and 2CN1LL2 and measured proton-gated current (Fig. 4, B and C). Oocytes expressing both 2FP1FN2 and 2CN1LL2 displayed appreciable proton-activated current with pH 5.5 (Fig. 4B). However, very little proton-activated current was observed in response to pH 5.5 in oocytes expressing either chimera alone. The pH dose response of oocytes expressing both chimera was also shifted toward more neutral pH values (Fig. 4C). Although the pH sensitivity of proton-gated currents when 2FP1FN2 and 2CN1LL2 were co-expressed was not as high as for 2FP1FN2CN1LL2, this increase in proton sensitivity suggests that regions 87–197 and 323–431 undergo intersubunit interactions, at least in part, to specify the proton dose response. In addition to increased proton sensitivity, ASIC1a is also sensitive to the venom peptide PcTx1, whereas ASIC2a is not (17Escoubas P. De Weille J.R. Lecoq A. Diochot S. Waldmann R. Champigny G.

PcTx1 limits ASIC1a activity by increasing the apparent proton sensitivity of ASIC1a and promoting steady-state desensitization at pH 7.4 (16Chen X. Kalbacher H. Gründer S. J. Gen.

If steady-state desensitization is not induced, then PcTx1 potentiates ASIC1a activation by shifting the pH0.5 of activation to more neutral pH values (16Chen X. Kalbacher H. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Chen X. Kalbacher H. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, ASIC1a currents evoked by non-saturating pH values are substantially enhanced in the presence of PcTx1 (Fig. 5A). We asked whether the same domains that determine high affinity proton sensing also confer sensitivity to PcTx1. ASIC1a chimeras containing ASIC2a in the region between amino acids 323 and 431 (1CN2LL1) were not affected by PcTx1-containing venom (Fig. 5B). Conversely, ASIC2a chimeras containing ASIC1a sequence in this same region (2CN1LL2) were enhanced by PcTx1-containing venom (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that ASIC1a sequence in the region between amino acids 323 and 431 is both necessary and sufficient for PcTx1 enhancement of the pH dose response and are in agreement with recently published observations (26Qadri Y.J. Berdiev B.K. Song Y. Lippton H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17625-17633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the specific amino acids in this region involved in the PcTx1 sensitivity of ASIC1a, we analyzed channels with mutations converting amino acids in this region of ASIC1a to amino acids present in ASIC2a. For most mutants, the effect of PcTx1 was retained (data not shown). However, ASIC1a channels with mutation F352L were unaffected by PcTx1-containing venom (the pH 6.3 response was 36.9 ± 5.0% maximal current without PcTx1 and 31.2 ± 1.8% in the presence of PcTx1, n = 5, p = 0.22) (Fig. 5C). A thorough pH dose-response analysis in the presence of PcTx1 revealed that F352L was unaffected by PcTx1 (Fig. 5D). The pH0.5 of F352L was 6.23 ± 0.01 (n = 4) in the absence of PcTx1 and was 6.21 ± 0.04 (n = 4, p = 0.72) in the presence of PcTx1. Under the same conditions, the pH dose response of ASIC1a was substantially shifted toward more neutral pH values (pH0.5 of ASIC1a in the absence of PcTx1 was 6.59 ± 0.04 (n = 5), and in the presence of PcTx1, it was 6.81 ± 0.06 (n = 3), p = 0.02). These results indicate that the F352L mutation eliminated PcTx1-induced potentiation of the pH dose response of ASIC1a. PcTx1 modulation of steady-state desensitization was also lost in F352L. Steady-state desensitization is induced by incubating cells in a slightly acidic pH (conditioning pH) for 2 min prior to pH 5.0 application (Fig. 5, E and F). When PcTx1 was present, steady-state desensitization of human ASIC1a was enhanced, and subsequent activation of the channels produced a substantially smaller current (Fig. 5, E and F). However, steady-state desensitization of F352L was not significantly different in the presence of PcTx1 (Fig. 5, G and H). Thus, the F352L mutation prevents PcTx1 modulation of the pH-dependence of both activation and steady-state desensitization. The pH dose response of ASIC1a is also markedly affected by extracellular calcium, with increasing concentrations of calcium increasing the concentration of protons required for channel activation (4Waldmann R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41597-41603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been proposed that calcium tonically inhibits ASIC1a activation and protons activate ASICs by facilitating calcium unbinding (23Paukert M. Babini E. Pusch M. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W.

Physiol. 2006; 127: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This effect can be observed by the decrease in the relative peak current amplitude evoked by pH 6.5 in the presence of either 1.8 or 10 mm calcium (Fig. 6A). To determine whether calcium affects ASIC1a and ASIC2a similarly, we tested the calcium dependence of ASIC2a activation. Surprisingly, we find that calcium enhanced proton sensitivity of ASIC2a, as indicated by the relative increase in pH 3.5-evoked currents (Fig. 6A). Quantification of the percentage change in normalized currents reveals a negative change for ASIC1a and a positive change for ASIC2a with increasing calcium (Fig. 6B). We used our ASIC1a/2a chimeras to identify the regions that are responsible for the difference in calcium dependence between ASIC1a and ASIC2a. We found that exchanging amino acids 197–323 of ASIC1a with ASIC2a sequence (1FN2CN1) eliminated the ASIC1a-like response to calcium (Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly, replacing the residues of ASIC2a between amino acids 197–323 with ASIC1a sequence (2FN1CN2) was sufficient to allow calcium inhibition of proton sensitivity (as indicated as a negative change in percentage of normalized current in Fig. 6B), although the channel had a pH0.5 of 4.1. Exchanging the regions we previously identified as playing a prominent role in the dose response to protons (FP-FN and CN-LL) did not determine the response to calcium. Thus, the region between amino acids 197 and 323 is responsible for the differential calcium sensitivity of ASIC1a and ASIC2a, whereas the region responsible for th"

SC3 of the mushroom-forming fungus Schizophyllum commune is the best studied class I hydrophobin. This protein spontaneously adopts the amyloid state at the water-air interface. In contrast, SC3 is arrested in an intermediate conformation at the interface between water and a hydrophobic solid such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; Teflon). This finding prompted us to study conditions that promote assembly of SC3 into amyloid fibrils. Here, we show that SC3 adopts the amyloid state at the water-PTFE interface at high concentration (300 microg ml(-1)) and prolonged incubation (16 h). Moreover, we show that amyloid formation at both the water-air and water-PTFE interfaces is promoted by the cell wall components schizophyllan (beta(1-3),beta(1-6)-glucan) and beta(1-3)-glucan. Hydrophobin concentration and cell wall polysaccharides thus contribute to the role of SC3 in formation of aerial hyphae and in hyphal attachment."
https://openalex.org/W2031337204,"Background Invasive Staphylococcus aureus infection is increasingly recognised as an important cause of serious sepsis across the developing world, with mortality rates higher than those in the developed world. The factors determining mortality in developing countries have not been identified. Methods A prospective, observational study of invasive S. aureus disease was conducted at a provincial hospital in northeast Thailand over a 1-year period. All-cause and S. aureus-attributable mortality rates were determined, and the relationship was assessed between death and patient characteristics, clinical presentations, antibiotic therapy and resistance, drainage of pus and carriage of genes encoding Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Principal Findings A total of 270 patients with invasive S. aureus infection were recruited. The range of clinical manifestations was broad and comparable to that described in developed countries. All-cause and S. aureus-attributable mortality rates were 26% and 20%, respectively. Early antibiotic therapy and drainage of pus were associated with a survival advantage (both p<0.001) on univariate analysis. Patients infected by a PVL gene-positive isolate (122/248 tested, 49%) had a strong survival advantage compared with patients infected by a PVL gene-negative isolate (all-cause mortality 11% versus 39% respectively, p<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis using all variables significant on univariate analysis revealed that age, underlying cardiac disease and respiratory infection were risk factors for all-cause and S. aureus-attributable mortality, while one or more abscesses as the presenting clinical feature and procedures for infectious source control were associated with survival. Conclusions Drainage of pus and timely antibiotic therapy are key to the successful management of S. aureus infection in the developing world. Defining the presence of genes encoding PVL provides no practical bedside information and draws attention away from identifying verified clinical risk factors and those interventions that save lives."

Vascular cells are exposed to oxidizing radicals during normal metabolism, but especially so during physiologic and pathologic inflammatory processes. The double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acyl residues are particularly prone to attack by radicals because the C-H bond situated between two double bonds is relatively weak, allowing a more facile abstraction of hydrogen to produce a radical (1Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). Because polyunsaturated fatty acyl residues are abundant and are generally esterified in the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone, common products of oxidative attack on cells and circulating lipoproteins are phospholipids that have been peroxidized at their sn-2 position. These peroxy radicals abstract hydrogen to form hydroperoxy phospholipids, may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol, rearrange (2Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F.

Members of the Bcl-2 family modulate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis either by promoting apoptosis (Bid, Bad, and Bax) or obstructing this event (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL). Aggregation of Bax on the mitochondrial outer membrane forms ion conducting pores and Bcl-XL associates with mitochondrial outer membranes to suppress this Bax activity (20Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 157-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bid promotes apoptosis after cleavage to truncated Bid, a regulatory event catalyzed by activated caspase 8 (21Ji H. Shekhtman A. Ghose R. McDonnell J.M. Cowburn D. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2006; 44: S101-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Bid, alone among Bcl-2 family members, displays homology to plant lipid transfer proteins and both truncated and full-length Bid will incorporate fluorescent phospholipids, and not the cognate fluorescent fatty acid, into mitochondrial membranes (22Goonesinghe A.

We determined whether mitochondrial integrity or function were directly affected by oxidatively truncated phospholipids, and then whether Bcl-2 family members alter these effects as they do in other, established apoptotic signaling pathways.

Quantitation of samples or defined amounts of Az-LPAF used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry with a Quattro Ultima triple quadrapole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) with collision-induced dissociation by argon gas. Analyses were performed using electrospray ionization in the positive-ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions used to detect the choline phospholipids were the mass to charge ratio (m/z) for the molecular ion [M + H]+ and the m/z 184 phosphocholine daughter ion. Mitochondria were frozen and thawed before these lysed mitochondria (1 mg) were added to 1 ml of a reaction mixture containing 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 3.5 mm phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 80 μm coenzyme-Q10, and the stated amount of Az-LPAF. The reaction mixture was equilibrated at room temperature (3 min) prior to the addition of 0.2 mm NADH to initiate the reaction. NADH oxidation was monitored at 340 nm at 37 °C over time. Rat liver mitochondria (0.1 mg/ml) were mixed with 0.5 μm TMRM, a positively charged fluorescent dye accumulated by energized mitochondria, and the fluorescence intensity of the organelle was determined using stirred, thermostatically controlled cuvettes. Fluorescence was determined using excitation wavelengths of 546 and 573 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The ratio between these signals reflects mitochondrial membrane potential. Changes in mitochondrial NADH levels were determined by incubating mitochondria (0.4 mg/ml) at room temperature in medium composed of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm EGTA, and 2 mm phosphate at 24 °C as fluorescence was determined by excitation at 340 nm with emission monitored at 460 nm. Fluorescence measurements used an LPS-200B fluorometer (Photon Technologies International, Lawrenceville, NJ) operated by FeliX32 software with slit widths for both emission and excitation set at 2.5 nm. HL-60 cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 and incubated with the stated amount of Az-LPAF for 4 h. One aliquot of washed cells was irradiated by 400 J/m2 (measured using a IL1700 radiometer and a SED240 UVB detector; International Light, Newburyport, MA) for 5 min, whereas a third aliquot remained unstimulated prior to the 4-h culture. To measure surface phosphatidylserine and the ability to exclude a nuclear dye, HL-60 cells were washed with PBS and stained with Annexin V-Alex 488 (1/100 dilution) and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide in binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 15 min at room temperature. At the end of this incubation the samples were diluted 4-fold with binding buffer and fluorescence was assessed by two-color flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by incubating the cells with the potentiometric dye JC-1 (10 μg/ml) for 15 min, before the cells were washed twice and resuspended for two-color flow cytometry. Oxidatively modified phospholipids affect cell function through G-protein coupled and nuclear hormone receptors, but also act in currently undefined, receptor-independent ways. For example, the truncated phospholipid Az-LPAF stimulates PAF receptor signaling (25Chen R. Chen X. Salomon R.G. McIntyre T.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but low micromolar concentrations of this oxidatively truncated phospholipid rapidly depolarized HL-60 cell mitochondria (Fig. 1A). Because these cells do not express the PAF receptor (26Müller E. Dupuis G. Turcotte S. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), mitochondria are one non-receptor dependent target of the oxidized phospholipids. The electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane in this experiment was monitored by JC-1 fluorescence. This cationic dye is accumulated by polarized mitochondria where its high concentration promotes aggregation, changing its green fluorescence as a monomer to a reddish orange. Two-color flow cytometry of HL-60 cells showed that as little as 1.25 μm Az-LPAF doubled the number of cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. The number of these cells increased as the concentration was increased to 5 μm Az-LPAF, rivaling that of the positive control, UVB irradiation. HL-60 cells exposed to these same concentrations of Az-LPAF also lost the phospholipid asymmetry of their plasma membrane, an early event in apoptotic cell death. The data show (Fig. 1B) that over half of the cells exposed to 5 μm Az-LPAF displayed phosphatidylserine on their surface, which was comparable with the 40% of cells that expressed phosphatidylserine on their surface after UVB irradiation. Few cells exposed to either Az-LPAF or UVB at this time had progressed to the point where they were unable to exclude propidium iodide from their nucleus. We determined whether Az-LPAF physically affected mitochondrial function using isolated rat liver mitochondria. Isolated mitochondria were provided glutamate and malate to oxidize (shown by the first arrow, Fig. 2A), which increased the transmembrane potential detected by increased TMRM fluorescence. The addition of 2.5 μm Az-LPAF at the time shown by the second arrow produced a rapid, but partial, loss of mitochondrial potential. There was an immediate and extensive loss of fluorescence when this truncated phospholipid was added at a final concentration of 5 μm. Complete depolarization of the isolated mitochondria was achieved by addition of the protonophore CCCP (third arrow, Fig. 2A). This agent had no effect on mitochondria previously exposed to 5 μm Az-LPAF, so this concentration of the truncated phospholipid had completely depolarized the organelle. We first determined whether the sn-1 ether bond of Az-LPAF was required for mitochondrial depolarization. We found that Az-LPAF was about twice as effective as its diacyl homolog 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (95 ± 2% depolarization by 5 μm Az-LPAF versus 40 ± 15% for diacyl palmitoyl azelaoyl glycerophosphocholine). We next tested related phospholipids and lysophospholipids, and many of these also caused a rapid loss of the energy gradient across intact mitochondria (Fig. 2B). Phospholipids with very short sn-2 residues (e.g. those with the 2-carbon acetyl residue of PAF and carbamoyl-PAF, and the 4-carbon long residues of butyroyl-LPAF) reduced the transmembrane potential by about one-third, which was similar to the effect of lyso-PAF that lacks any sn-2 residue. Phospholipids containing sn-2 residues 5 carbon atoms long (e.g. palmitoyl glutaroyl and palmitoyl oxovaleroyl phosphatidylcholines) that, like Az-LPAF, possess ω-oxy functions on the fragmented sn-2 residue, were also no more than one-third as effective as Az-LPAF. Apparently, the combination of an ω-acidic function in conjunction with a medium length sn-2 acyl chain is particularly devastating to mitochondrial function. Only the strongly acidic phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid approached Az-LPAF effectiveness in depolarizing mitochondria. Amphipathic truncated phospholipids bearing a carboxyl function are detergents that disrupt membrane structure (14Itabe H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Megli F.M. Russo L. Conte E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and they physically bind to cytochrome c (28Mattila J.P. Sabatini K. Kinnunen P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether Az-LPAF irreversibly damaged mitochondrial function, as would be the case after solubilization, by depleting mitochondria of this lipid by sequestering it with excess albumin. Addition of Az-LPAF to mitochondria oxidizing glutamate and malate resulted, as before, in an immediate loss of transmembrane potential (Fig. 3A). Addition of BSA to the Az-LPAF de-energized mitochondria produced an immediate recovery of most, although not all, of the lost potential energy. Mass spectrometry (not shown) confirmed that an albumin wash removed 80 to 90% of the Az-LPAF associated with mitochondria. These data show that Az-LPAF must be continuously present to fully depolarize mitochondria. We determined whether a transmembrane potential gradient, perhaps aiding internalization of the lipid, was essential for depolarization by Az-LPAF by treating mitochondria with Az-LPAF in the absence of oxidizable substrates. We found (Fig. 3B) that the resting transmembrane potential was rapidly and fully depolarized by CCCP and by about half with Az-LPAF. Albumin alone did not affect organelle function, but the introduction of albumin induced a small increase in transmembrane potential of mitochondria exposed to the lipids Az-LAPF or CCCP. Substrate addition after albumin addition induced a rapid increase in polarization, although this increase was diminished in mitochondria that had previously been exposed to Az-LPAF or CCCP. These results show that the effect of Az-LPAF on mitochondrial function is aided by a large transmembrane potential as in Fig. 3A, but that, again, the bulk of the effect of Az-LPAF on mitochondria was reversible. We determined whether complex I composition or function was altered by Az-LPAF using Blue Native electrophoresis, which recovers intact electron transport lipoprotein complexes (29Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), to find all macromolecular complexes were still present after exposure to Az-LPAF (not shown). Staining these gels with the oxidizable substrate nitro blue tetrazolium dye indicated that complex I function was normal after Az-LPAF exposure (data not shown). Mitochondria contain iPLA2 that protects against staurosporine-induced apoptosis (30Seleznev K. Zhao C. Zhang X.H. Song K. Ma Z.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22275-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mitochondria also express the calcium-dependent phospholipase A2-γ that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine and then can also reacylate the resulting lysophosphatidylcholine (31Yamashita A. Tanaka K. Kamata R. Kumazawa T. Suzuki N. Koga H. Waku K. Sugiura T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). We determined whether mitochondria also displayed PAF acetylhydrolase-like activity, that is, the ability to hydrolyze PAF in the absence of Ca2+. We found that the fraction in a sucrose density gradient containing intact mitochondria (fraction V) effectively hydrolyzed PAF, and that this activity was displayed by the other subcellular fractions (Fig. 4A). The mechanism-based iPLA2 inhibitor BEL (32Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reduced PAF hydrolysis in fraction V by half, indicating that mitochondrial iPLA2 was able to hydrolyze short-chain phospholipids. Plasma (33Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and type II (34Kono N. Inoue T. Yoshida Y. Sato H. Matsusue T. Itabe H. Niki E. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1628-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) PAF acetylhydrolases additionally will hydrolyze oxidized phospholipids such as Az-LPAF. The ability to hydrolyze this truncated phospholipid was also present in mitochondria. Thus, isolated mitochondria completely catabolized Az-LPAF by 10 min (Fig. 4B), with an increase in lyso-PAF (Fig. 4C). Lyso-PAF was not stable in isolated mitochondria and its concentration fell over the subsequent 10 min. One route to loss of membrane potential, with subsequent irreversible effects, is through the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore that allows molecules below ∼2000 daltons to move across the inner membrane. To determine whether Az-LPAF opened this channel, we loaded HL-60 cells with the fluorescent dye calcein, which distributes between mitochondria and cytoplasm, and treated them with either cobalt chloride or buffer. The cobalt cation quenches calcein fluorescence, but cannot do so when an intact permeability barrier excludes the ion from the mitochondrial matrix. We found that, first, this dye was retained by cells exposed to Az-LPAF, which shows that the plasma membrane barrier function was uncompromised by the truncated phospholipid. Second, we found that the internalized dye content was the same between control and Az-LPAF-treated cells (Fig. 5A, left). We also found that the cobalt ion had no effect on the fluorescence of control cells, but that fluorescence in the majority of cells exposed to Az-LPAF was sharply reduced by cobalt exposure (Fig. 5A, right). This means the cobalt ion had access to the inner mitochondrial compartment, which in turn implies that the mitochondrial permeability barrier had been breached. We determined whether the permeability transition pore participated in the loss of barrier function using isolated mitochondria treated with varied concentrations of cyclosporin A to block the cyclophilin D component of the pore. This inhibitor produced a partial, concentration-dependent increase (Fig. 5B) in mitochondrial potential in mitochondria that would have been completely depolarized by 5 μm Az-LPAF. Cyclosporin A also reduced mitochondrial swelling secondary to collapse of the electrical potential, but again was only partially effective in this (not shown). Opening of the permeability transition pore allows NADH to leach from mitochondria, compromising their function. To test for the effect of Az-LPAF on mitochondrial NADH content we treated mitochondria with cyclosporin A, or not, and then with 5 μm Az-LPAF. We found (Fig. 5C, left, first arrow) that there was a time-dependent loss of NADH fluorescence, and that this change was less severe when the permeability transition pore was blocked by cyclosporin A. We then added CCCP (second arrow) to stimulate maximal electron transport and this, as expected, pulled electrons from NADH causing a rapid loss of fluorescence at 340 nm as non-fluorescent NAD+ accumulated. Finally, we added rotenone (third arrow) to block the flow of electrons from complex I to complex II. In this case, NADH produced by glutamate and malate oxidation cannot be reduced by the electron transport chain. Thus, rotenone addition allowed a full recovery of NADH fluorescence when the permeability transition pore was blocked by cyclosporin A, but allowed only a partial recovery of NADH fluorescence in mitochondria exposed to Az-LPAF when the permeability transition pore was not blocked. We determined whether NADH had been in fact released from Az-LPAF-treated mitochondria by physically recovering them by centrifugation from the foregoing experiment. The data (Fig. 5C, right) showed that cyclosporin A-treated mitochondria retained a greater portion of their NADH after Az-LPAF exposure than did those organelles exposed to just the truncated phospholipid. Bcl-XL is a member of the Bcl-2 family that physically interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane and suppresses apoptosis (35Kroemer G. Biochem. Soc.

https://openalex.org/W2062616792,"Background Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been long believed to be associated with many pathophysiological processes during septic shock. Here we present novel activities for PAF in protecting mice against LPS-mediated endotoxic shock. Principal Findings In vivo PAF treatment immediately after LPS challenge markedly improved the survival rate against mortality from endotoxic shock. Administration of PAF prominently attenuated LPS-induced organ injury, including profound hypotension, excessive polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, and severe multiple organ failure. In addition, PAF treatment protects against LPS-induced lymphocytes apoptosis. These protective effects of PAF was correlated with significantly decreases in the production of the inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12, and IFN-γ, while increasing production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that PAF may protect mice against endotoxic shock via a complex mechanism involving modulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators."

From the proteinase K-cleavable peripheral fraction of Lewy bodies, which was densely cross-linked by γ-glutamyl-ϵ-lysine bonds between HspB1 and ubiquitin in a pattern similar to neurofibrillary tangles (Nemes, Z., Devreese, B., Steinert, P. M., Van Beeumen, J., and Fésüs, L. (2004) <i>FASEB J.</i> 18, 1135–1137), 53 proteins were identified. In the core of Lewy bodies only α-synuclein was found, and it contained a low amount of intramolecular cross-links between Gln-99 and Lys-58. <i>In vitro</i> cross-linking of α-synuclein by transglutaminases 1–3 and 5 produced a heterogeneous population of variably cross-linked α-synucleins in solution, which inhibited the aggregation of the protein into amyloid. However, in the presence of phosphatidylserine-rich membranes and micromolar calcium concentrations, the cross-linking by transglutaminases 1, 2, and 5 showed specificity toward the utilization of Gln-99 and Lys-58. As shown by thioflavin T fluorescence monitoring, the formation of this cross-link accelerated the aggregation of native α-synuclein. Chemical cross-linking of residues 58–99 triggered amyloid formation, whereas such bonding of residues 99 to 10 was inhibitory. Our findings reveal the pivotal role of membrane attachment and transglutaminase-mediated intermolecular cross-linking for the propagative misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein."
https://openalex.org/W2035101641,"Background Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and global profiling of gene expression (microarrays) are two major technological breakthroughs that allow hypothesis-free identification of candidate genes associated with tumorigenesis. It is not obvious whether there is a consistency between the candidate genes identified by GWAS (GWAS genes) and those identified by profiling gene expression (microarray genes). Methodology/Principal Findings We used the Cancer Genetic Markers Susceptibility database to retrieve single nucleotide polymorphisms from candidate genes for prostate cancer. In addition, we conducted a large meta-analysis of gene expression data in normal prostate and prostate tumor tissue. We identified 13,905 genes that were interrogated by both GWASs and microarrays. On the basis of P values from GWASs, we selected 1,649 most significantly associated genes for functional annotation by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. We also conducted functional annotation analysis using same number of the top genes identified in the meta-analysis of the gene expression data. We found that genes involved in cell adhesion were overrepresented among both the GWAS and microarray genes. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the results of these analyses suggest that combining GWAS and microarray data would be a more effective approach than analyzing individual datasets and can help to refine the identification of candidate genes and functions associated with tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2058537734,"Neurons in the cortex exhibit a number of patterns that correlate with working memory. Specifically, averaged across trials of working memory tasks, neurons exhibit different firing rate patterns during the delay of those tasks. These patterns include: 1) persistent fixed-frequency elevated rates above baseline, 2) elevated rates that decay throughout the tasks memory period, 3) rates that accelerate throughout the delay, and 4) patterns of inhibited firing (below baseline) analogous to each of the preceding excitatory patterns. Persistent elevated rate patterns are believed to be the neural correlate of working memory retention and preparation for execution of behavioral/motor responses as required in working memory tasks. Models have proposed that such activity corresponds to stable attractors in cortical neural networks with fixed synaptic weights. However, the variability in patterned behavior and the firing statistics of real neurons across the entire range of those behaviors across and within trials of working memory tasks are typical not reproduced. Here we examine the effect of dynamic synapses and network architectures with multiple cortical areas on the states and dynamics of working memory networks. The analysis indicates that the multiple pattern types exhibited by cells in working memory networks are inherent in networks with dynamic synapses, and that the variability and firing statistics in such networks with distributed architectures agree with that observed in the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2080152761,"Although our previous studies found Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) as a highly up-regulated gene in acute lung injury that could stimulate expressions of other inflammatory cytokines, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

This study was designed to determine whether the effect of PBEF to stimulate expressions of inflammatory cytokines depends on its enzymatic activity. We prepared two human PBEF mutant (H247E and H247A) recombinant proteins and overexpressing constructs for their overexpressions in A549 cells and confirmed that enzymatic activities of both mutants were nearly or completely abolished.

The signal transduction pathways underlying these effects are also not understood. This study was designed to determine whether the effect of PBEF to stimulate expressions of inflammatory cytokines depends on its Nampt enzymatic activity and to dissect signal transduction pathways underlying these effects. We prepared two human PBEF mutant (H247E and H247A) recombinant proteins and overexpressing constructs for their overexpression in A549 cells and confirmed that enzymatic activities of both mutants were nearly or completely abolished.

We also cultured transfected A549 cells in the absence or presence of SB203580, a p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, and JNK inhibitor 1 to probe whether the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways are pertinent to the PBEF-mediated effect.

A549 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-hPBEF, pCAGGS-mutant PBEFs (H247A and H247E), or pCAGGS vector for 24 h. RNA synthesis was blocked by addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, and then total RNA was isolated at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 24 h.

The reporter gene assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (cat. no. E1910, Promega, Madison, WI). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed essentially as described by Wang et al. (16Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) except the probe AP-1/IL-8 (GTG TGA TGA CTC AGG TTT G) (17Zhu Y.M. Bradbury D.A. Pang L. Knox A.J. J.

The CignalTM Reporter Assay for AP-1-dependent GFP reporter activity was performed following the manufacture's manuals (CignalTM Reporter Assay Kits, cat. no. CCS-011G, SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). Plasmids of interest (200 ng) plus Cignal reporter (100 ng) were transfected into A549 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (cat. no. 31985-062, Invitrogen). 48 h later, the transfected cells were directly visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Statistical analyses were performed using the Sigma Stat (ver 3.5, Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of three samples from at least two independent experiments. Stimulated samples were compared with controls by unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To establish the assay of Nampt activity, we first prepared enzymatic components (Nmnat 1 and Nampt) as well as two Nampt mutants (H247E and H247A). As shown in Fig. 1, human MBP-tagged Nmnat 1 and human wild-type and mutant Nampts display a single band with the right molecular weight, respectively, on a Simple BlueTM-stained gel separated by SDS-PAGE, indicating a purity >95%. Two human Nampt mutants (H247E and H247A) were prepared based on the work by Wang and his colleagues (18Wang T. Zhang X. Bheda P. Revollo J.R. Imai S. Wolberger C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 661-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The H247E mutant of Nampt retains low enzymatic activity, whereas the H247A mutant has no detectable activity. As depicted in Fig. 2A, analysis of Nampt enzymatic activity in the enzyme-coupled spectrometric assay requires three enzymes: Nampt, Nmnat1, and alcohol dehydrogenase. MBP-tagged Nmnat 1 displayed a normal enzymatic activity to catalyze the synthesis of NAD from NMN (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we were confident that MBP-tagged Nmnat 1 could be used for the analysis of Nampt enzymatic activity. As presented in Fig. 2C, recombinant wild-type Nampt had a higher activity that can catalyze the synthesis of NAD from nicotinamide while two mutant human Nampts showed a very low or nearly no enzymatic activity. To examine whether PBEF regulates IL-8 expression via its Nampt activity, we transfected A549 cells with pCAGGS-hPBEF (H247E, HE) and pCAGGS-hPBEF (H247A, HA), which overexpress two human PBEF mutants, as well as positive and negative control constructs to assay their effects on IL-8 mRNA level and IL-8 protein secretion. As shown in Fig. 3A, the cell lysate from A549 cells transiently transfected with two pCAGGS-PBEF mutants, pCAGGS vector only and pCAGGS-eGFP, had very low Nampt activities, whereas those cells with wild-type pCAGGS-hPBEF showed a higher Nampt enzymatic activity. However, overexpression of two mutant PBEFs similarly and significantly augmented the IL-8 expression at both mRNA and protein levels as wild-type PBEF (Fig. 3, B and C). The controls, pCAGGS vector only and pCAGGS-eGFP, had no effect. Expression of a housekeeping gene, β-actin, was not affected by any treatment. These results indicate that PBEF can augment IL-8 expression in A549 cells via its nonenzymatic activity. To examine whether the increase of IL-8 gene expression by PBEF in A549 cells is due to an increase of its gene transcription or mRNA stability, we carried out a transcriptional blockade study. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), an RNA polymerase II inhibitor, was added to A549 cell culture 24 h after transfections with different constructs. The IL-8 mRNA level was analyzed by RT-PCR. As presented in Fig. 4(A and B), the rate of IL-8 mRNA decay in all five groups was about the same. β-Actin expression was again used as a housekeeping gene control. It should be pointed out that only one-third of the normal control total RNA amount from wild-type and mutant PBEF groups was used for the RT-PCR analysis. These data suggest that PBEF induces IL-8 expression in A549 cells not due to an increase of its mRNA stability. The result in Fig. 4 suggests that overexpression of PBEF augments IL-8 expression at the transcriptional level. To confirm this notion and to define the regions of the IL-8 promoter involved in PBEF-mediated effect, we prepared several luciferase reporter plasmids containing serial deletions of the proximal region of the IL-8 gene promoter as shown in Fig. 5A. A549 cells were transiently co-transfected with pCAGGS-hPBEF, -mutant PBEF vectors (H247E and H247A), -eGFP vector, pCAGGS vector, and luciferase reporter plasmids containing different IL-8 gene promoter deletants. Luciferase activities were measured after 48 h of the transient transfections. As shown in Fig. 5B, PBEF and mutant PBEFs induced luciferase activity of the −162/IL-8 by 4- to 6-fold compared with control (PBEF versus control: 71.07 ± 7.98 versus 17.35 ± 4.29, n = 3, p < 0.01; H247A versus control: 69.06 ± 8.46 versus 17.35 ± 4.29, n = 3, p < 0.01; H247E versus control: 70.49 ± 7.04 versus 17.35 ± 4.29, n = 3, p < 0.01), while there was no significant difference between pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS-eGFP and the control groups (pCAGGS vector versus control: 14.28 ± 1.11 versus 17.35 ± 4.29, n = 3, NS; pCAGGS-eGFP versus control: 15.33 ± 1.18 versus 17.35 ± 4.29, n = 3, NS). A 5′ deletion to −132 bp did not affect the response of IL-8 promoter to wild-type and mutant PBEF overexpression (PBEF versus control: 68.45 ± 8.41 versus 18.68 ± 2.56, n = 3, p < 0.01; H247A versus control: 70.19 ± 4.76 versus 18.68 ± 2.56, n = 3, p < 0.01; H247E versus control: 69.27 ± 8.38 versus 18.68 ± 2.56, n = 3, p < 0.01), there was also no significant difference between pCAGGS vector, pCAGGS-eGFP, and the control groups (pCAGGS vector versus control: 16.09 ± 1.12 versus 18.68 ± 2.56, n = 3, NS; pCAGGS-eGFP versus control: 17.08 ± 2.88 versus 18.68 ± 2.56, n = 3, NS). However, further deletion to −99 nucleotides and −54 nucleotides reduced the basal activity of the promoter by 2- to 3-fold and almost completely abolished the wild-type PBEF and mutant PBEF-induced luciferase activity (−132/IL-8 versus −99/IL-8 in PBEF group : 68.45 ± 8.41 versus 9.57 ± 1.47, n = 3, p < 0.01; −132/IL-8 versus −99/IL-8 in H247A group: 70.19 ± 4.76 versus 8.66 ± 1.30, n = 3, p < 0.01; −132/IL-8 versus −99/IL-8 in H247E group: 69.27 ± 8.38 versus 9.18 ± 1.14, n = 3, p < 0.01), indicating that the sequence between −132 and −99 nucleotides is critically involved in the wild-type PBEF- or mutant PBEFs-mediated IL-8 gene activation. This region contains a functional AP-1 binding site. These data suggest that AP-1 is required in the wild-type PBEF- or mutant PBEFs-augmented IL-8 gene expression. To corroborate the above finding, we performed EMSA to determine whether PBEF and mutant PBEFs overexpression engendered an increase in the abundance of transcription factor AP-1 that recognizes this region of the IL-8 promoter. As shown in Fig. 6, PBEF and mutant PBEFs overexpression significantly increased the binding of AP-1 compared with those in Control, pCAGGS vector only, and pCAGGS-eGFP groups. The binding to AP-1 site was sequence-specific, because it was competed out by the addition of 200-fold unlabeled cognate oligonucleotide. In addition, Fig. 7 showed that 48 h after co-transfection with GFP Cignal reporter under the control of AP-1 transcription factor, similar numbers of GFP-positive cells were observed in pCAGGS-hPBEF, pCAGGS-H247A, and pCAGGS-H247E groups, further validating the AP-1-dependent regulation of gene expression by PBEF in a non-enzymatic way.FIGURE 7The effects of pCAGGS, -hPBEF, -H247A, and -H247E on AP-1-dependent GFP reporter activity. The A549 cells were separately co-transfected with pCAGGS+Cignal reporter, pCAGGS-hPBEF+Cignal reporter, pCAGGS-H247A+Cignal reporter, pCAGGS-H247E+Cignal reporter, and Cignal-positive or -negative control. After 48-h transfection, the samples were directly analyzed under a fluorescence microscope using an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and detection at 530 nm, ×100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate signal transduction pathways in the PBEF-augmented IL-8 transcription, we cultured transfected A549 cells in the absence or presence of the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, SB203580, and the JNK pathway inhibitor, JNK inhibitor 1, or their combinations and analyzed their reporter gene activities. As presented in Fig. 8, PBEF and mutant PBEF overexpression induction of luciferase activity of IL-8 promoter were significantly attenuated by the treatment of SB203580 (PBEF group: 48.78 ± 1.81 versus 60.52 ± 5.36, n = 3, p < 0.05; H247A group: 47.41 ± 5.33 versus 62.80 ± 4.58, n = 3, p < 0.05; H247E group: 46.38 ± 4.06 versus 59.63 ± 5.44, n = 3, p < 0.05). Similarly, JNK inhibitor 1 was also inhibited luciferase activity of IL-8 promote stimulated by PBEF and mutant PBEF overexpression, although the inhibition was not significant in PBEF and H247E overexpression groups (PBEF group: 51.33 ± 4.49 versus 60.52 ± 5.36, n = 3, NS; H247A group: 49.74 ± 5.63 versus 62.80 ± 4.58, n = 3, p < 0.05; H247E group: 51.40 ± 4.78 versus 59.63 ± 5.44, n = 3, NS). When a combination of these two inhibitors was used, the inhibition became more significant (PBEF group: 40.50 ± 4.82 versus 60.52 ± 5.36, n = 3, p < 0.01; H247A group: 42.93 ± 2.56 versus 62.80 ± 4.58, n = 3, p < 0.01; H247E group: 41.23 ± 3.59 versus 59.63 ± 5.44, n = 3, p < 0.01). These data suggest that wild-type PBEF- or mutant PBEF-mediated augmentation of IL-8 expression is in part via the p38 MAPK pathway and the JNK pathway. To determine whether two mutant PBEFs can also augment the expression of other inflammatory cytokines, we quantitated mRNA levels of IL-16 and CCR3 in A549 cells transfected with the same groups of constructs. As presented in Fig. 9, overexpression of mutant PBEFs similarly and significantly enhanced the expression of IL-16 and CCR3 gene at the mRNA level in A549 cells as the wild-type PBEF, whereas there was no significant difference between pCAGGS-eGFP or pCAGGS vector and the control groups. These data suggest that PBEF could augment the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-16 and CCR3 in A549 cells via its nonenzymatic activity. Although accumulating evidence indicate that PBEF is a pleiotropic protein involved in a number of physiological processes from bacteria to human and its dysregulation has been implicated in the susceptibility and pathogenesis of acute lung injury, sepsis, cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other diseases (19Pilz S. Mangge H. Obermayer-Pietsch B. März W. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 2007; 30: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), only the Nampt enzymatic function of PBEF has been well substantiated (10Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 11Martin P.R. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whether all functions of PBEF depend on its Nampt enzymatic activity remains to be fully elucidated. The data from this study provided the first evidence that PBEF can regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-16, and CCR3 via its nonenzymatic function. In addition, our data revealed a new insight into the signal transduction of PBEF-mediated augmentation of inflammatory cytokine expression, which is AP-1-dependent, in part via p38 MAP kinase pathway and JNK pathway. PBEF cDNA was first cloned by Samal and his colleagues in 1994 and initially named pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (20Samal B. Sun Y. Stearns G. Xie C. Suggs S. McNiece I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That PBEF could be a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase was first shown by Martin et al. (11Martin P.R. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in 2001 in bacteria. Rongvaux et al. (10Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) verified that, similarly to its microbial counterpart, the mammalian PBEF is a Nampt, catalyzing the condensation of nicotinamide with 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate to yield nicotinamide mononucleotide, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of NAD (Fig. 1). A study by Revollo et al. (12Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Nampt is the rate-limiting component in a salvage pathway of the mammalian NAD biosynthesis. Hasmann and Schemainda (22Hasmann M. Schemainda I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7436-7442PubMed Google Scholar) identified an inhibitor to PBEF, FK866, which inhibits its Nampt activity to reduce the cellular NAD synthesis to trigger cell apoptosis in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells. Thus FK866 has been applied in clinical trials to treat cancer patients (23Holen K. Saltz L.B. Hollywood E. Burk K. Hanauske A.R. Invest. New Drugs. 2008; 26: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). van der Veer et al. (24van der Veer E. Ho C. O'Neil C. Barbosa N. Scott R. Cregan S.P. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10841-10845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) proved that it is due to the enhanced Nampt activity of PBEF that cellular lifespan of human primary SMCs, human clonal SMCs, and fibroblasts derived from a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome can be lengthened. Recent work by Revollo et al. (25Revollo J.R. Körner A. Mills K.F. Satoh A. Wang T. Garten A. Dasgupta B. Sasaki Y. Wolberger C. Townsend R.R. Milbrandt J. Kiess W. Imai S. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) revealed that Nampt regulates insulin secretion in beta cells as a systemic NAD biosynthetic enzyme. In short, it has been well documented that PBEF is a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, and its enzymatic activity is attributed for its various functions. However, Li et al. (26Li Y. Zhang Y. Dorweiler B. Cui D. Wang T. Woo C.W. Brunkan C.S. Wolberger C. Imai S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34833-34843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) recently reported that extracellular PBEF protected macrophages from endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis by activating an IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway via a nonenzymatic mechanism. Our study here provided seven lines of evidence to support PBEF augmenting expressions of inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-16, and CCR3 via its nonenzymatic mechanisms. Firstly, two human PBEF mutants similarly increased IL-8 mRNA level as wild-type PBEF (Fig. 3). Secondly, we found that this effect was not due to the increased IL-8 mRNA stability (Fig. 5), suggesting that a transcriptional mechanism may be operative. Both mutants behaved like the wild-type PBEF. Thirdly, augmentation of IL-8 expression by both mutants and the wild-type PBEF is AP-1-dependent, because the reporter gene assay indicated that, without a functional AP-1 binding site, theses effects were abrogated (Fig. 5). Fourth, gel shifting assays indicated that overexpression of two PBEF mutants similarly increased the binding of AP-1 to the IL-8 gene promoter as the wild-type PBEF (Fig. 6). Fifth, an AP-1-driven GFP Cignal reporter assay revealed a similar number of GFP-positive cells in pCAGGS-hPBEF-, pCAGGS-H247A-, and pCAGGS-H247E-transfected A549 cells (Fig. 7). Sixth, SB203580, a p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, and JNK inhibitor 1 attenuated the augmentative effects of both two mutants and the wild-type PBEF on IL-8 transcription similarly (Fig. 8). Seventh, both PBEF mutants similarly stimulated the expression of two other inflammatory cytokines: IL-16 and CCR3 as the wild-type PBEF. It indicates that this is a general mechanism underlying PBEF's role in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines, not restricted to the IL-8 gene alone. PBEF is joined in a unique protein club in which protein members not only function as enzymes but also display other functions unrelated to their enzymatic activities. Recently, Xu et al. (27Xu J. Gao X.P. Ramchandran R. Zhao Y.Y. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 880-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) found that myosin II regulatory light-chain kinase had a myosin II regulatory light-chain phosphorylation-independent function in complex with c-Src and Pyk2. This nonenzymatic function of myosin II regulatory light-chain kinase was essential for neutrophil transmigration during sepsis-induced lung injury. The results by Zhai et al. (28Zhai R.G. Zhang F. Hiesinger P.R. Cao Y. Haueter C.M. Bellen H.J. Nature. 2008; 452: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) implicate nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), which can catalyze the NAD formation using nicotinamide mononucleotide as a substrate, as a stress-response protein that acts as a chaperone for neuronal maintenance and protection. This chaperone activity of NMNAT is independent of its enzymatic activity, i.e. the NAD synthesis activity. ALI/ARDS is characterized by an acute inflammatory process in the airspaces and lung parenchyma. Evidence from several clinical studies indicates that a complex network of inflammatory cytokines play a major role in mediating, amplifying, and perpetuating the lung injury process (29Goodman R.B. Pugin J. Lee J.S. Matthay M.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-8 have been identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from ARDS patients. IL-8 has been identified as one of biomarkers of ALI/ARDS mortality (30Ware L.B. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 33: S217-S222Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies of models of acute inflammation have established IL-8 as a key mediator in neutrophil-mediated acute inflammation (31Mukaida N. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Wang et al. reported that IL-16 was a critical factor in the development of inflammation-mediated renal injury and may be a therapeutic target for prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury of the kidney (32Wang S.

Animal studies suggest that CCR3 is a prominent mediator of allergic responses and that antagonizing the receptor will lead to a reduction in airway inflammation (33De Lucca G.V. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2006; 9: 516-524PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study on animal models of ALI and human patients with ARDS identified PBEF as a biochemical and genetic marker in ALI (5Ye S.Q. Simon B.A. Maloney J.P. Zambelli-Weiner A. Gao L. Grant A. Easley R.B. McVerry B.J. Tuder R.M. Standiford T. Brower R.G. Barnes K.C. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 171: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies found that PBEF could modulate IL-1β and the role of tumor necrosis factor-α in their inductions of other inflammatory cytokines as well as directly regulate the expression of IL-8, IL-16, and CCR3. This study provided a new insight into the signal transduction process in PBEF-mediated augmentation of inflammatory cytokine expression, i.e. an AP-1-dependent nonenzymatic mechanism in part via p38 MAPK and JNK pathways. These data lend further support that PBEF might be an important signal transducer or initiator in the inflammation process to regulate the synthesis of IL-8 or other inflammatory cytokines, and PBEF could play a critical role as an inflammatory factor during the pathogenesis of ALI. PBEF expression is up-regulated in a variety of other acute and chronic inflammatory diseases such as sepsis (34Jia S.H. Li Y. Parodo J. Kapus A. Fan L. Rotstein O.D. Marshall J.C. J. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2051677647,"Background The cellular prion protein, PrPC, is GPI anchored and abundant in lipid rafts. The absolute requirement of PrPC in neurodegeneration associated to prion diseases is well established. However, the function of this ubiquitous protein is still puzzling. Our previous work using the 1C11 neuronal model, provided evidence that PrPC acts as a cell surface receptor. Besides a ubiquitous signaling function of PrPC, we have described a neuronal specificity pointing to a role of PrPC in neuronal homeostasis. 1C11 cells, upon appropriate induction, engage into neuronal differentiation programs, giving rise either to serotonergic (1C115-HT) or noradrenergic (1C11NE) derivatives. Methodology/Principal Findings The neuronal specificity of PrPC signaling prompted us to search for PrPC partners in 1C11-derived bioaminergic neuronal cells. We show here by immunoprecipitation an association of PrPC with an 80 kDa protein identified by mass spectrometry as the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). This interaction occurs in lipid rafts and is restricted to 1C11-derived neuronal progenies. Our data indicate that TNAP is implemented during the differentiation programs of 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells and is active at their cell surface. Noteworthy, TNAP may contribute to the regulation of serotonin or catecholamine synthesis in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE bioaminergic cells by controlling pyridoxal phosphate levels. Finally, TNAP activity is shown to modulate the phosphorylation status of laminin and thereby its interaction with PrP. Conclusion/Significance The identification of a novel PrPC partner in lipid rafts of neuronal cells favors the idea of a role of PrP in multiple functions. Because PrPC and laminin functionally interact to support neuronal differentiation and memory consolidation, our findings introduce TNAP as a functional protagonist in the PrPC-laminin interplay. The partnership between TNAP and PrPC in neuronal cells may provide new clues as to the neurospecificity of PrPC function."

The Ras signal transduction pathway is a central hub for a variety of pro-oncogenic events with a fundamental role in normal and neoplastic physiology. In this work we were interested in linking Ras activation to HSV-1 replication in a direct manner in order to generate a novel oncolytic herpes virus which can target cancer cells. To establish such link, we developed a mutant HSV-1 in which the expression of ICP4 (infected cell protein-4, a viral protein necessary for replication) is controlled by activation of ELK, a transcription factor down-stream of the Ras pathway and mainly activated by ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, an important Ras effector pathway). This mutant HSV-1 was named as Signal-Smart 1 (SS1). A series of prostate cells were infected with the SS1 virus. Cells with elevated levels of ELK activation were preferentially infected by the SS1 virus, as demonstrated by increased levels of viral progeny, herpetic glycoprotein C and overall SS1 viral protein production. Upon exposure to SS1, the proliferation, invasiveness and colony formation capabilities of prostate cancer cells with increased ELK activation were significantly decreased (p<0.05), while the rate of apoptosis/necrosis in these cells was increased. Additionally, high Ras signaling cells infected with SS1 showed a prominent arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle as compared to cells exposed to parental HSV-1. The results of this study reveal the potential for re-modeling the host-herpes interaction to specifically interfere with the life of cancer cells with increased Ras signaling. SS1 also serves as a ""prototype"" for development of a family of signal-smart viruses which can target cancer cells on the basis of their signaling portfolio."
https://openalex.org/W2097869309,"Estrogen may be involved in the development of prostate cancer. The association between genetic polymorphisms of estrogen receptors alpha (ESR1) and beta (ESR2) and prostate cancer risk was examined in a nested case-control study in Washington County, Maryland. Incident prostate cancer cases (n = 269) were matched to one or two controls (n = 440) by age, sex, race, and date of blood donation. Associations between estrogen receptor genotypes or dietary intake and the development of prostate cancer were examined in conditional logistic regression models. Results from this study showed that six single base-pair polymorphisms (SNPs) of ESR1 (rs1801132, rs2077647, rs746432, rs2273206, rs851982, rs2228480) and four SNPs of ESR2 (rs4986938, rs928554, rs8018687, rs number not available for ESR2 5696 bp 3' of STP A>G) were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk, either by allelic or genotypic frequencies. However, an interactive association with BMI was observed in the relationship between prostate cancer risk and genotypes of ESR2 38 bp 3' of STP G>A (rs4986938) (p = 0.031). An interaction between intake level of phytoestrogen and genotypes of ESR1 Ex1-192G>C (rs746432) and between intake level of phytoestrogen and genotypes of ESR1 Ex8+229G>A (rs2228480) and risk of prostate cancer was observed (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.044, respectively). In conclusion, selected genetic polymorphisms of ESR1 and ESR2, overall, were not associated with prostate cancer risk. However, a variation in risk by BMI and phytoestrogen intake was implicated."
https://openalex.org/W2006709274,"Infant crying is an important cue for mothers to respond adequately. Inappropriate response to infant crying can hinder social development in infants. In rodents, the pup-mother interaction largely depends on pup's calls. Mouse pups emit high frequency to ultrasonic vocalization (2-90 kHz) to communicate with their dam for maternal care. However, little is known about how the maternal response to infant crying or pup calls affects social development over the long term.Here we used mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 3 (Asic3(-/-)) to create a hearing deficit to probe the effect of caregiver hearing on maternal care and adolescent social development. Female Asic3(-/-) mice showed elevated hearing thresholds for low to ultrasonic frequency (4-32 kHz) on auditory brain stem response, which thus hindered their response to their pups' wriggling calls and ultrasonic vocalization, as well as their retrieval of pups. In adolescence, pups reared by Asic3(-/-) mice showed a social deficit in juvenile social behaviors as compared with those reared by wild-type or heterozygous dams. The social-deficit phenotype in juvenile mice reared by Asic3(-/-) mice was associated with the reduced serotonin transmission of the brain. However, Asic3(-/-) pups cross-fostered to wild-type dams showed rescued social deficit.Inadequate response to pups' calls as a result of ASIC3-dependent hearing loss confers maternal deficits in caregivers and social development deficits in their young."
https://openalex.org/W2087550837,"The trophoblast-specific gene PLAC1 (placenta-specific 1) is ectopically expressed in a wide range of human malignancies, most frequently in breast cancer, and is essentially involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Here we show that basal activity of the PLAC1 promoter is selectively controlled by ubiquitous transcription factor SP1 and isoform 2 of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β that we found to be selectively expressed in placental tissue and cancer cells. Binding of both factors to their respective elements within the PLAC1 promoter was essential to attain full promoter activity. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling further augmented transcription and translation of PLAC1 and most likely accounts for the positive correlation between PLAC1 expression levels and the ERα status we observed in primary breast cancer specimens. DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that transactivation of the PLAC1 promoter by ligand-activated ERα is based on a nonclassical pathway independent of estrogen-response elements, by tethering of ERα to DNA-bound CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β-2, and SP1.

Our findings provide first insight into a novel and hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism governing selective activation of trophoblast-specific gene expression in breast cancer. More than 100 years ago Scottish embryologist John Beard proposed a “trophoblastic theory of cancer” based on phenotypical similarities between the pregnancy trophoblast and cancer cells (1Beard J. Lancet. 1902; 1: 1758-1761Abstract Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In particular, these shared features are invasion in surrounding tissues (2Strickland S. Richards W.G.

Based on these observations, it has long been speculated that cancer cells acquire characteristic traits by reactivation of embryonic or fetal gene programs, most prominently depicted by the ectopic production of oncofetal antigens, such as α-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen, and the aberrant production of chorionic gonadotropin and other trophoblastic hormones (8Dirnhofer S. Koessler P. Ensinger C. Feichtinger H. Madersbacher S. Berger P. Hum. Pathol. 1998; 29: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Iles R.K. Chard T. J.

The knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying ectopic activation of placenta-specific genes in cancer, however, is sparse. In a recent study, we introduced PLAC1 as novel member of cancer-associated placental genes (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The PLAC1 gene encodes a membrane-associated protein that is speculated to serve a receptor-like function modulating specific cell-cell or ligand-receptor interactions unique to the maternal-placental interface (12Fant M. Weisoly D.L. Cocchia M. Huber R. Khan S. Lunt T. Schlessinger D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 63: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PLAC1 is strictly confined to differentiated cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, in which it is expressed throughout human gestation, but underlies tight transcriptional repression in all other normal tissues (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Fant M. Weisoly D.L. Cocchia M. Huber R. Khan S. Lunt T.

Dev. 2005; 71: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the course of malignant transformation, however, PLAC1 is frequently activated and highly expressed in a variety of tumor types, in particular breast cancer. Applying RNA interference technology, we found that PLAC1 has a tumor-promoting role and is a critical factor for proliferation, migration, and chemotactic invasion of cancer cells (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, treatment of human breast cancer cells with a PLAC1-specific antibody was sufficient to suppress cell proliferation and phosphorylation of AKT kinase, proposing PLAC1 as a target candidate for therapeutic antibody development against cancer. PLAC1 in trophoblast cells seems to be modulated by growth factors important for normal trophoblast differentiation (13Massabbal E. Parveen S. Weisoly D.L. Nelson D.M. Smith S.D. Fant M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2005; 71: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms mediating ectopic activation of PLAC1 in neoplastic cells have not been specified so far. Identification of these mechanisms is likely to further shed light on the biological functions of PLAC1, its role in breast cancer carcinogenesis, and its suitability as therapeutic target. Moreover, such knowledge might help to gain a general understanding of the factors involved in activation of trophoblast-specific transcriptional programs in cancer. Having already shown that ectopic activation of PLAC1 is not linked to DNA hypomethylation of the promoter region (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we now aimed to identify the cis-elements and trans-factors that regulate PLAC1 promoter activity in breast cancer cells. Recombinant DNA work was done with the official permission and according to the rules of the State Government of Rhineland-Palatinate. Tissues were stored at −80 °C until use. Breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum.

Binding of C/EBPβ and SP1 to the predicted binding sites was assessed using NoShift transcription factor assay kit (Novagen). Briefly, biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides covering the wild type (C/EBPβ, 5′-ACC ACC ATG TTG TAA CCC TCC-3′; SP1, 5′-CCT CCT CCC CGC CCT TCT TCC-3′) or the mutated (C/EBPβ, 5′-ACC ACC ATA CCA CGG TCC TCC-3′; SP1, 5′-CCT CCT AAA AGA AAT TCT TCC-3′) PLAC1 promoter-binding sites were incubated with nuclear extracts of MCF-7 cells. The extract/probe mixtures were transferred to a Streptavidin-coated 96-well plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibodies specific for C/EBPβ and SP1 (Abcam) were added to the samples and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After final washing, TMB substrate was added to the samples to develop colorimetric signal before quenching the reaction with 1 n HCl. Sample absorbance was read at 450 nm on a Wallac Victor2 multiple label counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The C/EBPβ small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (Qiagen) targeted nucleotides 983–1001 (siRNA1) and 962–980 (siRNA2) of the C/EBPβ mRNA sequence (NM_005194.2) and SP1 siRNA duplexes targeted nucleotides 1984–2002 (siRNA1) and 5449–5467 (siRNA2) of the SP1 mRNA sequence (NM_138473.2). As control a nonsilencing siRNA duplex (sense 5′-r(UAA CUG UAU AAU CGA CUA G)dTdT-5′, antisense 5′-r(CUA GUC GAU UAU ACA GUU A)dGdA-3′) was used. Cells were transfected with 10 nm siRNA duplex using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extraction, first-strand cDNA synthesis and real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR) were performed as previously described (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Koslowski M. Sahin U. Huber C. Türeci O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2392-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Real time quantitative expression analysis was performed in triplicates in a 40 cycle RT-PCR. After normalization to HPRT (sense 5′-TGA CAC TGG CAA AAC AAT GCA-3′; antisense 5′-GGT CCT TTT CAC CAG CAA GCT-3′, 62 °C annealing), expression of PLAC1 (sense 5′-AAA TTT GGC AGC TGC CTT CAC-3′; antisense 5′-TGA TGC CAC ATT CAG TAA CAC-3′, 60 °C annealing) was quantified using ΔΔCT calculation. The PLAC1 promoter region (−1022 to +12) was cloned into the basic pGL4 luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Variants containing mutated C/EBPβ- and SP1-binding sites were generated using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 24 h prior to transfection, 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well plates. Promoter constructs were co-transfected with an eGFP reporter construct as transfection and normalization control using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection cells were collected and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured on an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan). Whole cell and tissue lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer. For preparation of nuclear extracts, NucBuster protein extraction kit (Novagen) was used. Extracts were diluted in reducing sample buffer (Roth), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and subsequently blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall). Immunostaining was performed with antibodies reactive to PLAC1 (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), C/EBPβ, SP1, ERα, ERβ, and β-actin (all from Abcam), followed by detection of primary antibodies with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The coding sequence of PLAC1 was cloned into the pST1-A120 plasmid described recently (15Holtkamp S. Kreiter S. Selmi A. Simon P. Koslowski M. Huber C. Türeci O. Sahin U.

Plasmids were linearized, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and sodium acetate precipitation, and used as templates for in vitro transcription (ivt) with Message-Machine kit (Ambion). ivtRNA concentration and quality were assessed by spectrophotometry and agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 250 μl of X-VIVO-15 medium (Cambrex), transferred into a 4-mm gap sterile electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), electroporated (225 V, 250 microfarads) with 5 μg of ivtRNA using a Gene-Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad), and cultured for 12 h prior to experiments. Biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides are described under “Transcription Factor Binding Assays.” 50 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated with 40 μl of a 50% streptavidin-agarose slurry (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The supernatant collected by centrifugation was incubated with 0.2 μg of wild type or mutant biotin-labeled probe in binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. DNA-protein complexes were then incubated with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose (pre-equilibrated in the binding buffer for 1 h) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. DNA-protein complexes were washed five times with the binding buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of protein sample buffer (Roth) and then boiled for 5 min to dissociate the complexes. The proteins were resolved by PAGE followed by Western blot detection with specific antibodies. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 107 MCF-7 cells under different treatments indicated in the corresponding experiments were used for each ChIP reaction. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and lysed in SDS lysis buffer. Soluble chromatin was prepared by sonication followed by immunoclearing. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight utilizing specific antibodies to transcription factors SP1 and C/EBPβ and transactivator ERα. Following immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose beads and salmon sperm DNA were added. After several rounds of washing the precipitates were extracted three times with 1% SDS, 0.1% NaHCO3. After reversal of cross-linking with 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 6 h, precipitates were treated with proteinase K, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was analyzed by conventional PCR and real time PCR for the presence of the human PLAC1 promoter fragment −348/−198 bp (sense 5′-CAA CAG CAA GCA CTA CAA GTG-3′; antisense 5′-GAA GCT CAA CTC GGT GCA CTT GTT C-3′) and for the fragment −1219/−1064 bp upstream to the promoter (sense 5′-AAG CAC TTA GGA CAG CAT CTG-3′; antisense 5′-TGA ATG ATA CCT ACT GTC ATG). PCR amplification of 1% of the soluble chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation was used as input control. The ChIP-precipitated DNA and input DNA were quantified by real time PCR using SYBR Green (Qiagen) in an ABI 7300 sequence detection system. Complexes were eluted from the primary immunoprecipitation by incubation with 5 mm DTT at 37 °C for 20 min and diluted with buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) followed by re-immunoprecipitation with a different relevant antibody. Subsequent steps of ChIP re-immunoprecipitations were as for the initial immunoprecipitations. As a first step for exploration of PLAC1 gene regulation, we analyzed the sequence of the PLAC1 promoter region. This led to the identification of a typical TATA box element (TATAAA) at position −15 to −10 and the prediction of several other cis-acting elements (Fig. 1A). A sequence at position −286 to −278 closely resembling the consensus C/EBPβ-binding site attracted our attention, as C/EBPβ has been reported to transactivate several trophoblast-specific genes (18Chakrabarty A.

The cytosine at position −278 did not match the consensus sequence T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G); however, a considerable number of functional sites differ from the published consensus sequence at this position (23Akira S.

It was particularly interesting to find a consensus sequence for specificity protein 1 (SP1) at position −271 to −264 in close vicinity to the C/EBPβ site, as this ubiquitous transcription factor is known to collaborate with cell-specific transcription factors serving as essential co-regulator of inducible or developmentally controlled genes (24Dong J.

Next, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based transcription factor binding assay was performed to verify that both transcription factors were able to bind to their respective elements. Incubation of nuclear cell extract from MCF-7 breast cancer cells as source of transcription factors with biotinylated oligonucleotide capture probes representing the putative C/EBPβ- and SP1-binding sequences within the PLAC1 promoter resulted in the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 1B). Mutation of the biotinylated oligonucleotide probes of either transcription factor binding site, however, suppressed binding of the respective transcription factors. Complex formation was inhibited by excess amounts of the nonbiotinylated capture probes as competitors, but not by competitor probes with mutated binding sites, confirming specificity of these interactions. Having shown that C/EBPβ and SP1 were able to bind to their predicted nuclear binding sites, we wanted to assess whether binding of the two transcription factors was sufficient to activate the PLAC1 promoter. Luciferase reporter genes directed by the wild type PLAC1 promoter domain (−1022 to +12) or by domains with mutated C/EBPβ and/or SP1 protein binding sites were expressed in PLAC-positive SK-BR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In all three cell lines single mutation of the C/EBPβ-binding site decreased the promoter activity by 80–90%, and single mutation of the SP1 site caused marked reduction of the promoter activity by 60–70% (Fig. 1C). Double mutation of both elements nearly completely abrogated promoter activity in all cell lines, indicating that both factors are required to attain full PLAC1 promoter activity. These results showed that basal PLAC1 promoter activity in breast cancer cells is essentially regulated by C/EBPβ and SP1. Constitutive expression of C/EBPβ has been reported in several human tissues, including liver, lung, ovary, placenta, and breast epithelial cells (27Bamberger A.M. Makrigiannakis A. Schröder M.

Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These data required reanalysis as they did not comply with the highly specific expression of C/EBPβ-regulated PLAC1 in the trophoblastic lineage of placental tissue. Being aware of the existence of three C/EBPβ isoforms (C/EBPβ-1, 56 kDa; CEBPβ-2, 48 kDa; and C/EBPβ-3, 21 kDa) generated by differential initiation of translation, we resorted to an anti-C/EBPβ antibody directed against the C terminus of C/EBPβ capable of binding to all three protein isoforms. Analysis of an extended set of human tissues and cell lines disclosed C/EBPβ-2 as being selectively expressed in placenta and PLAC1-positive breast cancer samples and cell lines, whereas it was absent from all PLAC1-negative tissues (Fig. 2A). The broader expression pattern of C/EBPβ-1, in contrast, did not correlate at all with the tissue distribution of PLAC1. C/EBPβ-3 was not detected in any of the samples analyzed. To assess the impact of C/EBPβ-2 on PLAC1 expression more directly, we silenced C/EBPβ-2 expression in SK-BR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells by transient transfection with two independent sets of siRNA duplexes, which resulted in loss of PLAC1 expression in all three cell lines (Fig. 2B). Analogously, introduction of C/EBPβ-2 into human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that only express C/EBPβ-1 by electroporation of in vitro transcribed RNA (ivtRNA) was sufficient to induce PLAC1 protein expression (Fig. 2C). As shown by luciferase reporter gene assays, the PLAC1 promoter was activated in HMECs in the presence of C/EBPβ-2 ivtRNA but was silent in the absence of this isoform or mutational disruption of at least one of the two binding sites for C/EBPβ-2 and SP1 within the promoter sequence (Fig. 2D). In summary, these investigations revealed C/EBPβ-2 to be essentially involved in selective activation of the PLAC1 gene. By correlation analyses, we sought to determine additional factors involved in transcriptional control of PLAC1 gene. Previously, we reported that PLAC1 expression in breast cancers was not associated with particular histological subtypes, tumor stage, or tumor grade (11Koslowski M. Sahin U. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Seitz G. Huber C. Türeci O. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9528-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, we found a striking correlation between PLAC1 expression and the ERα status of breast cancer samples (Fig. 3A). ERα-positive tumors display significantly higher PLAC1 expression levels compared with ERα-negative tumors. To analyze whether this reflects estrogen-induced transactivation, we quantified endogenous PLAC1 mRNA expression in ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in response to treatment with E2. This was compared with cells, which were either not treated or treated with ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI), which is known to efficiently inhibit the actions of endogenous and exogenous estradiol. Induction of PLAC1 expression was detectable as early as 2 h after addition of E2. Maximum induction of PLAC1 transcript levels to 9–10-fold higher as compared with control cells was reached after 8 h (Fig. 3B). This also resulted in increased PLAC1 protein levels in E2-treated cells but not in control cells (Fig. 3C). Importantly, PLAC1 protein was still detectable in the absence of E2, proving that basal expression of PLAC1 is not dependent on ERα signaling. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with a luciferase reporter gene driven by the wild type PLAC1 promoter (−1022 to +12) resulted in 10-fold induction of luciferase activity after E2 treatment (Fig. 3D). This was not the case upon treatment with controls, indicating that the E2 regulatory elements are located within the cloned PLAC1 promoter sequence. Classically, activated ERα binds to estrogen-response elements (EREs) in target gene promoters and recruits cofactors to induce or repress transcription (31Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). We were not able to identify a classical ERE in the proximal 5′-flanking region of PLAC1, which implied that E2-mediated transactivation of PLAC1 may be directed by an ERE-independent ERα signaling pathway. ERα is capable of a nonclassical mode of action altering the transcription of genes in the absence of direct binding to DNA by engaging in protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors bound to their cognate DNA elements in the promoter of respective target genes (32Björnström L. Sjöberg M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 33Marino M. Galluzzo P. Ascenzi P. Curr. Genomics. 2006; 7: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We evaluated C/EBPβ-2 and SP1 as potential interaction partners of ERα for transactivation of PLAC1. siRNA-mediated silencing of C/EBPβ-2 and SP1 (supplemental Fig. 1) in MCF-7 cells abrogated inducibility of PLAC1 by treatment with E2, whereas E2 responsiveness of PLAC1 induction was not altered in untreated control cells or cells transfected with nonsilencing siRNA (Fig. 4A). Assays with luciferase reporter genes directed by the wild type PLAC1 promoter sequence, but not by variants with mutated C/EBPβ and/or SP1-binding sites, revealed the need for occupancy and functionality of both binding sites to allow for maximal E2-induced transactivation of PLAC1 (Fig. 4B). To better understand the interaction of C/EBPβ-2 and SP1 with ERα, we conducted DAPA using biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides featuring wild type and mutant variants of C/EBPβ and SP1 sites derived from the PLAC1 promoter. These probes were incubated with nuclear extracts from untreated MCF-7 cells or MCF-7 cells treated with 100 nm E2, in the presence or absence of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI, or with ICI alone. Immunoblots of these nuclear extracts showed that protein levels of SP1 and C/EBPβ-2 were not altered by these treatments (Fig. 5A). ERα levels increased significantly in response to E2 treatment, which was prevented by co-treatment with the E2 receptor antagonist ICI. Using an antibody specific to ERβ we confirmed previously published data that MCF-7 cells do not express ERβ protein (34Omoto Y. Eguchi H. Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Hayashi S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5011-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Paruthiyil S. Parmar H. Kerekatte V. Cunha G.R. Firestone G.L. Leitman D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), proving that the observed E2-dependent effects were specifically mediated by activation of ERα. DNA affinity precipitation was conducted with these quality-controlled nuclear lysates to determine whether DNA-bound C/EBPβ-2 and SP1 target ERα to the complex (Fig. 5B). Most remarkably, probing with C/EBPβ-2 as well as SP1 wild type capture oligonucleotides allowed retrieval of a complex of ERα, C/EBPβ-2, and SP1 transcription factors from cells treated with E2 but not from cells that treated with E2/ICI or ICI. No binding or protein complex precipitation was shown with mutated probe variants of either transcription factor-binding site. These findings indicated that in addition to the mutual recruitment of ERα to SP1 and C/EBPβ, ERα could link both transfactors when only one of them is bound to DNA. Next, we analyzed endogenous formation of the tertiary protein complex on the PLAC1 promoter in MCF-7 cells. ChIP assays showed no apparent differences in the recruitment of SP1 to the promoter in the presence or absence of E2 with or without ERα antagonist ICI (Fig. 5, C and D). In contrast, recruitment of C/EBPβ and ERα was strongly and specifically induced by E2. The association of these transfactors in the complex was further shown in re-ChIP assays by the sequential use of first C/EBPβ and thereafter ERα antibodies or vice versa (Fig. 5E). These observations not only demonstrate non-ERE-dependent tethering of E2-activated ERα to C/EBPβ-2 as well as SP1 bound to their cognate binding sites within the endogenous PLAC1 promoter. They further imply that transactivation of PLAC1 by E2-activated ERα is primarily mediated by enhanced recruitment of C/EBPβ-2 to its element after complex formation. Furthermore, as enhanced recruitment of C/EBPβ-2"
https://openalex.org/W2064480846,"As genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are becoming more popular, two approaches, among others, could be considered in order to improve statistical power for identifying genes contributing subtle to moderate effects to human diseases. The first approach is to increase sample size, which could be achieved by combining both unrelated and familial subjects together. The second approach is to jointly analyze multiple correlated traits. In this study, by extending generalized estimating equations (GEEs), we propose a simple approach for performing univariate or multivariate association tests for the combined data of unrelated subjects and nuclear families. In particular, we correct for population stratification by integrating principal component analysis and transmission disequilibrium test strategies. The proposed method allows for multiple siblings as well as missing parental information. Simulation studies show that the proposed test has improved power compared to two popular methods, EIGENSTRAT and FBAT, by analyzing the combined data, while correcting for population stratification. In addition, joint analysis of bivariate traits has improved power over univariate analysis when pleiotropic effects are present. Application to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 (GAW16) data sets attests to the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2148210664,"The killer cell lectin-like receptor G1, KLRG1, is a cell surface receptor expressed on subsets of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. KLRG1 was recently found to recognize E-cadherin and thus inhibit immune responses by regulating the effector function and the developmental processes of NK and T cells. E-cadherin is expressed on epithelial cells and exhibits Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions that contribute to cell-cell junctions. However, the mechanism underlying the molecular recognition of KLRG1 by E-cadherin remains unclear. Here, we report structural, binding, and functional analyses of this interaction using multiple methods. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that KLRG1 binds the E-cadherin N-terminal domains 1 and 2 with low affinity (Kd ∼7–12 μm), typical of cell-cell recognition receptors. NMR binding studies showed that only a limited N-terminal region of E-cadherin, comprising the homodimer interface, exhibited spectrum perturbation upon KLRG1 complex formation. It was confirmed by binding studies using a series of E-cadherin mutants. Furthermore, killing assays using KLRG1+NK cells and reporter cell assays demonstrated the functional significance of the N-terminal region of E-cadherin. These results suggest that KLRG1 recognizes the N-terminal homodimeric interface of domain 1 of E-cadherin and binds only the monomeric form of E-cadherin to inhibit the immune response. This raises the possibility that KLRG1 detects monomeric E-cadherin at exposed cell surfaces to control the activation threshold of NK and T cells.

For example, NK cells can kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells without presensitization to a specific antigen, and they produce various cytokines, including interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α (1Biron C.A.

NK cells are controlled by both inhibitory and activating receptors that are expressed on their surfaces (2Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev.

The killer cell Ig-like receptor, Ly49, CD94/NKG2, and paired Ig-like type 2 receptor families include both inhibitory and activating members and thus are designated as paired receptor families. On the other hand, some inhibitory receptors, including KLRG1 (killer cell lectin-like receptor G1), and activating receptors, such as NKG2D, also exist.

These inhibitory and activating receptors can also be divided into two structurally different groups, the Ig-like receptors and the C-type lectin-like receptors, based on the structural aspects of their extracellular regions. The Ig-like receptors include killer cell Ig-like receptors and the leukocyte Ig-like receptors, and the C-type lectin-like receptors include CD94/NKG2(KLRD/KLRC), Ly49(KLRA), NKG2D(KLRK), NKR-P1(KLRB), and KLRG1. Many of these immune receptors recognize major histocompatibility complex class I molecules or their relatives (2Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 225-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 3Moretta L. Moretta A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Yokoyama W.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but there are still many orphan receptors expressed on NK cells. KLRG1 was one such orphan receptor; however, E-cadherin was recently found to be a ligand of KLRG1 (5Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Gründemann C. Bauer M. Schweier O. von Oppen N. Lässing U. Saudan P. Becker K.F. Karp K. Hanke T. Bachmann M.F. Pircher H. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although major histocompatibility complex-receptor interactions have been extensively examined, the molecular basis of non-major histocompatibility complex ligand-receptor recognition is poorly understood. KLRG1 is a type II membrane protein, with one C-type lectin domain in the extracellular region, one transmembrane region, and one immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. KLRG1 is expressed on a subset of mature NK cells in spleen, lungs, and peripheral blood during normal development. KLRG1 expression is induced on the surface of NK cells during viral responses (7Robbins S.H. Tessmer M.S. Mikayama T. Brossay L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Robbins S.H. Nguyen K.B. Takahashi N. Mikayama T. Biron C.A. Brossay L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). NK cells expressing KLRG1 produce low levels of interferon-γ and cytokines and have a slow in vivo turnover rate and low proliferative responsiveness to interleukin-15 (9Huntington N.D. Tabarias H. Fairfax K. Brady J. Hayakawa Y. Degli-Esposti M.A. Smyth M.J. Tarlinton D.M. Nutt S.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 4764-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KLRG1 is recognized as a marker of some T cell subsets, as follows. KLRG1 defines a subset of T cells, short lived effector CD8 T cells (SLECs), which are mature effector cells that express high levels of KLRG1 and cannot be differentiated into long lived memory CD8 T cells. In addition, memory precursor effector cells express low levels of KLRG1 and harbor the potential to become long lived memory CD8 T cells (10Joshi N.S. Cui W. Chandele A. Lee H.K. Urso D.R. Hagman J. Gapin L. Kaech S.M. Immunity. 2007; 27: 281-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Since SLECs exhibit stronger effector function than memory precursor effector cells, it is potentially beneficial, in terms of preventing harmful excess cytotoxicity, that SLECs express KLRG1 at a higher level to inhibit the immune response. Taken together, the expression of KLRG1 during the viral response and normal development might confer the inhibition of effector function and the regulation of NK and T cell proliferation (9Huntington N.D. Tabarias H. Fairfax K. Brady J. Hayakawa Y. Degli-Esposti M.A. Smyth M.J. Tarlinton D.M. Nutt S.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 4764-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). E-cadherin plays a pivotal role in Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion and also contributes to tissue organization and development (11Gooding J.M. Yap K.L. Ikura M. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 13Gumbiner B.M. J.

E-cadherin is primarily expressed on epithelial cells, and its extracellular region consists of several domains that include cadherin motifs (15Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 16Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grübel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). These domains mediate Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions to facilitate cell adhesion. When E-cadherins form cis- or trans-homodimers, they utilize their N-terminal regions as an interface, which can dock with domain 1 of another E-cadherin to form strand exchange (17Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N-terminal region plays important roles in homophilic binding and cell adhesion. KLRG1 recognizes E-cadherins (and other class I cadherins), which are widely expressed in tissues and form tight adhesive cell-cell junctions, and Ito et al. (5Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) demonstrated that E-cadherin binding by KLRG1 inhibits NK cytotoxicity. Further, Gründermann et al. (6Gründemann C. Bauer M. Schweier O. von Oppen N. Lässing U. Saudan P. Becker K.F. Karp K. Hanke T. Bachmann M.F. Pircher H. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that the E-cadherin-KLRG1 interaction inhibits the antigen-induced proliferation and induction of the cytolytic activity of CD8 T cells. Therefore, it is plausible that E-cadherin recognition by KLRG1, expressed on the surfaces of NK cells and T cells, may raise their activation thresholds by transducing inhibitory signals. Such an inhibition would prevent the excess injury of normal cells, which might result in inflammatory autoimmune diseases. KLRG1 may also have an important role in monitoring and removing cancer cells that lose E-cadherin expression. A recent report demonstrated that N-terminal domains 1 and 2 of E-cadherin are critical for KLRG1 recognition (18Rosshart S. Hofmann M. Schweier O. Pfaff A.K. Yoshimoto K. Takeuchi T. Molnar E. Schamel W.W. Pircher H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, despite accumulating evidence supporting the functional importance of the E-cadherin-KLRG1 interaction, the molecular basis of this interaction is poorly understood. Here, we report that the N-terminal region of E-cadherin, comprising the dimer interface, is the binding site for KLRG1. This suggests that KLRG1 does not recognize the dimeric form of E-cadherin but rather recognizes the monomeric form, which is exposed on the cell surfaces of disrupted or infected cells. This may suppress excess immune responses. The plasmid pET15bEC-D1D2(His10Xa), encoding domains 1 and 2 of E-cadherin, with a His10 tag, a spacer sequence, and a Factor Xa recognition site at the N terminus (EC-D1D2(His10Xa)), and pET15bEC-D2D3(His10) encoding domains 2 and 3 (residues 109–332) with an additional His10 tag (EC-D2D3(His10)) were used to express recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. Soluble EC-D1D2(His10Xa) was subjected to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (HisTrapFF, 5 ml; GE Healthcare), or the inclusion bodies of EC-D1D2(His10Xa) were dissolved in guanidine buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA). To refold the recombinant protein, 10–20 mg of solubilized inclusion bodies were gradually diluted by the addition of refolding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C, into a final volume of 1 liter. The resulting solution was stirred for 2 days and was concentrated to 5–10 ml by a VIVA FLOW system and an Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore). The protein was purified by gel filtration chromatography (HiLoad26/60 Superdex 75 pg; GE Healthcare). After purification, EC-D1D2(His10Xa) was treated with Factor Xa to cleave the extra amino acids. The resulting EC-D1D2 protein was designated as EC-D1D2. EC-D2D3(His10) was prepared by the method of the refolded EC-D1D2. The DNA encoding the extracellular region (residues 73–188) of Mus musculus KLRG1 was ligated into pET3c, to create the plasmid pET3cKLRG1. The recombinant protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and was refolded, in a similar manner as EC-D1D2 and EC-D2D3. The refolded protein was purified by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). For surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, a biotinylated version of KLRG1 was prepared, as described previously (5Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recombinant cadherins, including the Ala-scanning mutants, were dissolved in HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P20) (BIAcore AB). SPR experiments were performed with a BIAcore2000 (Biacore AB). Biotinylated KLRG1 was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB), onto which streptavidin had been covalently coupled. Biotinylated bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control protein. All cadherin samples were injected over the immobilized KLRG1 protein, at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, in HBS-P buffer with 10 mm CaCl2 or 3 mm EDTA (for the Ca2+-free conditions). The binding response at each concentration was calculated by subtracting the equilibrium response measured in the control flow cell from the response in each sample flow cell. The data were analyzed using the BIA evaluation version 4.1 (Biacore AB) and ORIGIN version 7 software (Microcal Inc.). Affinity constants (Kd) were derived by nonlinear curve fitting of the standard Langmuir binding isotherm. AUC was carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with absorption optics, an An-50 Ti rotor, and standard double-sector centerpiece cells. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed at 4 °C, and concentration profiles were recorded at 0, 20, 23, 26, and 29 h after the velocity of the rotor reached 9,000, 14,000, and 20,000 rpm. At each time and velocity, one scan was collected. Data were analyzed using the standard Optima XL-I data analysis software. All of the protein samples were in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, with 100 mm NaCl. Monomeric EC-D1D2 and monomeric KLRG1 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 without calcium. Uniformly 15N-labeled EC-D1D2 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS bearing the plasmid pET15bEC-D1D2(His10Xa), grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, and was prepared by the same method used for the unlabeled EC-D1D2. KLRG1 was prepared as described previously. The KLRG1 and EC-D1D2 proteins were both dissolved in the HBS-E buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA). For the direct observation of KLRG1 binding to 15N-labeled EC-D1D2, a series of 1H-15N heteronuclear sequential quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra at 1:0 (EC-D1D2/KLRG1, 70 μm:0 μm), 1:0.5 (70 μm:35 μm), 1:1 (70 μm:70 μm), and 1:2 (70 μm:140 μm) ratios were measured at 25 °C. All HSQC spectra were measured at 25 °C and collected on 600-MHz spectrometers (Bruker) equipped with cryoprobes. The collected data were analyzed by NMRView. Chemical shift changes were defined by the formula, ((δ1H2 + (δ15N/5)2)/2)½ (19Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6653-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning and D90K mutagenesis of EC-D1D2 were performed using a QuikChange (Stratagene) kit with pET15bEC-D1D2(His10Xa) as the template. All of the EC-D1D2 mutants accumulated as soluble protein and purified in the manner of EC-D1D2(His10Xa). SPR experiments for all mutants were performed in HBS-P buffer with 3 mm EDTA. Mouse thymoma cell line BW5147 and mouse NK cell line NK 03 expressing KLRG1, KLRG1-NK03, were prepared as described previously (5Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The retrovirus vector, pMXs-IRES-GFP, and retrovirus packaging cell line, Plat-E, were kindly provided by T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo). Culture supernatant from anti-mouse E-cadherin monoclonal antibody ECCD-2 hybridoma cells was kindly provided by M. Takeichi (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research CDB, Hyogo, Japan) and was used to assess E-cadherin expression. Goat F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-mouse IgG(H+L)-phycoerythrin (PE) was purchased from Beckman Coulter. DNA encoding the entire extracellular region of wild-type and mutant M. musculus E-cadherin was ligated into the pMXs-IRES-GFP vector using XhoI and NotI restriction enzyme sites to produce pMXs-WT mEC-IRES-GFP. These vectors were transfected into retrovirus packaging Plat-E cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants containing retrovirus were used to transduce BW5147 cells. BW5147 cells were stained with anti-mouse E-cadherin antibody (ECCD-2) and goat F(ab′)2 fragment anti-mouse IgG(H+L)-PE to confirm the expression of E-cadherin. Data were acquired with a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Inc.). KLRG1 tetramer was formed by incubating soluble biotinylated KLRG1 with PE-coupled streptavidin, as previously reported (20Matsumoto N. Mitsuki M. Tajima K. Yokoyama W.M. Yamamoto K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The concentration of KLRG1 tetramer used in the binding studies was 20 μg/ml. BW5147 cells expressing E-cadherin were incubated with KLRG1 tetramer or PE-coupled streptavidin in Hanks' solution 2 (Nissui Pharmaceuticals) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3 (fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer) and were then analyzed by FACSCalibur. The KLRG1 reporter cell line was established as described previously (5Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The reporter cells were stimulated by target cells expressing E-cadherin for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and then accumulated β-galactosidase activity was determined by a colorimetric assay using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemicals) as substrate. The cytotoxicity of KLRG1-expressing NK03 cells against target cells expressing E-cadherin was examined using 5,6-carboxyl-succinimidyl-fluorescein ester (Dojindo) and 7-amino-actinomycin (Sigma). First, BW5147 cells expressing E-cadherin were incubated with 6 μm 6-carboxyl-succinimidyl-fluorescein ester at room temperature for 5 min in the dark. Afterward, 6-carboxyl-succinimidyl-fluorescein ester-labeled target cells were incubated with effector KLRG1-expressing NK03 cells in the presence or absence of anti-KLRG1 3D4 F(ab′)2 in a CO2 incubator for 6 h in the dark. The expression of E-cadherin protected the target cells from killing by KLRG1-expressing NK03 cells, and the protection was reversed by inhibiting the KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction with anti-KLRG1 3D4 F(ab′)2. Then 1 μg/ml 7-amino-actinomycin was added to the reaction solution, and cells were incubated on ice for 15 min. Data were collected using the FACSCalibur system and analyzed on FlowJo. N-terminal domains 1 and 2 of M. musculus E-cadherin (residues 1–221) with a His10 tag, a spacer sequence, and a Factor Xa recognition site at the N terminus were expressed in E. coli either as a soluble protein or inclusion bodies. The soluble protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, and the inclusion bodies were refolded by the standard dilution method. For both proteins, the extra N-terminal amino acids were removed with Factor Xa, resulting in the authentic N-terminal sequence (Asp1-Trp2-Val3-) (designated as EC-D1D2). EC-D1D2 was further purified by ion exchange chromatography. A final yield of 2–4 mg of purified EC-D1D2 was obtained from 1 liter of culture. N-terminal domains 2 and 3 of M. musculus E-cadherin (designated as EC-D2D3; residues 109–332) was also produced as inclusion bodies in E. coli and refolded by the standard dilution method. The refolded protein was purified by gel filtration chromatography. Next, the extracellular region of M. musculus KLRG1 (residues 73–188) was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. KLRG1 was refolded by the dilution method, in a similar manner as E-cadherin. The refolded protein was purified by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1, A and B), and the final yield was 1 mg of KLRG1 from 1 liter of culture. To clarify the molecular interaction between KLRG1 and E-cadherin, we performed SPR analysis, using recombinant E-cadherins EC-D1D2 and EC-D2D3. Recombinant E-cadherin variants EC-D1D2 and EC-D2D3 were injected over the flow cells, in which biotinylated KLRG1 had been immobilized at a level of 1,000 response units. As a negative control, biotinylated bovine serum albumin was immobilized on one of the flow cells, at a level similar to that of KLRG1. The response derived from the negative control was subtracted from each response derived from the recombinant E-cadherins. Fig. 1, C and D, shows the conventional plots of these binding data. In accordance with recent results showing that the deletion of either domain 1 or 2 abolished reactivity in KLRG1 reporter cell assays (18Rosshart S. Hofmann M. Schweier O. Pfaff A.K. Yoshimoto K. Takeuchi T. Molnar E. Schamel W.W. Pircher H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Fig. 1C indicates that KLRG1 can bind to domains 1 and 2 of E-cadherin (EC-D1D2) but not to domains 2 and 3 (EC-D2D3). The KLRG1-EC-D1D2 interaction conforms to a simple 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model, and its dissociation constant (Kd) was 7 μm at 25 °C in the presence of Ca2+. This affinity is within the range of Kd values measured for other cell-cell recognition molecules (supplemental Table S1). Furthermore, the KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction in the absence of Ca2+ exhibited a Kd of 12 μm, indicating that binding was independent of Ca2. Thus, Ca2+-induced reduction of interdomain flexibility does not have a significant effect on KLRG1 binding (Fig. 1, C and D; summarized in supplemental Table S1). These results imply that KLRG1 binding is dependent on the N-terminal domain of E-cadherin. The SPR data indicated that the EC-D1D2-KLRG1 interaction occurs at 1:1 stoichiometry. To confirm this, we performed AUC. Solutions of EC-D1D2 and KLRG1 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1. The experimental data fit well to the monomer-monomer association model (Fig. 1E). The estimated molecular mass of the EC-D1D2-KLRG1 complex was 36 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass of a complex between monomeric KLRG1 (13 kDa) and monomeric EC-D1D2 (24 kDa) (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, gel filtration analysis demonstrated that, when EC-D1D2 and KLRG1 were mixed under the same conditions as for AUC, the complex eluted at the position of the 1:1 complex (data not shown). These results provide clear evidence for the 1:1 binding stoichiometry of the KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction. Next, to identify the binding site of KLRG1 on EC-D1D2, we performed an NMR chemical shift perturbation study. 70 μm 15N-labeled EC-D1D2 was mixed with nonlabeled KLRG1 at concentrations of 0, 35, 70, and 140 μm. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the mixed samples were measured (supplemental Fig. S1). Chemical shift changes were observed in the HSQC spectrum when unlabeled KLRG1 bound to 15N-labeled EC-D1D2, as compared with the HSQC spectrum of free 15N-labeled EC-D1D2. These chemical shift changes were saturated at 70 μm KLRG1, corresponding to a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. The amino acid residues whose HSQC peaks were largely shifted or disappeared upon the complex formation are localized to the N-terminal region of EC-D1D2, as depicted in Fig. 2, A and B. This result indicates that KLRG1 can recognize the N-terminal region of EC-D1D2. The opposite face of the N-terminal region did not have any residues that showed large chemical shift changes (Fig. 2A). To confirm the results of the NMR binding study, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed. The mutants of EC-D1D2, shown in Table 1, were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SPR analysis using these mutants showed that the W2A mutant cannot bind to KLRG1. In addition, both the V3A and P6A mutants showed significantly reduced KLRG1 binding. All of these amino acids are in the N-terminal region of E-cadherin (Fig. 2, C and D), consistent with the results of the NMR analysis. The other mutants, including the D90K mutant, bound to KLRG1 at levels comparable that of the wild-type protein. The mutagenesis data are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1SPR study of KLRG1 binding to wild-type and mutant E-cadherinAnalytesKd (25 °C)μmWild type12 ± 3.0D1A19 ± 0.0W2ANBV3A66 ± 2.1P6A86 ± 9.2N20A14 ± 0.7F35A7.8 ± 0.1S37A6.2 ± 0.3T39A8.8 ± 0.3Q64A13 ± 0.7K73A5.5 ± 0.7I75A8.0 ± 0.0Y77A22 ± 0.0E89A30 ± 0.7D90K20 ± 2.1P91A8.6 ± 0.2E93A24 ± 2.8V95A22 ± 0.0T97A19 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab To further examine the KLRG1 binding site on the N-terminal region of E-cadherin, KLRG1 tetramer binding to wild type or a series of mutant E-cadherins (D1A, W2A, V3A, I4A, and P5A) expressed on the cell surface was examined by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). BW5147 cells expressing wild-type or mutant E-cadherin were generated by retroviral transduction, and E-cadherin expression was confirmed by anti-E-cadherin staining with monoclonal antibody, ECCD2, as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. PE-conjugated KLRG1 tetramer was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The W2A, V3A, I4A, and P5A mutants failed to bind the KLRG1 tetramer. These data indicate that KLRG1 recognizes a relatively large area of the N-terminal region of E-cadherin that is responsible for homophilic association, supporting the idea that KLRG1 can only bind to monomeric E-cadherin. Interestingly, the D1A mutant E-cadherin bound to the KLRG1 tetramer at levels comparable with that of wild type (Fig. 3A). We next performed KLRG1 reporter cell assays using the KLRG1-expressing cell line BWZ.muKLRG1 and BW5147 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant E-cadherins. The BWZ.muKLRG1 cells express a chimeric receptor that has the extracellular and transmembrane regions of KLRG1 and the cytoplasmic region of mouse T cell receptor ζ chain, which can mediate the activating signal to induce interleukin-2 gene expression. This cell line also harbors a β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the interleukin-2 promoter. Thus, the E-cadherin binding to the chimera KLRG1 can stimulate the β-galactosidase expression. The W2A, V3A, I4A, and P5A E-cadherin mutants failed to induce β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the wild-type and D1A E-cadherins induced the expression of β-galactosidase (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the SPR and tetramer binding experiments and indicate that the N-terminal region of E-cadherin plays an essential role in KLRG1-mediated cellular signaling. To investigate how much the N-terminal mutations of E-cadherin affect NK cell function, we performed NK cell cytotoxicity assays using the KLRG1-expressing mouse NK cell line, NK03. BW5147 cells expressing wild-type or mutant E-cadherin were used as target cells in the killing assays, which were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of wild-type E-cadherin protected target cells from killing by KLRG1-expressing NK03 cells. This protection was reversed in the presence of the F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-KLRG1 antibody 3D4, which inhibits the KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction (Fig. 3, C and D). Target cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin did not show any difference of killing by KLRG1-deficient NK03 cells in the presence or absence of the anti-KLRG1 3D4 F(ab′)2 (data not shown). Similar data were obtained using cells expressing the D1A mutant E-cadherin, consistent with the KLRG1-E-cadherin binding and reporter cell assays. On the other hand, target cells expressing the W2A, V3A, and I4A mutant E-cadherins were killed by KLRG1-expressing NK03 cells at similar levels both in the presence and absence of the anti-KLRG1 3D4 F(ab′)2. These results show that E-cadherin mutants that abrogate binding also abolish KLRG1-mediated inhibition of killing by KLRG1-expressing NK03 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that the N-terminal amino acids of E-cadherin are critical for the KLRG1-mediated inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity. E-cadherin is expressed mainly by epithelial cells and mediates Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The N-terminal regions of cadherins are known to play an important role in homotypic adhesion (14Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of E-cadherin can adopt two conformations. In the intramolecular conformation, Trp2 interacts with Glu89 and Met92. In the intermolecular conformation, the N-terminal region can dock with domain 1 of another cadherin to form an adhesive dimer, in which strand exchange occurs (Fig. 4, left) (21Parisini E. Higgins J.M. Liu J.H. Brenner M.B. Wang J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This study shows that KLRG1 recognizes a relatively broad area of the N-terminal region of E-cadherin (Trp2–Pro6), which largely overlaps with the strand-exchanged homodimer interface. In addition, cells expressing E-cadherin mutants (W2A, V3A, I4A, and P5A) could not interact with KLRG1 tetramer or induce intracellular signaling of KLRG1 reporter cell lines. Further, the expression of the N-terminal mutant E-cadherins (W2A, V3A, I4A) on target cells did not inhibit the cytotoxic activity of KLRG1-expressing NK cells. These results demonstrate that KLRG1 specifically recognizes the strand-exchanged homodimeric interface of E-cadherin, indicating that KLRG1 only binds to the monomeric form of E-cadherin, with an exposed N-terminal region, to regulate immune function, such as NK cell cytotoxicity. In normal epithelial tissues, two E-cadherin molecules interact with each other to form strand-exchanged homodimeric complexes constituting adherent junctions, as described above, and thus they are not easily accessible to NK cells or T cells (Fig. 4, left). However, E-cadherin may be exposed on the surfaces of disrupted or infected epithelial cells. In turn, NK cells and T cells can directly detect E-cadherin by utilizing KLRG1, but this recognition occurs in a more sophisticated manner. Here, we show that KLRG1 recognizes the N-terminal strand-exchanged homodimer interface of E-cadherin and thus can only bind to the monomeric form to inhibit KLRG1-mediated cytotoxicity. This monomeric form is thought to be expressed on abnormal epithelial tissues. Therefore, NK cells and T cells can mediate suitable inhibitory responses via KLRG1 binding to only monomeric E-cadherin. The KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction is presumably safe and efficient for inhibiting the excess functional responses of NK cells as well as those of the SLECs (Fig. 4, right). This function is similar to that of inhibitory costimulatory molecules, such as CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4). The αEβ7 integrin (CD103) receptor also recognizes E-cadherin (22Cepek K.L. Shaw S.K. Parker C.M. Russell G.J. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Brenner M.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The αEβ7 integrin is found on intraepithelial lymphocytes, where it mediates their adhesion to epithelial cells and enhances their function (23Agace W.W. Higgins J.M. Sadasivan B. Brenner M.B. Parker C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The αEβ7 integrin recognizes the conserved residue Glu31 and its surrounding area at the top of E-cadherin domain 1 (supplemental Fig. S3) (23Agace W.W. Higgins J.M. Sadasivan B. Brenner M.B. Parker C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), adjacent to the KLRG1 binding site. Thus, KLRG1 may physically interfere with αEβ7 integrin binding. Although the expression of KLRG1 in activated intraepithelial lymphocytes has not been determined, if KLRG1 is expressed simultaneously with αEβ7 integrin, it may inhibit excess immune responses both by transducing E-cadherin-mediated inhibitory signals and by competing for αEβ7 integrin binding. Interestingly, αEβ7 integrin can bind to both monomeric and homodimeric E-cadherin, whereas KLRG1 binds only monomeric E-cadherin. This functional difference may have a sophisticated potential to finely modulate mucosal immunity (24Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as well as NK and T cell development/differentiation. Several types of cancer cells express mutant E-cadherin. One alteration of the E-cadherin gene is induced by the in-frame skipping of either exon 8 or exon 9. Interestingly, these alterations result in the deletion of either domain 2 or domain 3 of E-cadherin and are reported to abolish KLRG1 binding (25Schwartzkopff S. Gründemann C. Schweier O. Rosshart S. Karjalainen K.E. Becker K.F. Pircher H. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that the KLRG1 binding site is located in the N-terminal region, far from domains 2 and 3. Thus, these mutations may indirectly disrupt the conformation of the N-terminal region that is required for KLRG1 recognition. A definitive conclusion will require future investigations of the structural characteristics of the E-cadherin mutants and KLRG1 binding interaction. The mutation or lack of E-cadherin in some cancer cells causes the loss of cell adhesion and the subsequent acquisition of cellular motility, facilitating tumor metastasis. Such abnormal cells may be susceptible to NK cells and T cells, because of the lack of KLRG1-mediated inhibitory signals. On the other hand, some tumors may exploit the KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction to their advantage. Such tumor cells might initially down-regulate E-cadherin to acquire motility and metastatic potential but then re-express E-cadherin to establish adherent metastatic foci and avoid immune attack by NK cells and T cells (24Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Schwartzkopff S. Gründemann C. Schweier O. Rosshart S. Karjalainen K.E. Becker K.F. Pircher H. J.

Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of inhibitors of KLRG1-E-cadherin recognition is important for eliminating these cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that KLRG1 recognizes the N-terminal amino acids of monomeric E-cadherin domain 1, which are well conserved in the type I classical cadherins (Fig. 2D). In fact, KLRG1 can also bind to the other type I classical cadherins, neuronal and retinal (N- and R-cadherins) (5Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the N-terminal amino acids are a major determinant for the KLRG1 binding. Therefore, the N-terminal region may be a useful template for designing inhibitors of the KLRG1-E-cadherin interaction. This study demonstrates that KLRG1 recognizes the N-terminal region of E-cadherin, known to be critical for homophilic adhesion. Therefore, we propose that KLRG1 cannot bind to the homodimeric form of E-cadherin but rather binds to the monomeric form. The monomeric form of E-cadherin is exposed on the adherens junction in special conditions, such as damaged epithelial tissues. Under these circumstances, it may serve as a target for KLRG1 recognition to mediate inhibitory signals, raising the activation threshold of NK cells and T cells and preventing excessive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1998703940,"The anaerobic bacterium Aeromonas sobria is known to cause potentially lethal septic shock. We recently proposed that A. sobria serine protease (ASP) is a sepsis-related factor that induces vascular leakage, reductions in blood pressure via kinin release, and clotting via activation of prothrombin. ASP preferentially cleaves peptide bonds that follow dibasic amino acid residues, as do Kex2 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae serine protease) and furin, which are representative kexin family proteases. Here, we revealed the crystal structure of ASP at 1.65 A resolution using the multiple isomorphous replacement method with anomalous scattering. Although the overall structure of ASP resembles that of Kex2, it has a unique extra occluding region close to its active site. Moreover, we found that a nicked ASP variant is cleaved within the occluding region. Nicked ASP shows a greater ability to cleave small peptide substrates than the native enzyme. On the other hand, the cleavage pattern for prekallikrein differs from that of ASP, suggesting the occluding region is important for substrate recognition. The extra occluding region of ASP is unique and could serve as a useful target to facilitate development of novel antisepsis drugs."

Friend of GATA1 (FOG1), a protein interaction partner of GATA1, is critical for GATA1 function in multiple contexts. Previous work has shown that FOG1 recruits two multi-protein complexes, the nucleosome remodeling domain (NuRD) complex and a C-terminal binding protein (CTBP)-containing complex, into association with GATA1 to mediate activation and repression of target genes. To elucidate mechanisms that might differentially regulate the association of FOG1, as well as GATA1, with these two complexes, we characterized a previously unrecognized translational isoform of FOG1. We found that an N-terminally truncated version of FOG1 is produced from an internal ATG and that this isoform, designated FOG1S, lacks the nucleosome remodeling domain-binding domain, altering the complexes with which it interacts. Both isoforms interact with the C-terminal binding protein complex, which we show also contains lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). FOG1S is preferentially excluded from the nucleus by unknown mechanisms.

Consequently, complexes containing activators would prevail at target genes.Here we characterize an alternate, translational isoform of FOG1, designated FOG1S, which is truncated at its N terminus.

Although the interaction of FOG1 with repression complexes may account for repression of genes by GATA1, how FOG1 might contribute to GATA1-dependent gene activation has yet to be elucidated.We demonstrate here the existence of a novel isoform of FOG1, FOG1S, in both erythroleukemia cells and primary fetal liver erythroblasts. Using antibody based mapping, we determined that FOG1S lacks the extreme N terminus. FOG1S can be generated along with FOG1L upon expression of full-length cDNA (10Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E.

These data imply that formation of FOG1S is not due to alternative RNA processing, a conclusion consistent with 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments. Furthermore, cycloheximide experiments in MEL cells provide evidence that FOG1S is not a cleavage product of FOG1L, because the ratio of the isoforms does not change after translation is blocked. Together, these data indicate that FOG1S is created by alternate translation of the canonical transcript from a downstream, internal initiator codon, most likely through use of the next downstream ATG.Translationally mediated generation of FOG1S appears to differ from the manner in which a similar variant of full-length FOG2 is produced (22Dale R.M. Remo B.F. Svensson E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Production of FOG1S is regulated by the 5′-UTR and the Kozak sequence, probably through modulation of ribosome scanning (27Kozak M. Gene. 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear what cellular cues, if any, may be involved in generating different ratios of the two translation products or whether maintaining a consistent ratio is biologically important.As anticipated, FOG1S is unable to bind components of the NuRD complex. The N-terminal domain of FOG proteins bears a highly conserved NuRD-binding motif (36Lin A.C. Roche A.E. Wilk J. Svensson E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55017-55023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The NuRD complex is most often associated with repression, although instances in which it potentiates activation have been described (37Denslow S.A. Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5433-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 38Koipally J. Heller E.J. Seavitt J.R. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, FOG1 (16Hong W. Nakazawa M. Chen Y.Y. Kori R. Vakoc C.R. Rakowski C. Blobel G.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and FOG2 (22Dale R.M. Remo B.F. Svensson E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), mutated to abrogate NuRD binding, show decreased GATA-mediated repression in transient reporter assays. Additionally NuRD is present, along with FOG1 and GATA1, at repressed genes in erythroid cells (16Hong W. Nakazawa M. Chen Y.Y. Kori R. Vakoc C.R. Rakowski C. Blobel G.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), indicating that NuRD functions largely in repression of GATA1-dependent genes. Recent data indicate that mice expressing only an N-terminally truncated form of FOG1 display perturbed erythroid development, specifically demonstrating defects in repression of select GATA1-target genes (39Gregory G.D. Wang Y. Hong. W. Miccio A. Bersenev A. Yu X. Wang H. Choi J. Shelat S. Tong W. Poncz M. Blobel G. Blood (ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts). 2008; (Blood (ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts))Google Scholar). These data show that the ability of FOG to repress genes is not wholly explained by NuRD binding and that the FOG1-NuRD interaction is dispensable for FOG1-dependent activation of erythroid target genes. These, and our own, data lead to speculation that FOG1L may be required for regulation of specific genes in a NuRD-dependent fashion, whereas FOG1S may be involved in the regulation of a subset of genes through a NuRD-independent mechanism. This model would suggest that other FOG1 interaction partners play a role in this regulation or that FOG1 is able to mediate regulation itself in the absence of NuRD recruitment.Previously, our lab demonstrated that mice in which the canonical CTBP-binding motif of FOG1 was mutated exhibited normal erythroid development (14Katz S.G. Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This result was unanticipated. Our recent data, however, indicate that this mutant version of FOG1 possesses residual CTBP binding activity, most likely through a noncanonical CTBP-binding motif. 5J. W. Snow and S. J. Orkin, manuscript in preparation. Thus, reassessment of the involvement of CTBP in FOG1-dependent activities is warranted. Here, we have shown that, although FOG1L is able to interact with CTBP, it may bind the CTBP and NuRD complexes in a mutually exclusive fashion. Furthermore, utilizing a tagged N-terminal truncation of FOG1, we found that only in the absence of NuRD binding were peptides of the CTBP complex recovered, an observation that provides preliminary evidence of exclusive binding to these distinct repressive complexes. Additionally, LSD1 peptides are recovered with CTBP proteins by purification of an N-terminally truncated FOG1 (N67). We confirmed this interaction by immunoprecipitation with FOG1L, which elucidates the molecular identity of the CTBP complex that associates with FOG1 in erythroid cells. CTBP family members have been shown to interact with a number of molecules (30Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Shi Y.

Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that may comprise distinct functional complexes. LSD1 is already known to play an important role in the biology of erythroid development as an interaction partner of Gf11b (40Saleque S. Kim J. Rooke H.M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 562-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). LSD1 can act as a repressor or an activator of transcription in a context-dependent manner (41Garcia-Bassets I. Kwon Y.S. Telese F. Prefontaine G.G. Hutt K.R. Cheng C.S. Ju B.G. Ohgi K.A. Wang J.

To understand what functional consequences the interaction between FOG1 and LSD1 may have on erythroid gene expression, it will be important to characterize the molecular components that are brought into association with GATA1 through the interaction of FOG1 and CTBP at specific gene loci.Translational regulation of protein expression affects other hematopoietic transcription factors, including T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (SCL/TAL) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), α (44Calkhoven C.F.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these cases, translationally generated isoforms exhibit biochemical and functional properties distinct from those of the canonical protein. Such appears to the case for FOG1 also, because FOG1L and FOG1S display different capacities to bind the NuRD complex and are regulated differentially with respect to their cellular localization. Translational regulation also allows for an additional level of control that is sensitive to the translational status of the cell. This status can serve as a finely tuned sensor for multiple cellular cues, such as cell cycle stage, nutrient deprivation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress (44Calkhoven C.F. Müller C. Leutz A. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 47Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc.

Erythroid differentiation is characterized by a number of cellular changes that impact stress pathways that alter translation, including oxidative stress associated with hemoglobin synthesis (49Weiss M.J. Zhou S. Feng L. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Shi Y. Gow A.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1054: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cell cycle exit (50Sankaran V.G. Orkin S.H. Walkley C.R. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and energetic stresses as mitochondria are removed through autophagy (51Sandoval H. Thiagarajan P. Dasgupta S.K. Schumacher A. Prchal J.T. Chen M. Wang J. Nature. 2008; 454: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) during terminal differentiation. These extrinsic and intrinsic cues may result in differential production of the two isoforms. These data lead to conjecture that favoring translation of FOG1L or FOG1S might allow for regulation of erythroid gene expression that is carefully linked to the cell state.The cellular localization of FOG1L and FOG1S also appears to be regulated, such that, in erythroid cells, FOG1L predominates in the nucleus, whereas the FOG1L and FOG1S are present equally in the cytoplasm. We show that TACC3, previously shown to be able to sequester FOG1 in the cytoplasm, is not responsible for this differential localization. We hypothesize that other molecules are involved in retaining FOG1S preferentially in the cytoplasm in erythroid cells. Further work is needed to test this speculation. Utilization of nuclear import and export pathways to regulate transcriptional regulators is common (52Ziegler E.C. Ghosh S. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re6PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown for at least one erythroid-specific factor, Kruppel-like factor 1 (erythroid) (KLF1) (53Quadrini K.J. Gruzglin E. Bieker J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although we have been unable to determine the mechanism through which FOG1S is selectively retained in the cytoplasm, it may be that cellular stimuli are also involved in regulation of this process. In addition, it is also possible that maintaining equivalent amounts of FOG1L and FOG1S in the cytoplasm is biologically important, although no cytoplasmic role for either FOG1 isoform has been demonstrated.Hence, we propose a model in which FOG1 isoforms are produced in a specific ratio, regulated by cues acting upon cellular translation machinery. Further control of the nuclear ratio of FOG1L and FOG1S may allow for adaptive adjustment of the relative amounts of biologically distinct GATA1-interacting proteins and hence the fine-tuning of gene expression during erythroid differentiation (Fig. 7C). Erythropoietic and megakaryocytic programs are specified from multipotential progenitors by the transcription factor GATA1, a zinc finger transcription factor first identified by its ability to bind globin gene regulatory regions (1Tsai S.F.

Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The importance of this factor in the development of these lineages is underscored by the presence of functionally relevant GATA sites in promoters and enhancers of virtually all erythropoietic and megakaryocytic specifically expressed genes (3Weiss M.J.

Beyond its essential role in normal development, inherited mutations in GATA1 in rare individuals cause hematological disorders, including anemia and thrombocytopenia. Among those with trisomy 21/Down syndrome, somatic mutation of GATA1 leads to expression of a truncated form of GATA1 that is associated with acute megakaroblastic leukemia (9Vyas P. Crispino J.D.

https://openalex.org/W2131330547,"A large body of evidence suggests impaired context processing in schizophrenia. Here we propose that this impairment arises from defective integration of mediotemporal 'what' and 'where' routes, carrying object and spatial information to the hippocampus.We have previously shown, in a mediotemporal lobe (MTL) model, that the abnormal connectivity between MTL regions observed in schizophrenia can explain the episodic memory deficits associated with the disorder. Here we show that the same neuropathology leads to several context processing deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia: 1) failure to choose subordinate stimuli over dominant ones when the former fit the context, 2) decreased contextual constraints in memory retrieval, as reflected in increased false alarm rates and 3) impaired retrieval of contextual information in source monitoring. Model analyses show that these deficits occur because the 'schizophrenic MTL' forms fragmented episodic representations, in which objects are overrepresented at the expense of spatial contextual information.These findings highlight the importance of MTL neuropathology in schizophrenia, demonstrating that it may underlie a broad spectrum of deficits, including context processing and memory impairments. It is argued that these processing deficits may contribute to central schizophrenia symptoms such as contextually inappropriate behavior, associative abnormalities, conversational drift, concreteness and delusions."

Here we describe the mapping of a novel N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced point mutation in the Scarb1 gene identified in a C57BL/6J background. The mutation is located in a highly conserved amino acid in the extracellular loop and leads to the conversion of an isoleucine to an asparagine (I179N). Homozygous mutant mice express normal Scarb1 mRNA levels and are fertile. SCARB1 protein levels are markedly reduced in liver (approximately 90%), but not in steroidogenic tissues. This leads to approximately 70% increased plasma HDL levels due to reduced HDL cholesteryl ester selective uptake. Pdzk1 knockout mice have liver-specific reduction of SCARB1 protein as does this mutant; however, in vitro analysis of the mutation indicates that the regulation of SCARB1 protein in this mutant is independent of PDZK1. This new Scarb1 model may help further our understanding of post-translational and tissue-specific regulation of SCARB1 that may aid the important clinical goal of raising functional HDL."
https://openalex.org/W2059613606,"Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alphaCaMKII) is thought to exert its role in memory formation by autonomous Ca(2+)-independent persistent activity conferred by Thr(286) autophosphorylation, allowing the enzyme to remain active even when intracellular [Ca(2+)] has returned to resting levels. Ca(2+) sequestration-induced inhibition, caused by a burst of Thr(305/306) autophosphorylation via calmodulin (CaM) dissociation from the Thr(305/306) sites, is in conflict with this view. The processes of CaM binding, autophosphorylation, and inactivation are dissected to resolve this conflict. Upon Ca(2+) withdrawal, CaM sequential domain dissociation is observed, starting with the rapid release of the first (presumed N-terminal) CaM lobe, thought to be bound at the Thr(305/306) sites. The time courses of Thr(305/306) autophosphorylation and inactivation, however, correlate with the slow dissociation of the second (presumed C-terminal) CaM lobe. Exposure of the Thr(305/306) sites is thus not sufficient for their autophosphorylation. Moreover, Thr(305/306) autophosphorylation and autoinactivation are shown to occur in the continuous presence of Ca(2+) and bound Ca(2+)/CaM by time courses similar to those seen following Ca(2+) sequestration. Our investigation of the activity and mechanisms of phospho-Thr(286)-alphaCaMKII thus shows time-dependent autoinactivation, irrespective of the continued presence of Ca(2+) and CaM, allowing a very short, if any, time window for Ca(2+)/CaM-free phospho-Thr(286)-alphaCaMKII activity. Physiologically, the time-dependent autoinactivation mechanisms of phospho-Thr(286)-alphaCaMKII (t(1/2) of approximately 50 s at 37 degrees C) suggest a transient kinase activity of approximately 1 min duration in the induction of long term potentiation and thus memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2031532870,"Background The zinc metalloprotease ADAMTS13 is a multidomain protein that cleaves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and is implicated in Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanism of this protein is an important goal. Conformation sensitive antibodies have been used to monitor protein conformation and to decipher the molecular mechanism of proteins as well as to distinguish functional and non-functional mutants. Methodology/Principal Findings We have characterized several antibodies against ADAMTS13, both monoclonal and polyclonal. We have used flow cytometry to estimate the binding of these antibodies to ADAMTS13 and demonstrate that antibodies raised against the TSP and disintegrin domains detect conformation changes in the ADAMTS13. Thus for example, increased binding of these antibodies was detected in the presence of the substrate (VWF), mainly at 37°C and not at 4°C. These antibodies could also detect differences between wild-type ADAMTS13 and the catalytically deficient mutant (P475S). The flow cytometry approach also allows us to estimate the reactivity of the antibody as well as its apparent affinity. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that these antibodies may serve as useful reagents to distinguish functional and non-functional ADAMTS13 and analyze conformational transitions to understand the catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1998046958,"The glomerular podocyte is a highly specialized and polarized kidney cell type that contains major processes and foot processes that extend from the cell body. Foot processes from adjacent podocytes form interdigitations with those of adjacent cells, thereby creating an essential intercellular junctional domain of the renal filtration barrier known as the slit diaphragm. Interesting parallels have been drawn between the slit diaphragm and other sites of cell-cell contact by polarized cells. Notably mutations in several genes encoding proteins localized to the foot processes can lead to proteinuria and kidney failure. Mutations in the Wilm's tumor gene (WT1) can also lead to kidney disease and one isoform of WT1, WT1(+KTS), has been proposed to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. We originally sought to identify mRNAs associated with WT1(+KTS) through an RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray approach, hypothesizing that the proteins encoded by these mRNAs might be important for podocyte morphology and function. We identified a subset of mRNAs that were remarkably enriched for transcripts encoding actin-binding proteins and other cytoskeletal proteins including several that are localized at or near the slit diaphragm. Interestingly, these mRNAs included those of α-actinin-4 and non-muscle myosin IIA that are mutated in genetic forms of kidney disease. However, isolation of the mRNAs occurred independently of the expression of WT1, suggesting that the identified mRNAs were serendipitously co-purified on the basis of co-association in a common subcellular fraction. Mass spectroscopy revealed that other components of the actin cytoskeleton co-purified with these mRNAs, namely actin, tubulin, and elongation factor 1α. We propose that these mRNAs encode a number of proteins that comprise a highly specialized protein interactome underlying the slit diaphragm. Collectively, these gene products and their interactions may prove to be important for the structural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes as well as other polarized cell types."

Sequencing of the genes encoding all subunits of the Clostridium symbiosum decarboxylase membrane complex revealed that it comprises two distinct biotin carrier subunits, GcdC1 and GcdC2, which differ in the length of a central alanine- and proline-rich linker domain. Co-crystallization of the decarboxylase subunit GcdA with the substrate glutaconyl-CoA, the product crotonyl-CoA, and the substrate analogue glutaryl-CoA, respectively, resulted in a high resolution model for substrate binding and catalysis revealing remarkable structural changes upon substrate binding. Unlike the GcdA structure from Acidaminococcus fermentans, these data suggest that in intact Gcd complexes, GcdA is associated as a tetramer crisscrossed by a network of solvent-filled tunnels.

EC 4.1.1.70) catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA (Reaction 1 and Equation 1). ΔGo′=ca.-25kJ mol-1(Eq. 1) In aerobic organisms and respiring anaerobes this decarboxylation represents the irreversible second half-reaction of the FAD-containing homotetrameric enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (1Härtel U. Eckel E. Koch J. Fuchs G. Linder D. Buckel W. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fermentative bacteria, however, conserve the small amount of free energy of decarboxylation (Equation 1) as an electrochemical Na+ gradient (sodium-motive force: SMF) (2Buckel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Dimroth P. Schink B. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These energy-limited organisms contain glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases, which are Na+-dependent and biotin-containing integral membrane enzymes composed of 4–5 different subunits. Because of generation of SMF, the decarboxylation is reversible as observed in vitro for the related Na+-dependent oxaloacetate (EC 4.1.1.3) and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylases (EC 4.1.1.41) (4Hilpert W. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5360-5366Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In Synthrophus aciditrophicus, this probably happens in vivo, where the synthesis of benzoate from crotonate requires carboxylation of crotonyl-CoA to glutaconyl-CoA (5Mouttaki H.

The best-studied Na+-dependent glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase is involved in the fermentation of glutamate to ammonia, CO2, acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen by the strictly anaerobic gut bacterium Acidaminococcus fermentans (6Buckel W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 57: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The enzyme complex comprises a hydrophilic α-subunit (GcdA, 65 kDa) that catalyzes the Na+-independent transfer of the carboxylate of glutaconyl-CoA to biotin, the latter being covalently bound to the γ-subunit (GcdC, 14 kDa, Equation 2). The hydrophobic β-subunit (GcdB, 35 kDa, 10–12 transmembrane helices) mediates the subsequent decarboxylation of N1-carboxybiotin coupled to the transport of Na+ from the cytoplasm to the outside of the cell (Equation 3). Glutaconyl-Coa+Biotin-GcdC=Crotonyl-CoA+Carboxy-Biotin-Gcdc(Eq. 2) Carboxy-Biotin-GcdC+H+=Biotin-GcdC+CO2(Eq. 3) The function of the small δ-subunit (GcdD, 12 kDa, one transmembrane helix) remains to be established (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The gcdA gene coding for the carboxytransferase (GcdA) is part of the 2-hydroxyglutarate operon from A. fermentans (8Bendrat K. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Mack M. Bendrat K. Zelder O. Eckel E. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The three other genes, gcdDCB, form a separate transcription unit, preceded by mcdA, encoding the putative carboxyltransferase subunit of methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (Fig. 1) (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase is readily purified from the solubilized membrane fraction of A. fermentans by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin Sepharose. On SDS-PAGE, Gcd subunits A, B, and D separate according to their calculated molecular masses, whereas GcdC forms a ladder of Coomassie stainable bands between 120 and 140 kDa, probably due to a stretch of 50 amino acids comprising 34 alanines and 14 prolines (10Buckel W. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles and shown to pump Na+. In the same manner, the decarboxylase from the glutamate fermenting anaerobic gut bacterium Clostridium symbiosum was characterized as an electrogenic Na+ pump (10Buckel W. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, on SDS-PAGE gels of purified C. symbiosum Gcd the biotin carrier subunit GcdC migrated as two distinct bands with apparent molecular masses of 22 and 24 kDa. The carboxytransferase subunit GcdA from A. fermentans was obtained as a single protein by overproduction in Escherichia coli (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Bendrat K. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation of free biotin with glutaconyl-CoA, albeit with a very high Km of 40 mm for biotin and an about 100-times lower kcat than the native enzyme (11Buckel W. Liedtke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Berger S. Braune A. Buckel W. Härtel U. Lee M.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1996; 35: 2132-2133Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The recombinant GcdA has been crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure has been determined (13Wendt K.S. Schall I. Huber R. Buckel W. Jacob U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both active sites of the homodimeric enzyme lie along the two interfaces between the monomers, where the N-terminal domain provides the glutaconyl-CoA binding site and the C-terminal domain binds biotin attached to GcdC. Recently, the structure of the carboxytransferase domain of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Vibrio cholerae was reported, which is structurally distinct from that of GcdA (14Studer R. Dahinden P. Wang W.W. Auchli Y. Li X.D. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For crystallization of the whole glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase complex, we chose the enzyme from C. symbiosum because of its simple availability and the normal behavior of its GcdC subunits. Despite encouraging initial results, we again obtained crystals of GcdA alone, whose structure will be described in this work. The structure revealed a more precise view on substrate binding, catalysis, and the possible quaternary structure of the intact enzyme complex. The genes of all subunits of the C. symbiosum decarboxylase were found to be arranged like those in the genome of the glutamate fermenting Fusobacterium nucleatum (15Kapatral V. Anderson I.

However, it was shown that the former enzyme complex indeed contains two distinct GcdC subunits. HB25, kindly provided by Dr. G. C. Mead, Food Research Institute, Norwich, England (17Mead G.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1971; 67: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was grown under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C in the glutamate medium previously described (18Buckel W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 547-558Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For cloning, sequencing, and gene expression Escherichia coli strains DH5α (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) (19Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8189) Google Scholar) and RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) (20Novy R. Drott D. Yaeger K. Mierendorf R. Innovations. 2001; 12: 1-3Google Scholar) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or standard I nutrient broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with the required antibiotics at 37 °C. The purification of the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase complex was carried out as previously described (21Beatrix B. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 154: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The only exception was the replacement of the detergent Triton X-100 by dodecylmaltoside, to facilitate UV-spectroscopic tracking of purification and subsequent crystallization. After affinity chromatography on a column prepared with Avidin SoftLink® Resins (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), the purified enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at 4 °C. The purity of the eluted protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining (22Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). Frozen wet cells from C. symbiosum (1 g) were resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 25% sucrose (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and incubated while gently shaking with 50 mg of lysozyme for 60 min at 37 °C. Then 2 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0/25 mm EDTA were added and incubated for 15 min on ice. After addition of 5 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 1% SDS, 100 mg RNase, and 10 mg proteinase K the solution was shaken for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were removed by repeated (3 times) phenolization and extraction with chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1). The DNA solution was dialyzed against 5 liters of 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 at 4 °C overnight. Construction of recombinant plasmids for sequencing and expression were carried out using standard techniques (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). DNA was restricted and ligated according to the protocols of the enzyme suppliers. PCR fragments were cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Degenerated oligonucleotides for GcdA were used to amplify an internal DNA fragment of 600 bp from the chromosomal DNA of C. symbiosum. Based on this fragment a Southern blot probe (522 bp) was synthesized using a DIG-dNTP labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Mapping by digestion with different restriction enzymes, Southern blot hybridization, ligation with pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and sequencing increased the known sequence information. The remainders of the sequence of gcdA at the 5′- and 3′-ends were obtained by several direct genomic sequencing walks using the Topo® Walker kit (Invitrogen) (24Heiner C.R. Hunkapiller K.L. Chen S.M. Glass J.I. Chen E.Y. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the DNA Walking SpeedUp kit (SeeGene; Seoul, Korea) (25Hwang I.T. Kim Y.J. Kim S.H. Kwak C.I. Gu Y.Y. Chun J.Y. BioTechniques. 2003; 35: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Confirmation of these data was accomplished by sequencing of PCR products using the proofreading Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). In a similar way the sequences of gcdDC2C1B were obtained using the N termini of GcdC1 and C2. DNA sequence data were analyzed using the web-based tool Biology WorkBench 3.2. Data base searches were performed with the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59913) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the nonredundant protein library. The genes gcdA and gcdC1 were amplified by PCR, ligated into the cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and then subcloned into the expression vector pASK-IBA7plus (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). This vector provides an N-terminal Strep-tag II peptide fused protein to enable one-step purification. For the coexpression of gcdA with gcdC1 the vector pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. GcdA was produced including an N-terminal His6 tag peptide. For expression, the transformed E. coli RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 50 μm biotin, carbenicillin (50 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (34 μg ml−1), at 37 °C. Cells transformed with a pCDFDuet-1 construct additionally needed spectinomycin (150 μg ml−1). An overnight preculture was used to inoculate fresh medium. At A578 = 0.5, the cells were induced by adding 0.4 μm anhydrotetracylin for pASK-IBA7plus constructs, and 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for the co-expression construct derived from pCDFDuet-1, respectively. After 3 h, the cells were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Purification of recombinant GcdA was carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications using a 1-ml Strep-Tactin Sepharose gravity flow column (IBA). Subsequently, the purified enzyme was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and concentrated up to 7 mg ml−1 protein. GcdC1 was purified by avidin-biotin affinity chromatography analogous to the purification of the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase complex. Protein subcomplexes obtained by the co-expression of gcdA and gcdC1 were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography using HIS-Select® HF Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma) as matrix. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient up to 500 mm imidazole and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. For biotinylated proteins the blocking solution contained an avidin-peroxidase conjugate (0.5 mg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich). Signals were detected with luminol/p-hydroxycoumaric acid chemiluminescence on Fuji 100 NIF medical x-ray films. His-tagged proteins were visualized using the anti-Penta-His-HRP-conjugate (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Amersham Biosciences ECL PlusTM Western blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare). The carboxytransferase activity of glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase subunit A was determined using the assay for native glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Buckel W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 547-558Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in the presence of d-biotin. After adding recombinant GcdA, the increasing absorbance of NADH was measured at 340 nm, ϵ = 6.3 mm−1 cm−1 (27Ziegenhorn J. Senn M. Bücher T. Clin. Chem. 1976; 22: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Glutaconyl-CoA was enzymatically synthesized from acetyl-CoA and glutaconate as catalyzed by glutaconate CoA-transferase (28Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Crotonyl-CoA and glutaryl-CoA were chemically synthesized by acylation of CoASH with the corresponding anhydrides (29Simon E.J. Shemin D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2520Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The calculated amount of anhydride (20% excess) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile and added to 25 mg of CoASH in 4.5 ml of 0.2 m NaHCO3 at ambient temperature. 5T. Selmer, personal communication. Completion of the reaction was checked by the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) assay (30Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), the reaction mix was acidified to pH 2. The CoA-thioester was isolated by passing the mixture through a SepPak C18 column, which was conditioned with methanol and equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was washed with 5–10 column volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the CoA-thioester was eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile. After evaporation of the acetonitrile under vacuum, the concentration of the CoA-thioester was determined from its absorbance at 260 nm and by the enzymatic DTNB assay (28Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The samples were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. The molecular mass of the CoA-thioester was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. A drop of the CoA-ester solution was mixed on a gold-plated target with the matrix 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in equal amounts, dried under air and analyzed by using a Voyager-DE/RP-MALDI-TOF MS in positive and reflector mode (31Selmer T. Buckel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20772-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The subunits of the isolated glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase complex were separated by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (33Textor S.

Chromatogr. 1991; 587: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. Prior to crystallization the purified C. symbiosum GcdA was either dialyzed or subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) using a buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The protein was concentrated to 20–30 mg/ml on a 50-kDa Vivascience Centricon unit. All crystallization experiments were carried out applying the vapor diffusion method at room temperature. In the case of co-crystallization trials, 100–200 mm solutions of biocytin, crotonyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, and glutaconyl-CoA in 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl were prepared. These solutions were individually added to the protein samples prior to crystallization. For soaking experiments the substrate solutions were added directly to the respective crystallization condition. Co-crystallization and soaking experiments were carried out at final ligand concentrations of 5–10 mm (CoA-esters) and 5–50 mm (biocytin). Initial crystallization screening was performed in 500 + 500 nl sitting drops using a Microsys 4004 Cartesian crystallization robotics system and a set of commercial crystallization screens, followed by manual optimization in hanging drops. Crystals were flash-frozen in their respective crystallization buffers supplemented with 20–30% glycerol as cryoprotectant. X-Ray data were collected at 100 K to a maximum resolution of 2.70 to 1.75 Å using beamline X13, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, beamlines ID14-1 and ID23-2, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, and a MAR345dtb imaging plate coupled to a Bruker AXS FR591 x-ray generator with a copper rotating anode (wavelength, 1.5418 Å). The diffraction data were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (35Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The integrated data were scaled, merged, and truncated using the SCALA and TRUNCATE programs of the CCP4 suite (36CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19765) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (37Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) with the atomic coordinates of the previously determined structure of A. fermentans GcdA (Protein Data Bank code 1PIX) as a search model. Subsequent model building and refinement were completed using the programs COOT (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23370) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar). Progress in the structural refinement was evaluated at each stage by inspection of the free R factor and the stereochemical parameters calculated by the program PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics of refinement and structure validation are presented in supplemental Table S2. Secondary structure elements were assigned using the program STRIDE (41Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Protein interfaces and intermolecular interactions were calculated using the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces, and Assemblies Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute (42Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB), Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), with the accession codes 3GF7 for apo-GcdA, 3GF3, 3GLM, and 3GMA for GcdA co-crystallized with glutaconyl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA, and glutaryl-CoA. Silver-stained SDS-PAGE of the intact Gcd complex revealed five different subunits with apparent molecular masses of GcdA, 65 kDa; GcdB, 35 kDa; GcdC1, 24 kDa; GcdC2, 23 kDa; and GcdD, 15 kDa (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the N-terminal sequences of GcdA, C1 and C2 with those of the corresponding subunits from A. fermentans (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and F. nucleatum (15Kapatral V. Anderson I. Ivanova N. Reznik G. Los T. Lykidis A. Bhattacharyya A. Bartman A. Gardner W.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2005-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) confirmed their assignment. As with the decarboxylase from A. fermentans, the N termini of GcdB and D could not be sequenced by Edman degradation. For sequencing of the corresponding genes PCR primers were deduced from the N termini and from highly conserved regions of the proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). After sequencing, it was observed that the 3′-end of gcdA had been previously sequenced during cloning of the genes coding for 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdCAB) from C. symbiosum (43Hans M. Sievers J. Müller U. Bill E. Vorholt J.A. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hence gcdA is located upstream of hgdCAB as already observed in A. fermentans and F. nucleatum. Similarly, upstream of gcdA the two gctAB genes coding for glutaconate CoA-transferase were detected (9Mack M. Bendrat K. Zelder O. Eckel E. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sequence of the DNA fragment comprising gcdA was deposited in GenBankTM under accession number FJ390113. Unlike in A. fermentans but similar to F. nucleatum (15Kapatral V. Anderson I. Ivanova N. Reznik G. Los T. Lykidis A. Bhattacharyya A. Bartman A. Gardner W. Grechkin G. Zhu L. Vasieva O. Chu L. Kogan Y. Chaga O. Goltsman E. Bernal A. Larsen N. D'Souza M. Walunas T. Pusch G. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Kyrpides N. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2005-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), all four genes coding for the smaller subunits are located upstream of gctAB (Fig. 1, accession number FJ390114). The amino acid sequence of the deduced carboxytransferase subunit GcdA matches well with those from A. fermentans (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (15Kapatral V. Anderson I. Ivanova N. Reznik G. Los T. Lykidis A. Bhattacharyya A. Bartman A.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2005-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (16Kapatral V. Ivanova N. Anderson I. Reznik G. Bhattacharyya A. Gardner W.L. Mikhailova N. Lapidus A. Larsen N. D'Souza M. Walunas T. Haselkorn R. Overbeek R. Kyrpides N. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (69% identity for each). The sequence of the hydrophobic subunit GcdB is also very similar to those listed above (67, 73, and 73%, respectively) and includes the conserved amino acids supposedly involved in Na+ transport. Interestingly, the two GcdC subunits (GcdC1 and GcdC2) are encoded by slightly different genes (79% sequence identity) (Fig. 2B). Similar to A. fermentans (7Braune A. Bendrat K. Rospert S. Buckel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) their calculated molecular masses (15 and 14 kDa, respectively) as well as that of the GcdD subunit (10 kDa) were substantially lower than those observed on SDS-PAGE. The C-terminal region of GcdC1 and GcdC2 (A78-N149 and A68-N139, respectively) corresponds to the biotin carrier domain, whereas the N-terminal region (M1-A31) is presumably involved in immobilizing the GcdA subunits on the GcdAB subcomplex (13Wendt K.S. Schall I. Huber R. Buckel W. Jacob U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the GcdC1 sequence the linker between these two domains comprises a stretch of 47 amino acid residues that is composed of 25 alanines and 14 prolines. In GcdC from A. fermentans (58% sequence identity), this apparently highly flexible stretch is similar in length (50 amino acids) and likewise composed of 34 alanines and 14 prolines. The main difference between the two GcdCs from C. symbiosum is the shortening of the GcdC2 linker by ten amino acids (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the highly conserved β-subunits, the δ-subunits are variable; the closest identity (33%) was found between the GcdDs of C. symbiosum and F. nucleatum. Thus, the gene cluster for the specific part of the glutamate fermentation pathway in C. symbiosum from (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, via (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, and glutaconyl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA (6Buckel W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 57: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) has been established. This cluster matches well with that in the genome of the neotype strain of C. symbiosum ATCC 14940 (Genome Sequencing Center, Washington University, St. Louis), which is slightly different from the strain HB25 used in this work (44Kaneuchi C. Watanabe K. Terada A. Benno Y. Mitsuoka T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1976; 26: 195-204Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified GcdA heterologously expressed in E. coli revealed pure protein with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa (calculated mass, 65 kDa). With the multienzyme assay system used for the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase, activity was observed only in the presence of d-biotin. This assay generates glutaconyl-CoA in situ and determines formed crotonyl-CoA via the NAD+-dependent oxidation to acetyl-CoA and acetylphosphate (18Buckel W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 547-558Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under saturating glutaconyl-CoA concentrations (0.1 mm) an apparent Km of 2.8 mm for biotin and a specific activity of Vmax of 0.11 units/mg were determined. The Km was 14-times lower than that observed with GcdA from A. fermentans and Vmax was about 1000 times lower than that of the complete decarboxylase (21Beatrix B. Bendrat K."
https://openalex.org/W1978671496,"It is commonly hypothesized that external representations serve as memory aids and improve task performance by means of expanding the limited capacity of working memory. However, very few studies have directly examined this memory aid hypothesis. By systematically manipulating how information is available externally versus internally in a sequential number comparison task, three experiments were designed to investigate the relation between external representations and working memory. The experimental results show that when the task requires information from both external representations and working memory, it is the interaction of information from the two sources that determines task performance. In particular, when information from the two sources does not match well, external representations hinder instead of enhance task performance. The study highlights the important role the coordination among different representations plays in distributed cognition. The general relations between external representations and working memory are discussed."

A structurally diverse repertoire of ligands, from photons to large peptides, activates G protein-coupled receptors to elicit their physiological functions (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). In turn, ligand-bound G protein-coupled receptors function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors, catalyzing the exchange of GDP bound on the Gα subunit with GTP in the presence of Gβγ and causing the dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer to form two functional units (Gα and Gβγ) (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Both Gα and Gβγ subunits signal to various cellular pathways. Based on sequence and functional homologies, G proteins are grouped into four families: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 (3Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Of these four subfamilies of G proteins, the physiological function of the G12 subfamily is less well understood. In this family, there are two members, G12 and G13. Gα12 knock-out mice appear normal (4Gu J.L. Müller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gα13 knock-out mice display embryonic lethality (embryonic day ∼9.5) (5Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I.

Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell-specific deletion of Gα13 also results in vascular defect and embryonic lethality (6Ruppel K.M. Willison D. Kataoka H. Wang A. Zheng Y.W. Cornelissen I. Yin L. Xu S.M. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The molecular basis that underlies the vascular defect observed in Gα13−/− mouse embryos has not been defined. Angiogenesis (formation of endothelium-lined blood vessels) is essential for organ growth in the embryo and for repair of wounded tissues in the adult (7Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar, 8Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). An imbalance in angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous malignant, inflammatory, ischemic, infectious, and immune disorders and cancers (7Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar, 8Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). Most angiogenesis events take place during embryonic development. In adult tissues, the majority of endothelial cells are quiescent, and angiogenesis occurs only rarely except in a few adult tissues (including ovary) that exhibit periodic and dynamic growth and regression (9Redmer D.A. Reynolds L.P. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Ferrara N. Chen H. Davis-Smyth T. Gerber H.P. Nguyen T.N. Peers D. Chisholm V. Hillan K.J. Schwall R.H. Nat.

Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrates into cancerous growths (including implanted tumor tissues), supplying nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. Solid tumors depend on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis in a hostile environment (12Folkman J. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). Bone marrow is the origin of endothelial progenitor cells in the adult. Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are mobilized into peripheral blood and recruited to the foci of pathophysiological neovascularization and re-endothelialization, thereby contributing to vascular regeneration (13Seandel M. Butler J. Lyden D. Rafii S. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 181-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 2The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellLLCLewis lung carcinomasiRNAsmall interfering RNA. the most critical factor for angiogenesis, is an important factor for the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow (7Carmeliet P.

Here, we show that heterozygous Gα13+/− mice display defects in adult angiogenesis. We found that female Gα13+/− mice show a higher number of immature follicles and a lower density of blood vessels in the mature corpus luteum compared with Gα13+/+ mice. Furthermore, implanted tumors grew slower in Gα13+/− host mice. These tumor tissues had many fewer blood vessels compared with those from Gα13+/+ host mice. We also down-regulated Gα13 in endothelial cells by RNA interference and show that defective migration and tube formation in response to VEGF likely contribute to the impaired angiogenesis. Moreover, bone marrow-derived cells from Gα13+/+ mice rescued the failed growth of allografted tumors when reconstituted into irradiated Gα13+/− mice. Our results demonstrate that Gα13 is haploinsufficient for adult angiogenesis in both the female reproductive system and tumor angiogenesis. This role in adult angiogenesis provides a suitable system to further investigate the biochemical and physiological functions of Gα13. Moreover, Gα13 inhibition could be explored for anticancer drug development. Mouse SVEC4-10 endothelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were provided by K. Hajjar (Weill Medical College of Cornell University). Gα13+/− mice were provided by M. Simon (California Institute of Technology). Anti-Gα13 monoclonal antibody was from NewEast Biosciences. Studies using mice were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Vaginal smears from age-matched mice were taken with transfer pipettes at the same time every day during at least three cyclic periods. Smears were fixed in absolute cold acetone for 10 min. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed. Mouse estrus cycles were examined as described (22Vrciæ H. Horvat B. Damjanov I. Gynecol. Obstet. Invest. 1992; 33: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Ovaries from estrus cycle-matched mice were fixed in 4% cold paraformaldehyde and imbedded in paraffin. Sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analyses and with anti-CD34 antibody for blood vessel analyses. Mouse B16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mice were genotyped by PCR of tail DNA. Approximately 2 × 106 logarithmically growing tumor cells were subcutaneously injected in the lower right backs of wild-type and Gα13+/− mice. Tumor size was measured at the indicated dates with a Vernier caliper and calculated by the formula V = L × W2/2. LLC tumors were excised 11 days after inoculation from wild-type and mutant mice. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and imbedded in O.C.T. Sections of 8 μm were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analyses and with anti-PECAM/CD31 antibody for blood vessel analyses. RNA interference was performed with HiPerformance 2-for-Silencing siRNA duplexes (Qiagen). The target sequence for mouse Gα13 was as described previously (23Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human Gα13 and control siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen. Transfection of siRNAs was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, siRNA and Lipofectamine were diluted and mixed in Opti-MEM I to allow the formation of siRNA-liposome complexes. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was overlaid onto cells cultured in growth medium without antibiotics. The transfected cells were usually analyzed 72 h after transfection. Matrigel growth factor-reduced matrix (500 μl, BD Biosciences) was applied to each well of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Mouse SVEC4-10 or human primary HUVECs were added in serum-free medium with or without 20 ng/ml VEGF. Tube formation was examined beginning 6 h later. Photographs of representative ×10 fields were taken, and endothelial tubes were quantified by counting length and branches using NIH ImageJ software. Cell migration was assayed using Boyden chambers (8.0-μm pore polyethylene terephthalate membrane, Falcon cell culture insert, BD Biosciences) (24Shan D. Chen L. Njardarson J.T. Gaul C. Ma X.

Cells were trypsinized and counted. 300 μl of 5–10 × 104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber, and 500 μl of the appropriate medium with 20 ng/ml VEGF were added to the lower chamber. Transwells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab, and cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained. Photographs of three random regions (×10 objective) were taken, and the number of cells was counted to calculate the average number of cells that had transmigrated. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with VEGF (10 mg/kg) or control vehicle every day. After day 4, mobilized cells in peripheral blood were collected by orbital bleeding. Circulating endothelial colony-forming cells were counted with the 5 Day CFU-Hill colony assay (StemCell Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. The circulating endothelial colony-forming cells were verified by 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein metabolic labeling. Gα13+/− and wild-type mice at 10–12 weeks of age were lethally irradiated (950 rads). Wild-type or Gα13+/− bone marrow cells were collected and filtered through a sterile 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove cell clumps and debris. Approximately 2 × 106 bone marrow cells were injected into the tail veins of each irradiated recipient mouse. After 4 weeks, LLC tumor cells were subcutaneously injected in the lower right back. Tumor surface area was measured at the indicated dates with calipers. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test with significance defined as p < 0.05. During the crossing of Gα13+/− mice, we noticed consistently that fewer pups were born per litter even after considering the embryonic death of Gα13−/− mouse embryos. Whereas the number of pups from wild-type Gα13+/+ crossings was approximately six to eight, heterozygous Gα13+/− crossing routinely gave approximately two or three pups per litter. Given the observation of vascular defects in Gα13−/− embryos, we hypothesized that this reduced fertility in Gα13+/− mice might reflect a possible adult angiogenesis defect. Therefore, we examined angiogenesis in ovaries. Gα13+/+ and Gα13+/− female mice appeared to have similar estrous cycles (∼5 days) through the proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus stages (Fig. 1A). We selected Gα13+/+ and Gα13+/− female mice at the same estrus stage based on examination of smears prepared from the vaginal fluid and examined the histology of the ovaries of these mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Compared with age-matched Gα13+/+ mice, Gα13+/− mice had more immature follicles and less mature corpora lutea (Fig. 1C). This suggests that, during each ovulation, fewer oocytes were released in Gα13+/− mice compared with Gα13+/+ mice. This likely contributes to the observation that fewer pups were born from Gα13+/− crossing. Furthermore, even the mature corpora lutea from Gα13+/− mice had a significantly lower blood vessel density (Fig. 1, D and E). We also observed a defect in uterine angiogenesis in Gα13+/− mice: the uteruses from Gα13+/− mice had a decreased blood vessel density compared with age- and estrous cycle-matched Gα13+/+ mice (data not shown). These results demonstrate that there are ovarian angiogenesis impairments in heterozygous Gα13+/− mice. Next, we used tumor angiogenesis as the second model to investigate the function of Gα13 in adult angiogenesis in mice. Western blot analyses revealed that Gα13 protein levels were decreased (by ∼50%) in G13+/− mice compared with wild-type mice (data not shown). We subcutaneously injected logarithmically growing malignant B16 melanoma cells into 8-week-old Gα13+/− and wild-type mice and measured the tumor growth (Fig. 2A). Wild-type Gα13+/+ mice inoculated with B16 tumor cells rapidly developed solid tumors and died at 21 ± 4 days (mean ± S.D.) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the implanted tumors grew significantly slower in Gα13+/− mice (Fig. 2A). To make sure that the observed impaired growth of allografted tumors in Gα13+/− host mice was not just limited to mouse B16 melanoma cells, we further performed transplant experiments with LLC cells (Fig. 2B). LLC tumor growth was also markedly attenuated in Gα13+/− mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). These experiments demonstrate the impaired tumor growth in Gα13+/− host mice. To investigate whether the impaired tumor growth in Gα13+/− mice was due to the failure of angiogenesis, we investigated the vascularization of tumor tissues from Gα13+/− and wild-type host mice. The primary tumors (after 11 days) were dissected, fixed, and imbedded. Sections of 8 μm were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analyses (Fig. 3A) and with anti-PECAM/CD31 antibody staining for blood vessel analyses (Fig. 3B). Based on hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumor tissues from both host mice showed similar morphologies (Fig. 3A). However, there were profound differences in the number of blood vessels in the tumor tissues from wild-type and Gα13+/− host mice. In the tumor tissues from wild-type host mice, tumors showed many (23.5 ± 5.3 vessels/field) well defined large vessels (stained with anti-PECAM/CD31 antibody) (Fig. 3B, left panels), whereas in the tumor tissues from Gα13+/− host mice, the tumors showed far fewer (12 ± 3.5 vessels/field) and stunted occluded vessels (right panels). Hence, these data show a defect in tumor angiogenesis in Gα13+/− host mice. We then investigated the molecular basis for the impaired adult angiogenesis in Gα13+/− mice. Endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels. Gα13 is highly expressed in endothelial cells, and endothelial cell-specific deletion of Gα13 also results in vascular defect and embryonic lethality (6Ruppel K.M. Willison D. Kataoka H. Wang A. Zheng Y.W. Cornelissen I. Yin L. Xu S.M. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the role of Gα13 in the physiological functions of endothelial cells. First, we examined the endothelial cell tube formation, as this has been used as an in vitro model of angiogenesis. This assay relies on the endothelial cells' ability to form distinct blood vessel-like tubules in an extracellular matrix. We used RNA interference to down-regulate the level of Gα13 proteins in endothelial cells (Fig. 4A). Control and Gα13 siRNA-treated murine SVEC4-10 endothelial cells were plated onto Matrigel. Whereas VEGF stimulated the rapid remolding and capillary tube formation in control siRNA-treated endothelial cells, Gα13 siRNA treatment impaired the VEGF-induced tube formation on Matrigel (Fig. 4B). Quantification of branch lengths and numbers demonstrated that Gα13 siRNA treatment reduced the tube formation by ∼60% (Fig. 4C). Similar results were observed with HUVECs (Fig. 4, D and E). These data demonstrate that Gα13 is critical for VEGF-induced endothelial cell tube formation. Second, we investigated the role of Gα13 in endothelial cell migration. Angiogenesis involves the migration of endothelial cells. In adult mice, bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells migrate and are recruited to newly forming blood vessels (14Asahara T. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka C. Pastore C. Silver M. Kearne M. Magner M. Isner J.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 28Asahara T. Murohara T. Sullivan A. Silver M. van der Zee R. Li T. Witzenbichler B. Schatteman G. Isner J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (7761) Google Scholar). We (23Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and others (5Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) have shown that Gα13 is critical for G protein-coupled receptor-induced fibroblast cell migration. Furthermore, we have shown that Gα13 is also essential for growth factor (such as platelet-derived growth factor)-induced fibroblast cell migration (23Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Wang D. Tan Y.C. Kreitzer G.E. Nakai Y. Shan D. Zheng Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32660-32667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that one of the contributing factors to the angiogenesis defect in Gα13+/− mice is the defective endothelial cell migration. Hence, we examined the role of Gα13 in VEGF-induced migration of endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells. As shown in Fig. 5(A and B), Gα13 siRNA treatment decreased the VEGF-induced migration of SVEC4-10 cells and HUVECs. Re-expression of human Gα13 in siRNA-treated SVEC4-10 cells (there are 5 different nucleotides within the 19-nucleotide siRNA oligomer in the mouse and human Gα13 genes) rescued VEGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 5A). Gα13 siRNA had no effect on the proliferation of these endothelial cells (data not shown). Thus, Gα13 plays an essential role in VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and capillary tube formation in vitro. Third, we investigated the migration/mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood in Gα13+/− and control Gα13+/+ mice. VEGF-A was injected into the tail veins of Gα13+/− and Gα13+/+ mice, and peripheral blood was drawn. Endothelial progenitor cells were separated and counted using the 5 Day CFU-Hill colony assay (Fig. 5C). Whereas VEGF increased the number of mobilized endothelial progenitor cells in peripheral blood in Gα13+/+ mice, this VEGF-induced mobilization was significantly reduced in Gα13+/− mice (Fig. 5C). These data demonstrate that there is a defect in the VEGF-induced mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells in Gα13+/− mice. To further explore the molecular mechanism by which Gα13 is required for VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration, we studied the role of Gα13 in lamellipodium formation in endothelial cells. Lamellipodia are protruding membrane structures at the leading edge of migrating cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (D and E), migrating SVEC4-10 cells (treated with a control siRNA) at the edge of a wound in the presence of VEGF displayed lamellipodia (∼82% of the cells), as evidenced by staining of F-actin filaments and cortactin. Significantly, Gα13 siRNA treatment led to the reduction of lamellipodia in the presence of VEGF (∼30% of cells with lamellipodia). These data suggest that Gα13 is involved in VEGF-induced lamellipodium formation. If the impaired migration/mobilization of bone marrow-derived cells in Gα13+/− mice is responsible for the slow growth of implanted tumors in Gα13+/− mice, reconstitution of bone marrow-derived cells from wild-type Gα13+/+ mice into irradiated Gα13+/− mice should rescue the tumor growth. We collected bone marrow-derived cells from wild-type Gα13+/+ littermates. Lethally irradiated Gα13+/− mice were reconstituted with these wild-type bone marrow-derived cells. After 4 weeks of recovery, we subcutaneously injected LLC cells into the Gα13+/− recipient mice, and tumor growth was monitored. As shown in Fig. 6A, Gα13+/− host mice reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow-derived cells rapidly developed solid tumors, similar to wild-type Gα13+/+ host mice that had been irradiated and reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow-derived cells. In contrast, tumor growth was markedly attenuated in either Gα13+/+ or Gα13+/− host mice that had been irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow-derived cells from Gα13+/− donor mice (Fig. 6B). Tumor tissues from host mice reconstituted with bone marrow-derived cells from Gα13+/− donor mice showed many fewer blood vessels compared with tumor tissues from host mice reconstituted with bone marrow-derived cells from Gα13+/+ donor mice (data not shown). These data suggest that the failed migration/mobilization of bone marrow-derived cells in Gα13+/− mice contributes to the slow tumor growth in Gα13+/− host mice and that this defect can be rescued by the reconstitution of bone marrow-derived cells from the wild-type littermates. We have shown here that Gα13 plays a critical role in adult angiogenesis. Gα13+/− mouse ovaries contained fewer mature follicles, and the corpora lutea contained fewer blood vessels. In tumor allografted experiments, tumors grew much slower in Gα13+/− host mice than in the wild-type littermates. Tumor tissues from the Gα13+/− host mice had lower numbers of blood vessels. These data demonstrate a physiological role for Gα13 in adult angiogenesis. Furthermore, we have shown that Gα13 is critical for endothelial cell migration in vitro and for the migration/mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood in vivo. We propose that the impaired migration of endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells underlies the angiogenesis defect in Gα13 gene-modified mice. Interestingly, a very recent report has shown that gene deletion of another G protein, Gαs, impairs the homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in bone marrow niches (29Adams G.B. Alley I.R. Chung U.I. Chabner K.T. Jeanson N.T. Lo Celso C. Marsters E.S. Chen M. Weinstein L.S. Lin C.P. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Nature. 2009; 459: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that multiple G proteins play critical roles in the physiological functions of stem and/or progenitor cells. Gα13−/− mouse embryos die at embryonic day ∼9.5 with a defective vasculature (5Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It is possible that Gα13 is essential for embryonic angiogenesis. Whereas Gα13+/− mice have impaired adult angiogenesis, these mice have apparently normal embryonic angiogenesis, although embryonic angiogenesis has not been systematically examined in Gα13+/− embryos. Thus, it appears that adult angiogenesis is more sensitive to the dose of Gα13 protein levels compared with embryonic angiogenesis. It is noteworthy that this Gα13 dose sensitivity has also been observed in the Gα12−/− genetic background: whereas Gα13+/+Gα12−/− mice appear normal, Gα13+/−Gα12−/− mice die at embryonic day ∼9.5 (4Gu J.L. Müller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The haploinsufficiency of Gα13 for adult angiogenesis may reflect the difference between adult and embryonic angiogenesis (11Grunewald M. Avraham I. Dor Y. Bachar-Lustig E. Itin A. Jung S. Yung S. Chimenti S. Landsman L. Abramovitch R. Keshet E. Cell. 2006; 124: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). We propose that the underlying molecular basis of the defective angiogenesis of Gα13 gene-modified mice is the impaired migration of endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells. We have shown that Gα13 is critical for VEGF-induced migration of endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells. Consistent with our previous report on fibroblast cells (23Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Gα13 plays a major role in the migration initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases in endothelial cells. Currently, it is not clear how the VEGF receptor is connected to Gα13. In fibroblast cells, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor links to Gα13 in a G protein-coupled receptor-independent fashion (23Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Gα13 forms a complex with Rac in fibroblast cells (23Shan D. Chen L. Wang D. Tan Y.C. Gu J.L. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, the Gα13-Rac complex is part of a larger complex including the actin polymerization protein HAX-1 (30Radhika V. Onesime D. Ha J.H. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49406-49413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, a larger complex involving Gα13-Rac might be critical for regulating cell migration. Furthermore, given the dependence of tumor growth and angiogenesis on the dosage of Gα13, inhibitors of Gα13 could be developed as therapeutics for cancer treatment. We thank Dr. M. Simon for the Gα13+/− mice, the Histology Core Facility at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for help with the ovary studies, H. G. Kopp for help with the bone marrow transplant experiments, and P. Mu for technical assistance. We are grateful to T. Maack, L. Levin, and members of our laboratory for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2090503294,"The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) is an intracellular mechanism that ensures proper chromosome segregation. By inhibiting Cdc20, a co-factor of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), the checkpoint arrests the cell cycle until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Inhibition of Cdc20 is mediated by a conserved network of interacting proteins. The individual functions of these proteins are well characterized, but understanding of their integrated function is still rudimentary. We here describe our attempts to reverse-engineer the SAC network based on gene deletion phenotypes. We begun by formulating a general model of the SAC which enables us to predict the rate of chromosomal missegregation for any putative set of interactions between the SAC proteins. Next the missegregation rates of seven yeast strains are measured in response to the deletion of one or two checkpoint proteins. Finally, we searched for the set of interactions that correctly predicted the observed missegregation rates of all deletion mutants. Remarkably, although based on only seven phenotypes, the consistent network we obtained successfully reproduces many of the known properties of the SAC. Further insights provided by our analysis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2091522007,"Detection, isolation, and identification of individual virus infected cells during long term infection are critical to advance our understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis for latent/persistent viruses. However, current approaches to study these viruses in vivo have been hampered by low sensitivity and effects of cell-type on expression of viral encoded reporter genes. We have designed a novel Cre recombinase (Cre)-based murine system to overcome these problems, and thereby enable tracking and isolation of individual in vivo infected cells.Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) was used as a prototypic persistent model virus. A Cre expressing recombinant virus was constructed and characterised. The virus is attenuated both in lytic virus replication, producing ten-fold lower lung virus titres than wild type virus, and in the establishment of latency. However, despite this limitation, when the sEGFP7 mouse line containing a Cre-activated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was infected with the Cre expressing virus, sites of latent and persistent virus infection could be identified within B cells and macrophages of the lymphoid system on the basis of EGFP expression. Importantly, the use of the sEGFP7 mouse line which expresses high levels of EGFP allowed individual virus positive cells to be purified by FACSorting. Virus gene expression could be detected in these cells. Low numbers of EGFP positive cells could also be detected in the bone marrow.The use of this novel Cre-based virus/mouse system allowed identification of individual latently infected cells in vivo and may be useful for the study and long-term monitoring of other latent/persistent virus infections."
