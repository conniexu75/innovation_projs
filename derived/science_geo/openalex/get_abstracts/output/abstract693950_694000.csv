Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors have the NADase function necessary but insufficient to activate plant immune responses. Here, we show that plant TIR proteins, besides being NADases, act as 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases by hydrolyzing RNA/DNA. Structural data show that a TIR domain adopts distinct oligomers with mutually exclusive NADase and synthetase activity. Mutations specifically disrupting the synthetase activity abrogate TIR-mediated cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb), supporting an important role for these cNMPs in TIR signaling. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis negative regulator of TIR-NLR signaling, NUDT7, displays 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP but not 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase activity and suppresses cell death activity of TIRs in Nb. Our study identifies a family of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases and establishes a critical role for them in plant immune responses. 2′,3′-cAMP is a positional isomer of the well-established second messenger 3′,5′-cAMP, but little is known about the biology of this noncanonical cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP).

https://openalex.org/W4281254649,"Gene regulation in the human genome is controlled by distal enhancers that activate specific nearby promoters1. A proposed model for this specificity is that promoters have sequence-encoded preferences for certain enhancers, for example, mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors2. This ‘biochemical compatibility’ model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila3–9. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible has not yet been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. Here we design a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer × promoter self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (ExP STARR-seq) and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify simple rules for enhancer–promoter compatibility, whereby most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities multiplicatively combine to determine RNA output (R2 = 0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters show subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contain built-in activating motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, which decrease the responsiveness of promoters to distal enhancers. Promoters of variably expressed genes lack these motifs and show stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer–promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome. A new high-throughput assay applied to 1,000 enhancers and 1,000 promoters in human cells reveals how different classes of enhancers and promoters control RNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W4280513768,"Many tissues harbor quiescent stem cells that are activated upon injury, subsequently proliferating and differentiating to repair tissue damage. Mechanisms by which stem cells sense injury and transition from quiescence to activation, however, remain largely unknown. Resident skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential orchestrators of muscle regeneration and repair. Here, with a combination of in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we show that quiescent MuSCs have elaborate, Rac GTPase-promoted cytoplasmic projections that respond to injury via the upregulation of Rho/ROCK signaling, facilitating projection retraction and driving downstream activation events. These early events involve rapid cytoskeletal rearrangements and occur independently of exogenous growth factors. This mechanism is conserved across a broad range of MuSC activation models, including injury, disease, and genetic loss of quiescence. Our results redefine MuSC activation and present a central mechanism by which quiescent stem cells initiate responses to injury."
https://openalex.org/W4281295263,"As the vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Malaysia progresses rapidly, the main challenge will gradually shift from procuring and distributing vaccines to ensuring the broadest possible acceptance among all population segments. Therefore, this study used the integrated framework of the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to investigate the predictors of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines in Malaysia.A market research company in Malaysia was engaged to collect data during June 11-20, 2021 using self-administered questionnaires via its online panel, ensuring a nationwide random sample of 804 respondents. A logistic regression was subsequently estimated to determine the significant predictors of vaccination intention.The predictors that significantly affect COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia are age, susceptibility, religious beliefs, attitude, subjective norms, and trust in the vaccine. In particular, those who are more inclined to get vaccinated are older individuals, have a higher perceived risk of infection and social pressure to get vaccinated, have a positive attitude, and have high levels of trust in the vaccine. Individuals' who perceive that their religious beliefs are against vaccination are more likely to exhibit uncertainty toward it.This study showed that although a large proportion of respondents indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, there are concerns about religious barriers and trust in the vaccine that the relevant stakeholders should address. Campaigns should also focus on shaping the nation's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines, in parallel with encouraging people to use their social influence in helping those in their close circle who are unsure of vaccination to cross the line. These measures will prove to be pertinent as the nation begins to administer booster vaccines to tackle the waning effects of COVID-19 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4280529765,"X inactivation (XCI) is triggered by upregulation of XIST, which coats the chromosome in cis, promoting formation of a heterochromatic domain (Xi). XIST role beyond initiation of XCI is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that XIST loss impairs differentiation of human mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and promotes emergence of highly tumorigenic and metastatic carcinomas. On the Xi, XIST deficiency triggers epigenetic changes and reactivation of genes overlapping Polycomb domains, including Mediator subunit MED14. MED14 overdosage results in increased Mediator levels and hyperactivation of the MaSC enhancer landscape and transcriptional program, making differentiation less favorable. We further demonstrate that loss of XIST and Xi transcriptional instability is common among human breast tumors of poor prognosis. We conclude that XIST is a gatekeeper of human mammary epithelium homeostasis, thus unveiling a paradigm in the control of somatic cell identity with potential consequences for our understanding of gender-specific malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4281396591,"In Ethiopia, an array of measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Such control measures could significantly influence the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in the general population. However, still, there is scarce information regarding the KAP of students towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to assess KAP and associated factors towards COVID-19 among secondary school students in Gondar town, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2021 on a total of 395 participants. Proportional sample allocation was used in 4 randomly selected schools. Then, students from each of the schools were recruited by using a systematic random sampling technique. Socio-demographic data and questions regarding the KAP were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 20. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the associated factors and p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.The mean age of study participants was 17.7±1.5 years and slightly more than 2/3 (67.3%) ranges from 17-19 years old. In this study, 86.3% (95% CI: 83-90) of study participants had good knowledge about COVID-19. Students having urban residence (AOR, with 95% CI: 5.6 (1.76-17.6), fathers with a diploma and above educational status (AOR, with 95% CI: 3 (1.2-7.5), and uses television or radio as a source of information (AOR, with 95% CI: 3.7 (1.5-9.3) tended to have good knowledge about COVID-19. About 381 (86.3%) had good attitude towards COVID-19 infections, while 238 (60.3%) of the participants had a good practice to prevent COVID-19 infections.The majority of the secondary school students in Gondar town have good knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19. However, targeted interventions are still necessary, especially for students having poor knowledge and poor practice towards COVID-19. This study also found that urban residence, a father with a diploma and above educational status, and using television or radio as a source of information about COVID-19 were significantly associated with the knowledge level of the study participants."
https://openalex.org/W4280613964,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a Gram-positive commensal and human respiratory pathogen. How this bacterium satisfies its nutritional iron (Fe) requirement in the context of endogenously produced hydrogen peroxide is not well understood. Here, we characterize a novel virulence-associated Rrf2-family transcriptional repressor that we term SifR (streptococcal IscR-like family transcriptional repressor) encoded by spd_1448 and conserved in Streptococci. Global transcriptomic analysis of a ΔsifR strain defines the SifR regulon as genes encoding a candidate catechol dioxygenase CatE, an uncharacterized oxidoreductase YwnB, a candidate flavin-dependent ferric reductase YhdA, a candidate heme-based ferric reductase domain-containing protein and the Piu (pneumococcus iron uptake) Fe transporter (piuBCDA). Previous work established that membrane-anchored PiuA binds FeIII-bis-catechol or monocatechol complexes with high affinity, including the human catecholamine stress hormone, norepinephrine. We demonstrate that SifR senses quinone via a single conserved cysteine that represses its regulon when in the reduced form. Upon reaction with catechol-derived quinones, we show that SifR dissociates from the DNA leading to regulon derepression, allowing the pneumococcus to access a catechol-derived source of Fe while minimizing reactive electrophile stress induced by quinones. Consistent with this model, we show that CatE is an FeII-dependent 2,3-catechol dioxygenase with broad substrate specificity, YwnB is an NAD(P)H-dependent quinone reductase capable of reducing the oxidized and cyclized norepinephrine, adrenochrome, and YhdA is capable of reducing a number of FeIII complexes, including PiuA-binding transport substrates. These findings are consistent with a model where FeIII-catechol complexes serve as significant nutritional Fe sources in the host."
https://openalex.org/W4281256094,"Chronic itch is a complex sensation of the skin frequently associated with skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. Although Serpin E1 is implicated in chronic itch, its receptor and signaling pathways involved in itch are not known. In this study, the clinical relevance of a putative Serpin E1 receptor PLAUR to chronic itch, and the neuro-cutaneous Serpin E1-PLAUR signaling are explored. We found that PLAUR is overexpressed in skin specimens of human lesional AD and lesional psoriasis, and sensory neurons innervating MC903-induced AD-like murine skin. Murine PLAUR+ sensory neurons responded to Serpin E1, resulting in enrichment of numerous itch- and inflammation-related genes and their protein release. PLAUR resides in TLR2+ neurons and Serpin E1 stimulus led to transcriptional upregulation of TLR2 and its co-signaling proteins. Agonists of TLR2 propagated itch-related gene transcription including BNP, OSM, and PAR2. OSM induced acute itch in mice and promoted G-CSF and IL-8 release from human keratinocytes. Serpin E1 inhibitor reduced MC903-induced itch, epidermal hyperplasia, immunocyte infiltration, and resulted in lower transcription/expression levels of Serpin E1 and OSM. Taken together, the PLAUR-TLR2-OSM signaling promotes skin-nerve communication, cutaneous inflammation, and itch, all feeding into an aggravation of AD and exaggerated itch circuits."
https://openalex.org/W4281385920,"Seroprevalence studies have been carried out in many developed and developing countries to evaluate ongoing and past infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data on this infection in marginalized populations in urban slums are limited, which may offer crucial information to update prevention and mitigation policies and strategies. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and factors associated with seropositivity in slum and non-slum communities in two large cities in Bangladesh.A cross-sectional study was carried out among the target population in Dhaka and Chattogram cities between October 2020 and February 2021. Questionnaire-based data, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements and blood were obtained. SARS-CoV-2 serology was assessed by Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay.Among the 3220 participants (2444 adults, ≥18 years; 776 children, 10-17 years), the overall weighted seroprevalence was 67.3% (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 65.2, 69.3) with 71.0% in slum (95% CI = 68.7, 72.2) and 62.2% in non-slum (95% CI = 58.5, 65.8). The weighted seroprevalence was 72.9% in Dhaka and 54.2% in Chattogram. Seroprevalence was positively associated with limited years of formal education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.43, 1.82), lower income (aOR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.46), overweight (aOR = 1.2835; 95% CI = 1.26, 1.97), diabetes (aOR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.21, 2.32) and heart disease (aOR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.86). Contrarily, negative associations were found between seropositivity and regular wearing of masks and washing hands, and prior BCG vaccination. About 63% of the population had asymptomatic infection; only 33% slum and 49% non-slum population showed symptomatic infection.The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was more prominent in impoverished informal settlements than in the adjacent middle-income non-slum areas. Additional factors associated with seropositivity included limited education, low income, overweight and pre-existing chronic conditions. Behavioral factors such as regular wearing of masks and washing hands were associated with lower probability of seropositivity."
https://openalex.org/W4280583503,"Unwinding of the replication origin and loading of DNA helicases underlie the initiation of chromosomal replication. In Escherichia coli, the minimal origin oriC contains a duplex unwinding element (DUE) region and three (Left, Middle, and Right) regions that bind the initiator protein DnaA. The Left/Right regions bear a set of DnaA-binding sequences, constituting the Left/Right-DnaA subcomplexes, while the Middle region has a single DnaA-binding site, which stimulates formation of the Left/Right-DnaA subcomplexes. In addition, a DUE-flanking AT-cluster element (TATTAAAAAGAA) is located just outside of the minimal oriC region. The Left-DnaA subcomplex promotes unwinding of the flanking DUE exposing TT[A/G]T(T) sequences that then bind to the Left-DnaA subcomplex, stabilizing the unwound state required for DnaB helicase loading. However, the role of the Right-DnaA subcomplex is largely unclear. Here, we show that DUE unwinding by both the Left/Right-DnaA subcomplexes, but not the Left-DnaA subcomplex only, was stimulated by a DUE-terminal subregion flanking the AT-cluster. Consistently, we found the Right-DnaA subcomplex-bound single-stranded DUE and AT-cluster regions. In addition, the Left/Right-DnaA subcomplexes bound DnaB helicase independently. For only the Left-DnaA subcomplex, we show the AT-cluster was crucial for DnaB loading. The role of unwound DNA binding of the Right-DnaA subcomplex was further supported by in vivo data. Taken together, we propose a model in which the Right-DnaA subcomplex dynamically interacts with the unwound DUE, assisting in DUE unwinding and efficient loading of DnaB helicases, while in the absence of the Right-DnaA subcomplex, the AT-cluster assists in those processes, supporting robustness of replication initiation."
https://openalex.org/W4280633582,"The small GTPase Cdc42 exists in the form of two alternatively spliced variants that are modified by hydrophobic chains: the ubiquitously expressed Cdc42-prenyl and a brain-specific isoform that can be palmitoylated, Cdc42-palm. Our previous work demonstrated that Cdc42-palm can be palmitoylated at two cysteine residues, Cys188 and Cys189, while Cys188 can also be prenylated. We showed that palmitoylation of Cys188 is essential for the plasma membrane localization of Cdc42-palm and is critically involved in Cdc42-mediated regulation of gene transcription and neuronal morphology. However, the abundance and regulation of this modification was not investigated. In the present study, we found that only a minor fraction of Cdc42 undergoes monopalmitoylation in neuroblastoma cells and in hippocampal neurons. In addition, we identified DHHC5 as one of the major palmitoyl acyltransferases that could physically interact with Cdc42-palm. We demonstrate that overexpression of dominant negative DHHC5 mutant decreased palmitoylation and plasma membrane localization of Cdc42-palm. In addition, knockdown of DHHC5 significantly reduced Cdc42-palm palmitoylation, leading to a decrease of Cdc42-mediated gene transcription and spine formation in hippocampal neurons. We also found that the expression of DHHC5 in the brain is developmentally regulated. Taken together, these findings suggest that DHHC5-mediated palmitoylation of Cdc42 represents an important mechanism for the regulation of Cdc42 functions in hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W4281250115,"Dense connective tissue healing, such as tendon, is protracted leading to highly variable and unsatisfactory patient outcomes. Biomarkers prognostic of long-term clinical outcomes is, however, unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the proteomic profile of healing, identify potential biomarkers, and assess their association with the patient's long-term outcomes after ATR. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated 1423 proteins in healing and contralateral healthy Achilles tendons of 28 ATR patients. Comparing healing at 2 weeks and healthy protein profiles, we identified 821 overlapping, 390 upregulated, and 17 downregulated proteins. Upregulated proteins are related mainly to extracellular matrix organization and metabolism, while downregulated pathways were associated with exocytosis in immune modulation and thrombosis formation. Further proteomic profiling in relation to validated patient outcomes revealed the downregulated pro-inflammatory complement factor D (CFD) as the most reliable predictive biomarker of successful tendon healing. Our finding showed a comprehensive proteomic landscape and bioinformatics on human connective tissue, indicating subtype-specific and shared biological processes and proteins in healing and healthy Achilles tendons, as well as in tendons related to good and poor patient outcomes. Inflammatory protein CFD and serpin family B member 1 were finally identified as potential predictive biomarkers of effective healing outcomes when combined the proteomic profiles with a validated clinical database. Following the future elucidation of the mechanisms associated with the identified biomarkers as predictors of good outcomes, our findings could lead to improved prognostic accuracy and development of targeted treatments, thus improving the long-term healing outcomes for all patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281288514,"Inter-personal violence (whether intra- or inter-group) is a pervasive yet highly variable human behavior. Evolutionary anthropologists suggest that the abundance and distribution of resources play an important role in influencing differences in rates of violence, with implications for how resource conditions structure adaptive payoffs. Here, we assess whether differences in large-scale ecological conditions explain variability in levels of inter-personal human violence. Model results reveal a significant relationship between resource conditions and violence that is mediated by subsistence economy. Specifically, we find that interpersonal violence is highest: (1) among foragers and mixed forager/farmers (horticulturalists) in productive, homogeneous environments, and (2) among agriculturalists in unproductive, heterogeneous environments. We argue that the trend reversal between foragers and agriculturalists represents differing competitive pathways to enhanced reproductive success. These alternative pathways may be driven by features of subsistence (i.e., surplus, storage, mobility, privatization), in which foragers use violence to directly acquire fitness-linked social payoffs (i.e., status, mating opportunities, alliances), and agriculturalists use violence to acquire material resources that can be transformed into social payoffs. We suggest that as societies transition from immediate return economies (e.g., foragers) to delayed return economies (e.g., agriculturalists) material resources become an increasingly important adaptive payoff for inter-personal, especially inter-group, violence."
https://openalex.org/W4285741414,"Background The purpose of the study was to characterize changes in waitlist and post-transplant outcomes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients bridged to heart transplantation under the 2018 adult heart allocation policy. Methods All adult patients listed for isolated heart transplantation from August 2016 to December 2020 were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Patients were stratified into Eras (Era 1 and Era 2) centered around the policy change on October 18, 2018. Competing risk regression was used to evaluate waitlist death or deterioration across Eras. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between use of ECMO and 1-year post-transplant mortality within each Era. Results Of 8,902 heart transplants included in analysis, 339 (3.8%) were bridged with ECMO (Era 2: 6.1% vs Era 1: 1.2%, P&lt;0.001). Patients bridged with ECMO in Era 2 were less frequently female (26.0% vs 42.0%, P = 0.02) and experienced shorter waitlist times (5 vs 11 days, P&lt;0.001) along with a lower likelihood of waitlist death or deterioration (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.45, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.30–0.68, P&lt;0.001) compared to those in Era 1. Use of ECMO was associated with increased post-transplant mortality at 1-year compared to all other transplants in Era 1 (hazard ratio 3.78, 95% CI 1.88–7.61, P &lt; 0.001) but not Era 2. Conclusions Patients bridged with ECMO in Era 2 experience improved waitlist and post-transplant outcomes compared to Era 1, giving credence to the increased use of ECMO under the new allocation policy."

Yet, no studies, to date, have qualitatively examined students' experiences with this resource.To explore college students' perspectives on barriers to using an on-campus food pantry and provide insights into student-suggested solutions.In this qualitative study, 41 college students were recruited from a large public university in the southeastern US with a campus food pantry. Students participated in one-on-one, in-person, semi-structured interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, managed using NVivo 12, and analyzed using inductive, semantic thematic analysis.Most students were classified as food insecure (n = 33, 82.5%), and two-thirds identified as pantry users (at least once). The students' reasons for not using the food pantry indicated resistance and access barriers. Students either 'chose not to use' the campus food pantry due to (i) stigma and shame, (ii) perceived insufficient need, (iii) and unsuitable food or they experienced 'barriers' due to (i) lack of knowledge and (ii) limited food access. The main reason reported by food insecure non-pantry users was feelings of stigma and shame while that of food insecure pantry users was limited food access. Students suggested three solutions to minimize barriers experienced when utilizing the campus food pantry. These included (i) spreading awareness about the pantry through positive marketing messages that de-stigmatize use, (ii) improving accessibility of fresh produce and protein options, and (iii) improving access through satellite locations and online ordering systems.These barriers need to be systematically addressed to normalize food pantry use. Consideration of student recommendations by university program developers and policymakers may be of added value to expand access to food by college students with food insecurity."
https://openalex.org/W4281293303,"In this paper we examine men’s insights on how migration and minework affect their perceptions and performances of masculinity in the settings of minework and in their “real home” communities and explore the potential consequences of masculinity constructions for their own and their family’s health. This study used qualitative methodology. Findings are based on 13 in-depth interviews conducted over two phases of data collection with adult men who were either working or seeking work in the mines in North-West province, South Africa. Data suggest that for these men, migration to and working in the mines meant they must straddle the temporal space of work and the rural home space. For these men, the role of provider was an inescapable demand and, resulting from migration for work, their experience of fatherhood was solely centred on material provision with little or no emotional involvement with their children. Findings further illustrate the impact of minework on men’s health and livelihoods-resulting in some men reimagining and seeking to create alternative career paths for their children. There is pressing need for labour reforms on the employment conditions of low-paid mine workers to enable them to reinforce their livelihoods and secure better futures for their families. Gender-transformative interventions which aim to transform ideas of masculinity that emphasize providing rather than emotional involvement with children are also needed."

TrmK is essential for Staphylococcus aureus survival during infection but has no homolog in mammals, making it a promising target for antibiotic development. Here, we characterize the structure and function of S. aureus TrmK (SaTrmK) using X-ray crystallography, binding assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. We report crystal structures for the SaTrmK apoenzyme as well as in complexes with methyl donor SAM and co-product product SAH. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that SAM binds to the enzyme with favorable but modest enthalpic and entropic contributions, whereas SAH binding leads to an entropic penalty compensated for by a large favorable enthalpic contribution. Molecular dynamics simulations point to specific motions of the C-terminal domain being altered by SAM binding, which might have implications for tRNA recruitment. In addition, activity assays for SaTrmK-catalyzed methylation of A22 mutants of tRNALeu demonstrate that the adenine at position 22 is absolutely essential. In silico screening of compounds suggested the multifunctional organic toxin plumbagin as a potential inhibitor of TrmK, which was confirmed by activity measurements. Furthermore, LC-MS data indicated the protein was covalently modified by one equivalent of the inhibitor, and proteolytic digestion coupled with LC-MS identified Cys92 in the vicinity of the SAM-binding site as the sole residue modified.

The enzyme belongs to the class-I methyltransferase family comprised of an N-terminal domain with a Rossmann-like fold for SAM binding and a C-terminal domain with a novel 4-helix fold (7Ta H.M.

The latter is analogous to the tRNA-interacting C-terminal domain of the archaeal m1G37-tRNA methyltransferase Trm5 (8Goto-Ito S. Ito T. Kuratani M. Bessho Y. Yokoyama S.

Importantly, disruption of the TrmK-encoding gene prevents S. aureus survival not only in rich media but during infection of the bloodstream, vitreous fluid, and cutaneous abscesses in mice (10Valentino M.D. Foulston L.

Moreover, the TrmK-encoding gene is expressed almost constitutively in cell models of infection (14Mäder U. Nicolas P. Depke M. Pané-Farré J.

Dis. 2014; 209: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Crucially, TrmK has no homolog in mammals (6Roovers M. Kaminska K.H. Tkaczuk K.L. Gigot D. Droogmans L. Bujnicki J.M. The YqfN protein of Bacillus subtilis is the tRNA: m1A22 methyltransferase (TrmK).Nucl. Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3252-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), making TrmK a promising target for the development of novel antibiotics against S. aureus. This bacterium is a leading cause of healthcare-associated and community-associated infections worldwide, with many patients infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). MRSA encompasses strains resistant to most antibiotics in clinical use (17Peacock S.J. Paterson G.K. Mechanisms of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 577-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In Europe, MRSA infections are responsible for an average of 7000 deaths a year, the second highest among all drug-resistant bacterial infections (18Cassini A. Högberg L.D. Plachouras D. Quattrocchi A. Hoxha A. Simonsen G.S. et al.Attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years caused by infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and the European economic area in 2015: a population-level modelling analysis.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2019; 19: 56-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar), and in the USA, more deaths occur due to MRSA infection than to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined (19Boucher H.W. Corey G.R. Epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2008; 46: S344-S349Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The World Health Organization ranked MRSA as a high priority in its list of bacteria against which novel antibiotics are urgently needed (20Tacconelli E. Carrara E. Savoldi A. Harbarth S. Mendelson M. Monnet D.L. et al.Discovery, research, and development of new antibiotics: the WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and tuberculosis.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2018; 18: 318-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have cloned and expressed the gene encoding S. aureus TrmK (SaTrmK), purified the recombinant protein, and used X-ray crystallography to obtain high-resolution structures of the enzyme. We employed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to characterize cofactor binding and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess differences in flexibility upon ligand binding. We used a luminescence-based SAH-detection assay and LC-MS to uncover the determinants of SaTrmK activity toward tRNA and small RNA hairpins. Finally, we carried out in-silico screening of compounds and identified a site on SaTrmK amenable to covalent inhibition. SaTrmK was successfully purified to homogeneity with no other bands visible on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel following SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1). A typical yield was 100 mg of SaTrmK per liter of culture. The molecular mass of the protein was confirmed by electrospray-ionization (ESI)/TOF-MS to be 25,564.5 (Fig. S2), in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 25,565.3. DSF assays yielded, upon data fitting to Equation 2, a melting temperature (Tm) of 40.3 ± 0.1 °C, which increased modestly to 41.4 ± 0.1 °C and more significantly to 45.9 ± 0.1 °C in the presence of SAH and SAM, respectively (Fig. S3). These values suggest SAH binding has little effect on enzyme thermostability. SAM, however, can thermally stabilize the protein upon binding. The SaTrmK elution profile from an analytical gel-filtration column revealed a major peak at 16 ml (MW of ∼23 kDa) and a minor peak at 14.4 ml (MW of ∼50 kDa) (Fig. S4). This profile indicates most of the protein is monomeric, while a minor fraction is dimeric. To shed light on the structural basis for cofactor binding and help inform future structure-based inhibitor design, crystals of SaTrmK apoenzyme, and the binary complexes SaTrmK:SAM and SaTrmK:SAH were obtained, and data were collected to a resolution of 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 Å, respectively (Table S1). The 2mFo − DFc map showed electron density for SAM and SAH in the respective structures (Fig. 2). SaTrmK is typical of class-I methyltransferases, with an N-terminal domain where the cofactor binds and methyl transfer takes place and a C-terminal domain likely involved in tRNA recognition (8Goto-Ito S. Ito T. Kuratani M. Bessho Y. Yokoyama S. Tertiary structure checkpoint at anticodon loop modification in tRNA functional maturation.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Superposition of the three structures (Fig. S5) revealed negligible effect of cofactor binding on Cα root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs), whose values were 0.15, 0.18, and 0.08 Å between SaTrmK and SaTrmK:SAM, SaTrmK and SaTrmK:SAH, and SaTrmK:SAM and SaTrmK:SAH, respectively. The SaTrmK apoenzyme structure superposes with the apoenzyme structures of B. subtilis TrmK (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 6Q56) (9Degut C. Roovers M. Barraud P. Brachet F. Feller A. Larue V. et al.Structural characterization of B. subtilis m1A22 tRNA methyltransferase TrmK: insights into tRNA recognition.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 4736-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and S. pneumoniae TrmK (PDB entry 3KR9) (7Ta H.M. Kim K.K. Crystal structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae Sp1610, a putative tRNA methyltransferase, in complex with S-adenosyl-L-methionine.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), with which it shares, respectively, 44% and 42% amino acid sequence identity, with Cα RMSDs of 0.68 and 0.98 Å, respectively, with the most ostensible differences located in the coiled-coil motif of the C-terminal domain (Fig. S6). The electron density data for the SaTrmK apoenzyme showed clearly defined density near the active site that could not be fitted with any of the small molecules involved in purification or crystallization of the enzyme, suggesting it was carried through with SaTrmK from protein expression. Intriguingly, citrate could be fitted perfectly into the electron density, making polar contacts with the side chains of His27, Tyr29, and Asn59 (Fig. S7A). It is possible the negatively charged groups of citrate are mimicking the phosphate group(s) of tRNA. DSF analysis indicated that citrate leads to an overall modest decrease in SaTrmK Tm (Fig. S7B) that only becomes noticeable at high citrate concentrations, which is incompatible with the presumed tight binding required for the interaction to continue from protein expression to crystallization. Therefore, the significance of this observation, if any, is still elusive. Interestingly, seven tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, including citrate, have been shown to regulate the catalytic activity of a nucleic acid–processing enzyme, yeast type-II topoisomerase (21Lee J.H. Mosher E.P. Lee Y.S. Bumpus N.N. Berger J.M. Control of topoisomerase II activity and chemotherapeutic inhibition by TCA cycle metabolites.Cell Chem. Biol. 2021; 29: 476-489.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The binding site for SAM is restricted to the N-terminal domain, and several polar and nonpolar interactions are made with residues via both main-chain and side-chain moieties to position the cofactor in the active site (Fig. 3A). SAM’s COO− group forms a salt bridge with the ω-NH2 and ωʹ-NH2 groups of Arg7, while its NH3+ group donates a hydrogen bond (H-bond) to the main chain CO– groups of Cys92 and Gly24 and to a water molecule (W1) which in turn H-bonds to Asp22. The 2ʹ-OH and 3ʹ-OH form H-bonds with another water molecule (W2) that itself H-bonds to Glu47 side chain COO− and Val48 main chain –NH. Adenine N1 and N6 atoms form H-bonds with Gly76 main chain –NH and Asp75 side chain COO−, respectively. Furthermore, the adenine plane is flanked on both sides by hydrophobic interactions with Met94, Leu98, Ile102, and Val48. A superposition of the active sites of SaTrmK, SaTrmK:SAM, and SaTrmK:SAH (Fig. 3B) shows there is local motion of some residues in order to accommodate the cofactor. In the region of the active site which binds the adenine moiety of SAM, the side chain of Glu47 moves slightly from its position in the apoenzyme but retains the same orientation. Interestingly, water molecule W2 is only observed in the structures when SAM and SAH are bound. Val48 moves ∼1 Å and rotates approximately 120° enabling both methyl groups to face away from SAM, and Asp75 also moves ∼1 Å and rotates slightly. Their position in the apoenzyme would have caused a steric clash with SAM. Asp26, which is in the vicinity of the SAM binding site but does not interact with the cofactor, moves significantly upon cofactor binding from its position in the apoenzyme (Fig. S8). In order to confirm binary complex formation in solution as observed in crystallo and gain insight into cofactor binding equilibrium thermodynamics, SAM and SAH binding to SaTrmK were determined by ITC (Fig. 4). The binding isotherms were best fitted to a single-site binding model with 1:1 (protein:ligand) stoichiometry. Binding of SAM to SaTrmK yielded a KD of 39 ± 4 μM, while binding of SAH resulted in a KD of 0.94 ± 0.05 μM. The Gibbs free energies (ΔG) were −5.92 ± 0.07 and −8.09 ± 0.03 kcal/mol for SAM and SAH binding to SaTrmK, respectively, with SAH binding favored by 2.17 ± 0.08 kcal/mol. Interestingly, while binding of both SAM and SAH are exothermic, they are driven by distinct thermodynamic functions. The SaTrmK:SAM complex is stabilized by modest but favorable enthalpic and entropic contributions, with ΔH of −3.46 ± 0.08 kcal/mol and TΔS of 2.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the SaTrmK:SAH complex formation is enthalpically driven, with ΔH of −12.8 ± 0.2 kcal/mol which pays for an entropic penalty on binary complex formation, given a TΔS of −4.7 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. To gain insight into the dynamics of SaTrmK, MD simulations were carried out over 500 ns using the crystal structures as starting points (Fig. 5). The distance of the salt bridge between Arg7 and either SAM or SAH confirmed the ligands did not dissociate from the protein over the course of the simulations but showed that the salt bridge with SAM oscillated more in comparison with SAH (Fig. 5A). Time-dependent Cα RMSDs indicated only minor oscillations for the three structures (Fig. 5B), and the overall root-mean-square fluctuations were remarkably similar, with the most flexible region comprising the C-terminal domain (Fig. 5C). Moreover, correlated motions between protein domains are similar among the three structures (Fig. S9). In order to uncover dominant motions of SaTrmK, principal component analysis was carried out, and the first three eigenvectors were isolated (Fig. 5D). This analysis revealed that the first two eigenvectors are dominated by specific motions of the C-terminal domain, but SAM binding is accompanied by a swap in the specific trajectories contributing to the highest root-mean-square fluctuations, as compared with SaTrmK apoenzyme and SaTrmK:SAH binary complex (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, the third eigenvector suggests that SAM and SAH binding reduces the amplitude of specific motions in the N-terminal domain, most notably those around residues implicated in cofactor binding, while increasing specific motions in the C-terminal domain, as compared with the apoenzyme (Fig. 5, D and E). Molecular electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated for the three structures throughout the simulations, and snapshots were taken every 125 ns (Fig. S10). While the cofactor binding pocket is consistently dominated by negative charges in all structures, positive charges outside this pocket undergo some redistribution throughout the trajectories, influenced by the presence or absence of SAM or SAH. The MTase-Glo methyltransferase assay, which detects luminescence generated in a luciferase-coupled reaction driven by ATP, which in turn is synthesized enzymatically from the SAH produced in the methyltransferase reaction (22Hsiao K. Zegzouti H. Goueli S.A. Methyltransferase-glo: a universal, bioluminescent and homogenous assay for monitoring all classes of methyltransferases.Epigenomics. 2016; 8: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was used to quantify the methylation of S. aureus tRNALeu as catalyzed by SaTrmK. This is a robust and sensitive assay used to characterize RNA methyltransferase activity (23Yu D. Kaur G. Blumenthal R.M. Zhang X. Cheng X. Enzymatic characterization of three human RNA adenosine methyltransferases reveals diverse substrate affinities and reaction optima.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and to screen tRNA methyltransferase inhibitors (24Zhong W. Koay A. Ngo A. Li Y. Nah Q. Wong Y.H. et al.Targeting the bacterial epitranscriptome for antibiotic development: discovery of novel tRNA-(N(1)G37) methyltransferase (TrmD) inhibitors.ACS Infect. Dis. 2019; 5: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as it has been shown to result in lower false-positive rates than other methods (25Dong G. Yasgar A. Peterson D.L. Zakharov A. Talley D. Cheng K.C. et al.Optimization of high-throughput methyltransferase assays for the discovery of small molecule inhibitors.ACS Comb. Sci. 2020; 22: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the absence of tRNA, SaTrmK contributes no background luminescence, as expected since the enzyme is not purified bound to SAH. This is evidenced by the crystal structure of the apoenzyme and no SAH detected by LC-MS after denaturation of SaTrmK which would have released any bound SAH (Fig. S11). Background luminescence possibly originating from contaminating ATP in the RNA samples was drastically diminished by dialysis of both tRNA and small RNA hairpins prior to use, and any residual background luminescence was subtracted from the reactions via controls lacking RNA. An SAH standard curve (Fig. S12) was used for quantification of the methylation reaction. Activity of SaTrmK was detected when tRNALeu, which contains an adenine at position 22, was used as substrate, but no SAH formation could be detected when either A22C-tRNALeu, A22U-tRNALeu, or A22G-tRNALeu was tested as substrate (Fig. 6A), suggesting methylation is conditional on an adenine at position 22. Furthermore, SAH production was linearly dependent on SaTrmK concentration with tRNALeu as substrate (Fig. 6A, inset). To validate the assay further for detection of SaTrmK enzymatic activity, SAH production was measured in the presence and absence of sinefungin, a SAM analog that is a pan-methyltransferase inhibitor (26Benoni R. Krafcikova P. Baranowski M.R. Kowalska J. Boura E. Cahová H. Substrate specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10-Nsp16 methyltransferase.Viruses. 2021; 13: 1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Sinefungin (10 μM) led to ∼98% inhibition of SAH production (Fig. 6B). In the absence of SaTrmK, sinefungin had no effect on luminescence generated by the addition of SAH to the assay (Fig. S13), pointing to sinefungin preventing SAH production by inhibiting SaTrmK. When the tRNALeu was hydrolyzed to nucleoside 5ʹ-monophosphates by nuclease P1 following the methylation reaction and subjected to LC-MS analysis, ions with the same mass/charge (m/z) and retention time as those for the N1-methyl-AMP standard were detected (Fig. 6C). However, no such signal was detected when either SaTrmK was omitted from the methylation reaction or A22C-tRNA was used instead of tRNALeu (Fig. 6C). This is in strict accordance with TrmK producing m1A22-tRNA (6Roovers M. Kaminska K.H. Tkaczuk K.L. Gigot D. Droogmans L. Bujnicki J.M. The YqfN protein of Bacillus subtilis is the tRNA: m1A22 methyltransferase (TrmK).Nucl. Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3252-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, by directly detecting the methylated adenine, the LC-MS–based assay provided orthogonal validation of the MTase-Glo Methyltransferase Assay for detection of SaTrmK activity. B. subtilis TrmK has been reported to require a full-length tRNA for activity, since no methyl transfer was detected when smaller RNAs were tested as substrate (9Degut C. Roovers M. Barraud P. Brachet F. Feller A. Larue V. et al.Structural characterization of B. subtilis m1A22 tRNA methyltransferase TrmK: insights into tRNA recognition.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 4736-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To confirm the same was true for SaTrmK, an RNA18mer, predicted to form a hairpin similar to the D-arm of tRNA but with only four nucleotides in the loop and containing adenine at three positions (Fig. 7A), was designed and tested as a substrate of the enzyme. Surprisingly, SaTrmK accepted this RNA18mer as a substrate (Fig. A). Catalytic activity increased to a level approaching that detected with tRNALeu (Fig. 6A) when A10G-RNA18mer replaced the original RNA18mer (referred to as WT-RNA18mer), but it was undetectable with either A11G-RNA18mer or U5C/A14G-RNA18mer as the substrate (Fig. 7A). This suggests that A10G-RNA18mer can be efficiently methylated by SaTrmK, pointing to a novel property of this enzyme. The lack of methylation activity toward U5C/A14G-RNA18mer was puzzling since A14 should be in a Watson–Crick pair with U5 in the WT-RNA18mer, making its N1 unavailable as a nucleophile for the methyl-transfer reaction, and A11 would be the only expected methylation site in the A10G-RNA18mer. Hence it is possible the C5 and G14 substitution caused a decrease in affinity for SaTrmK and/or reduction of A11 methylation efficiency. To probe the limits of RNA18mer methylation further, a second-generation RNA18mer was synthesized which contained G5, C14, and only one adenine, at position 11 (A11-RNA18mer). At higher concentrations of RNA and SaTrmK than previously used, significant methylation of A11-RNA18mer was detected (Fig. 7B). To confirm SAH formation was indeed a result of SaTrmK-catalyzed methylation of A11 in A11-RNA18mer and not an unforeseen artefact of the higher substrate and enzyme concentrations, a no-adenine (0A-RNA18mer) counterpart to A11-RNA18mer harboring an A11G substitution was tested as a substrate for SaTrmK under the same conditions as A11-RNA18mer, and no activity was detected (Fig. 7B). Again, orthogonal evidence for methylation of A11-RNA18mer was obtained when A11-RNA18mer was hydrolyzed to nucleoside 5ʹ-monophosphates by nuclease P1 following the methylation reaction and subsequently subjected to LC-MS analysis. Ions were detected with the exact m/z (362.086) expected for N1-methyl-AMP. However, no such signal was detected in a control sample where SaTrmK was omitted from the methylation reaction. A small peak rising slightly above the noise level was detected in the control with the same retention time as the presumed N1-methyl-AMP peak from the reaction sample, but with an m/z = 364.125 that does not correspond to N1-methyl-AMP (Fig. 7C). In order to identify potential inhibitors of SaTrmK, in-silico screening of compounds based on molecular docking was carried out against the SaTrmK:SAM binary complex structure. This complex was chosen to increase the stringency of the screening against compounds that would compete with SAM for the cofactor-binding site, in an attempt to discover potentially novel druggable pockets in SaTrmK while increasing selectivity against the myriad other SAM-dependent methyltransferases in humans. The top hits from the screening were tested as inhibitors of SaTrmK, however, all but one, plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphtoquinone), significantly interfered with the activity assay itself and were discarded. Plumbagin docked to a pocket adjacent to the SAM-binding site, making nonpolar contacts with Ile20 and Leu30 and polar interactions with Asp22 and Asp26 (Fig. 8A). Plumbagin (5 μM) led to ∼93% inhibition of SaTrmK-catalyzed methylation of tRNALeu (Fig. 8B). In the absence of SaTrmK, plumbagin had a negligible effect (∼6% decrease) on luminescence generated by the addition of SAH to the assay (Fig. S14). Plumbagin is"

SmiA of Bacillus subtilis was identified as the first adaptor protein for the Lon family of proteases, but the mechanism of SmiA-dependent proteolysis is unknown. Here, we develop a fluorescence-based assay to measure the kinetics of SmiA-dependent degradation of its client SwrA and show that SmiA-SwrA interaction and the SwrA degron were both necessary, but not sufficient, for proteolysis. Consistent with a scaffolding adaptor mechanism, we found that stoichiometric excess of SmiA caused substrate-independent inhibition of LonA-dependent turnover. Furthermore, SmiA was strictly required even when SwrA levels were high suggesting that a local increase in substrate concentration mediated by the scaffold was not sufficient for proteolysis. Moreover, SmiA function could not be substituted by thermal denaturation of the substrate, consistent with a priming adaptor mechanism. Taken together, we conclude that SmiA functions via a mechanism that is a hybrid between scaffolding and priming models."
https://openalex.org/W4280527256,"Thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) are small protein motifs containing six conserved cysteines forming three disulfide bonds that can be modified with an O-linked fucose. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) catalyzes the addition of O-fucose to TSRs containing the appropriate consensus sequence, and the O-fucose modification can be elongated to a Glucose-Fucose disaccharide with the addition of glucose by β3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). Elimination of Pofut2 in mice results in embryonic lethality in mice, highlighting the biological significance of O-fucose modification on TSRs. Knockout of POFUT2 in HEK293T cells has been shown to cause complete or partial loss of secretion of many proteins containing O-fucosylated TSRs. In addition, POFUT2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and only modifies folded TSRs, stabilizing their structures. These observations suggest that POFUT2 is involved in an ER quality control mechanism for TSR folding and that B3GLCT also participates in quality control by providing additional stabilization to TSRs. However, the mechanisms by which addition of these sugars result in stabilization are poorly understood. Here, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and provide crystallographic and NMR evidence that the Glucose-Fucose disaccharide interacts with specific amino acids in the TSR3 domain in thrombospondin-1 that are within proximity to the O-fucosylation modification site resulting in protection of a nearby disulfide bond. We also show that mutation of these amino acids reduces the stabilizing effect of the sugars in vitro. These data provide mechanistic details regarding the importance of O-fucosylation and how it participates in quality control mechanisms inside the ER."
https://openalex.org/W4280538736,"Ribosome speed is dictated by multiple factors including substrate availability, cellular conditions, and product (peptide) formation. Translation slows during the synthesis of cationic peptide sequences, potentially influencing the expression of thousands of proteins. Available evidence suggests that ionic interactions between positively charged nascent peptides and the negatively charged ribosome exit tunnel impede translation. However, this hypothesis was difficult to test directly because of inability to decouple the contributions of amino acid charge from mRNA sequence and tRNA identity/abundance in cells. Furthermore, it is unclear if other components of the translation system central to ribosome function (e.g., RNA modification) influence the speed and accuracy of positively charged peptide synthesis. In this study, we used a fully reconstituted Escherichia coli translation system to evaluate the effects of peptide charge, mRNA sequence, and RNA modification status on the translation of lysine-rich peptides. Comparison of translation reactions on poly(lysine)-encoding mRNAs conducted with either Lys-tRNALys or Val-tRNALys reveals that that amino acid charge, while important, only partially accounts for slowed translation on these transcripts. We further find that in addition to peptide charge, mRNA sequence and both tRNA and mRNA modification status influence the rates of amino acid addition and the ribosome’s ability to maintain frame (instead of entering the −2, −1, and +1 frames) during poly(lysine) peptide synthesis. Our observations lead us to expand the model for explaining how the ribosome slows during poly(lysine) peptide synthesis and suggest that posttranscriptional RNA modifications can provide cells a mechanism to precisely control ribosome movements along an mRNA.

In this study, we used a fully reconstituted Escherichia coli translation system to evaluate the effects of peptide charge, mRNA sequence, and RNA modification status on the translation of lysine-rich peptides. Comparison of translation reactions on poly(lysine)-encoding mRNAs conducted with either Lys-tRNALys or Val-tRNALys reveals that that amino acid charge, while important, only partially accounts for slowed translation on these transcripts. We further find that in addition to peptide charge, mRNA sequence and both tRNA and mRNA modification status influence the rates of amino acid addition and the ribosome’s ability to maintain frame (instead of entering the −2, −1, and +1 frames) during poly(lysine) peptide synthesis. Our observations lead us to expand the model for explaining how the ribosome slows during poly(lysine) peptide synthesis and suggest that posttranscriptional RNA modifications can provide cells a mechanism to precisely control ribosome movements along an mRNA. Translation of the nucleic acid code into protein is catalyzed by the ribosome. During this process, ribosomes use mRNAs as molecular maps to direct the programmed assembly of amino acids into polypeptides. In Escherichia coli growing polypeptide chains are extended by an average of 4 to 22 amino acids per second, though the rate of individual amino acid incorporation by the ribosome is not always uniform (1Wohlgemuth I.

Slowing bacterial translation speed enhances eukaryotic protein folding efficiency.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity in peptide elongation rates is caused by a number of factors, including substrate (e.g., mRNA, aminoacyl-tRNAs [aatRNAs], translation factors) availability and modification status, and the formation of stable interactions between the growing polypeptide chain and the ribosome machinery (4Qian W.

Although translation initiation rates are responsible for controlling the rate of protein expression in many circumstances, situations that alter polypeptide elongation rates can change protein levels, protein folding, and mRNA stability to ultimately impact cellular health and fitness (6Jacobs W.M.

Contacts between the ribosome and its nascent peptide products are receiving growing recognition for their role in translationally controlling protein expression (9Choi J. Grosely R. Prabhakar A. Lapointe C.P. Wang J. Puglisi J.D. How mRNA and nascent chain sequences regulate translation elongation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 421-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interactions involving the ribosome and positively charged peptides present a classic example of this phenomenon. There is overwhelming evidence that translating the cationic peptide sequences commonly present in proteins slows the ribosome (10Lu J. Deutsch C. Electrostatics in the ribosomal tunnel modulate chain elongation rates.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 11Brandman O. Stewart-Ornstein J. Wong D. Larson A.

In humans, there are over 60,000 examples of proteins containing four or more consecutive basic amino acids, suggesting that the synthesis of positively charged peptides contributes to the posttranscriptional control of a significant fraction of the proteome (Tables S1 and S2). The observation that ribosomes slow while linking iterated positively charged amino acids has long been attributed to the formation of strong ionic interactions between cationic peptides and the anionic ribosome peptide exit channel (12Charneski C.A. Hurst L.D. Positively charged residues are the major determinants of ribosomal velocity.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11e1001508Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, several recent reports demonstrate that the ribosome produces different amounts of protein from mRNAs possessing synonymous codons that encode identical positively charged poly(lysine) and poly(arginine) peptides (13Koutmou K.S. Schuller A.P. Brunelle J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Djuranovic S. Green R. Ribosomes slide on lysine-encoding homopolymeric A stretches.Elife. 2015; 4e05534Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Arthur L.L. Pavlovic-Djuranovic S. Koutmou K.S. Green R. Szczesny P.

Zubay G. Effects of consecutive AGG codons on translation in Escherichia coli, demonstrated with a versatile codon test system.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 716-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ionic interactions alone cannot explain these findings, suggesting that additional factors in the translation system also contribute to modulating ribosome speed during the synthesis of cationic peptides. Multiple codons instruct the ribosome to add the positively charged amino acids lysine (AAA and AAG) and arginine (AGA, AGG, and CGN [N=U, C, A,G]). The ability of individual arginine codons to differentially impact protein expression largely depends on the availability of tRNA isoacceptors possessing appropriate anticodon sequences. Some isoacceptors are less abundant, and translation along mRNA sequences containing multiple codons corresponding to these rare tRNAs can slow sufficiently to trigger cellular mechanisms that rescue stalled ribosomes (16Sørensen M.A. Kurland C.G. Pedersen S. Codon usage determines translation rate in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 17Liu Y. Yang Q. Zhao F. Synonymous but not silent: the codon usage code for gene expression and protein folding.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2021; 90: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cause of differential protein expression from the two lysine codons appears to differ from that of arginine codons. In the case of lysine, less protein is produced from mRNAs containing consecutive AAA codons than those with consecutive AAG codons in both eukaryotic and bacterial cells (13Koutmou K.S. Schuller A.P. Brunelle J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Djuranovic S. Green R.

Biol. 2014; 34: 4062-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, differences in substrate tRNA levels are unlikely to account for these codon-specific observations because AAA and AAG are decoded by a single tRNALys in at least one of the species (E. coli) where codon-dependent differences in poly(lysine) protein output have been observed. Furthermore, in addition to reducing the rate of protein synthesis, under some conditions the presence of two or more AAA codons in a row can promote an unusual ribosome movement termed “ribosome sliding” (13Koutmou K.S. Schuller A.P. Brunelle J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Djuranovic S. Green R. Ribosomes slide on lysine-encoding homopolymeric A stretches.Elife. 2015; 4e05534Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During sliding, the ribosome loses reading frame and shifts along an mRNA. The ribosome has been captured moving backward by 1 to 3 nucleotides while translating iterated AAA codons (13Koutmou K.S. Schuller A.P. Brunelle J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Djuranovic S. Green R. Ribosomes slide on lysine-encoding homopolymeric A stretches.Elife. 2015; 4e05534Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Arthur L.L. Pavlovic-Djuranovic S. Koutmou K.S. Green R. Szczesny P. Djuranovic S. Translational control by lysine-encoding A-rich sequences.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1e1500154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), changing the identity of the peptide being made. These movements activate cotranslational surveillance mechanisms that target the translated mRNA and resulting peptide products for degradation (18Ito-Harashima S. Kuroha K. Tatematsu T. Inada T. Translation of the poly(A) tail plays crucial roles in nonstop mRNA surveillance via translation repression and protein destabilization by proteasome in yeast.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ribosome sliding differs from other noncanonical ribosome movements, which place the ribosome at a single, discrete location on an mRNA and can produce stable products (20Agirrezabala X. Samatova E. Klimova M. Zamora M. Gil-Carton D. Rodnina M.V. et al.Ribosome rearrangements at the onset of translational bypassing.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3e1700147Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Dinman J.D. Mechanisms and implications of programmed translational frameshifting.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2012; 3: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).These data suggest that the influence of mRNA and tRNA sequences on the translation of poly(lysine) peptide regions warrant further examination. Here, we use a reconstituted E. coli translation system to deconvolute the contributions of peptide, mRNA sequence, and RNA (mRNA and tRNA) modification to both the speed of amino acid addition and ribosome frame maintenance during the translation of iterated lysine codons. We chose to investigate the role of RNA modifications in addition to peptide and mRNA sequence because these common chemical changes to nucleosides can alter the hydrogen-bonding interactions between tRNAs and mRNAs used by the ribosome to ensure the faithful and rapid translation of the genetic code into protein (22Jones J.D. Monroe J. Koutmou K.S. A molecular-level perspective on the frequency, distribution, and consequences of messenger RNA modifications.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2020; 11e1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our findings expand the biochemical framework for understanding the contributions of individual components of the translation system to ribosome stalling during cationic peptide synthesis. We demonstrate that in addition to peptide charge, mRNA sequence, along with mRNA and tRNA modification status, are important determinants of ribosome speed during poly(lysine) translation. Additionally, we developed a minimal kinetic mechanism for ribosome sliding on iterated AAA codons, in which the ribosome moves along an mRNA in the 3′ direction one nucleotide at a time, until it can bind an available cognate aatRNA and resume “normal” translation in a different frame. Much like ribosome speed, this series of one nucleotide ribosome movements is controlled not only by peptide charge but also by posttranscriptional modifications to tRNALys and mRNA (N6-methyladenosine [m6A]). While it has been known for decades that tRNA anticodon stem-loop modifications can influence ribosome movements, these data provide the first evidence that mRNA modifications also have the power to impact ribosome reading frame maintenance (23Ranjan N. Rodnina M.V. tRNA wobble modifications and protein homeostasis.Translation. 2016; 4e1143076Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our work presents a molecular level rationalization for how seemingly small changes in the translational machinery (e.g., synonymous codon substitution and single posttranscriptional modifications) can result in different protein production outcomes. There are multiple ways to envision how ribosome sliding on consecutive AAA codons could be achieved. For example, the ribosome might hop directly into the −1 and −3 frames, “scan” along an mRNA until it reaches a specific, desired frame, or make series of discrete one nucleotide frameshifts (13Koutmou K.S. Schuller A.P. Brunelle J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Djuranovic S. Green R.

Tinoco I. Ribosome excursions during mRNA translocation mediate broad branching of frameshift pathways.Cell. 2015; 160: 870-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We developed a kinetic framework to distinguish between these possibilities and describe how the ribosome moves during sliding using a fully reconstituted in vitro translation system (26Monroe J.G. Smith T.J. Koutmou K.S. Investigating the consequences of mRNA modifications on protein synthesis using in vitro translation assays.Methods Enzymol. 2021; 658: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, we first identified the reading frames the ribosome enters during translation along an mRNA with a AUG-AAA-AAA-UUC-UAA (MK2(AAA)FX; X=stop codon) coding sequence (Fig. 1A). In these assays, 70 nM of E. coli 70S ribosome initiation complexes (ICs) containing 35S-labeled formylmethionine-tRNAfMet bound to an AUG in the P site and an AAA codon in the A site were reacted with saturating concentrations of two ternary complexes (TCs, 10–30 μM; aatRNAaa⋅EF-Tu⋅GTP) formed with elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) as well as cognate Lys-tRNALys and individual aatRNAaa species capable of reacting in each of the reading frames that the ribosome could inhabit on our MK2(AAA)FX mRNA (−2 frame, Asn-tRNAAsn; −1 frame, Ile-tRNAIle; 0 frame, Phe-tRNAPhe; +1 frame, Ser-tRNASer; and +2 frame, Leu-tRNALeu) (Fig. 1A). These reactions were conducted in the presence of 0 to 12 μM of elongation factor G GTPase bound to GTP (EF-G⋅GTP) at 37 °C. The reactants (fMet), programmed peptides (MK, MK2, MK2F), and peptide products resulting from the ribosome sliding (MK2I, MK2N, MK2S, MK2L, MK3, and MK4+) were visualized by electrophoretic TLC (eTLC; Fig. 1B). In our assays, the ribosome generated products in five different reading frames (0, −1, −2, −3, and +1; Fig. 1, A–C). We find that movement of the ribosome into non-0 frames is EF-G dependent, much like canonical-1 frameshifting ribosome movements (Fig. S1) (24Tsai T.-W. Yang H. Yin H. Xu S. Wang Y.

Johansson M. Tsai A. O'Leary S.E. Puglisi J.D. Dynamic pathways of -1 translational frameshifting.Nature. 2014; 512: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After establishing which frames the ribosome inhabits during sliding, we measured the extent of amino acid incorporation in each of these frames at discrete time points (0–1200 s, Figs. 1C and S2). These data were used to develop a minimal kinetic mechanism for ribosome sliding by globally fitting our experimental observations with KinTek Explorer (KinTek Corporation; https://kintekexplorer.com/) (Fig. S2). We examined a series of possible mechanisms (Fig. S3) and selected the model that best fit our data to ascertain the rate constants for each step in the mechanism. Our fits indicate that the ribosome undergoes a series of progressive −1 nucleotide movements from the 0-frame into the −1, −2, and −3 frames during ribosome sliding (Figs. 2 and S4). The rate constants for amino acid addition in the −1, −2, and −3 frames are relatively uniform (k7 values range between 0.01–0.02 s−1) (Fig. 1D and Table 1). Furthermore, a subset of ribosomes (∼10%) appear unable to extend the growing polypeptide following each progressive −1 nucleotide ribosome movement (Figs. 1B and 2 (k5, k4:6,obs), Figs. S3 and S5B). While we do observe a small amount of product formation in the +1 frame, both the endpoint and rate constant for this reaction are diminished relative to the same values for the ribosome reacting in the −1, −2, and −3 frames (Fig. 1, C and D). These observations lead us to propose a model for ribosome sliding in which a small (<5% of ribosomes) can undergo a +1 frameshift, while most ribosomes move in the 3′ direction by one nucleotide a time until they enter a reading frame that can react with an available aatRNA species (Fig. 2).Table 1Rate constants for frameshift and amino acid addition during ribosome slidingFrameshift position0 frame−2 frame−1 frame+1 frame+2 frametRNA TCsLys + PheLys + AsnLys + IleLys + SerLys + LeuRate constants (s−1) k111.7 ± 0.0113.1 ± 0.0115.3 ± 0.812.7 ± 0.713.3 ± 0.7 k21.5 ± 0.0021.6 ± 0.0021.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.151.2 ± 0.3 k3-0.005 ± 0.00020.008 ± 0.00150.008 ± 0.0010.02 ± 0.004 k4:6,obs-0.006 ± 0.0020.003 ± 0.0010.007 ± 0.0030.002 ± 0.009 k5-0.0008 ± 0.000040.0007 ± 0.00030.002 ± 0.00050.017 ± 0.009 k70.9 ± 0.00070.01 ± 0.00090.02 ± 0.0060.002 ± 0.00070.0002 ± 0.0001 Open table in a new tab Native tRNAs possess posttranscriptional chemical modifications essential to their stability, structure, and function (30Lorenz C.

Since the tRNALys N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A37) and 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl2-thiouridine [mcm5S2U34] modifications in yeast tRNALys,UUU influence tRNA decoding, we speculated that analogous E. coli tRNALys modifications, such as 5-methylaminocarbonylmethyluridine (mnm5s2U34), might suppress ribosome sliding and enhance poly(lysine) translation (34Rezgui V.A.N.

To test this idea, we compared the rate constants for lysine addition during the translation of AUG-AAA-AAA-UUC-UAA [MK2(AAA)FX] and AUG-AAG-AAG-UUC-UAA [MK2(AAG)FX] messages using saturating levels (20–30 μM) of unmodified T7 transcribed Lys-tRNALys and natively modified Lys-tRNANLys purified from E. coli cells (Figs. 3A and S6). We find that the rate constants for programmed MK and MK2 peptide formation are twofold to fourfold faster when ribosome complexes are reacted with TCs containing modified Lys-tRNANLys than with unmodified Lys-tRNALys. These moderate enhancements in lysine addition rate constants are observed when either AAG or AAA containing mRNAs are translated (Table 2). The modifications have a larger role on frame maintenance than on programmed lysine addition; the rate constants for forming ribosome sliding products (MK3 and MK4+) on AAA codons are decreased by up to 25-fold when natively modified Lys-tRNANLys is used (Fig. 3B). Despite the slowed formation of these sliding products, the percentage of peptides that are eventually extended and generated sliding products is only slightly reduced by the inclusion of modifications on tRNALys (Lys-tRNALys = 60% ± 3% versus Lys-tRNANLys = 40% ± 6%) (Figs. 3, B and C and S6). Our data suggest that tRNANLys modifications likely limit the extent of ribosome sliding in cells.Table 2Rate constants for lysine addition during ribosome slidingmRNA constructMK2(AAA)FXMK2(AAG)FXtRNA TCsLys-tRNALysLys-tRNANLysLys-tRNALysLys-tRNANLysRate constants (s−1) k110.2 ± 0.328.9 ± 1.92.7 ± 0.512.7 ± 0.4 k21.2 ± 0.44.8 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.74.4 ± 0.3 k30.02 ± 0.0040.0008 ± 0.0000080.006 ± 0.0020.002 ± 0.001 k4 (or k4,obs)0.007 ± 0.0010.07 ± 0.020.0004 ± 0.00010.00009 ± 0.00002 k50.01 ± 0.0080.0001 ± 0.000050.001 ± 0.00010.001 ± 0.0002 k60.006 ± 0.0020.02 ± 0.007-- Open table in a new tab Regardless of tRNALys modification status, we observed that after the first lysine is added into a peptide, the rate constants for adding subsequent lysines on AAA codons are reduced (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). This is consistent with a large body of evidence from cellular reporter and ribosome profiling studies indicating that the translation of iterated positive charges slows the ribosome (36Ahmed N. Friedrich U.A. Sormanni P. Ciryam P. Altman N.S. Bukau B. et al.Pairs of amino acids at the P- and A-sites of the ribosome predictably and causally modulate translation-elongation rates.J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432: 166696Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, the observation that different poly(lysine) encoding mRNA sequences differentially impact translation leads us to wonder if mRNA sequence, and therefore also structure, contribute to ribosome slowing and during poly(lysine) translation (13Koutmou K.S. Schuller A.P. Brunelle J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Djuranovic S. Green R.

Djuranovic S. Translational control by lysine-encoding A-rich sequences.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1e1500154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To deconvolute the effects of peptide charge from mRNA sequence, we mischarged unmodified tRNALys and natively modified tRNANLys sequences with the small nonpolar amino acid valine (Val-tRNALys, Val-tRNANLys) (Fig. 4A) . Misacylation was accomplished using a small RNA microhelix (flexizyme) capable of attaching an esterified aminoacid acyl donor to virtually any tRNA of interest (37Goto Y. Katoh T. Suga H. Flexizymes for genetic code reprogramming.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ICs containing mRNAs encoding consecutive lysines (AUG-AAA-AAA-UUC-UAA and AUG-AAG-AAG-UUC-UAA) were reacted with TCs possessing mischarged tRNAs (Val-tRNALys⋅EF-Tu⋅GTP, Val-tRNANLys⋅EF-Tu⋅GTP). Because the translation factor EF-Tu selects for correct tRNA and aminoacyl donor pairings, we titrated EF-Tu with each aatRNA to ensure saturating conditions for incorporating these species (Fig. S7) (38Dale T. Sanderson L.E. Uhlenbeck O.C.

Concurrent control assays with TCs containing Val-tRNAVal and ICs formed on an mRNA encoding consecutive valines (AUG-GUG-GUG-UUC-UAA) were also performed. The rate constants for Met-Val dipeptide and tripeptide, MV and MV2, formation are three-fold and five-fold slower (respectively) on AUG-AAA-AAA-UUC-UAA [MK2(AAA)FX] mRNA than AUG-GUG-GUG-UUC-UAA GUG [MV2FX] mRNA regardless of the modification status of tRNALys (Fig. 4C and Table S3). In contrast, the rate constants for synthesizing MV and MV2 on AUG-AAG-AAG-UUC-UAA [MK2(AAG)FX] mRNA are reduced by less than two-fold relative to (MV2FX) mRNA when modified Val-tRNANLys is included in the translation reaction. However, when unmodified Val-tRNALys is used instead, the ability of the ribosome to add Val to a growing polypeptide on an AAG codon is dramatically slowed, and the rate constants for MV and MV2 synthesis are diminished by >1000-fold (Fig. S8 and Table S3).

https://openalex.org/W4280639566,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (eIF3a), the largest subunit of the eIF3 complex, has been shown to be overexpressed in malignant cancer cells, potentially making it a proto-oncogene. eIF3a overexpression can drive cancer cell proliferation but contributes to better prognosis. While its contribution to prognosis was previously shown to be due to its function in suppressing synthesis of DNA damage repair proteins, it remains unclear how eIF3a regulates cancer cell proliferation. In this study, we show using genetic approaches that eIF3a controls cell proliferation by regulating glucose metabolism via the phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα) at Thr172 in its kinase activation loop. We demonstrate that eIF3a regulates AMPK activation mainly by controlling synthesis of the small GTPase Rheb, largely independent of the well-known AMPK upstream liver kinase B1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, and also independent of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and glucose levels. Our findings suggest that glucose metabolism in and proliferation of cancer cells may be translationally regulated via a novel eIF3a-Rheb-AMPK signaling axis."
https://openalex.org/W4281288984,"Infection prevention and control (IPC) program is obligatory for delivering quality services in any healthcare setup. Lack of administrative support and resource-constraints (under-staffing, inadequate funds) were primary barriers to successful implementation of IPC practices in majority of the hospitals in the developing countries. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought a unique opportunity to improve the IPC program in these hospitals. A PDSA (Plan—Do—Study- Act) model was adopted for this study in a tertiary care hospital which was converted into a dedicated COVID-19 treatment facility in Varanasi, India. The initial focus was to identify the deficiencies in existing IPC practices and perceive the opportunities for improvement. Repeated IPC training (induction and reinforce) was conducted for the healthcare personnel (HCP) and practices were monitored by direct observation and closed-circuit television. Cleaning audits were performed by visual inspection, review of the checklists and qualitative assessment of the viewpoints of the HCP was carried out by the feedbacks received at the end of the training sessions. A total of 2552 HCP and 548 medical students were trained in IPC through multiple offline/onsite sessions over a period of 15 months during the ongoing pandemic. Although the overall compliance to surface disinfection and cleaning increased from 50% to &gt;80% with repeated training, compliance decreased whenever newly recruited HCP were posted. Fear psychosis in the pandemic was the greatest facilitator for adopting the IPC practices. Continuous wearing of personal protective equipment for long duration, dissatisfaction with the duty rosters as well as continuous posting in high-risk areas were the major obstacles to the implementation of IPC norms. Recognising the role of an infection control team, repeated training, monitoring and improvisation of the existing resources are keys for successful implementation of IPC practices in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4281294311,"Researchers are increasingly looking to plants as sources of novel ingredients active against vector-borne diseases. Medicinal plant extracts and their metabolites are an attractive source for such products. This study investigated the insecticidal activity of five essential oils extracted from the most common medicinal herbs in Jazan province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Extracted oils and nanoemulsions synthesized from those oils were characterized before application at different concentrations to laboratory-reared fourth-stage larvae of Culex pipens. Basil ( Ocimum bascilicum ) and cumin ( Cuminum cyminum ) essential oils showed moderate larvicidal effect with LC50 81.07 ug/mL and 96.29 ug/mL, respectively. That activity was improved in their nanoemulsion forms, as evidenced by a reduction in the LC50 to 65.19 ug/mL for basil and 64.50 ug/mL for cumin. Clove ( Syzygium aromaticum ), henna ( Lawsonia inermis ) and ginger ( Zingiber officinalis ) oils showed weaker insecticidal activity, with LC50 values of 394 ug/mL, 306 ug/mL, and 494 ug/mL, respectively. Moreover, the nanoemulsion forms of those essential oils did not show any improvement in their insecticidal activity. In conclusion, of the studied plants, the nanoemulsions of basil and cumin showed significant larvicidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W4281295682,"Background Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, several countries are still struggling to contain its spread. Apart from economic challenges, the pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health and psychological well-being of millions of people worldwide. The effects of COVID-19 are disproportionate depending on sociodemographic characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological distress among women in Saudi Arabia. Methods Data were extracted from an online cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire conducted to measure symptoms of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia from 3 May to 8 May 2020. The study included a sample of 1527 women. The questionnaire was based on the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) tool to categorise women who responded to the questionnaire as experiencing normal, mild, or severe levels of distress. Sociodemographic factors related to different levels of psychological distress among women were examined using descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression models. Results Overall, 44% of the respondents indicated symptoms of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 36% of women showed symptoms of mild psychological distress, with 8% of women experiencing a severe distress level. The results also revealed particularly high levels of psychological distress among younger women and female healthcare workers. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic highly contributes to psychological distress among women in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it is essential to establish medium- and long-term strategies that target the most vulnerable women affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4281386942,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis. The adenosine A1 receptor (A1 AR) has been detected to be over-expressed in various cancer cell lines. However, the role of A1 AR in tumor development is not yet well characterized. A series of A1 AR mutations were identified in the Cancer Genome Atlas from cancer patient samples. In this study, we have investigated the pharmacology of mutations located outside of the 7-transmembrane domain by using a ""single-GPCR-one-G protein"" yeast system. Concentration-growth curves were obtained with the full agonist CPA for 12 mutant receptors and compared to the wild-type hA1 AR. Most mutations located at the extracellular loops (EL) reduced the levels of constitutive activity of the receptor and agonist potency. For mutants at the intracellular loops (ILs) of the receptor, an increased constitutive activity was found for mutant receptor L211R5.69 , while a decreased constitutive activity and agonist response were found for mutant receptor L113F34.51 . Lastly, mutations identified on the C-terminus did not significantly influence the pharmacological function of the receptor. A selection of mutations was also investigated in a mammalian system. Overall, similar effects on receptor activation compared to the yeast system were found with mutations located at the EL, but some contradictory effects were observed for mutations located at the IL. Taken together, this study will enrich the insight of A1 AR structure and function, enlightening the consequences of these mutations in cancer. Ultimately, this may provide potential precision medicine in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4280597797,"Myosins belong to a large superfamily of actin-dependent molecular motors. Nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) is involved in the morphology and function of neurons, but little is known about how NM II activity is regulated. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a prevalent neurotrophic factor in the brain that encourages growth and differentiation of neurons and synapses. In this study, we report that BDNF upregulates the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2), to increases the activity of NM II. The role of BDNF on modulating the phosphorylation of MLC2 was validated by using Western blotting in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. This result was confirmed by injecting BDNF into the dorsal hippocampus of mice and detecting the phosphorylation level of MLC2 by Western blotting. We further perform coimmunoprecipitation assay to confirm that this process depends on the activation of the LYN kinase through binding with tyrosine kinase receptor B, the receptor of BDNF, in a kinase activity-dependent manner. LYN kinase subsequently phosphorylates MLCK, further promoting the phosphorylation of MLC2. Taken together, our results suggest a new molecular mechanism by which BDNF regulates MLC2 activity, which provides a new perspective for further understanding the functional regulation of NM II in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W4280631067,"The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activating protein (PACT), an RNA-binding protein that is part of the RNA-induced silencing complex, plays a key role in miR-mediated translational repression. Previous studies showed that PACT regulates the expression of various miRs, selects the miR strand to be loaded onto RNA-induced silencing complex, and determines proper miR length. Apart from PACT's role in mediating the antiviral response in immune cells, what PACT does in other cell types is unknown. Strikingly, it has also been shown that cold exposure leads to marked downregulation of PACT protein in mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT), where mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism play a central role. Here, we show that PACT establishes a posttranscriptional brake on mitochondrial biogenesis (mitobiogenesis) by promoting the maturation of miR-181c, a key suppressor of mitobiogenesis that has been shown to target mitochondrial complex IV subunit I (Mtco1) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). Consistently, we found that a partial reduction in PACT expression is sufficient to enhance mitobiogenesis in brown adipocytes in culture as well as during BAT activation in mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate an unexpected role for PACT in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energetics in cells and BAT."

In Brazil, the Bolsa Familia Program (BFP) was implemented to alleviate poverty and improve living conditions, health, and education for socioeconomically vulnerable populations. However, the effect of this intervention on maternal and child health is not well understood.We will evaluate the effect of BFP on maternal and child outcomes: 1. Birth weight; 2. Preterm birth; 3. Maternal mortality; and 4. Child growth. Dynamic retrospective cohort data from the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort (2001 to 2015) will be linked to three different databases: Live Birth Information System (2004 to 2015); Mortality Information System (2011 to 2015); and Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (2008 to 2017). The definition of exposure to the BFP varies according to the outcome studied. Those who never received the benefit until the outcome or until the end of the follow-up will be defined as not exposed. The effects of BFP on maternal and child outcomes will be estimated by a combination of propensity score-based methods and weighted logistic regressions. The analyses will be further stratified to reflect changes in the benefit entitlement before and after 2012.Harnessing a large linked administrative cohort allows us to assess the effect of the BFP on maternal and child health, while considering a wide range of explanatory and confounding variables."
https://openalex.org/W4281288295,"The premises for the potential success of molecular breeding is the ability to identify major genes associated with important dairy related traits. The present study was taken up with the objectives to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of bovine MASP2 and SIRT1 genes and its effect on estimated breeding values (EBVs) and to estimate genetic parameters for lactation milk yield (LMY), 305-day milk yield (305dMY), 305-day fat yield (305dFY), 305-day solid not fat yield (305dSNFY) and lactation length (LL) in Sahiwal dairy cattle to devise a promising improvement strategy. Genetic parameters and breeding values of milk production traits were estimated from 935 Sahiwal cattle population (1979–2019) reared at National Dairy Research Institute at Karnal, India. A total of 7 SNPs, where one SNP (g.499C&gt;T) in exon 2 and four SNPs (g.576G&gt;A, g.609T&gt;C, g.684G&gt;T and g.845A&gt;G) in exon 3 region of MASP2 gene and 2 SNPs (g.-306T&gt;C and g.-274G&gt;C) in the promoter region of SIRT1 gene were identified in Sahiwal cattle population. Five of these identified SNPs were chosen for further genotyping by PCR-RFLP and association analysis. Association analysis was performed using estimated breeding values (n = 150) to test the effect of SNPs on LMY, 305dMY, 305dFY, 305dSNFY and LL. Association analysis revealed that, three SNP markers (g.499C&gt;T, g.609T&gt;C and g.-306T&gt;C) were significantly associated with all milk yield traits. The estimates for heritability using repeatability model for LMY, 305dMY, 305dFY, 305dSNFY and LL were low, however the corresponding estimates from first parity were 0.20±0.08, 0.17±0.08, 0.13±0.09, 0.13±0.09 and 0.24, respectively. The repeatability estimates were moderate to high indicating consistency of performance over the parities and hence reliability of first lactation traits. Genetic correlations among the traits of first parity were high (0.55 to 0.99). From the results we could conclude that optimum strategy to improve the Sahiwal cattle further would be selecting the animals based on their first lactation 305dMY. Option top include the significant SNP in selection criteria can be explored. Taken together, a 2-stage selection approach, select Sahiwal animals early for the SNP and then on the basis of first lactation 305dMY will help to save resources."
https://openalex.org/W4281291720,"Objectives Delayed sternal closure is a routine procedure to reduce hemodynamic and respiratory instability in pediatric patients following cardiac surgery, particularly in neonates and infants. In this setting, the possible links between sternal wound infection and delayed sternal closure are still a matter of debate. As a part of our routine, there was a low threshold for delayed sternal closure, so we reviewed our experience with sternal wound infections with a focus on potentially related perioperative risk factors, particularly delayed sternal closure. Methods We retrospectively identified 358 operated neonates (37%) and infants (mean age 3.6 months) in our local congenital heart disease database between January 2013 and June 2017. Potential risk factors for sternal wound infections, such as age, gender, complexity (based on Aristotle- and STS-EACTS mortality category), reoperation, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, mortality and delayed sternal closure (163/358, 46%), were subjected to uni- and multivariate analysis. Results A total of 26/358 patients (7.3%) developed a superficial sternal wound infection. There were no deep sternal wound infections, no mediastinitis or sepsis. Applying univariate analysis, the prevalence of sternal wound infections was related to younger age, more complex surgery and delayed sternal closure. However, in multivariate analysis, sternal wound infection was only associated with delayed sternal closure (p = 0.013, odds ratio 8.6). Logistic regression revealed the prevalence of delayed sternal closure to be related to younger age, complexity, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Conclusion In patients younger than one year, sternal wound infections are clearly related to delayed sternal closure. However, in our cohort, all sternal wound infections were superficial and acceptable, considering the improved postoperative hemodynamic stability."
https://openalex.org/W4281388441,"This survey was conducted to estimate the incidence and level of potential viral contamination in commercially collected porcine plasma. Samples of spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) were collected over a 12- month period from eight spray drying facilities in Spain, England, Northern Ireland, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. In this survey, viral load for several porcine pathogens including SVA, TGEV, PRRSV (EU and US strains), PEDV, PCV-2, SIV, SDCoV and PPV were determined by qPCR. Regression of Ct on TCID50 of serial diluted stock solution of each virus allowed the estimate of potential viral level in SDPP and unprocessed liquid plasma (using typical solids content of commercially collected porcine plasma). In this survey SVA, TGEV or SDCoV were not detected in any of the SDPP samples. Brazil SDPP samples were free of PRRSV and PEDV. Samples of SDPP from North America primarily contained the PRRSV-US strain while the European samples contained the PRRSV-EU strain (except for one sample from each region containing a relatively low estimated level of the alternative PRRSV strain). Estimated viral level tended to be in the range from <1.0 log10 TCID50 to <2.5 log10 TCID50. Estimated level of SIV was the exception with a very low incidence rate but higher estimated viral load <3.9 log10 TCID50. In summary, the incidence of potential viral contamination in commercially collected porcine plasma was variable and estimated virus level in samples containing viral DNA/RNA was relatively low compared with that occurring at the peak viremia during an infection for all viruses or when considering the minimal infectious dose for each of them."

To capture the prevalence in an accurate and timely manner and to understand the mode of nosocomial infection are essential for its preventive measure.We recruited 685 healthcare workers (HCW's) at Tokyo Shinagawa Hospital prior to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine. Sera of the subjects were tested by assays for the titer of IgG against S protein's receptor binding domain (IgG (RBD)) or IgG against nucleocapsid protein (IgG (N)) of SARS-CoV-2. Together with PCR data, the positive rates by these methods were evaluated.Overall positive rates among HCW's by PCR, IgG (RBD), IgG (N) with a cut-off of 1.4 S/C (IgG (N)1.4), and IgG (N) with a cut-off of 0.2 S/C (IgG (N)0.2) were 3.5%, 9.5%, 6.1%, and 27.7%, respectively. Positive rates of HCW's working in COVID-19 ward were significantly higher than those of HCW's working in non-COVID-19 ward by all the four methods. Concordances of IgG (RBD), IgG (N)1.4, and IgG (N)0.2 against PCR were 97.1%, 71.4%, and 88.6%, respectively. By subtracting the positive rates of PCR from that of IgG (RBD), the rate of overall silent infection and that of HCW's in COVID-19 ward were estimated to be 6.0% and 21.1%, respectively.For the prevention of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2, identification of silent infection is essential. For the detection of ongoing infection, periodical screening with IgG (RBD) in addition to PCR would be an effective measure. For the surveillance of morbidity in the population, on the other hand, IgG (N)0.2 could be the most reliable indicator among the three serological tests."

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains are recognized as the most frequent causative agent, and these express a range of virulence factors including the adhesins. Immune response to UPEC under immunosuppression has not been fully understood yet. Interleukin 1β (IL1β), 6 (IL6) and 17 (IL17) represent clinically relevant markers of inflammation.The study aimed to investigate the interplay between UPEC genotype and hosts' immune status in shaping local inflammatory response in the course of an UTI episode. The respective numbers of: 18 kidney recipients with UPEC UTI, 28 immunocompetent hosts with UPEC UTI and 29 healthy controls were involved. Urine IL1β, IL6, and IL17/creatinine ratios in relation to fimH, csgA, papC, tosA, and flu genes presence in UPEC isolated from the urine samples were analyzed. Apart from traditional statistics, also machine learning algorithms were applied.The urine levels of IL1β and IL 6 were similar in kidney recipients and the immunocompetent hosts. IL1β levels were higher in both kidney recipients and immunocompetent hosts than in controls, while IL6 levels were higher only in immunocompetent hosts than in controls. In the machine learning classification model, high urine IL17 levels were significantly more prevalent in controls, while low IL17 levels in urines infected with Ag43-positive UPEC strains, regardless of the host's immune status. In the traditional statistical analysis, IL17 levels appeared significantly higher in urine samples from kidney recipients infected with Ag43-negative UPEC strains.In the UTI- affected patients, the combination of the immune status of an individual and Ag43 status of the UPEC strain determined urine IL17 level in the analyzed group. However, IL17 levels above median were overall more prevalent in controls."

A lower all-cause mortality was noted in the PUD+HPRx in DM group (HR: 0.937, P<0.001) than in the PUD-HPRx in DM group. Trends of a higher incidence of IBD and a lower mortality in younger patients in the PUD+HPRx in DM group compared with the PUD-HPRx in DM group were noted.The results revealed that H. pylori treatment increased the incidences of autoimmune diseases and IBD and decreased the all-cause mortality in the DM group with PUD. The effect was more significant in younger patients. This finding assists in realizing the influence of H. pylori treatment in the DM population."
https://openalex.org/W4281291791,"Ethnic Malaysian Chinese used to observe the 1-month postpartum confinement period at home and many families would engage a traditional postpartum carer to help care for the mother and newborn. A recent trend has been the development of confinement centres (CCs) which are private non-healthcare establishments run by staff not trained in health care. Concerns about hygiene in CCs arose after infections were reported. We describe the practice of hand hygiene observed in CCs, the availability of resources for hygiene, and the prevalence of health-related problems in CCs.This is a cohort study of ethnic Chinese mothers intending to breastfeed their healthy infants. They were recruited post-delivery along with a comparison group who planned to spend their confinement period at home. After their 1-month confinement period, they were contacted for a structured telephone interview about their experience. To avoid any alteration in behaviour, mothers were not told at recruitment that they had to observe hygiene practices. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the effect of place of confinement on rates of infant health problems.Of 187 mothers, 88(47%) went to 27 different CCs while 99(53%) stayed at home. Response rates for the 1-month interviews were 88%(CC) versus 97%(home). Mothers in CC group stayed in one to four-bedded rooms and 92% of them had their baby sleeping separately in a common nursery described to have up to 17 babies at a time; 74% of them spent less than six hours a day with their babies; 43% noticed that CC staff had inadequate hand hygiene practices; 66% reported no hand basins in their rooms; 30% reported no soap at hand basins; 28% reported inexperienced or inadequate staff and 4% reported baby item sharing. Among the mothers staying at home, 35% employed a traditional postpartum carer for her baby; 32% did not room-in with their babies, but only 11% spent less than 6 hours a day with their babies. Of mothers who employed traditional postpartum carers, 32% did not know if their carer washed hands after changing diapers and 18% reported that their carer did not. Health problems that were probably related to infection (HPRI) like fever and cough were similar between the groups: 14%(CC) versus 14%(home) (p = 0.86). Multiple logistic regression did not show that CCs were a factor for HPRI: aOR 1.28 (95% CI 0.36 to 4.49). Three mothers reported events that could indicate transmission of infection in CCs.We found unsatisfactory hygiene practices in CCs as reported by mothers who spent their confinement period there. Although we were not able to establish any direct evidence of infection transmission but based on reports given by the mothers in this study, it is likely to be happening. Therefore, future studies, including intervention studies, are urgently needed to establish an appropriate hygiene standard in CCs as well as the best method to implement this standard. Training CC staff with hygiene knowledge so that they can be empowered to contribute to the development of these standards would be important."

This cross-sectional study of the eight (public and private) medical schools in the province of Madrid, used an electronic questionnaire with the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE), Medical Student Well-Being Index, and other independent characteristics as measuring instruments. Of the 2,264 student participants, 1,679 (74.0%) were women, with a 50.7% participation rate. No significant differences were found in empathy levels by academic year. Regarding range, percentile and cut-off point tables were established to identify students with high, medium, and low empathy levels. Women (p<0.001), volunteer workers (p<0.001), and those preferring general specialties (internal medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, or family medicine) scored higher on the JSE (p<0.02). Moreover, 41.6% presented high level of psychological distress. Women reported a lower well-being level and a higher risk of psychological distress (p = 0.004). In sum, the empathy of medical students in Madrid did not differ among the three critical moments of their university studies. The established cut-off points could be taken into account when accessing the medical degree and identifying students with low levels of empathy to implement curricular interventions to rectify this perceived deficiency. There was a high percentage of medical students with high levels of psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W4281297344,"Whip smut disease of sugarcane, caused by Sporisorium scitamineum, is considered one of the main constraints in the successful cultivation of sugarcane. The pathogen infection can decrease the quantity and quality of the produce. Cultivation of resistant varieties is the most feasible strategy to combat the harms of this devastating disease. Development of varieties having disease-resistance together with improved important traits such as brix, pol, purity, CSS, and low fiber contents are desirable. Therefore, we documented the variances in quality traits of 104 sugarcane cultivars under disease pressure in split-plot design with 6 replications. The split ANOVA revealed a highly significant impact (p<0.0001) between treatments (inoculated and uninoculated), within cultivars as well as interaction 'Cultivars x Treatments' effect on brix, pol, fiber, purity, and CSS contents. In inoculated plots, the infection of S. scitamineum brought a highly significant reduction (t>4.032) in brix, pol, purity, and CSS of more than 40% of the cultivars used, as compared to the uninoculated ones. On the other hand, the smut infection caused a highly significant (t>4.032) increase in fiber percentage of 41 cultivars. We found significant positive correlations between smut rating and reduction of brix, pol, purity, and CSS contents. The cultivars that were caught with greater disease severity, compromised a higher reduction of their useful contents. Similarly, a significant positive correlation was found between increased fiber percent and smut rating. Remarkably, cultivars that showed immune reactions to whip smut disease were not statistically different from uninoculated ones in brix, pol, purity, CSS, and fiber contents. Variable effects of whip smut infection to quality parameters of different cultivars depict the importance of further improvement through breeding programs."

A multi-reader study (10 readers) was performed to assess the agreement of ADC values between 2D-ROI without specific instruction and 2D-ROI with specific instruction to place a 9-pixel size 2D-ROI covering the lowest ADC area. The computer script generated multiple overlapping 9-pixel 2D-ROIs within a 3D-ROI encompassing the entire lesion placed by a single reader. The lowest mean ADC values from each 2D-small-ROI were used as reference values. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using the Bland-Altman plot. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was assessed between ADC values measured by 10 readers and the computer-calculated reference values.Ten lesions were benign, 6 were Gleason score 6 prostate carcinoma (PCa), and 24 were clinically significant PCa. The mean±SD ADC reference value by 9-pixel-ROI was 733 ± 186 (10-6 mm2/s). The 95% limits of agreement of ADC values among readers were better with specific instruction (±112) than those without (±205). ICC between reader-measured ADC values and computer-calculated reference values ranged from 0.736-0.949 with specific instruction and 0.349-0.919 without specific instruction.Interobserver agreement of ADC values can be improved by indicating a measurement method (use of a specific ROI size covering the lowest ADC area)."

Currently, several methods are known for detecting O-GlcNAcylated proteins using monoclonal antibodies or wheat germ agglutinin, but these methods have some limitations in their sensitivity and quantitative comparison. We developed a new disaccharide-tag method to overcome these problems. This is a method in which a soluble GalNAc transferase is expressed intracellularly, extended to a disaccharide of GalNAc-GlcNAc, and detected using a Wisteria japonica agglutinin specific to this disaccharide. We verified the method using human c-Rel protein and also highly sensitively compared the difference in O-GlcNAc modification of intracellular proteins associated with differentiation from embryonic stem cell (ESC) to epiblast-like cells (EpiLC). As one example of such a modification, a novel O-GlcNAc modification was found in the transcription factor Sox2 at residue Ser263, and the modification site could be identified by nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry."

Methods A total of 16616 subjects who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from 2003 to 2017 and a cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan within one year were included in this study. Coronary atherosclerosis was evaluated by the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). The severity of GERD was evaluated based on endoscopic findings using the Los Angeles classification. Results The proportion of high CACSs (≥100) increased significantly in subjects with severe GERD ( p = 0.008). However, the presence of a high CACS did not increase the risk of GERD (OR = 1.007, 95% CI 0.857–1.182), nor did that of GERD increase the risk of a high CACS (OR = 1.018, 95% CI 0.865–1.198). The risk factors for a high CACS in GERD patients included age (OR = 1.087, 95% CI 1.066–1.109), male sex (OR = 5.645, 95% CI 2.561–12.446), hypertension (OR = 1.800, 95% CI 1.325–2.446), and hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.684, 95% CI 1.213–2.338). Conclusions Although the presence of a high CACS did not increase the risk of GERD or vice versa, the proportion of high CACSs was significantly higher in subjects with severe GERD. Therefore, it might be helpful to assess the CACS in GERD patients with multiple risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4280561423,"The human rhomboid-5 homolog-1 (RHBDF1) is a multi-transmembrane protein present mainly on the endoplasmic reticulum. RHBDF1 has been implicated in the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-derived cell growth signals and other activities critical to cellular responses to stressful conditions, but details of this activation mechanism are unclear. Here, we report a RHBDF1 mRNA transcript alternative splicing variant X6 (RHBDF1 X6 or RHX6) that antagonizes RHBDF1 activities. We found that while the RHBDF1 gene is marginally expressed in breast tumor-adjacent normal tissues, it is markedly elevated in the tumor tissues. In sharp contrast, the RHX6 mRNA represents the primary RHBDF1 variant in normal breast epithelial cells and tumor-adjacent normal tissues but is diminished in breast cancer cells and tumors. We demonstrate that, functionally, RHX6 acts as an inhibitor of RHBDF1 activities. We show that artificially overexpressing RHX6 in breast cancer cells leads to retarded proliferation, migration, and decreased production of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related adhesion molecules. Mechanically, RHX6 is able to inhibit the maturation of TACE, a protease that processes pro-TGFα, a pro-ligand of EGFR, and to prevent intracellular transportation of pro-TGFα to the cell surface. Additionally, we show that the production of RHX6 is under the control of the alternative splicing regulator RNA binding motif protein-4 (RBM4). Our findings suggest that differential splicing of the RHBDF1 gene transcript may have a regulatory role in the development of epithelial cell cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4280590467,"Protein transport to peroxisomes requires various proteins, such as receptors in the cytosol and components of the transport machinery on peroxisomal membranes. The Arabidopsis apem (aberrant peroxisome morphology) mutant apem7 shows decreased efficiency of peroxisome targeting signal 1-dependent protein transport to peroxisomes. In apem7 mutants, peroxisome targeting signal 2-dependent protein transport is also disturbed, and plant growth is repressed. The APEM7 gene encodes a protein homologous to peroxin 4 (PEX4), which belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) protein family; however, the UBC activity of Arabidopsis PEX4 remains to be investigated. Here, we show using electron microscopy and immunoblot analysis using specific PEX4 antibodies and in vitro transcription/translation assay that PEX4 localizes to peroxisomal membranes and possesses UBC activity. We found that the substitution of proline with leucine by apem7 mutation alters ubiquitination of PEX4. Furthermore, substitution of the active-site cysteine residue at position 90 in PEX4, which was predicted to be a ubiquitin-conjugation site, with alanine did not restore the apem7 phenotype. Taken together, these findings indicate that abnormal ubiquitination in the apem7 mutant alters ubiquitin signaling during the process of protein transport, suggesting that the UBC activity of PEX4 is indispensable for efficient protein transport to peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W4280634794,"Background As a kind of traditional Chinese medicine, HQ is widely mentioned in the treatment of cancerous diseases in China, which has been proven to have a therapeutic effect on cancerous diseases, such as prostate cancer. To predict the specific mechanism of HQ in the treatment of CRPC, we will conduct preliminary verification and discussion based on a comprehensive consideration of network pharmacology and molecular docking. Methods TCMSP was used to obtain the compounds and reach the effective targets of HQ. The targets of CRPC were reached based on GeneCards database and CTD database. GO and KEGG were utilized for the analysis of overlapping targets. The software of Openbabel was used to convert the formats of ligands and reporters. In addition, molecular docking studies were performed by using the software of Autodock Vina. Result It can be seen from the database results that there were 87 active compounds (20 key active compounds) in HQ, and 33 targets were screened out for CRPC treatment. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses identified 81 significant GO terms and 24 significant KEGG pathways. There is a difference in terms of the expression of core protein between cancer patients and healthy people. The expression of core protein in patients also has an impact on the life cycle. The results of molecular docking showed that the docking activity of drug molecules and core proteins was better. Conclusions It is concluded from the results of this network pharmacology and molecular docking that HQ makes a multi-target and multi-biological process, and results in the multi-channel synergistic effect on the treatment of CRPC by regulating cell apoptosis, proliferation and metastasis, which still needs further verification by experimental research."

Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) have been widely used in China as a novel and promising treatment option for SP. Therefore, this study will assess and rank the effectiveness of CHIs to provide more sights for the selection of SP treatment.Seven databases will be searched, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP) from their inception up to October, 2021. The literatures screening, data extraction and the quality assessment of included studies will be conducted independently by two reviewers. Then Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) will be performed by WinBUGS 14.0 and STATA 14.0 software. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability values will be applied to rank the examined treatments. The risk of bias of each included study will be evaluated using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB 2). Publication bias will be reflected by a funnel plot.The results of this NMA will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication.Our study findings maybe reveal which CHI or CHIs will be better in the treatment of SP and provide more therapy strategies for clinical practitioners and patients.CRD42021244587.Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) can integrate direct evidence with indirect evidence of severe pneumonia treated by Chinese herbal injections to generate a clinically useful ranking of these regimens. This NMA will address Chinese herbal injections for SP and its findings may help to provide more sights for selection of SP treatment. Evidence drawn from an NMA is limited and should be interpreted with caution. We only included studies in Chinese and English languages, which may increase the publication bias."
https://openalex.org/W4281289057,"As the rate of percutaneous coronary intervention increases, in-stent restenosis (ISR) has become a burden. Random forest (RF) could be superior to logistic regression (LR) for predicting ISR due to its robustness. We developed an RF model and compared its performance with the LR one for predicting ISR. We retrospectively included 1501 patients (age: 64.0 ± 10.3; male: 76.7%; ISR events: 279) who underwent coronary angiography at 9 to 18 months after implantation of 2nd generation drug-eluting stents. The data were randomly split into a pair of train and test datasets for model development and validation with 50 repeats. The predictive performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The RF models predicted ISR with larger AUC-ROCs of 0.829 ± 0.025 compared to 0.784 ± 0.027 of the LR models. The difference was statistically significant in 29 of the 50 repeats. The RF and LR models had similar sensitivity using the same cutoff threshold, but the specificity was significantly higher in the RF models, reducing 25% of the false positives. By removing the high leverage outliers, the LR models had comparable AUC-ROC to the RF models. Compared to the LR, the RF was more robust and significantly improved the performance for predicting ISR. It could cost-effectively identify patients with high ISR risk and help the clinical decision of coronary stenting."
https://openalex.org/W4281289780,"Background Although gene-expression (GE) and protein levels are typically strongly genetically regulated, their correlation is known to be low. Here we investigate this phenomenon by focusing on the genetic background of this correlation in order to understand the similarities and differences in the genetic regulation of these omics layers. Methods and results We performed locus-wide association studies of 92 protein levels measured in whole blood for 2,014 samples of European ancestry and found that 66 are genetically regulated. Three female- and one male-specific effects were detected. We estimated the genetically regulated GE for all significant genes in 49 GTEx v8 tissues. A total of 7 proteins showed negative correlations with their respective GE across multiple tissues. Finally, we tested for causal links of GE on protein expression via Mendelian Randomization, and confirmed a negative causal effect of GE on protein level for five of these genes in a total of 63 gene-tissue pairs: BLMH, CASP3, CXCL16, IL6R, and SFTPD. For IL6R, we replicated the negative causal effect on coronary-artery disease (CAD), while its GE was positively linked to CAD. Conclusion While total GE and protein levels are only weakly correlated, we found high correlations between their genetically regulated components across multiple tissues. Of note, strong negative causal effects of tissue-specific GE on five protein levels were detected. Causal network analyses revealed that GE effects on CAD risks was in general mediated by protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W4281294336,"The optimal initial pre-conditioning parameter is essential to properly adjust the temperature within the cabin in an effective and accurate way, especially while passengers’ thermal comfort and energy-saving properties are both considered. Under the various environmental thermal loads, the pre-conditioning solutions resulting from those pre-fixed cooling parameters are unfeasible for achieving accurately passengers’ comfort temperature. In addition, it is also difficult in such a narrow car space to identify a lot of local attributes due to the different material properties and sizes of a variety of structural parts that have various thermal responses to environmental conditions. This paper presents a data-driven decision model to numerically identify the degrees of the cabin thermal characteristic to determine satisfactory pre-conditioning parameter schemes. Initially, based on the thermal data within a vehicle recorded through the whole year at a selected hot climate region of the Middle East, the study levels multiple climate scenes corresponding to change in the cabin air temperature. Then three classification algorithms (Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, and K-nearest neighbor model) are used to comparatively identify climate levels according to the input conditions. Based on the identified climate level, an appropriate parameters scheme for this level is applied. A comprehensive evaluation index ( CEI ) is proposed to characterize the passengers’ satisfaction in numerical computation, on considering multi-satisfaction objectives including Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), local temperature, air quality, and energy efficiency; and it formulates the pre-conditioning parameter scheme for each climate scene with CEI . Several scene cases are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The result shows that the pre-conditioning schemes of the model can effectively satisfy passengers in multi-satisfaction objectives."
https://openalex.org/W4281296757,"The graphene modified asphalt used in this study was prepared based on a highway project in Gansu Province. In this paper, the high temperature rutting resistance, low temperature cracking resistance, and water stability of SMA-13 asphalt mixture with asphalt (AH-70), SBS modified asphalt and graphene rubber composite modified asphalt were tested and analyzed comparatively by the rutting test, Schellenberg binder drainage test, Cantabro test, freeze-thaw splitting test, and beam bending test. The results showed that the graphene modifier improved the asphalt’s ductility and softening point significantly, and 0.4g graphene content was the threshold and its corresponding mixture performance index. In the other tests under the same conditions, the high temperature and water stability of SMA-13 mixtures of graphene rubber modified asphalt were the best, followed by SBS modified asphalt mixture, and matrix asphalt mixture. Compared with wood fiber, graphene modifier had no significant effect on SMA-13 mixtures’ low temperature performance. The use of graphene modifiers can enhance the adhesion between asphalt and aggregate and its asphalt has good consistency and viscosity. When compared with matrix asphalt and SBS modified SMA-13 mixtures, the water and high temperature stability of graphene modified asphalt mixture is better."
https://openalex.org/W4281387576,"This study aimed to investigate the frequency of islet autoantibody positivity in adult patients with recently diagnosed diabetes in Uganda and its associated characteristics.Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GADA), zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8-A), and tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A) were measured in 534 adult patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Islet autoantibody positivity was defined based on diagnostic thresholds derived from a local adult population without diabetes. The socio-demographic, clinical, and metabolic characteristics of islet autoantibody-positive and negative participants were then compared. The differences in these characteristics were analysed using the x2 test for categorical data and the Kruskal Wallis test for continuous data. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of islet autoantibody positivity.Thirty four (6.4%) participants were positive for ≥1 islet autoantibody. GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8-A positivity was detected in 17 (3.2%), 10 (1.9%), and 7 (1.3%) participants, respectively. Compared with those negative for islet autoantibodies, participants positive for islet autoantibodies were more likely to live in a rural area (n = 18, 52.9% Vs n = 127, 25.5%, p = 0.005), to be initiated on insulin therapy (n = 19, 55.9% Vs n = 134, 26.8%, p<0.001), to have a lower median waist circumference (90 [80-99] cm Vs 96 [87-104.8], p = 0.04), waist circumference: height ratio (0.55 [0.50-0.63] vs 0.59 [0.53-0.65], p = 0.03), and fasting C-peptide concentration (0.9 [0.6-1.8] Vs 1.4 [0.8-2.1] ng/ml, p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, living in a rural area (odds ratio or OR 3.62, 95%CI 1.68-7.80, p = 0.001) and being initiated on insulin therapy (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.67-7.83, p = 0.001) were associated with islet autoantibody positivity.The prevalence of islet autoantibody positivity was relatively low, suggesting that pancreatic autoimmunity is a rare cause of new-onset diabetes in this adult Ugandan population. Living in a rural area and being initiated on insulin therapy were independently associated with islet autoantibody positivity in this study population."
https://openalex.org/W4281395724,"Information transmission significantly impacts social stability and technological advancement. This paper compares the phenomenon of ""Super transmission"" and ""Asymptomatic infection"" in COVID-19 transmission to information transmission. The former is similar to authoritative information transmission individuals, whereas the latter is similar to individuals with low acceptance in information transmission. It then constructs an S2EIR model with transmitter authority and individual acceptance levels. Then, it analyzes the asymptotic stability of information-free and information-existence equilibrium on a local and global scale, as well as the model's basic reproduction number, R0. Distinguished with traditional studies, the population density function and Hamiltonian function are constructed by taking proportion of ""Super transmitter"" and proportion of hesitant group turning into transmitters as optimization control variables. Based on the Pontryagin maximum principle, an optimal control strategy is designed to effectively facilitate information transmission. The numerical simulation corroborates the theoretical analysis results and the system's sensitivity to control parameter changes. The research results indicate that the authoritative ""Super transmitter"" has a beneficial effect on information transmission. In contrast, the ""Asymptomatic infected individual"" with poor individual acceptance level negatively affects information transmission."
