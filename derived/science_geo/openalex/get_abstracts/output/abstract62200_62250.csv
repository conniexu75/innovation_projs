Internal standards consisting of proteins covalently linked to 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl- (DANS-) groups were prepared. DANS- derivatives of insulin and monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer of egg white lysozyme and serum albumin covered molecular weights from 6,600 to 360,000. They were concurrently applied in small amounts on a single gel together with the unknown sample. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Positions of the DANS- proteins were detected under an ultraviolet lamp as yellowish fluorescent bands. These bands are reproducible and related to the positions obtained by standard gel staining techniques. Even 0.2 µg of a DANS-protein was detectable. Molecular weights of unknowns were determined by interpolation from their positions. This method was applied to envelope proteins of Escherichia coli. The molecular weights of major proteins were determined. The molecular weights of Proteins X and Y, which have been shown in a previous paper to be related to cell division and DNA synthesis, respectively, were reexamined and found to be 50,000 and 44,000, respectively. One of the major envelope proteins was found at the molecular weight of 7500. This protein showed a very high arginine to histidine ratio (about 11 times as high as the others) distinctly different from all other proteins of higher molecular weights. Thus, this protein is not a subunit of proteins of higher molecular weights."

Application of either cholera exotoxin or prostaglandin E1 (0.1 mM) to the mucosa inhibits sodium absorption and stimulates chloride secretion. Furthermore, prostaglandin infused into the superior mesenteric artery in dogs causes loss of fluid into the intestinE1. Greenough et al.1 suggested that both the toxin and the prostaglandin E1 act on cyclic adenosine monophosphate, because the responses are mimicked by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline. The similarity of effect of cholera exotoxin and prostaglandin E1 extends to man. A characteristic of cholera is the profuse watery diarrhoea, and cholera toxin and theophylline inhibit sodium absorption and stimulate chloride secretion in human isolated ileal mucosa. Prostaglandin E1 given orally to man causes diarrhoea3,4 which was described4 as normally formed faeces in clear fluid which suggests an effect on intestinal secretion."

When this is incubated in a protein-synthesizing system directed by polyuridylic acid, it yields an acid-precipitable, alkali-labile polyester of phenyllactic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2168510619,The amino acid sequence of the Clostridium tartarivorum ferredoxin was determined to be: Ala-His-Ile-Ile-Thr-Asp-Glu-Cys-Ile-Ser-Cys-Gly-Ala-Cys-Ala-Ala-Glu-Cys-Pro-Val-Glu-Ala-Ile-His-Glu-Gly-Thr-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Val-Asp-Ala-Asp-Thr-Cys-Ile-Asp-Cys-Gly-Ala-Cys-Gln-Ala-Val-Cys-Pro-Thr-Gly-Ala-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu. The first 23 residues were determined in the protein sequenator while the remainder of the sequences were determined by conventional methods. The primary structure of the heat-stable ferredoxin is compared with the ferredoxins from the mesophilic organisms.

https://openalex.org/W1559078311,"Abstract Glycerol kinase of Escherichia coli was purified and crystallized by a gentle modified procedure. A new assay utilizing [γ-32P]ATP was developed for following enzyme activity during purification. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels and equilibrium ultracentrifugation of the crystalline enzyme indicated that this preparation was homogeneous. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was analyzed. Two independent tyrosine determinations by a colorimetric and a spectrophotometric method were in good agreement with the value from the amino acid analysis. The cysteine residues in the molecule are all present as the free sulfhydryls, with some residues exposed to reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) only under denaturing conditions. The partial specific volume of the enzyme was found to be 0.732 ml per g from the amino acid composition or 0.724 ml per g by differential equilibrium sedimentation in buffers of H2O and D2O. With the use of these partial specific volumes, the molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation to be 217,000 or 210,000, respectively. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, even without prior reduction, gave only one band of molecular weight 57,000, determined with respect to the migration of standard proteins. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride indicated a homogeneous species of molecular weight 55,000. After reaction of the native enzyme with a bifunctional cross-linking reagent, dimethyl suberimidate, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate yielded four bands, consistent with a tetrameric structure. Hydrazinolysis released only glutamic acid, in an amount equimolar to the subunit, suggesting that it is the only carboxyl-terminal amino acid. Mapping of the tryptic fragments of carboxymethylated enzyme yielded a number of ninhydrin-positive and of tyrosine- and tryptophan-containing peptides consistent with that expected from the amino acid analysis if the enzyme were composed of four identical subunits. It is concluded that glycerol kinase is an oligomeric protein composed of four identical subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2059380712,"FEW measurements have been made of the concentration of mercury in sea water and there are considerable differences in the values reported. High values of 1.6 to 3.6 µg total Hg/l. for oxidized samples from Minamata Bay, Japan1, probably reflect the serious pollution of that area2. Ocean water from the north-western Pacific has been reported3 to contain from 0.06 to 0.27 µg/l., with the highest concentrations in deep water. These measurements were made spectrophotometrically with dithizone, which was also used, in different conditions following anion exchange concentration, in the analysis of waters from the Solent and the English Channel4. These were found to contain lower amounts of mercury, from 0.014 to 0.021 µg/l., which are quite similar to that (0.03 µg/l.) found for a single sample from off Heligoland in the early work of Stock and Cucuel5."

https://openalex.org/W1575389655,"Abstract After infection of Escherichia coli, bacteriophage T5 induces an exonuclease which yields oligonucleotides upon hydrolysis of a DNA strand from the 5'-end. A mutant of T5 has been isolated which bears a mutation in the structural gene of the exonuclease. In addition to inducing a heat-labile enzyme, the mutant phage is unable to form plaques at 45°. Single step revertants lose both of these properties. After infection with the mutant at 45° DNA synthesis begins normally but arrests prematurely. The DNA which is synthesized in mutant-infected cells is converted to a rapidly sedimenting form, as is the DNA synthesized in wild type-infected cells. However, there is defective conversion to mature length phage DNA in mutant-infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W973541555,"Two intramolecular cross-linkages (methylene bridges) have been introduced by formaldehyde in the α subunit of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase without any detectable loss in enzyme activity. These have been assigned to side chains in the sequences between residues 152 to 158, 212 to 218, and 227 to 233. Based on the conditions of reaction, the stability of the methylene bridges, and the availability of reactive residues in these sequences, the specific amino acid pairs linked together have been tentatively designated as asparagine-156-serine-214 and glutamine-218-serine-232."

https://openalex.org/W1505694812,"Abstract The complex of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase with lipoyl transsuccinylase isolated from cauliflower florets and assayed with exogenous lipoyl dehydrogenase is strongly activated by adenosine 5'-monophosphate. The fact that cauliflower α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is free of bound thiamine pyrophosphate as isolated makes possible measurement of the influence of AMP on the binding of this cofactor to the enzyme. The presence of AMP causes an increase in the Vmax of the reaction and a decrease in the Km for Mg-thiamine-PPi. The kinetic indication of tighter binding of Mgthiamine-PPi implicit in the smaller Km is confirmed by independent and more direct measurements of the dissociation of the enzyme-cofactor complex. The half-time for dissociation of the complex of the enzyme with Mg-thiaminePPi is 5 ½ min. In the presence of AMP, the half-time of dissociation is increased to 179 min. The slower rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-Mg-thiamine-PPi complex is paralleled by a more rapid rate constant for the association of these components in the presence of AMP. The α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction can utilize Ca2+, Mg2+, or Sr2+, although at significantly different rates. In the presence of AMP, the rate with any of these ions is stimulated and reaches approximately the same value regardless of which ion is supplied."
