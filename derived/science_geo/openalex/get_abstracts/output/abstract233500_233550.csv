https://openalex.org/W2086688096,"Ca2+ toxicity remains the central focus of ischemic brain injury. The mechanism by which toxic Ca2+ loading of cells occurs in the ischemic brain has become less clear as multiple human trials of glutamate antagonists have failed to show effective neuroprotection in stroke. Acidosis is a common feature of ischemia and is assumed to play a critical role in brain injury; however, the mechanism(s) remain ill defined. Here, we show that acidosis activates Ca2+-permeable acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), inducing glutamate receptor-independent, Ca2+-dependent, neuronal injury inhibited by ASIC blockers. Cells lacking endogenous ASICs are resistant to acid injury, while transfection of Ca2+-permeable ASIC1a establishes sensitivity. In focal ischemia, intracerebroventricular injection of ASIC1a blockers or knockout of the ASIC1a gene protects the brain from ischemic injury and does so more potently than glutamate antagonism. Thus, acidosis injures the brain via membrane receptor-based mechanisms with resultant toxicity of [Ca2+]i, disclosing new potential therapeutic targets for stroke."
https://openalex.org/W1977088495,"DNA repair is an essential process for preserving genome integrity in all organisms. In eukaryotes, recombinational repair is choreographed by multiprotein complexes that are organized into centers (foci). Here, we analyze the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Mre11 nuclease and the ATM-related Tel1 kinase are the first proteins detected at DSBs. Next, the Rfa1 single-strand DNA binding protein relocalizes to the break and recruits other key checkpoint proteins. Later and only in S and G2 phase, the homologous recombination machinery assembles at the site. Unlike the response to DSBs, Mre11 and recombination proteins are not recruited to hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks unless the forks collapse. The cellular response to DSBs and DNA replication stress is likely directed by the Mre11 complex detecting and processing DNA ends in conjunction with Sae2 and by RP-A recognizing single-stranded DNA and recruiting additional checkpoint and repair proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1963545628,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cancer. In this study, we show that JunD, a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, reduces tumor angiogenesis by limiting Ras-mediated production of ROS. Using junD-deficient cells, we demonstrate that JunD regulates genes involved in antioxidant defense, H2O2 production, and angiogenesis. The accumulation of H2O2 in junD-/- cells decreases the availability of FeII and reduces the activity of HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that target hypoxia-inducible factors-alpha (HIFalpha) for degradation. Subsequently, HIF-alpha proteins accumulate and enhance the transcription of VEGF-A, a potent proangiogenic factor. Our study uncovers the mechanism by which JunD protects cells from oxidative stress and exerts an antiangiogenic effect. Furthermore, we provide new insights into the regulation of PHD activity, allowing immediate reactive adaptation to changes in O2 or iron levels in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2126326200,"Endocytosis comprises several routes of internalization. An outstanding question is whether the caveolar and endosomal pathways intersect. Following transport of the caveolar protein Caveolin-1 and two cargo complexes, Simian Virus 40 and Cholera toxin, in live cells, we uncovered a Rab5-dependent pathway in which caveolar vesicles are targeted to early endosomes and form distinct and stable membrane domains. In endosomes, the low pH selectively allowed the toxin to diffuse out of the caveolar domains into the surrounding membrane, while the virus remained trapped. Thus, we conclude that, unlike cyclic assembly and disassembly of coat proteins in vesicular transport, oligomeric complexes of caveolin-1 confer permanent structural stability to caveolar vesicles that transiently interact with endosomes to form subdomains and release cargo selectively by compartment-specific cues."
https://openalex.org/W2074286944,"Centromeres contain specialized chromatin that includes the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, spCENP-A/Cnp1. Here we report identification of five fission yeast centromere proteins, Mis14-18. Mis14 is recruited to kinetochores independently of CENP-A, and, conversely, CENP-A does not require Mis14 to associate with centromeres. In contrast, Mis15, Mis16 (strong similarity with human RbAp48 and RbAp46), Mis17, and Mis18 are all part of the CENP-A recruitment pathway. Mis15 and Mis17 form an evolutionarily conserved complex that also includes Mis6. Mis16 and Mis18 form a complex and maintain the deacetylated state of histones specifically in the central core of centromeres. Mis16 and Mis18 are the most upstream factors in kinetochore assembly as they can associate with kinetochores in all kinetochore mutants except for mis18 and mis16, respectively. RNAi knockdown in human cells shows that Mis16 function is conserved as RbAp48 and RbAp46 are both required for localization of human CENP-A."
https://openalex.org/W2132492733,"FLVCR, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporter proteins, is the cell surface receptor for feline leukemia virus, subgroup C. Retroviral interference with FLVCR display results in a loss of erythroid progenitors (colony-forming units-erythroid, CFU-E) and severe anemia in cats. In this report, we demonstrate that human FLVCR exports cytoplasmic heme and hypothesize that human FLVCR is required on developing erythroid cells to protect them from heme toxicity. Inhibition of FLVCR in K562 cells decreases heme export, impairs their erythroid maturation and leads to apoptosis. FLVCR is upregulated on CFU-E, indicating that heme export is important in primary cells at this stage. Studies of FLVCR expression in cell lines suggest this exporter also impacts heme trafficking in intestine and liver. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a mammalian heme transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2121153005,"The endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its physiological functions, including membrane hyperpolarization and smooth muscle cell relaxation, position this gas well in the family of gasotransmitters together with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). In this study, we demonstrate that H2S at physiologically relevant concentrations induced apoptosis of human aorta smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Exposure of HASMCs to H2S did not induce necrosis as verified with Trypan blue exclusion and LDH release analysis. After inhibiting endogenous H2S production, exogenous H2S induced much more significant apoptosis, which was not altered by the presence of albumin or glutathione. H2S treatment increased the activities of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity. Suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, but not of p38 activity, inhibited the H2S-induced apoptosis of HASMCs. The activation of ERK by H2S in HASMCs was accompanied by increased caspase-3 activity. Inhibition of caspase-3 by AC-DEVD-CHO attenuated the H2S-induced cell apoptosis. Inhibition of ERK by U0126 decreased caspase-3 activity, whereas AC-DEVD-CHO did not alter ERK activity. In conclusion, exogenous H2S induces apoptosis of HASMCs, which is significantly affected by the endogenous H2S level. Of the three investigated MAPKs, only ERK played an active role in mediating H2S-induced apoptosis of HASMCs by activating caspase-3. These findings may help reveal novel mechanisms for many diseases linked to H2S-related abnormal cellular proliferation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2042774137,"Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, imported into mitochondria, and sorted to one of the four mitochondrial subcompartments. Here we identified a new inner membrane protein, Tim40, that mediates sorting of small Tim proteins to the intermembrane space. Tim40 is essential for yeast cell growth, and its function in vivo requires six conserved Cys residues but not anchoring of the protein to the inner membrane by its N-terminal hydrophobic segment. Depletion of Tim40 impairs the import of small Tim proteins into mitochondria both in vivo and in vitro. In wild-type mitochondria, Tim40 forms a translocation intermediate with small Tim proteins prior to their assembly in the intermembrane space in vitro. These results suggest the essential role of Tim40 in sorting/assembly of small Tim proteins. Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, imported into mitochondria, and sorted to one of the four mitochondrial subcompartments.

In wild-type mitochondria, Tim40 forms a translocation intermediate with small Tim proteins prior to their assembly in the intermembrane space in vitro. These results suggest the essential role of Tim40 in sorting/assembly of small Tim proteins. Mitochondria are essential organelles in eukaryotic cells that consist of four compartments, the outer membrane, intermembrane space (IMS), 1The abbreviations used are: IMS, the intermembrane space; TOM, the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane; TIM, the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane; BN, blue-native; PK, proteinase K; WT, wild-type; AAC, ADP/ATP carrier; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. inner membrane, and matrix. Since most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized in the cytosol, mitochondria contain an elaborate system to take up these proteins from the cytosol and to sort them to specific intramitochondrial compartments. Recently, evidence has accumulated that the import/sorting pathways for mitochondrial proteins are much more complex than previously envisaged and involve the TOM40 (TOM, the translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane) and SAM (protein sorting and assembly machinery) complexes in the outer membrane, the TIM23 (TIM, the translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane) and the TIM22 complexes in the inner membrane, small Tim proteins in the IMS, and the mitochondrial Hsp70 system in the matrix (1Herrmann J.M.

The mitochondrial IMS contains many soluble, small size proteins including small Tim proteins and cytochrome c. They are synthesized without a cleavable presequence and enter the IMS with the aid of the TOM40 complex but independently of the TIM23 or TIM22 complex. Since there is no membrane potential across the outer membrane and the IMS lacks an ATP-dependent chaperone system, vectorial import of small IMS proteins should be driven by a unique mechanism (2Endo T. Yamamoto H. Esaki M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 4Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). One possible scenario to achieve this is the attachment of ligands such as heme (for cytochrome c) or zinc ion (for small Tim proteins) to the imported proteins in the IMS (5Nargang F.E. Drygas M.E. Kwong P.L. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9388-9394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lutz T. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This will result in their folding/assembly preferentially in the IMS so that their translocation back to the cytosol will be prevented, leading to their accumulation in the IMS. However, it is still unclear whether proteinaceous factors in the IMS are further required for the small IMS protein biogenesis, which is discharged from the TOM40 complex, specific ligand binding, and assembly in the IMS etc. In the present study, we looked for a component, if any, that mediates protein sorting to the mitochondrial IMS in yeast. Our approach relied on the fact that many mitochondrial proteins mediating mitochondrial protein assembly/import are essential or important for yeast cell viability (7Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 639-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Ishikawa D. Yamamoto H. Tamura Y. Moritoh K. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We systematically analyzed the localization of yeast proteins that are indicated in the data base to have essential but unknown functions and identified a novel inner membrane protein Tim40 facing the IMS. We found that Tim40 is involved in the sorting/assembly of small Tim proteins to the IMS. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are D273–10B (MATα, ATCC 25657), W303–1A (MATaade2–1 his3–11,15 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 can1–100), and W303-AB (MATa/α ade2–1/ade2–1 his3–11,15/his3–11,15 ura3–1/ura3–1 leu2–3,112/leu2–3,112 trp1–1/trp1–1 can1–100/can1–100). The TIM40 gene was cloned from the yeast genomic DNA by PCR using primers YKL195W-F (5′-CCC GGA TCC ATT TTG TTT AAT AGT GTG TAT-3′) and YKL195W-R (5′-CCG GAA TTC AAA CGA ACC CCT AGG GTA TAG-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into the yeast single-copy plasmids pRS316 (URA3 selection marker) and pRS314 (TRP1 selection marker) (9Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give pRS316-Tim40 and pRS314-Tim40, respectively. GAL-TIM40, a yeast strain expressing Tim40 under the control of the GAL7 promoter, was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the GAL7 promoter was amplified from plasmid pCgHIS3-GAL7 (10Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers GAL195F (5′-GCA CGC CAC CCA ATA AGA AAA AAA GGG AAA AGG AGC CGA ATT TTG GTT TAA AAA CAT ATA AAG CTT GGG TCT TCT GGA GC-3′) and GAL195R (5′-ATA CAC TCT TTG GAT CGA GCC TAC TTC CAG TTG GTA ATT GGT GTT CCA CAA TTT CAG CAT TTT GAG GGA ATA TTC AAC T-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was used to transform the wild-type haploid strain W303–1A to integrate into the upstream region of the TIM40 gene. Disruption of the TIM40 gene was performed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the Candida glabrata HIS3 gene was amplified from plasmid pCgHIS3 (11Kitada K. Yamaguchi E. Arisawa M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers Del195-F (5′-CTG AAA TTG TGG AAC ACC AAT TAC CAA CTG GAA GTA GGC TGT TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT-3′) and Del195-R (5′-TTA AGG TTT GGA TTC CTC ATT CAA TGG TTC TTT TTT CAC ACA CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG ACC-3′). The amplified DNA fragment, flanked by 40 base pairs of the sequences upstream and downstream of the TIM40 gene, was introduced into the wild-type diploid strain W303-AB, and the resulting strain was named TIM40/Δtim40. The strain Δtim40/pRS316-Tim40, which expresses Tim40 depending on the plasmid, but not on the chromosomal TIM40 gene, was constructed by tetrad analysis of the strain TIM40/Δtim40 harboring pRS316-Tim40 after sporulation. The C296S/C298S, C307S/C317S, and C330S/C340S mutations were introduced into the TIM40 gene by PCR using pRS314-Tim40 as a template using primer sets 195–898F (5′-GGA GGT ATG GCC CAT GGA CCC-3′)/195-C296–298S-897R (5′-CAA AGA AGG AGA GTC CCA ATT TAT CTC ACC-3′), 195-C317S-934F (5′-AAA TCT GCA TTT TCT TGC TTC GTC TAT TCT-3′)/195-C307S-933R (5′-GAA CTC TTC ACC AGA GGG TCC ATG G-3′), and 195-C340S-1003F (5′-CAA CAT ATG CAA GAC TGT TTC AGA AAA TAC-3′)/195-C330S-1002R (5′-AAA CTT TTC AAC AGA GTC GAT ACC T-3′), respectively, followed by self-ligation. The resulting plasmids were named pRS314-Tim40(C296S/C298S), pRS314-Tim40(C307S/C317S), and pRS314-Tim40(C330S/C340S), respectively. Replacement of residues 1–70 of Tim40 with residues 1–220 or residues 1–85 of the cytochrome b2 precursor with or without the AA mutation (N80A and E81A) at the DNA level was performed as follows. The region corresponding to 576 nucleotides upstream of the TIM40 gene was amplified from pRS314-Tim40 by PCR using primers KpnI-195pro-F (5′-CCG GGT ACC ATT TTG TTT AAT AGT GTG TAT-3′) and 195pro-SalI-R (5′-CCG GTC GAC TTT ACT GAT AAT ATA CAC TCT-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with KpnI and SalI and inserted into pRS314 to give pRS314-Tim40pro. The region corresponding to residues 71–403 of Tim40 followed by 418 nucleotides downstream of the TIM40 gene was cloned from pRS314-Tim40 by PCR using primers EcoRI-195mt-F (5′-CCG GAA TTC CTT TTC GCC TCA AGG AAG GTA-3′) and 195mt-SacI-R (5′-CCG GAG CTC AAA CGA ACC CGT AGG GTA TAG-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and SacI and inserted into pRS314-Tim40pro to give pRS314-Tim40pro-mt. DNA fragments for the N-terminal 220 residues of the cytochrome b2 precursor with or without the AA mutation were amplified by PCR using primers SalI-b2-F (5′-CCG GTC GAC ATG CTA AAA TAC AAA CCT TTA-3′) and b2(220)-EcoRI-R (5′-CCG GAA TTC CGC TTG TTT AGT CAA AGT TTG-3′) from the gene for pb2 (330) AA-DHFR (12Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and pb2(330)-DHFR (12Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), respectively. A DNA fragment for the N-terminal 85 residues of the cytochrome b2 precursor was cloned from the gene for pb2(330)-DHFR by PCR using primers SalI-b2-F and b2(85)-EcoRI-R (5′-CCG GAA TTC ATC GAG TTT CGG CTC GTT GTC-3′). A DNA fragment for the N-terminal 85 residues of the cytochrome b2 precursor with the AA mutation was cloned from the gene for pb2(330)AA-DHFR by PCR using primers SalI-b2-F and b2(85)AA-EcoRI-R (5′-CCG GAA TTC ATC GAG TTT CGG CGC GGC GTC-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with SalI and EcoRI and inserted into pRS314-Tim40pro-mt. Thus, plasmids containing the genes for cytochrome b2-Tim40IMS fusion proteins flanked by the promoter for TIM40 and terminator were obtained. Growth Conditions—Yeast strains were grown in YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% galactose), YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% glucose), SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose), SCGal (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% galactose), SCD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% glucose) with the appropriate supplements (13Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genomics: A Labolatory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). 5-Fluoroorotic acid (Q-BIO gene) was added to medium at 0.15%. Yeast molecular genetic techniques were performed as described (13Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genomics: A Labolatory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). For isolation of mitochondria, cells were grown in lactate medium (14Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lactate medium without glucose but containing 0.05% galactose was used to maintain the GAL-TIM40 strain. Total protein extracts were prepared from yeast cells as described (15Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Import Assays—Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized with rabbit reticulocyte lysate by coupled transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Mitochondria were isolated from yeast strains D273-10B, W303-1A, and GAL-TIM40 (see below) and incubated with radiolabeled precursor proteins in import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm KPi, 2 mm methionine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 23 °C. Import reactions were stopped by addition of valinomycin to 10 μg/ml. The mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging. Treatments of mitochondria with proteinase K (PK), Na2CO3, and Triton X-100 and preparation of mitoplasts were performed as described previously (10Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Blue-native (BN)-PAGE analyses were carried out according to Dekker et al. (16Dekker P.J.T. Martin F. Maarse A.C. Bömer U. Müller H. Guiard B. Meijer M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5408-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Preparation of Anti-Tim40 Antibodies—The gene for residues 243–403 of Tim40 was cloned from the yeast genomic DNA by PCR using primers PRTGST195F (5′-CGC GCG AAT TCA CTG TAA GTG ACT CGG AAA-3′) and PRTGST195R (5′-CGC GCC TCG AGT TAA GGT TTG GAT TCC TCA-3′). The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate a gene for the GST-Tim40 fusion protein. The fusion protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was used to immunize rabbits with complete Freund's adjuvant followed by three booster immunizations with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Tim40 Is a Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Protein—Tim40, the gene product of YKL195W, is deposited as an essential protein in the data base of the yeast deletion project (Ref. 17Winzeler E.A.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar; www-deletion.stanford.edu/YDPM/YDPM_index.html) (Fig. 1A). We analyzed its properties in mitochondrial association by treatment of isolated yeast mitochondria with PK, Na2CO3, and Triton X-100, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tim40 antibodies (Fig. 1B). Tim40 was inaccessible to protease added to intact mitochondria (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) but was accessible to protease added to mitoplasts, where the outer membrane was selectively ruptured (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). This behavior resembled that of Tim23, an inner membrane protein exposing a domain to the IMS, but is different from those of Tom70, a surface-exposed outer membrane protein, or the β subunit of F1-ATPase (F1β), a peripheral inner membrane protein on the matrix side (Fig. 1B). Tim40 was, like integral membrane proteins, Tom70 and Tim23, not extracted by alkaline treatment of mitochondria but was solubilized by treatment of mitochondria with Triton X-100 and 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8). These results indicate that Tim40 is an integral inner membrane protein exposing a domain to the IMS. The Tim40 precursor comprises 403 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). Is N terminus appears to possess a cleavable matrix-targeting presequence (Fig. 1A, underlined) followed by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues (Fig. 1A, double underlined) that is reminiscent of the inner-membrane sorting signal, as found in the precursors to cytochromes b2 and c1 and subunit Va of cytochrome c oxidase (CoxVa) (18Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Precursors to cytochromes b2 and c1 have the inner-membrane sorting signal in the form of a bipartite cleavable presequence, which receives two-step processing by mitochondrial processing peptidase in the matrix (for the N-terminal part) and by Imp1p/Imp2p on the IMS side of the inner membrane (for the C-terminal part). The CoxVa precursor has a regular matrix-targeting presequence, but not a bipartite presequence, and is anchored to the inner membrane by the N-terminal hydrophobic segment in the mature part. To test whether Tim40 has a bipartite presequence, we analyzed the in vitro import of Tim40 into isolated yeast mitochondria. The radiolabeled Tim40 precursor (44.5 kDa) synthesized with reticulocyte lysate exhibits unusually slow migration on the SDS-PAGE gel with an apparent molecular mass of 67.5 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 9, p-form). This could be due to unusual distribution of acidic amino acid residues in Tim40 (Fig. 1A). When incubated with isolated mitochondria, the Tim40 precursor was converted to the lower molecular mass form (64.5 kDa; Fig. 1C, lanes 3–7, m-form), which was sequestered to the protease protected compartment (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and was of the same size as authentic Tim40 in isolated mitochondria as detected with anti-Tim40 antibodies (Fig. 1C, lane 10). Dissipation of the membrane potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane inhibited generation of the m-form (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The presence of o-phenanthroline and EDTA, which inhibits the activity of mitochondrial processing peptidase in the matrix, prevented this processing, yielding a protease-protected precursor form (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 8, p-form). These results show that Tim40 does not have a bipartite presequence but is likely anchored to the inner membrane by its N-terminal hydrophobic stretch in the mature part. Conserved Cys Residues, but Not the N-terminal Anchor to the Inner Membrane, Are Essential for the Tim40 Functions— Next, we asked if the N-terminal anchoring of Tim40 to the inner membrane is essential for its function. For this purpose, we fused the IMS domain (residues 71–403) of Tim40 (Tim40IMS) to the N-terminal part (residues 1–220 or 1–85) of the cytochrome b2 precursor with or without the AA mutation (N80A and E81A), which removes the second processing site for Imp1p cleavage (19Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11770-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since Tim40 is essential for yeast cell viability as confirmed by tetrad analysis (data not shown), these cytochrome b2-Tim40 fusion proteins were expressed in yeast strain GAL-TIM40, in which the galactose-inducible GAL7 promoter was integrated into the chromosome in front of the TIM40 gene to achieve regulated expression of Tim40 by galactose. Immunoblotting with anti-Tim40 antibodies confirmed that pb2AA(85)-Tim40IMS and pb2AA(220)-Tim40IMS received only the first cleavage of the presequence (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 3), while pb2(220)-Tim40IMS received the first and second cleavage of the presequence (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Since pb2(85)-Tim40IMS lacks the folded heme-binding domain (residues 81–180 of cytochrome b2), which is required for the efficient cleavage by Imp1p, the second processing of pb2(85)-Tim40IMS was retarded, so that both the intermediate-size and mature forms were detected (Fig. 1D, lane 4). The apparent molecular mass of authentic Tim40 was close to that of the processed form of pb2AA(85)-Tim40IMS (Fig. 1D, lane 5), supporting that the Tim40 precursor receives only the first cleavage by mitochondrial processing peptidase. Therefore, pb2(85)-Tim40IMS, pb2AA(85)-Tim40IMS, and pb2AA(220)-Tim40IMS are anchored to the inner membrane, whereas the N terminus of pb2(220)-Tim40IMS is liberated from the inner membrane. When wild-type Tim40 was depleted by shifting cells to galactose-free medium, both wild-type and AA mutants of cytochrome b2-Tim40IMS fusion proteins could functionally complement depletion of Tim40, without causing yeast growth defects (Fig. 1E). This suggests that anchoring of the N-terminal segment to the inner membrane is not essential for the function of Tim40 in vivo. A data base search showed that open reading frames encoding possible Tim40 homologs including a putative mitochondiral targeting signal are present in the genomes of Candida albicans (EAL02677), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (NP_593316), and Neurospora crassa (XP_324302). Open reading frames encoding proteins with similarity to Tim40 were also found in the genomes of evolutionarily distant organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster (NP_733343), Danio rerio (AAH77126), Xenopus laevis (AAH68790), Mus musculus (AAH19405), and Homo sapiens (BAB71132), although, since the encoded proteins lack a typical mitochondrial presequence, their mitochondrial localization is unclear. Tim40 proteins in various organisms consist of a rather divergent, N-terminal acidic domain and a conserved C-terminal domain containing three pairs of highly conserved Cys pairs, Cys296/Cys298, Cys307/Cys317, and Cys330/Cys340, the latter two of which form C-X9-C motif (Fig. 1A) (20Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N.D. Greer L.Y. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Lanczycki C.J. Liebert C.A. Liu C. Madej T. Marchler G.H. Mazumder R. Nikolskaya A.N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Since Tim40 is essential for viability of yeast cells, we assessed the roles of these Cys pairs by testing the abilities of mutant Tim40 with replacement of one of the three Cys pairs with a pair of Ser residues to functionally replace wild-type Tim40 in vivo. Replacement of wild-type Tim40 with Tim40 mutants that lack one of the conserved Cys pairs was lethal (Fig. 1F), indicating that three pairs of conserved Cys residues of Tim40 are essential for its function. Tim40 Mediates Sorting of Small Tim Proteins to the IMS—To analyze the functions of Tim40, we depleted Tim40 by shifting GAL-TIM40 cells to galactose-free medium; cell growth of GAL-TIM40 slowed down significantly 28 h after the shift (data not shown). Total cell extracts were prepared from wild-type (WT) and GAL-TIM40 cells at various times after shift from galactose-containing medium to galactose-free medium and were analyzed by immunoblotting for various mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 2A). The amount of Tim40 in GAL-TIM40 was decreased to <6% in WT cells 24 h after shift to galactose-free medium. Components of the TOM40 complex in the outer membrane (Tom70, Tom40, Tom20), those of the TIM23 complex (Tim50, Tim44, Tim23), those of the TIM22 complex (Tim22), mitochondrial matrix proteins (Hsp60, Mdj1p, Ssc1p), and the endoplasmic reticulum protein (Sec63p) were not affected by the depletion of Tim40 at all. However, the amounts of small Tim proteins in the IMS, Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12 were significantly decreased 24 h after shift to galactose-free medium. These results suggest that Tim40 is involved in biogenesis of small Tim proteins destined for the IMS. Next, we tested the in vitro import abilities of mitochondria isolated from Tim40-depleted (Tim40↓) cells after 12 h cultivation in the absence of galactose for various radiolabeled precursor proteins. Mitochondria isolated from Tim40↓ cells did not exhibit decrease in Δψ, which is essential for protein import via the TIM23 or TIM22 complex (data not shown). We analyzed the import of radiolabeled soluble matrix and polytopic inner membrane proteins: pSu9-DHFR, a presequence-containing precursor protein that uses the TIM23 complex to move across the inner membranes, and ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), a presequence-less polytopic inner membrane protein that uses the TIM22 complex to be inserted into the inner membrane. The import rates of pSu9-DHFR (Fig. 2B) and of AAC (Fig. 2C) were not affected by depletion of Tim40. We then analyzed the import of small Tim proteins, Tim9 (Fig. 2D) and Tim13 (Fig. 2E), into WT and Tim40↓ mitochondria. In contrast to pSu9-DHFR and AAC, import of Tim9 and Tim13 into mitochondria was impaired in Tim40↓ mitochondria. These results suggest that Tim40 is involved in import of small Tim proteins into the IMS. To understand more precise roles of Tim40 in import of small Tim proteins into the IMS, we followed the in vitro assembly of small Tim proteins in the IMS of WT mitochondria by BN-PAGE. When we incubated radiolabeled Tim9 with isolated mitochondria at 30 °C and analyzed the proteins by BN-PAGE, we observed its accumulation in three distinct bands with apparent molecular masses of 70, 140, and 300 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The bands at 70 and 300 kDa shifted to the higher molecular mass range upon incubation with anti-Tim10 antibodies (Fig. 3A, lane 4). This is consistent with the previous report that the 70-kDa complex represent the Tim9-Tim10 complex and the 300-kDa complex is the Tim9-Tim10-Tim12 complex associated with the TIM22 complex (21Koehler C.M.

Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The 140-kDa complex shifted to the higher molecular mass range upon incubation with anti-Tim40 antibodies, suggesting that it contains Tim40 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). To demonstrate that the 140-kDa complex involving Tim40 is a transport intermediate on the correct Tim9 assembly pathway, we performed a chase reaction. Tim9 was incubated with mitochondria for 10 min at 16 °C, leading to formation of the 140-kDa complex alone. The mitochondria were then reisolated and incubated for indicated times at 30 °C (Fig. 3B). The amount of the 140-kDa complex decreased with increasing time, whereas those of the 70-kDa Tim9-Tim10 complex and the 300-kDa complex with the TIM22 complex increased. These results indicate that Tim9 assembles into its final complexes with Tim10 alone and with the TIM22 complex together with Tim10 and Tim12 via the 140-kDa intermediate involving Tim40. Finally, we analyzed the possible complex structure of Tim40. When mitochondria solubilized with digitonin were subjected to glycerol density-gradient centrifugation, Tim40, Tim22, and Tim23 were recovered in the fractions corresponding to 80, 320, and 270 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3C). Therefore Tim40 does not constitute the TIM22 or TIM23 complex. Nevertheless, it remains open whether Tim40 forms a homo-oligomer or a complex with other components involved in the small Tim protein assembly pathway in the IMS. How can Tim40 facilitate import of small Tim proteins into the IMS? Since Tim40 can function at the inner membrane, not necessarily in the IMS, it may mediate zinc ion binding to or disulfide-bond formation of small Tim proteins (23Koehler C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and/or assembly of small Tim proteins into hetero-oligomeric complexes on the IMS side of the inner membrane. Impairment of these processes will fail to provide small Tim proteins with a driving force for their efficient translocation across the outer membrane, as observed here with Tim40↓ mitochondria. Elucidation of the precise roles of essential Cys residues of Tim40 will certainly help us to further understand the functions of Tim40."
https://openalex.org/W2004172485,"Wnt proteins are intercellular signals that regulate various aspects of animal development. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in lin-17, a Frizzled-class Wnt receptor, and in lin-18 affect cell fate patterning in the P7.p vulval lineage. We found that lin-18 encodes a member of the Ryk/Derailed family of tyrosine kinase-related receptors, recently found to function as Wnt receptors. Members of this family have nonactive kinase domains. The LIN-18 kinase domain is dispensable for LIN-18 function, while the Wnt binding WIF domain is required. We also found that Wnt proteins LIN-44, MOM-2, and CWN-2 redundantly regulate P7.p patterning. Genetic interactions indicate that LIN-17 and LIN-18 function independently of each other in parallel pathways, and different ligands display different receptor specificities. Thus, two independent Wnt signaling pathways, one employing a Ryk receptor and the other a Frizzled receptor, function in parallel to regulate cell fate patterning in the C. elegans vulva."

Omi can also induce caspase-independent apoptosis through an as yet unknown mechanism that requires its proteolytic activity (7Blink E. Maianski N.A. Alnemri E.S. Zervos A.S. Roos D. Kuijpers T.W.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition to its pro-apoptotic function, Omi has another unique role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, but the details of this mechanism are still unclear (9Jones J.M. Datta P. Srinivasula S.M. Ji W. Gupta S. Zhang Z. Davies E. Hajnoczky G. Saunders T.L. Van Keuren M.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Meisler M.H. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The serine protease activity of Omi is necessary and essential for its normal function whether it acts as a pro-apoptotic protein in the cytoplasm or as a potential chaperone in the mitochondria (9Jones J.M.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of Omi's function, it will be necessary to identify new substrates for this protease. These substrates might be mitochondrial or cytoplasmic proteins, and their degradation and removal by Omi could be part of the apoptotic process. In this report, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate and characterize new Omi-interacting proteins. One of these interactors isolated from this screen was the HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) anti-apoptotic protein (10Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar). HAX-1 interacted with Omi both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, HAX-1 was degraded and removed by Omi when cells were treated with various apoptotic stimuli. Using a specific inhibitor of the proteolytic activity of Omi, we could block HAX-1 degradation and protect cells from apoptosis. We also used a cell line derived from motor neuron degeneration 2 (mnd2) mice that carry a mutated form of Omi affecting its proteolytic activity (9Jones J.M. Datta P. Srinivasula S.M. Ji W. Gupta S. Zhang Z. Davies E. Hajnoczky G. Saunders T.L. Van Keuren M.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Meisler M.H. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). There was little degradation of HAX-1 in these cells upon induction of apoptosis. When functional Omi was reconstituted in the mnd2 cells, degradation of HAX-1 was also restored. Our present study identified the HAX-1 protein as a new substrate for Omi. Cleavage of HAX-1 occurs in mitochondria before Omi translocates to the cytoplasm. This suggests HAX-1 degradation precedes cleavage of IAPs that takes place in the cytoplasm. HAX-1 degradation occurs in response to various apoptotic stimuli and requires the presence of a proteolytically active Omi. Our results define a new mechanism by which Omi activates apoptosis from inside the mitochondria by removing the HAX-1 anti-apoptotic protein. Furthermore, we show a very significant inverse correlation between the level of HAX-1 protein and the degree of cell death. This suggests that the HAX-1 protein (and its regulation by Omi protease) plays a central role in mammalian cell death.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Screen—EGY48 (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLex Aop6-LEU2) was used as the host yeast strain for all two-hybrid interaction experiments (11Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This yeast strain has both an integrated LEU reporter gene with upstream LexA operators as well as a pSH18–34 (LexAop-lacZ) 2 μ plasmid that directs the synthesis of β-galactosidase (12Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar).Positive protein-protein interactions between the bait and prey were initially detected by the ability of the yeast to grow on galactose-Ura-Trp-His-Leu-selective yeast plates. They were further tested on Ura-His-Trp-X-gal plates. Plasmids were rescued from positive clones and introduced into KC8 Escherichia coli by electroporation. DNA sequence was determined by sequencing both DNA strands with a commercially available kit (CEQ DTCS-Quick Start kit (Beckman Coulter)) using a CEQ 2000 DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). The presence and stability of the recombinant proteins in yeast cells was monitored by Western blot analysis with either LexA-antibodies (for baits) or HA-antibodies (for preys).Degradation Assay—The ability of His-Omi134–458 to cleave HAX-1 in vitro was investigated. For this the full-length cDNA for HAX-1 protein was cloned in the pET-28 vector (Novagen) containing the T7 promoter and used in an in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterially expressed recombinant His-Omi134–458 was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin as described (13Cilenti L. Lee Y. Hess S. Srinivasula S. Park K.M. Junqueira D. Davis H.

His-Omi134–458 (0.5 μg) was incubated with 35S-labeled HAX-1 in 20 μl of reaction volume in assay buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl). After 2 or 6 h of incubation at 37 °C the reactions were stopped through the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were grown using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen).

This mutation has been shown previously to inactivate the proteolytic activity of Omi (6Srinivasula S.M. Gupta S. Datta P. Zhang Z. Hegde R. Cheong N. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Twenty-four h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease-inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After a low spin centrifugation, the supernatant of the cell lysates was precleared by mixing them with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h followed by a GFP-polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads were then added and allowed to bind for an additional 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation, washed extensively with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. They were then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and treated with a mouse monoclonal HAX-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody.We also investigated the potential interaction between endogenous Omi and HAX-1 proteins. For this, HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and subconfluent cultures were lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Approximately 400 μg of total protein cell lysate was precleared using Protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h followed by incubation with Omi rabbit polyclonal antiserum overnight at 4 °C. A control (preimmune) antiserum was also used. Protein G-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and then resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using HAX-1 monoclonal antibodies.Western Blot Analysis—After various pro-apoptotic treatments, cells were lysed using a Triton X-100 based lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Approximately 20 μg of whole cell extracts were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall Corporation) using a semi-dry cell transfer blot (Bio-Rad). 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) was used to block nonspecific binding of the membrane. The membrane was incubated with the indicated primary antibodies: HAX-1 monoclonal antibody at 1:300 dilution (BD Biosciences), Omi rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1:5000 dilution (prepared in our lab), XIAP monoclonal antibody (BD, Transduction Laboratories) at 1:500 dilution, and β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:5,000 dilution followed by a secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5,000 dilution; the immunocomplex was then visualized by ECL (Pierce).Cell Death Assays—HK-2 cells were grown in six-well plates in the appropriate medium until they reached 80% confluence; they were then treated with ucf-101 (50 or 70 μm) for 20 min followed by cisplatin (50 μm) or H2O2 (2 mm) treatment for 14 h. HEK293 cells were treated with cisplatin (50 μm) or H2O2 (1 mm) for 14 h. mnd2-derived cell lines were treated with cisplatin (5 μm), H2O2 (100 μm), or etoposide (100 μg/ml) for 14 h. Cells were detached using 1× trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer (BD Biosciences) according to BD Biosciences protocol. Cell death was estimated by staining with Annexin V (apoptotic cell) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (necrotic cells) (15Derby E. Reddy V. Kopp W. Nelson E. Baseler M. Sayers T. Malyguine A. Immunol.

After treatment with cisplatin (50 μm) or H2O2 (1 mm) for 14 h, cell fractionation was performed using the ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (Clontech) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Cells were homogenized with a tissue grinder in a fractionation buffer mix containing protease inhibitors and dithiothreitol. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 700 × g. The pellet representing the crude nuclear fraction was discarded. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged further at 10,000 × g. Both the resultant crude pellet mitochondrial fraction and the crude supernatant cytosolic fraction were collected. The purity of the mitochondrial fractions was monitored by assaying the activity of succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase (18Gateau O. Morelis R. Louisot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The majority of the activity of these two enzymes was associated with the mitochondrial fraction. The fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the following antibodies: Omi (1:5,000), HAX-1 (1:300), XIAP (1:500), and cytochrome c (1:500).Transient Expression of HAX-1 and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—HEK293 cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected with either the EGFP-C1 vector or EGFP-HAX-1 plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Eighteen h after transfection, cells were treated with various concentrations of cisplatin (30, 50, and 70 μm) for 14 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells was estimated by staining with Annexin V. The change in the mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored by staining the cells with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) (Sigma) using the method described in Ref. 19Rasola A. Geuna M. Cytometry. 2001; 45: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar with some modifications. Briefly, each sample (1 × 106 cells) was divided in three test tubes: (a) control GFP, (b) TMRM, and (c) phycoerythrin-conjugated Annexin V, and incubated either at 37 °C ((b)) or at room temperature ((a) and (c)) for 15 min in 1× binding buffer (BD Biosciences). All samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Statistical Analysis—All quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSIsolation of Omi Interactors—We used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen three different cDNA libraries constructed in the pJG4–5 vector (11Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 12Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). We used a HeLa cDNA library (11Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) as well as cDNA libraries prepared from primary human melanocytes or keratinocytes. 2A. S. Zervos, unpublished data. We selected these cDNA libraries to screen as many diverse proteins as possible, including any potential tissue-specific interactors. Furthermore, cDNAs encoding pro-apoptotic proteins might be underrepresented or absent in cDNA libraries prepared from cell lines. The bait used was the mature, proteolytically active form of the Omi protein (amino acids 134–458) cloned in the pGilda (Clontech) bait vector. Initially, we used the PL202 (11Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) vector and found that constitutive high expression of the LexA-Omi134–458 was detrimental to yeast. Therefore, we chose to use the pGilda vector, where expression of the bait protein is under the control of the GAL1 inducible promoter that allows expression of the LexA-bait fusion protein only when yeast are grown in galactose medium. Expression and stability of the LexA-Omi134–458 was verified by Western blot analysis using LexA antibodies (results not shown). Several interacting proteins were identified in this screen. A detailed description of these interactors and their properties will be presented elsewhere. 3M. M. Soundarapandian, G. A. Kyriazis, L. Cilenti, and A. S. Zervos, unpublished data. One of the Omi interactors isolated from both the melanocyte and keratinocyte cDNA libraries was the full-length HAX-1 protein. Fig. 1 shows that HAX-1 interacts specifically and strongly with Omi in yeast. The interaction is mediated through the PDZ domain of Omi as well as its catalytic domain.The specificity of HAX-1 interaction with Omi in yeast was tested using L56/HtrA1, a mammalian homolog of Omi that has 68% amino acid sequence similarity. No interaction between HAX-1 and L56/HtrA1 was observed in this yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A).Interaction of Omi with HAX-1 in Mammalian Cells—To investigate if Omi interacts with HAX-1 in vivo, HEK293 cells were transfected with a construct encoding a proteolytically inactive form of Omi (Omi-S/A, serine 306 was replaced with alanine) fused to the GFP protein. GFP antibodies were used to precipitate GFP-Omi-S/A; the presence of any HAX-1 protein in the precipitated complex was monitored by Western blot analysis using HAX-1 antibodies. Fig. 1B shows that HAX-1 is in a complex with GFP-Omi-S/A in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, interaction between endogenous Omi and HAX-1 proteins was also investigated in HEK293 cells. Polyclonal Omi antiserum or control pre-immune serum was used to precipitate endogenous Omi and any associated proteins. The presence of HAX-1 in this immunoprecipitated complex was detected by Western blot using HAX-1 antibodies. Fig. 1D shows endogenous Omi and HAX-1 proteins interact in HEK293 cells.Omi Can Degrade HAX-1 Protein in Vitro—To test the ability of Omi to cleave the HAX-1 protein in vitro, 35S-labeled HAX-1 protein was made using a TnT-Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Bacterially made His-Omi134–458 is an active serine protease and has been described previously (13Cilenti L. Lee Y. Hess S. Srinivasula S. Park K.M. Junqueira D. Davis H. Bonventre J.V. Alnemri E.S.

Fig. 2 is an autoradiograph of an SDS-PAGE gel showing specific cleavage of 35S-labeled HAX-1 by His-Omi134–458in vitro.Fig. 2HAX-1 can be cleaved by Omi protease in vitro. In vitro translated 35S-labeled HAX-1 protein was incubated at 37 °C without (lane 1) or with 500 ng of recombinant His-Omi134–458 for 2 h (lane 2) and6h(lane 3). The reactions were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the gel was transferred on a PDVF membrane and exposed on X-OMAT-AR film.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)HAX-1 Protein Level Decreases during Cell Death—To investigate whether the level of HAX-1 protein is regulated in mammalian cells during cell death, we treated HK-2 cells with various concentrations of cisplatin or H2O2. Fig. 3 shows the protein level of HAX-1 proportionally decreases as the concentration of cisplatin is raised from 30 to 70 μm. HAX-1 protein also decreased in cells treated with increasing concentration of H2O2.Fig. 3The level of HAX-1 protein is regulated by cisplatin or H2O2 treatment. Total cell lysates were prepared from HK-2 cells after induction of apoptosis using different concentrations of cisplatin or H2O2 for 14 h. Lane 1 shows lysates from control cells treated with vehicle (N,N-dimethylformamide). Lanes 2, 3, and 4 show cell extracts from HK-2 treated with 30, 50, and 70 μm cisplatin, respectively. Lane 5 shows cell lysates without treatment; lanes 6, 7, and 8 contain lysates obtained after 1, 2, and 4 mm of H2O2 treatment. In the lower panel, β-actin antibody was used to verify that equal amounts of protein were present in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ucf-101 Inhibitor Prevents HAX-1 Degradation—We investigated whether the Omi protease is specifically responsible for the degradation of HAX-1 observed in HK-2 cells during apoptosis. To accomplish this, HK-2 cells were treated with cisplatin and the percentage of cell death was monitored by flow cytometry. Cell extracts were also prepared from the same cell populations, and the levels of HAX-1 or Omi proteins were monitored by Western blot analysis. HK-2 cells treated with 50 μm cisplatin for 14 h resulted in 94% cell death of the population (Fig. 4). The cell death in these cells coincided with a dramatic reduction in the level of HAX-1 protein. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of ucf-101, a specific inhibitor of the proteolytic activity of Omi, the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased to 66%. HAX-1 degradation was also inhibited in the presence of ucf-101. At the higher concentration of 70 μm ucf-101, cisplatin-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells was further reduced to 48%. At this higher concentration, ucf-101 also had a more pronounced effect in blocking HAX-1 degradation. The level of Omi protein in HK-2 cells did not show any significant variation under any of these conditions.Fig. 4ucf-101 protects HK-2 cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis and inhibits HAX-1 degradation. HK-2 cells were treated with 50 or 70 μm of ucf-101, and apoptosis was induced with 50 μm cisplatin for 14 h. Cell death was monitored using Annexin V (apoptosis) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (necrosis) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry (15Derby E. Reddy V. Kopp W. Nelson E. Baseler M. Sayers T. Malyguine A. Immunol. Lett. 2001; 78: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Herault O. Colombat P. Domenech J. Degenne M. Bremond J.L. Sensebe L. Bernard M.C. Binet C. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared from the same cell population and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using HAX-1 and Omi antibodies. This corresponds with increased apoptosis in the cell population. When HK-2 cells were treated with ucf-101 followed by cisplatin, the inhibitor substantially protected HAX-1 proteins and the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced (lanes 4 and 6). Lane 1 shows cell lysates obtained from untreated cells, lane 2 shows lysates after 50 μm of cisplatin, lane 3 shows lysates after treatment with 50 μm of ucf-101, lane 4 shows lysates after treatment with 50 μm of ucf-101 followed by 50 μm of cisplatin, lane 5 shows cell lysates after treatment with 70 μm of ucf-101, and lane 6 shows lysates after treatment with 70 μm of ucf-101 followed by 50 μm of cisplatin.

https://openalex.org/W1967736967,"Many viruses package their genome into preformed capsids using packaging motors powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. The hexameric ATPase P4 of dsRNA bacteriophage phi12, located at the vertices of the icosahedral capsid, is such a packaging motor. We have captured crystallographic structures of P4 for all the key points along the catalytic pathway, including apo, substrate analog bound, and product bound. Substrate and product binding have been observed as both binary complexes and ternary complexes with divalent cations. These structures reveal large movements of the putative RNA binding loop, which are coupled with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, indicating how ATP hydrolysis drives RNA translocation through cooperative conformational changes. Two distinct conformations of bound nucleotide triphosphate suggest how hydrolysis is activated by RNA binding. This provides a model for chemomechanical coupling for a prototype of the large family of hexameric helicases and oligonucleotide translocating enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1974629890,"Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is one of the most fundamental environmental-sensing mechanisms in bacteria and imparts competitive advantage by establishing priorities in carbon metabolism. In gram-positive bacteria, the master transcription regulator of CCR is CcpA. CcpA is a LacI-GalR family member that employs, as an allosteric corepressor, the phosphoprotein HPr-Ser46-P, which is formed in glucose-replete conditions. Here we report structures of the Bacillus megaterium apoCcpA and a CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-DNA complex. These structures reveal that HPr-Ser46-P mediates a novel two-component allosteric DNA binding activation mechanism that involves both rotation of the CcpA subdomains and relocation of pivot-point residue Thr61, which leads to juxtaposition of the DNA binding regions permitting ""hinge"" helix formation in the presence of cognate DNA. The structure of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre complex also reveals the elegant mechanism by which CcpA family-specific interactions with HPr-Ser46-P residues Ser46-P and His15 partition the high-energy CCR and low-energy PTS pathways, the latter requiring HPr-His15-P."
https://openalex.org/W2124296466,"Interleukin (IL)-18 is the interferon-gamma-inducing factor and has potent proinflammatory activities. IL-18 has been recently implicated in atherosclerotic plaque instability and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, it is unknown whether IL-18 expression is increased in human myocardium or if it has any role in heart failure. We analyzed the expression of IL-18, its receptor IL-18Ralpha, and its endogenous inhibitor, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) in myocardial tissue from patients with end-stage heart failure (ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy) and controls by use of quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot or immunohistochemical techniques. Plasma levels of IL-18 were also determined in 48 patients with heart failure. IL-18 mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in the myocardium of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Both ischemic and dilated myocardium showed increased IL-18Ralpha levels, suggesting potential biological effects. In addition, mRNA levels of IL-18 BP were down-regulated in the failing myocardium. Finally, plasma IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in patients with heart failure and were higher in those who died at follow-up than in survivors. The results suggest a potential role for the immunoinflammatory IL-18 signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of heart failure and identify novel therapeutic targets for future testing."
https://openalex.org/W2088811318,"The predominant forms of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases, are dimers of catalytic (C) and scaffolding (A) subunits and trimers with an additional variable regulatory subunit. In mammals, catalytic and scaffolding subunits are encoded by two genes each (α/β), whereas three gene families (B, B′, and B″) with a total of 12 genes contribute PP2A regulatory subunits. We generated stable PC12 cell lines in which the major scaffolding Aα subunit can be knocked down by inducible RNA interference (RNAi) to study its role in cell viability. Aα RNAi decreased total PP2A activity as well as protein levels of C, B, and B′ but not B″ subunits. Inhibitor experiments indicate that monomeric C and B subunits are degraded by the proteosome. Knock-down of Aα triggered cell death by redundant apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms because the inhibition of RNAi-associated caspase activation failed to stall cell death. PP2A holoenzymes positively regulate survival kinase signaling, because RNAi reduced basal and epidermal growth factor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. RNAi-resistant Aα cDNAs rescued RNAi-induced loss of the C subunit, and Aα point mutants prevented regulatory subunit degradation as predicted from each mutant's binding specificity. In transient, stable, and stable-inducible rescue experiments, both wild-type Aβ and Aα mutants capable of binding to at least one family of regulatory subunits were able to delay Aα RNAi-induced death of PC12 cells. However, only the expression of wild-type Aα restored viability completely.

The dynamic balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activities toward key substrates is crucial for cellular homeostasis. It is becoming increasingly apparent that phosphatases are just as tightly controlled as kinases, although mechanistic details largely remain to be explored.

Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) that, together with protein phosphatase 1, contributes most of the Ser/Thr phosphatase activity in cells. The PP2A catalytic subunit is a 36-kDa globular protein that associates predominantly with a 65-kDa scaffolding that associates predominantly with a 65-kD scaffolding A subunit (or PR65) to form the PP2A core dimer. In vertebrates, two genes referred to as Cα/β and Aα/β encode catalytic and scaffolding subunits, respectively. The significance of having two isoforms is unclear, although there are subtle differences in the tissue expression of the two A and C subunit genes, with α isoforms generally being more abundant (2Khew-Goodall Y.

Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that link catalytic subunits to a diverse group of regulatory subunits to form PP2A heterotrimers. Regulatory subunits have been divided into three gene families, called B (or PR55), B′ (or B56 or PR61), and B″ (or PR72/130, PR59, or PR48). Each gene family contains one to two genes in lower metazoans, such as flies and worms, and three to five members in vertebrates. The three gene families have no obvious sequence or predicted structural similarities, although loose consensus sequences for A subunit interaction have been reported (6Li X. Virshup D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Although some regulatory subunits are expressed in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific pattern, any given mammalian cell is believed to express several dozen distinct PP2A heterotrimers formed by the combination of the 16 PP2A subunit genes. This complexity presents a considerable challenge, particularly because functional redundancy can complicate the interpretation of genetic ablation experiments. Representing the only PP2A subunit knocked out to date, deletion of the major catalytic subunit (Cα) leads to early embryonic lethality, because the mesoderm does not form (21Gotz J. Probst A.

Highlighting the role of PP2A in growth control, several viruses encode proteins that subvert PP2A activity by binding to either dimeric or trimeric forms of the phosphatase (1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). To begin to address the roles of the different forms of PP2A in mammalian cells, we report here the consequences of down-regulating the major scaffolding (Aα) subunit by inducible RNAi. We find that Aα RNAi destabilizes other PP2A subunits, impairs Akt signaling, and leads to apoptotic cell death. Rescue experiments involving Aα mutants with different regulatory subunit binding specificities demonstrate that PP2A heterotrimers containing members of all three regulatory subunit families contribute to cell survival. Plasmid Construction—Two tetracycline operator (TO) sites were inserted flanking the TATA box of the H1 promoter to create a vector for doxycycline (Dox)-inducible RNAi.

To add a neomycin resistance marker, the H1-TO cassette was re-isolated by digestion with BamHI/HindIII and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) digested with BglII/HindIII. The hairpin (hp)RNA encoding sequence targeting Aα was synthesized as two complementary primers (5′-GATCCCCGGTCAAAGAGTTCTGTGAATTCAAGAGATTCACAGAACTCTTTGACCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGGTCAAAGAGTTCTGTGAATCTCTTGAATTCACAGAACTCTTTGACCGGG-3′ (reverse); Aα complementary sequence is underlined), phosphorylated, and ligated into pcDNA3.1/H1-TO. pcDNA3 plasmids expressing Aα and Aβ wild-type and Aα mutants harboring a C-terminal EE-epitope tag were described previously (3Zhou J. Pham H.T. Ruediger R. Walter G. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Gernot Walter (University of California at San Diego). The RNAi-resistant Aα cDNAs were generated by double-stranded DNA mutagenesis according to the QuikChange protocol using Pfu Ultra polymerase (Stratagene) (sense mutagenic primer was 5′-GGGCCGCAGCCTCCCACAAAGTGAAGGAATTCTGTGAAAACCTCTCAGC-3′; base changes are underlined). For Dox-inducible expression, Aα/Aβ cDNAs were excised with HindIII/XbaI and subcloned into pcDNA5/TO (Invitrogen). All PCR products were subjected to automated sequencing. Stable Cell Line Generation—PC6-3 cells stably expressing the tetracycline repressor (12Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were transfected with the linearized vector expressing Aα-directed hpRNA under the control of the H1-TO promoter and selected in 500 μg/ml G418 and 2 μg/ml blasticidin essentially as described (12Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 36 clones were expanded and screened for Dox-dependent down-regulation of Aα by immunoblotting. A-exchange cells with concomitant induction of Aα mutants were established by transfecting an inducible Aα RNAi clone with linearized, RNAi-resistant Aα cDNAs in pcDNA5/TO, followed by selection in 500 μg/ml hygromycin, 200 μg/ml G418, and 2 μg/ml blasticidin. Protein Phosphatase Assays—Aα RNAi PC6-3 cells growing in 6-well plates were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 15 min. Cleared lysates were diluted 1:100 to 1:200 in 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin. Myelin basic protein was phosphorylated with [γ-33P]ATP by protein kinase A as described (8Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and diluted to ∼10,000 cpm/μl in the same buffer. Phosphatase reactions were started by the addition of 5 μl of diluted lysate to 20 μl of diluted substrate, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with intermittent agitation on an Eppendorf shaking incubator, and terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). Following centrifugation at 22,000 × g, acid-soluble 33P-phosphate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. PP2A activity was determined by subtracting the activity in the presence of 2.5 nm okadaic acid from the total activity (30Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Less than 20% substrate dephosphorylation occurred under all assay conditions. Survival and Apoptosis Assays—Aα RNAi PC6-3 cells were cultured (37 °C with 5% CO2) in PC12 growth medium (10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640) containing 200 μg/ml G418 and 2 μg/ml blasticidin. A-exchange PC6-3 cell medium additionally contained 200 μg/ml hygromycin. For survival/apoptosis assays, cells were seeded in 24- or 96-well plates at 50,000 or 2,000 cells/well, respectively, followed by the addition of 1 μg/ml Dox or ethanol vehicle (final 0.1%) at different time points. Cell density was assayed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS tetrazolium) reduction to formazan according to the manufacturer's instructions (CellTiter 96® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay, Promega). Formazan production was quantified after 2–4 h by an absorbance measurement at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Previous apoptosis studies with PC6-3 cells have documented excellent correlation between cell counts and metabolic activity as assayed by tetrazolium salt reduction (31Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For apoptosis assays based on nuclear morphology, fixed cells in 24-well plates were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy as described (8Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For trypan blue exclusion and annexin V assays, cells were trypsinized, stained with either a 0.2% trypan blue dye solution or Cy3-conjugated annexin V according to the manufacturer's protocol (United States Biological, San Antonio, TX) and counted in a hemocytometer under transmission or epifluorescence illumination. Caspase-3/7 activity was determined by cleavage of the fluorescent substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethyl-coumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC; Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). Cells cultured in the presence or absence of 50 μm of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk; Calbiochem Novabiochem) were treated with 20 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC for 24 to 48 h prior to fluorescence measurement (excitation at 360 nm, emission at 460 nm) using a 96-well plate reader. Transfection Experiments—COS-M6 or PC6-3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (BD Biosciences), and EE epitope-tagged A subunits were immunoprecipitated as described previously (8Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase activity-based survival assays were performed by co-transfecting β-galactosidase and A subunit expression plasmids at a 1:10 mass ratio. After 0–11 days in Dox, survival was determined with a chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay (Galacto Star, Applied Biosystems). Antibodies—Pan-A (rat monoclonal 6G3), Aα (rat monoclonal 6F9), and Aβ (rabbit polyclonal) antibodies were kindly provided by Gernot Walter (University of California at San Diego). Polyclonal antibodies against B′α and B′δ were a gift from David Virshup (University of Utah), and the polyclonal PR59 antibody and pan-B antibody were from Egon Ogris (Vienna Biocenter) and Brian Wadzinski (Vanderbilt University), respectively. Antibodies obtained from commercial sources recognized the FLAG epitope (mouse monoclonal M2, Sigma; rabbit polyclonal, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), the EE epitope (Babco, Richmond, CA), the PP2A catalytic subunit (BD Pharmingen), striatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and Ser(P)-473 Akt and total Akt (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Knock-down of PP2A/Aa by Inducible RNAi—Stable knock-down of gene expression is a prerequisite for carrying out long term growth and survival studies in a homogenous cell population, and stable expression of double-stranded RNA to down-regulate endogenous mRNAs is increasingly used as a less time consuming alternative to traditional gene knock-outs (32Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 255-266PubMed Google Scholar). An inducible RNAi approach avoids a possible selection bias and allows for the analysis of essential gene products. We modified the H1 promoter, which is widely used to drive small hpRNA expression for RNAi (28Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar), by replacing evolutionarily non-conserved sequences before and after the TATA box with the bacterial TO sequence. A similar inducible construct with a single TO site between the TATA box and the transcription start site was reported recently (33Van De Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. Van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and has since become commercially available (pSUPERIOR; OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). The induction principle is illustrated in Fig. 1A. In cells expressing the tetracycline repressor (TR) protein, TR silences the hybrid H1-TO promoter in the absence of tetracycline or its more stable analog, Dox. Upon the addition of an inducer, TR dissociates from the promoter, allowing hpRNA expression and RNAi to proceed. We found the H1-TO promoter to lack detectable leak expression and to effect gene knock-down with a potency comparable to the parental H1 promoter. Importantly, this inducible system appears to require the repressor function of the native TR protein in that TR cannot be replaced with the more widely used VP16 transactivation domain fusions of the TR DNA binding domain (34Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To study the role of PP2A holoenzymes in cell survival, we chose to target the scaffolding Aα subunit because it is the best-characterized PP2A subunit in terms of structure/function (4Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 1999; 96: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 29Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used TR-expressing PC6-3 cells as a host for the inducible RNAi cassette (12Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PC6-3 cells are a subline of rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells that differentiate to a sympathetic neuronal-like phenotype upon the addition of nerve growth factor (31Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected in G418, and multiple, independently isolated clones were scored for Dox-inducible down-regulation of the endogenous A subunit by immunoblotting. Two positive clones were characterized further and exhibited identical phenotypes in survival and PP2A subunit degradation assays. Experiments with one of these clones are reported here. Proteosomal Degradation of PP2A Holoenzymes after Aα RNAi—Dox addition resulted in a time-dependent (∼70% by day 4) decrease in A subunit expression as detected with an antibody that recognizes both α and β gene products (Fig. 1, B and C). An Aα-specific antibody showed the same time course of down-regulation, indicating that Aα is the predominant scaffolding subunit isoform expressed in PC6-3 cells and that Aα down-regulation does not cause an appreciable compensatory induction of Aβ. Previous studies in Drosophila S2 cells showed that RNAi of the A or C subunit leads to the loss of the other PP2A subunits (11Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16Li X. Scuderi A. Letsou A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, Aα knock-down in mammalian cells was paralleled by a significant decrease in PP2A catalytic subunit immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, B and C), which was well matched by a decline in total PP2A phosphatase activity (Fig. 1D). In addition to the PP2A C subunit, levels of B family subunits (detected by a pan-B specific antibody) as well as B′ family subunits (detected with B′α- and B′δ-specific antibodies) fell dramatically following Aα knock-down (Fig. 2). In contrast, neither the B″ subunit PR59 nor the PP2A-associated protein striatin responded to Dox treatment for 3 days. These data suggest that C, B, and B′ family subunits are stable only when complexed to the A subunit, whereas B″ and striatin proteins can exist independently of PP2A in the cell. We have demonstrated previously that ectopically expressed, monomeric Bγ mutants are rapidly cleared by ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (7Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of PP2A subunit removal following Aα knock-down, cells were treated with MG132, a proteosomal inhibitor, or leupeptin, which inhibits lysosomal degradation, in the absence or presence of Dox. Proteosome inhibition restored C and B family subunits almost to control levels, whereas leupeptin had no effect. Neither inhibitor prevented the loss of B′ family subunits following Aα RNAi (Fig. 2). Aα Knock-down Kills Cells by Apoptotic and Non-apoptotic Mechanisms—RNAi-mediated knock-down of the single A and C subunit genes in Drosophila S2 cells causes apoptotic cell death (11Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16Li X. Scuderi A. Letsou A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We observed a drastic loss of PC6-3 cell viability starting 4 days after Dox treatment to induce Aα-directed hpRNA expression, with almost complete cell loss by 8 days after the Dox treatment (Fig. 3A). In a second, independently isolated clonal cell line with slower kinetics of Aα down-regulation, cell death was first detectable 6 days after Dox addition (data not shown). These results indicate that PC6-3 cells can tolerate a ∼70% drop in Aα levels before viability is compromised. As a control, inducible RNAi of the Bα regulatory subunit of PP2A was associated with a modest (∼20%) decrease in cell number over the same time course, which appeared to be due to a slowing of proliferation rather than mortality (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Starting 4 days after Dox treatment, Aα RNAi was associated with cell rounding and the appearance of membrane blebs (Fig. 3B, inset). Additionally, we observed increases in membrane permeability, annexin V staining, and condensed/fragmented nuclear morphology (Fig. 3B), which occurred over the same time course as the loss of viability (Fig. 3A). As further evidence of apoptotic cell death, Aα RNAi was found to result in a time-dependent increase in caspase-3/7 activity, which could be abolished by the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm; Fig. 3C). In the same experiments, however, caspase inhibition was unable to prevent the cell death caused by PP2A down-regulation (Fig. 3D). Importantly, the same dose of Z-VAD-fmk completely blocked apoptosis induced by 100 nm stauroporine (data not shown), as was reported previously for PC12 cells (35Ivins K.J. Ivins J.K. Sharp J.P. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2107-2112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The inability of Z-VAD-fmk to restore viability in PP2A-depleted cells stands in marked contrast to Drosophila studies, which showed that caspase knock-down overcomes PP2A RNAi-mediated cell death (16Li X. Scuderi A. Letsou A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It would appear that in mammalian cells the loss of PP2A activity initiates redundant caspase-dependent (apoptotic) and caspase-independent cell death programs. Aα Knock-down Impairs Akt Phosphorylation—The Ser/Thr kinase Akt/PKB transduces survival signals from a variety of growth factor receptors (36Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). We analyzed Akt signaling by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes Ser(P)-473, which is tightly correlated with activity. At the time point analyzed, 3 days with or without Dox, Aα subunit level and cellular PP2A activity are diminished by ∼60 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 1), whereas cells are still completely viable (Fig. 3). We found that Dox treatment decreased basal Akt phosphorylation by 50%. In cells stimulated for 5 and 15 min with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), Aα RNAi caused a similar reduction in phospho-Akt without changing total Akt protein levels (Fig. 4). These results indicate that PP2A holoenzymes are necessary for proper activation of the survival kinase Akt. RNAi Resistant Aα Mutants Prevent Holoenzyme Degradation—Gernot Walter's group has identified several mutations in the N-terminal half of Aα that modulate its ability to interact with select regulatory subunit families without effecting C subunit association (29Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, Glu-100 and Glu-101 of Aα form critical salt bridges with basic residues on regulatory subunits (7Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the Aα EE100RR mutant can hence only form PP2A dimers in the cell. The Aα DWF139HA"

Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). PKC and PKB/AKT kinase domains are related by sequence homology; however, there are key structural differences in the regulatory domains and second messenger cofactor requirements. PKB/AKT contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain regulated by phosphoinositide second messengers, a central catalytic kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory region facilitating key protein-protein interactions with signaling molecules like Src kinase (2Jiang T. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15789-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PKC kinases can be regulated by calcium, diacylglycerol, and phorbol esters and are divided into three subfamilies based on their cofactor requirements (3Tan S.L. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar): conventional (PKCα, PKCβI, PKC βII, PKCγ), novel (PKCδ, PKCϵ, PKCθ, PKCη), and atypical (PKCζ, PKCι, PKCλ, PKCμ) isoforms. PKC kinases have a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory co-factor-binding domain. The N-terminal motifs comprise the phosphatidylserine- and diacylglycerol-binding C1 motifs and calcium-binding C2 domain, in addition to a pseudosubstrate sequence motif that is regulated by cofactor binding. The closely related PKC isoforms have been shown to have important roles in T cells (PKCα, PKCθ), B cells and mast cells (PKCβ, PKCδ), and macrophages (PKCϵ), contributing to adaptive and innate immunity (3Tan S.L. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Both PKCθ and PKB/AKT are implicated in T cell signaling leading to T cell activation and survival (4Arendt C.W. Albrecht B. Soos T.J. Littman D.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Bauer B. Krumbock N. Fresser F. Hochholdinger F. Spitaler M. Simm A. Uberall F. Schraven B. Baier G. J. Biol.

Leitges M. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the expression and role of PKCθ are relatively restricted to T cells, with signaling in response to TCR stimulation contributing to T cell activation and cytokine production (7Altman A. Villalba M. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Pfeifhofer C. Kofler K. Gruber T. Tabrizi N.G. Lutz C. Maly K. Leitges M. Baier G. J. Exp.

Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). PKCθ co-localizes to the immunological synapse in response to T cell activation (10Diaz-Flores E. Siliceo M. Martinez A.C. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29208-29215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCθ inhibition is potentially desirable in T cell leukemias (11Villalba M. Altman A. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2002; 2: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and T cell-mediated allergic and autoimmune disorders. Among AGC superfamily kinases, the kinase domain crystal structures have been determined for both PKB/AKT- and cAMP-dependent PKA (12Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar) but not for a PKC isoform. The homologies in the kinase domain ATP-binding site have been a challenge in the development of highly specific inhibitors as disease therapies (1Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 13Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Structural elucidation of kinase active sites and comparison with that of closely related family members greatly increases our understanding of the mechanism of enzyme action and divulges issues regarding selectivity. A Rho kinase (AGC superfamily) inhibitor Fasudil/HA1077/1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)homopiperazine HCl, belonging to the isoquinoline sulfonamide class of compounds, also inhibits both PKA and PKC in a reversible and ATP competitive manner (14Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). This kinase inhibitor is a therapeutic drug in treating cerebral vasospasm and has recently been co-crystallized with the PKA catalytic subunit to define key interactions of the kinase inhibitor within the ATP binding site (15Breitenlechner C.

The crystal structure of PKA revealed that the invariant amino acids in the highly conserved kinase catalytic core are clustered at the sites of nucleotide binding and catalysis (13Knighton D.R.

The PKB/AKT active enzyme structure complexed with AMP-PNP and substrate peptide revealed mechanistic implications of key phosphorylations of the kinase domain (16Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). More recently, the comparison of the PKB/AKT structure with PKA structure (17Gassel M. Breitenlechner C.B. Ruger P. Jucknischke U. Schneider T. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) provided explanations for distinct substrate specificities of the similar active kinase domain conformations. Yang et al. (16Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) have also speculated potential PKC, SGK, p70, and p90 S6 kinase substrate interactions based on homologies with the GSK-3 substrate binding residues of PKB/AKT. Till now these mechanistic insights remained to be confirmed by a PKC crystal structure, and the studies presented here attempt to define PKC kinase domain characteristics. We report the x-ray structure elucidation of the PKCθ catalytic domain, with mechanistic insights into similarities and distinctions from the closely related PKB/AKT and PKA catalytic domains. In addition, the structural information of the staurosporine-complexed PKCθ kinase domain presented here will aid in the rational design and optimization of selective small molecule inhibitors for therapeutic use for inhibiting PKCθ in specific targeting of T cells. Expression and Purification—The C-terminal catalytic domain of PKCθ (residues 362–706) was cloned into a pET-16b expression vector. This vector introduced a hexahistidine tag to the C terminus of the expressed protein, and a methionine-glycine amino acid pair was introduced at the N terminus by cloning. The plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3 for overexpression. A 10-liter cell culture was expanded at 37 °C to an A600 of about 0.4. The temperature was then lowered to 25 °C before addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce expression. The cells were grown for an additional 4 h before they were harvested. Harvested cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 50 μm ATP, and protease inhibitors and lysed using a microfluidizer. The lysate was applied to 20 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was subsequently poured as a chromatography column and washed extensively with the same buffer including 25 mm imidazole. Protein bound to the resin was eluted with 200 mm imidazole buffer and then immediately loaded onto an anion exchanger HQ. The column was washed with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 50 μm ATP before being resolved by the application of a linear gradient from 25 to 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing PKCθ were selected by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and diluted 2-fold with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT and loaded onto a heparin chromatography column. The flow-through was applied to a hydroxyapatite column and washed extensively with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT. A linear gradient of sodium phosphate from 0 to 100 mm eluted the target protein. The protein was then sized as a monomer on a Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column. The purified protein was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT and concentrated to 7 mg/ml (determined by the Bradford assay) before being used for crystallization experiments. Kinase Assays and Data Analysis—ATP, ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzymes, staurosporine, acetonitrile, and the buffer HEPES were purchased from Sigma. Peptide substrate was purchased from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA), Syn Pep (Dublin, CA), or Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The enzymatic activity determined using the coupled pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase assay followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The standard reaction, except where indicated, was carried out in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT, 0.008% Triton, 100 mm NaCl, 20 units of pyruvate kinase, 30 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The PKCθ concentration was in the range of 0.156–0.312 μg/ml. The kinetic analysis was carried out in a 384-well plate at 25 °C on a Molecular Devices spectrophotometer in a final volume of 0.080 ml. The steady state kinetic parameters were determined in the buffer described above containing varied sucrose or Ficoll 400. Data were fitted to Equation 1 for normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics,ν=Vmax[S]/Km+[S](Eq.1) where [S] is the substrate, Vmax is the maximum enzyme velocity, and Km is the Michaelis constant. For inhibition kinetics the data were fitted to a competitive inhibition model in Equation 2,ν=Vmax[S]/Km(1+[I]/Kis)+[S](Eq.2) where Kis is the slope inhibition constant. The data were analyzed using Sigma Plot 2000 Enzyme Kinetics Module from SPSS Science (Richmond, CA). Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals with staurosporine were obtained at 18 °C from hanging drops containing 1 μl of protein:staurosporine solution (at ∼1:1 molar ratio) and 1 μl of precipitating solution (2 m ammonium sulfate, 40 mm DTT, and 0.1 m bis-tris, pH 5.0). The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2, with one protein-staurosporine complex in crystallographic asymmetric unit. Prior to data collection, crystals were stabilized in solution containing mother liquor plus 25% glycerol and flash-frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream. The x-ray diffraction data were collected to 2-Å resolution at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA) using a Quantum-4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems) and then reduced and scaled with HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMORE (19P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using the structure of PKA (PDB code: 1STC (20Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D.

The rotation and translation function solutions were found using data from 8 to 3.5 Å. The BUSTER program (21Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were applied in generating maximum entropy omit maps to overcome model bias and to produce a more detailed map for the bound inhibitor. Several rounds of rebuilding (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and refinement were performed. To further reduce model bias and to generate better maps, an “average map” was calculated using CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. De Lano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuzewski J. Nigles M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Somonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) by overlapping seven protein kinase coordinates including those of PKA. The resulting electron density maps were of better quality, especially for loop regions in the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe). The model was further rebuilt and refined, and the quality of the model was judged by the decrease in R-factors. Refinement converged after many rebuilding cycles to an R-factor of 0.201 and Rfree of 0.216. Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model contains protein residues 377–649 and 688–696, two phosphate groups attached at Thr-538 and Ser-695, one staurosporine molecule, and 115 water molecules. Residues 362–376 from the N terminus, C-terminal region 650–687, and residues 697–706 at the very C terminus were not detected in the electron density maps due to disordering. Structural figures were generated using PyMOL (24De Lano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.

Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), PDB code: 106L) via automatic alignment (using weights of 1.0 for both sequence homology and structural homology) in the Protein Design module of Quanta (Accelrys (2004), San Deigo, CA). The alignment was further adjusted manually to improve the overlap of the “hinge region” backbone (residues 459–461 in PKCθ) between the two structures. The initial positioning in the PKCθ structure of the ATP analog AMP PNP in the ATP binding site, the peptide in its binding site, and the glycine-rich loop was determined by the alignment. The GSK-3 peptide was mutated to the PKCθ activation segment (532GDAKTNTFCG541) peptide in one case and the hydrophobic motif peptide (689NMFRNFSFMN698) in the other case. The conformation and position of residues 386–395 (the glycine-rich loop plus two residues on either side) was taken from the PKB-β structure. First, the attachment points for the loop, residues 386–388 and 696–698, were energy minimized keeping the remainder of the structure fixed. Next, the peptide, the glycine-rich loop, AMP-PNP, and the surrounding residues (with an atom within 8 Å) were minimized subject to decreasing harmonic constraints. Finally, the peptide was fully minimized keeping the remainder of the structure fixed. The minimizations were carried out using CHARMm (Ref. 25Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J.

Analysis of Protein Construct and Overall Structure—The bacterially expressed PKCθ kinase domain used for structure determination (residues 362–706) showed higher molecular weight than expected. Treatment by λ-phosphatase and subsequent molecular mass determination by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry indicated that the protein is phosphorylated at either six or seven amino acid residues (roughly a 50:50 mixture). The purified PKCθ kinase domain was shown to have a higher specific activity than the full-length, commercially available PKCθ. Further characterizations of its catalytic activity demonstrated that it has an apparent Km of ∼49 μm for ATP and Km of ∼6.5 μm for a peptide derived from the PKCα pseudosubstrate, as indicated in Table II. Details of mass spectrometric analysis of phosphorylation sites and catalytic domain enzymatic characterization will be published elsewhere. 2Z.-B. Xu, D. Chaudhary, S. Olland, S. Wolfrom, R.

Within the PKC subfamily, isozymes display more than 60% sequence identity in the kinase domain and share three conserved phosphorylation motifs (Fig. 1). The overall fold of the catalytic domain of PKCθ is very close to other protein kinase structures solved, with most similarities to those of PKB/AKT and PKA (Fig. 2). The conserved core of the structure is made of a small N-terminal lobe (residues 377–461) and a large C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) (residues 466–696), connected by a hinge linker (residues 462–465). The N-lobe is based on a five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β5) and two α-helices (αB and αC), and the C-lobe is mostly helical consisting of eight α-helices (αD–αK). The ATP-binding site, occupied by staurosporine, with the adjacent peptide-substrate binding site open to solvent, constitute the active site cleft at the interface of the two lobes.

Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). As in most Ser/Thr kinase structures reflecting active enzymes (28Johnson L.N. Noble E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), helix αC (residues 421–437) is properly aligned for substrate binding and catalysis, and the activation loop (residues 522–544) bearing the essential phosphothreonine Thr-538(P) (29Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R.J. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) is well ordered and in an extended conformation. The C-terminal hydrophobic motif (HM) FXXFS* (residues 691–695), another conserved feature across AGC family, is adjacent to the hydrophobic groove of the N-lobe, in a location similar to the FXXF-binding pocket in PKA and PKB. Like in PKB, but in contrast to PKA that terminates with the FXXF sequence, HM in PKCθ contains phosphoserine at position 695 (Ser-695(P)), a phosphorylation that substantially effects the PKCθ kinase activity (29Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R.J. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PKCθ has an additional conserved phosphorylation site referred to as the turn motif (residues 662–685 and Fig. 1). In the structure, a long polypeptide linker between the kinase domain and the C-terminal HM (residues 650–687) is disordered; therefore the region corresponding to the turn motif is not defined in the electron density maps. There is also no observable electron density for residues C-terminal to HM (residues 697–706). In both PKA and PKB, the corresponding C-terminal linker is structurally ordered extending across the ATP-binding cleft (Fig. 2B). Compared with PKB, where HM is contained in the 17-residue-long stretch, HM seen in the PKCθ structure is considerably shorter (residues 688–696) and displays high b-factor values. Together these observations indicate that the C-terminal tail of PKCθ encompassing the turn motif and HM is intrinsically flexible either in this particular crystal form or in the absence of other functional domains or substrates. Binding of Staurosporine—The natural broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, with micromolar potency against only few kinases and low nanomolar potency against most kinases, has been shown to have a higher degree of selectivity toward PKC kinases (as reviewed in Ref. 30Meggio F. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Cesaro L. Guerra B. Meyer T. Mett H. Fabbro D. Furet P. Dobrowska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our kinetics data on PKCθ activity in the presence of staurosporine indicate it to be a strong, ATP competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.33 nm (Table II). Associations maintaining this tight interaction are clearly and well defined by electron density (Fig. 3A) and will be described in comparison with the binding of staurosporine to PKA (PDB code: 1STC (20Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1627-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)). As expected, these high affinity ligands bind to the related enzymes in a generally similar binding mode. Staurosporine resides in the ATP-binding pocket, forming four potential hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone (Fig. 3A) and extensive van der Waals contacts with the surrounding residues from both lobes and the hinge linker (Table III). Hydrogen bonding between the lactam ring of staurosproine (N-1, O-5) and the hinge polypeptide (O-459, N-461) is well reproduced in all protein kinase-staurospori"

Whereas Fbw7α and -γ are nuclear and the β-isoform is cytoplasmic in 293T cells, all three isoforms induce cyclin E destruction in an in vivo degradation assay. Cyclin E is phosphorylated on Thr62, Ser88, Ser372, Thr380, and Ser384in vivo. To examine the roles of phosphorylation in cyclin E turnover, a series of alanine point mutations in each of these sites were analyzed for Fbw7-driven degradation. As expected, mutation of the previously characterized residue Thr380 to alanine led to profound defects of cyclin E turnover, and largely abolished association with Fbw7. Mutation of Thr62 to alanine led to a dramatic reduction in the extent of Thr380 phosphorylation, suggesting an indirect effect of this mutation on cyclin E turnover. Nevertheless, phosphopeptides centered at Thr62 associated with Fbw7, and residual binding of cyclin ET380A to Fbw7 was abolished upon mutation of Thr62, suggesting a minor role for this residue in direct association with Fbw7. Mutation of Ser384 to alanine also rendered cyclin E resistant to degradation by Fbw7, with the largest effects being observed with Fbw7β. Cyclin ES384A associated more weakly with Fbw7α and -β isoforms but was not defective in Thr380 phosphorylation. Analysis of the localization of cyclin E mutant proteins indicated selective accumulation of cyclin ES384A in the nucleus, which may contribute to the inability of cytoplasmic Fbw7β to promote turnover of this cyclin E mutant protein.

Flux through signaling pathways is controlled, in large part, by regulated protein destruction and reversible protein phosphorylation. During the last few years, it has become clear that, in many cases, protein destruction is initiated by site-specific phosphorylation of the target protein, which then facilitates the interaction of the target protein with the destruction machinery. Much of the ubiquitination that occurs in response to protein phosphorylation occurs via the SCF ubiquitin ligase pathway. Phosphorylated proteins are ubiquitinated by an E1-E2 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; MS, mass spectrometry. thiol-ester cascade, wherein the E2 is brought to the phosphorylated substrate via an SCF E3 (1Deshaies R.J.

Many F-box proteins contain C-terminal protein-protein interaction domains including WD40 and leucine-rich repeats that allow for specific target recognition. Several F-box proteins, including Cdc4 and Grr1 in yeast and β-TRCP (β-transducin-repeat containing protein), Skp2, and Fbw7 in humans, have been demonstrated to interact with target proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (5Skowyra D.

Structural and biochemical analysis of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1, a target of the SCFCdc4 complex, has revealed a complex relationship between Sic1 phosphorylation events and recognition by WD40 repeats in Cdc4 (18Nash P.

In essence, a minimum of six phosphorylation events are required for recognition through a single phosphodegron binding site on Cdc4. Each of these phosphorylation events generates phosphodegrons that are, in isolation, suboptimal for tight binding with Cdc4 (18Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B.

In contrast, structural analysis of the β-TRCP F-box protein responsible for destruction of IκBα and β-catenin indicates that two phosphorylation events are recognized as a unit by a specific network of basic residues (25Wu G.

The extent to which other substrates of the Cdc4 class of F-box proteins require multiple phosphorylation events is unknown. In this work, we have examined how phosphorylation is used to regulate the interaction of the human G1 cyclin, cyclin E, with the WD40 containing F-box protein, Fbw7. Fbw7 is most closely related to Cdc4 in budding yeast (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Science. 2004; 303: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) as well. RNAi against Fbw7 in humans or its Drosophila ortholog Ago leads to increased levels of cyclin E in tissue culture cells (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Nature. 2001; 413: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition, mice deficient in Fbw7 die during embryogenesis (∼10.5 days postcoitum) and both the embryo and the placenta display stabilization of cyclin E and Notch (32Tetzlaff M.T. Yu W. Li M. Zhang P. Finegold M. Mahon K. Harper J.W. Schwartz R.J. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3338-3345Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Finally, Fbw7 can ubiquitinate cyclin E in vitro (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 21Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Mammalian cyclin E functions to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) at the G1/S transition. Previous work has demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr380 in cyclin E, in part via an autophosphorylation mechanism, is required for its rapid turnover (33Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 34Won K.A. Reed S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4182-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This residue can also be phosphorylated by GSK3β to promote turnover (35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although mutation of Thr380 to alanine greatly stabilizes cyclin E, its turnover in vivo or ubiquitination in vitro is not completely eliminated (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 21Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also implicated phosphorylation of Thr62 and Ser384 in cyclin E turnover by Fbw7β (21Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), but whether this reflects direct or indirect effects in Fbw7 recognition is not clear. Thr62 conforms to a Cdk2 consensus site but the identity of kinases involved in Thr62 phosphorylation are currently unknown (35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Available data indicates that phosphorylation of Thr62 is required for phosphorylation of Ser58 by GSK3β (35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser384 is dependent upon interaction of cyclin E with active Cdk2, and it has been proposed that Ser384 is directly phosphorylated by Cdk2 (35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To understand in greater detail how Fbw7 recognizes cyclin E and promotes its turnover, we have used mass spectrometry to confirm and extend recent peptide mapping studies of cyclin E phosphorylation and have performed a series of biochemical and mutagenic experiments that examine the role of multiple phosphorylation events in recognition and turnover of cyclin E by three specific isoforms of Fbw7, α, β, and γ. The data indicate both direct and indirect roles for Thr62 in binding to Fbw7. Whereas synthetic peptides encompassing Thr62 bind Fbw7 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, the major effect seen upon mutation of Thr62 to alanine is a dramatic reduction in the extent of Thr380 phosphorylation, suggesting an indirect effect of the T62A mutation on cyclin E degradation through the Thr380 degron. Nevertheless, residual association of cyclin ET380A with Fbw7 is reduced upon mutation of Thr62 to alanine. Mutation of Ser384 to alanine reduced turnover of cyclin E by all three isoforms of Fbw7, although the effects seen with Fbw7β were much greater than that observed with α and γ. Cyclin ES384A associated more weakly than wild-type cyclin E with both Fbw7α and Fbw7β. Unlike other cyclin E mutants examined, cyclin ES384A appeared to be preferentially retained in the nucleus, partially explaining the reduced ability of cytoplasmic Fbw7β to promote cyclin E turnover. Plasmids, Transfections, and Immunofluorescence—The pCS2-Myccyclin E expression plasmid employed was from a previous study (33Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated using the Gene Editor System (Promega). Vectors for expression of FLAG-Fbw7α, -β, and -γ were created in pCMV-FLAG (Sigma). To create an Fbw7γ expression plasmid, PCR was used to amplify Fbw7γ-specific sequences from a brain cDNA library. The oligonucleotides used were as follows: forward, GATCAAGCTTATGTCAAAACCGGGAAAACCTACTC; reverse, TGTCTGAGCTGCTTGTAGCAGGTC. The 570-bp PCR product was digested with HindIII and BspMI and ligated into the pCMV-FLAG-Fbw7 backbone previously digested with HindIII and BspMI, and the product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids used for expression of untagged Fbw7 mutants were described previously (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To generate an expression plasmid for dominant negative Cul1, sequences encoding amino acids 1–453 were cloned into pcDNA3 (12Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Crossref Google Scholar). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The indicated quantities of DNA were used in either calcium phosphate- or Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science)-mediated transfections. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were either lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) or were processed for immunofluorescence. Microscopy and Image Analysis—For immunofluorescence, cells transfected with cyclin E or Fbw7α/β/γ plasmids were grown on ultrathin cover slides (Fisher) and fixed in methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were then blocked with 5% goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min, incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Myc or anti-FLAG at 1:100) for 1 h, washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, and generously washed. Nuclei were then counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and cells were mounted in Slow-Fade Light Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). To visualize subcellular localization of Fbw7 isoforms, images were taken on a Nikon/DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision) as a series of 0.2-μm-thick Z-sections and processed with a Softworx image work station. Each image represents single transcellular Z-section. For fluorescence signal quantification, cells were fixed and immunostained as described above 48 h post-transfection with the indicated wild type and mutant cyclin E-expressing plasmid. Images were recorded with an empirically chosen, constant exposure time on an Olympus BX60 microscope fitted with a Hammamatsu CCD camera. For processing, an ImagePro Plus work station (Media Cybernetics Inc.) was employed. Fluorescence intensity profiles were measured and averaged along intranuclear or intracytoplasmic linear tracks, and obtained values were normalized against internal background controls for each visual field. Results were calculated as y = Δ(x(Nnorm/Cnorm); wt(Nnorm/Cnorm)), using averaged N/C ratios for 15 cells/construct. Statistical significance was confirmed by analysis of variance. Immunoprecipitation and Protein Interactions—To examine cyclin E degradation, lysates from transfected cells were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies (Covance). To examine cyclin E turnover, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and 36 h later, cells were cultured for 1 h in methionine-free medium prior to pulse labeling with [35S]methionine (0.1 mCi/ml). Twenty minutes later, [35S]methionine-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 mm cold methionine. Extracts made at the indicated times were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies. Immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and quantitation using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To examine association of FLAG-Fbw7α with cyclin E post-transfection, extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies, and immune complexes were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies. To examine the extent of cyclin E phosphorylation at Thr380, anti-cyclin E immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Thr380 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-Myc antibodies. The absence of reactivity of anti-phospho-Thr380 antibodies with cyclin ET380A points to the specificity of the antibodies employed. For peptide binding experiments, the indicated synthetic peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel-10 beads (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Immobilized peptides (7 μl) were incubated with the indicated in vitro translation products (5 μl) in a total volume of 120 μl of NETN (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of NETN prior to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In some cases, Thr62-containing peptides were employed as competitor. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide containing Thr62 (SLIPpTPDK) were made by Phospho-Solutions, Inc. (Aurora, CO). Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant cyclin E was produced in insect cells as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as described (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To produce mammalian cell-derived cyclin E for mass spectrometry, pCS2-Myc-cyclin E was transfected into four 150-mm dishes using Fugene 6. Subsequently, Myc-cyclin E was isolated using immobilized 9E10 antibodies and purified by SDS-PAGE for mass spectral analysis. Approximately 500 ng of cyclin E was recovered for mass spectral analysis, based on Coommassie Blue staining (data not shown). Mass spectral analysis of phosphopeptides in cyclin E was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry with delayed extraction (Voyager-DE; Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Unless otherwise noted, an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ; Finnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary high pressure liquid chromatograph (Magic 2002, Auburn, CA) was used for identification of phosphorylation sites. Cyclin E81–98 was sequenced by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography/MS/MS) using a Q-TOF micro (Micromass). Analysis of Cyclin E Phosphorylation in Vivo—Previous studies of cyclin E have demonstrated that mutation of Thr380 or Thr62 to nonphosphorylatable alanine leads to partial stabilization of cyclin E in transfected cells, whereas simultaneous mutation of both leads to further stabilization (21Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Additionally, these mutations lead to reduced ubiquitination efficiency in vitro (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 21Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Precisely how these phosphorylation events facilitate recognition by Fbw7 is unclear. In addition, it is possible that additional phosphorylation events in cyclin E are important for recognition by Fbw7. Recent studies have identified five cyclin E phosphorylation sites, Ser58, Ser75, Ser372, Thr380, and Ser384, by conventional peptide mapping (35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Using mass spectrometry, we confirmed and extended these results in cyclin E purified from mammalian cells after transfection with a pCMV-Myc-cyclin E expression plasmid and in cyclin E expressed in insect cells with Cdk2 (Table I). In brief, various forms of cyclin E363–386 were found to contain either two or three phosphates, as determined by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase. Peptide sequencing by liquid chromatography/MS/MS identified Ser372, Thr380, and Ser384 as sites of phosphorylation in the triply phosphorylated peptide (Table I). Peptide sequencing of the cyclin E81–98 peptide by liquid chromatography/MS/MS demonstrated phosphorylation on Ser88 (Table I and data not shown). Ser88 in cyclin E has not been previously shown to be phosphorylated but does conform to a minimal Cdk2 consensus site. In these experiments, we did not observe phosphopeptides containing either Ser58, which is known to be phosphorylated (35Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), or Thr62, possibly due to the large size and cysteine-rich character of the predicted tryptic peptide. Therefore, antibodies directed at phospho-Thr62 were generated using a synthetic peptide as antigen. Immunoblotting of affinity-purified Myc-tagged wild-type or T62A cyclin E with these antibodies revealed specific interaction with wild-type but not T62A cyclin E (Fig. 1C). Moreover, treatment of Myc-cyclin E with λ-phosphatase resulted in loss of reactivity toward the phospho-Thr62 antibody, consistent with a specific phosphorylation-dependent interaction (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that cyclin E is phosphorylated on Thr62 in tissue culture cells. Overall, these data lead to the conclusion that cyclin E is phosphorylated on at least three sites in the C terminus and at least four sites near the N terminus (Fig. 1B).Table IAnalysis of cyclin E phosphorylation by mass spectrometryTryptic fragmentCalculated massObserved mass293TInsect cellsDaDaF14-15 (aa 81-98)aaa, amino acids.1934.32014.2 (1P)2014.5bPhosphopeptides sequenced by liquid chromatography/MS/MS.

Open table in a new tab Contribution of Phosphorylation to Fbw7-mediated Cyclin E Turnover in Vivo—Currently, three distinct isoforms of Fbw7 (α, β, and γ) have been described (17Koepp D.M.

We first asked where these proteins are localized in the cell. However, because anti-Fbw7 antibodies suitable for immunofluorescence are not available, we used transient transfection of Fbw7 expression vectors in which the N terminus was tagged with a FLAG epitope. In 293T cells, we found that both Fbw7α and Fbw7γ are localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, Fbw7β is almost exclusively found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). We previously reported that Fbw7β has an apparent transmembrane domain near the N terminus (17Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), and this may be involved in localizing Fbw7β to endoplasmic reticulum membranes.

Recent work indicates that telomerase shuttles between subcellular compartments during assembly and in response to specific stimuli. In particular, telomerase colocalizes with nucleoli in normal human fibroblasts. Here, we show that nucleolin, a major nucleolar phosphoprotein, interacts with telomerase and alters its subcellular localization. Nucleolin binds the human telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT) through interactions with its RNA binding domain 4 and carboxyl-terminal RGG domain, and this binding also involves the telomerase RNA subunit hTERC. The protein-protein interaction between nucleolin and hTERT is critical for the nucleolar localization of hTERT.

To understand telomerase RNP assembly, we wished to identify proteins that regulate hTERT nucleolar localization. Here we show that nucleolin interacts with hTERT in a manner dependent upon hTERC and that this interaction plays an important role in regulating the nucleolar localization of telomerase. Plasmids—The bacterial and mammalian expression vectors for full sized nucleolin and nucleolin mutants as well as the mammalian expression vectors pNKZFLAG-hTERT (amino-terminal FLAG-tagged hTERT), pNCZFLAG-hTERT (carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged hTERT), and pNKZGST-hTERT (amino-terminal GST-fused hTERT) have been described previously (22Murakami S.

We generated an amino-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-hTERT fusion protein by replacing the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope in pNKZFLAG-hTERT with EGFP cDNA (pNKZEGFP-hTERT). EGFP cDNA was obtained by PCR using pLEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Clontech) as a template. pGRN164 vector containing hTERC cDNA was linearized with FspI and used as a template for hTERC RNA preparation as described previously (5Masutomi K.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-nucleolin fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (26Yamashita T. Kaneko S. Shirota Y. Qin W. Nomura T.

Briefly, the transformed bacterial cells (BL21) were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (-), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation of the sonicated lysates, the supernatants were passed through DEAESepharose, and the GST fusion proteins were recovered using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed, and the GST fusion proteins were then eluted with glutathione. The eluted solution was dialyzed against buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 12 h. Amino-terminally FLAG-tagged, recombinant hTERT was produced using baculovirus expression system in High5 insect cells as described previously (5Masutomi K. Kaneko S. Hayashi N. Yamashita T.

Preparation of Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested, washed with PBS (-), and sonicated in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm leupeptin, 10 mm aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates derived from 5 × 106 cells were diluted 10-fold in the lysis buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and precleared by incubation with GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Precleared lysates were incubated with 10 μl of GammaBind G resin with prebound α-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or α-GST (Z-5, Santa Cruz) antibodies at 4 °C for 4 h. Resins were preblocked in lysis buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After an extensive washing (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm leupeptin, 10 mm aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies specific for GST (B-14, Santa Cruz) or the FLAG epitope (M2). For RNase treatment, the same lysates were divided into two tubes and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the presence or absence of 0.1 μg/μl RNase A followed by the addition of affinity resins. For in vitro GST pull-down experiments, 260 ng of recombinant GST-nucleolin fusion protein was mixed with 220 ng of recombinant FLAG-hTERT in the presence or absence of 250 ng of in vitro transcribed hTERC in a binding buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 250 ng/ml yeast total RNA. The bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with α-GST (B-14) or α-FLAG M2 antibodies. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—IMR90 (normal human lung fibroblasts), Huh7, HLE (hepatoma cell lines), VA13 (SV40-transformed lung fibroblast, subline 2RA) and VA13+hTERC (VA13 cells with stable expression of hTERC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (CELLect R GOLD) and 20 μg/ml antibiotics (ampicillin and kanamycin; Meigi Co., Ltd.) and maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on glass slides were washed once in PBS (-) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (-) for 20 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (-) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody in a humidifying chamber for 1 h, washed three times with PBS (-), and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed five times in PBS (-) and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium. Immunofluorescent images were acquired using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd). To visualize endogenous nucleolin or GST fusion proteins, cells were stained with a rabbit polyclonal α-nucleolin antibody (1:500 (24Hirano M. Kaneko S. Yamashita T. Luo H. Qin W. Shirota Y.

Telomerase Activity Assays and Immunoprecipitation-Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP)—Total lysates of cells were subjected to TRAP assay using a TRAPEZE kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's method. For immunoprecipitation-TRAP, lysates from ∼2 × 105 cells/test tube were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for hTERT (2C4, subtype IgM (27Masutomi K. Yu E.Y.

As a control, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an isotype-matched, mouse monoclonal antibody specific for α-actinin (Sigma, clone BM-75.2, subtype IgM) or rabbit preimmune serum. The IgG subtype antibodies were bound directly to 10 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose. The IgM subtype antibodies were bound to same amount of resin using rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgM antibody, (Pierce). Telomerase activity was detected using 1 μl of post-immunoprecipitation resin. For in vitro reconstitution assays, for one test tube 100 ng of purified FLAG-hTERT, 200 ng in vitro transcribed hTERC, and increasing amounts of purified nucleolin-1234R were mixed in 20 μl of reconstitution buffer (5Masutomi K.

After incubation at 33 °C for 10 min, samples were subjected to telomerase reaction using Telochaser kit (Toyobo). Subcellular Localization of hTERT—To establish the subcellular localization of hTERT, we transiently expressed an EGFP-hTERT fusion protein in normal human lung fibroblasts (IMR90) and in a hepatoma-derived cancer cell line (Huh7). Ectopic expression of EGFP-hTERT conferred telomerase activity in IMR90 cells as well as a slight increase of telomerase activity in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that EGFP-hTERT formed an active telomerase complex. IMR90 cells expressing EGFP-hTERT showed a pan-nuclear localization of EGFP-hTERT with enriched nucleolar localization as assessed by costaining with an anti-nucleolin-specific antibody. In contrast, Huh7 cells expressing EGFP-hTERT exhibited a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution of EGFP-hTERT with exclusion of EGFP-hTERT from the nucleoli (Fig. 1B), consistent with a prior report (11Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We note that although the percentage of EGFP-hTERT-expressing cells in the transfected population of IMR90 cells was lower than those in Huh7 cells (20 and 60% of the cell population, respectively), the distinct localization pattern of EGFP-hTERT between these cell lines was reproducible. It may be related to a lower expression level of hTERC in normal cells than that in transformed cells (data not shown) or reflect deregulation of shuttling process of hTERT between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm in transformed cells (see “Discussion”). Interactions between hTERT and Nucleolin—The colocalization of EGFP-hTERT with nucleolin in nucleoli of normal cells, but not in cancer cells, suggested that nucleolin and hTERT physically interact. To examine this possibility, N-terminally GST-fused hTERT was transiently expressed in IMR90 or Huh7 cells. When we used an α-GST antibody to immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged hTERT from IMR90 cells, we found endogenous nucleolin in these immune complexes (Fig. 2A, a, lane 4). Despite the preferential nucleoplasmic localization of hTERT, endogenous nucleolin was also detected in α-GST-immunoprecipitates derived from Huh7 cells expressing GST-hTERT (Fig. 2A, c, lane 4). Endogenous nucleolin was similarly recovered in α-FLAG immunoprecipitates from IMR90 cells and Huh7 cells expressing carboxyl-terminally FLAG-tagged hTERT (data not shown). A possibility that interaction of hTERT and nucleolin occurs not in cells but in lysate after cell disruption is unlikely because excess recombinant competitor proteins in lysates could not interfere with the interaction of the two protein (Supplemental data, Fig. S1). These observations indicate that the interaction of hTERT and nucleolin occurs in both normal and cancer cells, implying that the interaction of nucleolin and hTERT occurs both in the nucleolus and in the nucleoplasm. Because the assembly of hTERT with hTERC may occur in the nucleolus similar to other RNPs (11Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Yang Y. Chen Y. Zhang C. Huang H. Weissman S.M. Exp.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we speculated that the binding of hTERT with nucleolin required the presence of hTERC. When we treated total cell lysates with RNase A, we found that this treatment reduced but did not eliminate the amount of nucleolin recovered in the immunoprecipitates in both normal and cancer cells (Fig. 2A, lane 5). These findings suggest that one or more RNA component(s) contributes to the interaction between nucleolin and hTERT. To confirm the specific interaction between nucleolin and hTERT, we mapped the regions of nucleolin required for its interaction with hTERT. For these experiments, we transiently coexpressed FLAG epitope-tagged, full-length nucleolin or a series of FLAG-nucleolin truncation mutants (Fig. 2B) with a GST-hTERT fusion protein into Huh7 cells. Using an α-GST antibody, we found that full-length nucleolin and two nucleolin truncation mutants, nucleolin-1234R and nucleolin-4R, bound GST-hTERT. In contrast, truncation mutants containing the amino terminus of nucleolin and RGG domain alone failed to bind GST-hTERT (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the binding of nucleolin-1234 to hTERT was abrogated by RNase A treatment (Fig. 2C, lanes 11 and 18). These observations indicate that nucleolin harbors two regions responsible for hTERT binding. The region within 4R binds only through protein-protein interactions, whereas the region within 1234 requires the involvement of RNA. RNase A treatment reduced the amount of hTERT recovered in the immunocomplexes containing full sized nucleolin or nucleolin-1234R. This finding is consistent with the view that both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions contribute additively to the binding of hTERT and nucleolin. Direct Binding of hTERT and Nucleolin in Vitro—To determine whether the binding of nucleolin and hTERT was direct, we prepared partially purified bacterial GST-nucleolin proteins, partially purified insect cell-expressed FLAG-hTERT alone, and purified hTERC and ascertained whether these partially purified proteins could bind hTERT in the presence and absence of hTERC (Fig. 3). Nucleolin-1234R, -123, and -4R but not nucleolin-234 or GST alone bound reconstituted hTERT (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-5). The direct interaction of hTERT and nucleolin was clearly detected with nucleolin-1234R and nucleolin-4R (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 10). The minimum region for the direct hTERT binding was 4R, consistent with the cellular analysis (Fig. 2). Nucleolin-123 also bound hTERT in vitro, although this interaction was much weaker than that with the reconstituted telomerase (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 3). However, RNase A treatment of total cell lysates eliminated the interaction between nucleolin-1234 and hTERT (Fig. 2C, lane 18). This discrepancy may be because of the use of higher amounts of the purified proteins in vitro than those in the mammalian cell lysates. Alternatively nucleolin-123 may retain weak hTERT binding ability. The augmentation effect of hTERC on the direct binding between hTERT and nucleolin in vitro (Fig. 3) implies that hTERC is a major RNA that contributes to the interaction between nucleolin and telomerase. The strong stimulating effect of hTERC on the binding between hTERT and nucleolin-123, but not nucleolin-234, may indicate that the RBD1 is the hTERC binding region. Taken together, these results indicate that the specific interaction of telomerase and nucleolin requires RBD4 and the RGG domains of nucleolin and that hTERC is partly involved in this interaction. However, RBD1 may also contribute to the binding of telomerase with nucleolin through interactions with hTERC (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Structure of human nucleolin and its truncation forms with summary of their binding ability to hTERT. The binding ability of each mutant to hTERT in the presence or absence of hTERC is summarized on the right (+, binding positive; ++, stronger binding; nd, not determined).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Telomerase Activity in Nucleolin Immune Complexes—To determine whether endogenous nucleolin and telomerase interact, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with an α-nucleolin antibody and found that we could detect telomerase activity in these immune complexes (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, when we performed similar experiments using cells expressing the nucleolin-N and nucleolin-R mutants, which are unable to bind hTERT, we failed to recover telomerase activity (Fig. 5B), confirming that recovery of telomerase activity depends upon the interaction between telomerase and nucleolin. These findings support the notion that endogenous nucleolin, at least in part, interacts with the telomerase complex. Moreover, these observations indicate that the interaction of nucleolin with hTERT does not inhibit telomerase activity. To address whether nucleolin modulates telomerase activity, we developed an in vitro reconstituted telomerase activity assay. The addition of purified recombinant human nucleolin-1234R failed to augment or inhibit in vitro reconstituted telomerase activity even when it was added in 8-fold molar excess to hTERT (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that nucleolin does not modulate telomerase enzymatic activity. Nucleolin Affects Subcellular Localization of hTERT—Because nucleolin and hTERT interact and colocalize, we addressed whether nucleolin affects the subcellular localization of hTERT. Full-length and truncated forms of nucleolin were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Huh7 cells expressing EGFP-hTERT (Fig. 6). Although we observed diffuse GFP signals in the nucleoplasm, coexpression of full sized nucleolin resulted in enriched localization of EGFP-hTERT in nucleoli (Fig. 6B). In contrast, coexpression of nucleolin-4R, the fragment of nucleolin which binds hTERT, with EGFP-hTERT showed cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 6D). However, coexpression of the nucleolin-N mutant with EGFP-hTERT failed to affect the localization of EGFP-hTERT (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that nucleolin affects the subcellular localization of hTERT. To confirm these observations, we examined subcellular localization of EGFP-hTERT using VA13 cells, which maintain their telomeres through an ALT mechanism rather than through the expression of telomerase. This cell line lacks both hTERC and hTERT (30Bryan T.M. Marusic L. Bacchetti S. Namba M. Reddel R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Guiducci C. Cerone M.A. Bacchetti S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of EGFP-hTERT in VA13 cells resulted in nucleolar localization of EGFP-hTERT in the absence of hTERC. The further introduction of hTERC shifted this localization of EGFP-hTERT to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 7A). EGFP-hTERT expression resulted in readily detectable telomerase activity in VA13+hTERC cells, although VA13 cells failed to show any telomerase activity upon expressing of EGFP-hTERT (Fig. 7B). FLAG-hTERT immune complexes derived from both VA13 and in VA13+hTERC contained endogenous nucleolin (Fig. 7C). Taken together, the results show that the interaction of nucleolin with hTERT and hTERC regulates the subcellular localization of telomerase. The regulation of subcellular localization of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, may regulate the biological functions of telomerase by controlling access of the telomerase complex to telomeres or by modulating the efficiency of telomerase RNP assembly. Several recent reports suggest that nucleoli and/or Cajal bodies are the sites for telomerase RNP assembly because both hTERT and hTERC are found in these structures (11Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K.

Furthermore, a previous report showed that hTERT distribution between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in normal cells, and deregulation of the proper localization of hTERT in cancer cells correlates with the growth advantage observed in transformed cells (11Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that nucleolin binds the active telomerase complex through both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Two distinct regions of nucleolin are involved in the interaction with hTERT: a central region containing the RBD1 and a carboxyl-terminal region containing both the RBD4 and RGG domains. It remains unclear whether the region covering RBD1 binds hTERC alone or also weakly interacts with hTERT in telomerase. Although other protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions may also modulate these interactions, the observations indicate that nucleolin is a binding partner for telomerase. Although the interaction of nucleolin and hTERT failed to alter telomerase activity in vitro, this interaction regulates the subcellular localization of hTERT. In this respect, these findings are reminiscent of a prior report that demonstrated that the interaction of nucleolin and a virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) altered the subcellular localization of RdRP (24Hirano M. Kaneko S. Yamashita T. Luo H. Qin W. Shirota Y. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, unlike the interaction of hTERT and nucleolin, the interaction of nucleolin with RdRP inhibited RdRP activity (24Hirano M. Kaneko S. Yamashita T. Luo H. Qin W. Shirota Y. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We show here that nucleolin affects subcellular localization of hTERT because the minimal hTERT binding region, nucleolin-4R, dramatically affected the subcellular localization of hTERT in vivo. Human TERT colocalizes with nucleolin-4R in the cytoplasm. Because the nucleolin-4R mutant lacks a nuclear localization signal, this protein-protein interaction of hTERT and nucleolin-4R is critical for the subcellular localization of telomerase. Despite the distinct hTERT subcellular localization between normal and transformed cells, ectopically expressed hTERT appears to interact with endogenous nucleolin from both types of cell. These results suggest that the interaction between nucleolin and telomerase occurs not only in nucleoli but also in the nucleoplasm. One possible explanation for these findings is that further post-translational modifications of nucleolin or hTERT may facilitate nucleoplasmic localization of hTERT in cancer cells. Alternatively, other proteins may differentially modify the localization of the nucleolin-telomerase complex in normal cells and cancer cells. In either case, nucleolin appears to be involved in assembly or maturation steps of telomerase because subcellular localization of hTERT was critically affected by the presence or the absence of hTERC as demonstrated in hTERC-negative VA13 cells. The nucleolar localization of hTERT in VA13 cells was not an intrinsic feature of ALT cells because in another ALT cell line, GM847, which expresses hTERC, hTERT was found to be preferentially localized to the nucleoplasm (11, and data not shown). Coexpression of EGFP-hTERT and GST-nucleolin-4R also dramatically changed cellular localization of EGFP-hTERT to the cytoplasm in hTERC-expressing VA13 cells as was observed in the Huh7 cells. In contrast, the nucleolar EGFP-TERT in VA13 cells was weakly affected by expression of GST-nucleolin-4R (Supplemental data, Fig. S2). The result suggests that the nature of nucleolin and the hTERT complex was affected by the presence of hTERC. Nucleolin as an RNA chaperone complexed with hTERT may facilitate assembly of telomerase in the presence of hTERC. Such nucleolin-telomerase complexes are then exported from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm in a process that may involve masking of a nucleolar retention signal of hTERT and/or nucleolin. Other factors appear to regulate this process because overexpression of full sized nucleolin resulted in nucleolar colocalization of telomerase in cancer cells. The functional consequences of the association of nucleolin with telomerase in the nucleoplasm remain obscure. One possibility is that nucleolin maintains telomerase in the nucleoplasm ready for the delivery to telomeres. Nucleolin thus not only helps assemble telomerase but also provides a reservoir of telomerase ready for delivery to the telomere. Because telomerase is present in different subnuclear compartments in normal and malignant human cells, these observations suggest that alterations in telomerase assembly and localization play additional roles in cell transformation.

We cloned this gene (now called treT), expressed it in Escherichia coli, purified the encoded protein, and identified it as an enzyme forming trehalose and ADP from ADP-glucose and glucose. The enzyme can also use UDP- and GDP-glucose but with less efficiency. The reaction is reversible, and ADP-glucose plus glucose can also be formed from trehalose and ADP. The rate of reaction and the equilibrium favor the formation of trehalose. At 90 °C, the optimal temperature for the enzymatic reaction, the half-maximal concentration of ADP-glucose at saturating glucose concentrations is 1.14 mm and the Vmax is 160 units/mg protein. In the reverse reaction, the half-maximal concentration of trehalose at saturating ADP concentrations is 11.5 mm and the Vmax was estimated to be 17 units/mg protein. Under non-denaturating in vitro conditions the enzyme behaves as a dimer of identical subunits of 48 kDa.

As the transporter encoded in the same gene cluster, TreT is induced by trehalose and maltose in the growth medium. Trehalose synthesis in response to osmotic stress is observed in many organisms. For instance, in Escherichia coli trehalose is formed by the gene products of otsA and otsB catalyzing the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose onto glucose-6-P (trehalose-6-P synthase), followed by the formation of trehalose (trehalose-6-P phosphatase) (1Strøm A.R. Kaasen I. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This is the usual pathway for trehalose synthesis in most organisms. Another enzymatic reaction, catalyzed by the treS gene product, transforms maltose into trehalose in an equilibrium reaction (2Tsusaki K. Nishimoto T. Nakada T. Kubota M. Chaen H. Fukuda S. Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A third possibility is realized in some hyperthermophilic organisms. Here, the terminal α (1–4)-linked unit of a linear maltodextrin is converted into an α,α (1–1) linkage by maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (encoded by treY). The terminal trehalose is then released by an additional enzyme, maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (encoded by treZ) (3Maruta K. Mitsuzumi H. Nakada T. Kubota M. Chaen H. Fukuda S. Sugimoto T.

J. 1999; 341: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) forming glucose and glucose-1-P from trehalose may also be regarded as a trehalose-synthesizing enzyme because the reaction is reversible at least in vitro. However, there is little doubt that the function of trehalose phosphorylase in vivo is in trehalose degradation rather than synthesis. Trehalose metabolism, aside from the function of trehalose phosphorylase, is usually achieved by trehalase, an enzyme hydrolyzing trehalose to glucose (5Hirimburegama K. Durnez P. Keleman J. Oris E.

In Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as E. coli, degradation of trehalose is initiated by its uptake via enzyme IIBC of the phosphotransferase system under simultaneous phosphorylation to trehalose-6-P, followed by cytoplasmic hydrolysis of the latter to glucose and glucose-6-P mediated by trehalose-6-P hydrolase (8Klein W. Horlacher R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5654-5664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis accumulates trehalose in response to high osmolarity when grown in the presence of yeast extract (10Lamosa P. Martins L.O. DaCosta M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contains trehalose. Indeed, trehalose induces a high affinity and binding protein-dependent ABC transporter for trehalose and maltose that is most likely responsible for the accumulation of trehalose. This operon is also induced under conditions of elevated temperature (11Shockley K.R. Ward D.E. Chhabra S.R. Conners S.B. Montero C.I. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it is understood that the accumulation of trehalose occurs in response to osmotic, and possibly heat, stress. However, trehalose must also be metabolized in T. litoralis, albeit slowly because trehalose is used up in the stationary phase of growth after its accumulation. The enzymes for trehalose synthesis and degradation have not been identified in T. litoralis. Dialyzed cellular extracts obtained from cells grown in the presence of trehalose do not hydrolyze or otherwise modify trehalose. In the past we studied the function of proteins encoded by a gene cluster in T. litoralis that appears in nearly identical sequence in Pyrococcus furiosus as the result of a lateral gene transfer (12DiRuggiero J.

This cluster contains genes for a binding protein-dependent ABC transporter for trehalose and maltose (13Xavier K.B. Martins L.O. Peist R. Kossmann M. Boos W. Santos H. J.

The last unidentified gene in this cluster, now called treT (appearing in identical sequence in P. furiosus, PF 1742), shows homology to trehalose phosphorylases from fungi. Here we report that the enzyme exhibits a novel activity to reversibly transfer the glucose moiety of ADP-glucose onto glucose to form trehalose. Materials—[14C]trehalose (600–720 μCi/μmol) and purified E. coli trehalase were obtained from Trenzyme GmbH (www.trenzyme.com). All other commercial chemicals and enzymes used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Cloning of treT, Overexpression and Purification of the Recombinant Protein—Two primers were designed based on the annotated sequence of the putative trehalose synthase (protein ID: AAG45375, PF1742). The forward primer was 5′-CGGGATCCATGTATGAGGTAACGAAGTTTGGTGGA-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GCGTCGACAAAAGAATTTAGTAAATCAAGATACCTCTCAAG-3′ with the BamHI and SalI restriction sites in bold, respectively. The chromosomal DNA was used as a template for PCR prepared as previously described (18Lee S.-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pET24a(+) (Novagen, Inc.) encoding a C-terminal His tag. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21. The transformed strain was grown at 28 °C in 4 liters of NZA medium (10 g NZ-amine A; Sheffield Product Inc.), 5 g of yeast extract, and 7.5 g of NaCl in 1 liter of distilled water) and was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight after the A578 of the culture had reached 1.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 500 mm NaCl. The suspension was extracted by passing it three times through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i and 4 °C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was heated to 80 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HPLC, high pH-anion exchange chromatography. affinity column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as the first step of purification. The column was washed twice with the same Tris-HCl buffer containing 20 and 50 mm imidazole, respectively. Bound protein was subsequently eluted with 200 mm imidazole and passed through a desalting column (Econo-Pac 10 DG; Bio-Rad) to remove the imidazole. The preparation was purified further by molecular sieve chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 5 mm MgCl2 to remove contaminants. Purified proteins were analyzed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blots using anti-His tag antibodies from mouse (Qiagen). Molecular Mass Determination—Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 5 mm MgCl2. The low molecular mass calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used consisting of bovine pancreas chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), hen egg albumin (43 kDa), bovine pancreas serum albumin (67 kDa), and rabbit muscle aldolase (158 kDa). Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—Enzyme reaction mixtures were prepared in a total volume of 100 μl at 80 °C. In the trehalose synthesis (forward) reaction, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm ADP-glucose, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of enzyme were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5. Samples were removed at different time intervals and 6 μl were spotted onto silica gel plates (type 60; Merck) that were then developed with butanol:ethanol:water (5:3:2) as solvent. Sugar-containing compounds were visualized by dipping the dried plate into methanol containing 5% H2SO4 followed by charring at 120 °C for 5 min. Enzymatic trehalose degradation (reverse reaction) was done in 100 μl containing either 10 mm unlabeled trehalose or 47 μm [14C]trehalose and 10 mm ADP in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 at 80 °C. Samples were removed at different time intervals and separated by TLC. The products formed were analyzed by charring or by autoradiography. The control experiments were performed in the trehalose synthesis as well as the degradation reaction with either denatured enzyme or no enzyme in the mixtures described above. The enzyme was denatured by autoclaving at 130 °C for 30 min. HPLC—Trehalose formation was also determined using HPLC (high pH-anion exchange chromatography) (Dionex Corp., Mississauga, Ontario) with pulsed amperometric detection. 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 8 mm ADP-glucose, 10 mm MgCl2, and varying glucose concentrations in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, were incubated at 90 °C. The reactions were started with the enzyme and stopped when still linear by adding cold buffer to a volume of 1 ml. The mixture was then kept on ice for 20 min. A Dionex carboPac MA-1 analytical column (4 × 250) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate and 500 mm NaOH for the separation of monosaccharides and disaccharides was injected with 20 μl of reaction mixture. The quantities of glucose and trehalose were calculated by comparison with sugar standards (1 mm). Kinetic Constants—Trehalose synthase activity (initial rates) was measured in both directions with discontinuous coupled enzyme assays. For trehalose synthesis, the half-maximal substrate concentration and Vmax for ADP-glucose was determined following ADP formation (Method 1). 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm glucose, 10 mm MgCl2, and varying ADP-glucose concentrations in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, were incubated for 6 min at 90 °C. The reaction was started by adding enzyme and stopped by adding cold buffer to a final volume of 980 μl. After cooling on ice for 20 min, the ADP produced in the reaction mixture was determined spectrophotometrically by adding 0.8 units of pyruvate kinase and 1.35 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 0.3 mm NADH, and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate at 25 °C. The decrease in the absorption at 340 nm was followed in a total volume of 1 ml. The half-maximal glucose concentration for ADP-glucose-dependent trehalose formation was determined using HPLC (see above) to follow the initial rate of trehalose formation. The reverse reaction (trehalose degradation) was measured by following the initial rate of glucose formation (Method 2). 100 μl of reaction mixture contained 5 mm ADP, 20 mm MgCl2, and varying trehalose concentrations in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, at 90 °C. The reaction was started by adding 0.5 μg of pure enzyme and stopped by adding 380 μl of cold buffer. Then the following coupled enzyme assay was performed at 25 °C: 0.5 units of hexokinase and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, a final concentration of 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.4 mm NADP+ were added to a final volume of 500 μl. The NADPH produced was measured at 340 nm. For determining substrate specificity, instead of glucose, potential sugar acceptors were used in a concentration of 10 mm in the forward reaction. In the reverse reaction trehalose was replaced by potential disaccharide substrates at 10 mm. All tests were done in duplicate, and all auxiliary enzymes were not rate-limiting. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol substrate formed/min at 90 °C. Specific enzyme activity is referred to as units/mg protein. Induction by Different Sugars—T. litoralis was cultivated in Bacto Marine Broth medium (10Lamosa P. Martins L.O. DaCosta M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented only with peptone (5 g/liter) as a control or with peptone plus maltose (3 g/liter), trehalose (3 g/liter), or sucrose (3 g/liter) for TreT induction. Cells were grown overnight at 80 °C, harvested by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 4 °C), and extracted by sonication in an anaerobic chamber under a N2:H2 (95:5, v:v) atmosphere in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm NaCl. Thin layer chromatography to measure trehalose formation was performed as described above. For Western blotting, the uninduced and induced cell extracts were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred, blotted with a Fluorotrans transfer membrane (Pall Europe Limited), and incubated with anti-TreT antibodies raised in rabbit. treT Encodes an Enzyme Involved in Trehalose Metabolism as Indicated by Sequence Similarity—Fig. 1 shows the operon encoding the ABC transporter for trehalose and maltose (14Horlacher R. Xavier K.B. Santos H. DiRuggiero J. Kossmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 680-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the gene for an ATP-dependent fructokinase (frk) in T. litoralis (19Qu Q. Lee S.-J. Boos W. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This gene cluster is contained in a 16-kb fragment of T. litoralis that appears to be the result of a horizontal gene transfer (of a composite transposon) between T. litoralis and P. furiosus (12DiRuggiero J. Dunn D. Maeder D.L. Holley-Shanks R. Chatard J. Horlacher R. Robb F.T. Boos W. Weiss R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The operon encoding the ABC transporter is induced by maltose and trehalose with TrmB acting as a transcriptional repressor (18Lee S.-J. Engelmann A. Horlacher R. Qu Q. Vierke G. Hebbeln C. Thomm M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). From its encoded transport proteins and profile of induction by maltose and trehalose, one would assume that the role of the gene cluster is in sugar metabolism. In this respect it was of interest what treT, the only remaining gene of unidentified function, would encode. NCBI BLAST results revealed a conserved domain found in glycosyl transferases near the C terminus of TreT. The five best hits concern hypothetical proteins from other hyperthermophiles, for instance, PH1035 of Pyrococcus horikoshii (77% identity) or TM 0392 of Thermotoga maritima (53% identity). Also, there is high sequence similarity with two enzymes with trehalose phosphorylase activity from fungi, Pleurotus sajor-caju (31% identity) and Grifola frondosa (30% identity). Interestingly, TreT of T. litoralis also has low sequence similarity to a sucrose synthase from potato (EC 2.4.1.13; 25% identity). This enzyme performs the reversible transfer of glucose via UDP-glucose onto fructose to form sucrose. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of TreT with four other protein sequences, including a hypothetical protein from P. horikoshii, trehalose phosphorylase from fungi, and sucrose synthase from potato as given by Clustal W multiple sequence alignment.Fig. 2Sequence comparison.

Fig. 3A shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of total cellular proteins with and without induction by IPTG. Cellular extracts of IPTG-induced cells were heated to 80 °C for 10 min prior to purification of the clarified extracts by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. TreT is a protein of 413 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 48,146 Da. After the first purification step, two bands of ∼48 and 37 kDa were seen in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Molecular sieve chromatography under non-denaturating conditions led to the purification of the larger protein exhibiting a molecular mass of 104,000 Da (Fig. 3C), indicating that TreT is a dimer of two identical polypeptides of 48 kDa. The two proteins of 48 and 37 kDa were eluted from the Ni-NTA column, and both carried the C-terminal His tag as seen in Western blots using anti-His tag antibodies (Fig. 3, A and B). The smaller protein most likely is not a degradation product of the larger polypeptide but the result of a restart within the treT open reading frame, as has also been found in the malK-encoded protein contained in the same operon (20Greller G. Horlacher R. DiRuggiero J. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20259-20264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purified TreT (48 kDa) is stable after heat treatment of the E. coli cellular extract. ∼2 mg of pure protein were obtained routinely from 1 liter of E. coli culture. TreT Is an ADP-glucose-dependent Trehalose Glycosyltransferring Synthase—We performed several tests with purified TreT to elucidate its enzymatic activity. We tested several disaccharides (maltose, sucrose, trehalose, lactose) and polysaccharides (linear maltodextrins, pullulan) and combinations of polysaccharides with disaccharides for their ability to act as substrates for a putative hydrolytic, phosphorolytic, or transfer activity of the enzyme. We also used glucose-6-P as acceptor for a possible glucosyltransfer from UDP-glucose or glucose-1-P to form trehalose-6-P or trehalose. None of these tests gave a positive result. However, when incubating ADP-glucose alone with the enzyme at 85 °C a product was slowly formed that could be identified by TLC as trehalose. ADP-glucose in the absence of the enzyme was then found to be unstable at this temperature and the buffer conditions used to slowly form free glucose. We then realized that the slow formation of trehalose was due to the transfer of glucose from ADP-glucose onto the glucose that had been liberated from ADP-glucose. Indeed, when glucose was included in the reaction mixture from the beginning, fast and time-dependent formation of trehalose could be observed (Fig. 4A). The identity of the formed product with trehalose was established by the action of E. coli periplasmic trehalase (6Boos W. Ehmann U. Bremer E. Middendorf A. Postma P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13212-13218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is specific for α,α (1–1) glucosyl glucoside (trehalose) and does not hydrolyze α-or β-paranitrophenyl glucosides or maltose, sucrose, lactose, or cellobiose (Fig. 4A). The trehalose-synthesizing reaction never went to completion, indicating that it is reversible. At high ADP-glucose concentration (10 mm) and trace amounts of [14C]glucose, the reaction went to near completion. This demonstrates its reversible nature. When starting the reaction with trehalose and ADP (i.e. the reverse reaction), we observed the formation of ADP-glucose and glucose (Fig. 4, C and D). Using [14C]trehalose the newly formed radioactive spot (aside from glucose) migrated identically and can be superimposed with chemically stained ADP-glucose (Fig. 4D, lane 11; charring is not shown). No enzymatic reaction can be detected when phosphate is used instead of ADP. Using autoclaved TreT as a control in both the trehalose synthesis and degradation reactions, no product formation can be detected (not shown). In the ADP-glucose-forming reaction, the amount of enzyme needed to obtain the same rate of reaction is ten times higher than for trehalose formation. Under these conditions, the reaction starts fast toward ADP-glucose, but the equilibrium is shifted strongly in the direction of trehalose formation. This can also be seen when the reaction is started with trace amounts of radiolabeled trehalose and 10 mm ADP (Fig. 4D). The formation of free glucose in this reaction is not caused by unspecific degradation of trehalose at the assay temperature because trehalose is stable under the conditions used (not shown). The stability of trehalose at high temperature had been demonstrated previously (21Higashiyama T. Pure Appl. Chem. 2002; 74: 1263-1269Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Trehalose synthesis was also followed using HPLC. At varying initial glucose concentrations (3.5, 5, and 7.5 mm) but identical TreT concentrations, a new peak emerged that corresponded to standard trehalose (16.35-min retention time). The trehalose concentration obtained in this way after 7 min increased in response to the initial glucose concentration (Fig. 5). Kinetic Constants, Temperature Dependence, and Substrate Specificity of TreT—The kinetics of trehalose glycosyltransferring synthase activity were measured in discontinuous two-step coupled assays. The half-maximal concentration of ADP-glucose at saturating glucose concentrations was 1.14 mm (Fig. 6A) and that for glucose at saturating ADP-glucose concentrations was 6.2 mm (Fig. 6B) as determined by HPLC. The Vmax for the purified enzyme was 160 units/mg protein for ADP-glucose at saturating glucose concentration and 220 units/mg protein for glucose at saturating ADP-glucose concentration. In the reverse reaction, the half-maximal concentration of trehalose was 11.5 mm, and the Vmax was estimated to be 17 units/mg protein (Fig. 6C). Thus, under saturating substrate concentrations, the enzymatic reaction is strongly favored toward the formation of trehalose. The effect of temperature (30–100 °C) on the enzymatic activity was measured with Method 1 at pH 6.5. The optimum for the trehalose-forming reaction was 90 °C (Fig. 7) with 65% enzymatic activity remaining at 100 °C. TreT showed a narrow pH optimum range around pH 6.5. At pH 7.5, only 13% of the activity at pH 6.5 remained. Sugar specificity was tested in the directions of disaccharide synthesis as well as degradation. Fructose, mannose, galactose, xylose, 2-deoxy-glucose, glucosamine, α-methylglucoside, sorbitol, G-1-P, G-6-P, F-1-P, and F-6-P were unable to replace glucose as an acceptor for the glucosyl transfer from ADP-glucose when tested with Method 1. In addition, maltose, lactose, and sucrose were unable to be cleaved in the presence of ADP when tested with HPLC. Phosphate and P-enolpyruvate could not substitute for ADP in trehalose degradation as tested by using [14C]trehalose as substrate followed by TLC and autoradiography. Thus, TreT appears to be specific for the synthesis and the degradation of trehalose. With UDP-glucose or GDP-glucose replacing ADP-glucose, only about 6 and 5% of TreT activity remained, whereas TDP-glucose was inactive. Method 1 was used to test the influence of cations (at 20 mm concentration). The enzyme needs Mg2+ for its activity (set as 100%), which can be replaced to some extent by CaCl2 (91%), MnCl2 (78%), CoCl2 (71.6%), and NiCl2 (57%). No enzymatic activity could be seen with ZnCl2. TreT Is Induced by Maltose and Trehalose in the Growth Medium—We obtained cellular extracts from T. litoralis grown in peptone alone (as a control) and in peptone plus maltose, trehalose, or sucrose. The dialyzed extracts at identical protein concentrations were tested for their ability to form trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Trehalose formation was monitored by TLC and is shown in Fig. 8. When grown only on peptone, trehalose formation was hardly detectable (Fig. 8A). Induction was highest with maltose in the growth medium (Fig. 8B), less efficient with trehalose, and even less with sucrose, although with the latter it was clearly higher than in the extract of uninduced cells (grown on peptone alone). The induction of TreT by maltose and trehalose in the growth medium could also be detected in Western blots with anti-TreT antibodies from rabbit (not shown). The induction pattern of treT was identical to that of malE, one of the genes encoding the ABC transporter for trehalose and maltose, consistent with the notion that these genes form an operon together with treT (20Greller G. Horlacher R. DiRuggiero J. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20259-20264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We describe an enzyme, TreT, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon T. litoralis that produces trehalose by the transfer of glucose from ADP-glucose (or, less effectively, UDP-glucose and GDP-glucose) onto the 1-position of glucose to form trehalose and ADP. The trehalose produced is identical with α,α-trehalose because E. coli trehalase was able to hydrolyze it to glucose. Such an enzymatic activity for the synthesis of trehalose has not yet been described for any organism. Instead, when activated glucose in the form of UDP-glucose is used in the synthesis of trehalose, the transfer of the glucosyl moiety always occurs onto glucose-6-P to form trehalose-6-P, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the latter to trehalose (for instance, by the enzymes encoded by the E. coli otsA otsB genes). In this way, unidirectional formation of trehalose is assured. The trehalose-synthesizing reaction catalyzed by TreT is reversible. Thus, ADP-glucose and glucose can be formed from ADP and trehalose. What is the physiological role of TreT? From the position of treT within a gene cluster encoding an ABC transporter for trehalose (and maltose), one would be inclined to interpret the function of TreT as a trehalose-degrading enzyme rather than a trehalose-synthesizing enzyme. This also appears sensible in light of the rather high half-maximal concentration for glucose of 6.2 mm. It would be unlikely that growing T. litoralis contains such high internal glucose concentrations. With a Km of 0.7 mm for glucose, the ADP-dependent hexokinase (22Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) would effectively reduce the concentration of free internal glucose and prevent any noticeable trehalose formation by TreT. One could argue that the metabolism of maltose, which also induces TreT synthesis, would provide ample amounts of free internal glucose (23Xavier K.B. Peist R. Kossmann M. Boos W. Santos H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3358-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) needed for trehalose formation by TreT. However, trehalose formation was not observed when T. litoralis grew on maltose (10Lamosa P. Martins L.O. DaCosta M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulation of trehalose present in the medium via the high affinity and binding protein-dependent ABC transporter results in high internal trehalose concentrations (10Lamosa P. Martins L.O. DaCosta M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that could subsequently be used for glucose formation by TreT, followed by hexokinase-dependent phosphorylation and glycolysis (22Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The fact that the formation of ADP-glucose is a necessary by-product of this pathway opens the possibility that it may be used for glucose polymer formation in the form of glycogen. Indeed, the major pathway of cellulose biosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria follows this strategy (24Porchia A.C. Curatti L. Salerno G.L. Planta. 1999; 210: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There, sucrose is used by an enzyme that forms UDP-glucose from UDP and sucrose. UDP-glucose is then used as a donor for cellulose biosynthesis (25Sebkova V. Unger C. Hardegger M. Sturm A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There is only residual sequence similarity of these types of enzymes with TreT described here. In contrast, significant sequence identity is seen with enzymes that are often described as putative trehalose synthases, and a few are characterized as authentic trehalose phosphorylases. These enzymes reversibly cleave trehalose by phosphorolysis to form glucose-β-1-P and glucose (26Eis C. Watkins M. Prohaska T. Nidetzky B. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 757-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They usually function as trehalose-degrading enzymes rather than trehalose-synthesizing enzymes. The high similarity of these enzymes to TreT is intriguing. One is inclined to describe the ADP-glucose formation by TreT also as a phosphorolysis in which not free Pi but the β-phosphoryl group of ADP is the active agent hydrolyzing trehalose. We acknowledge the contribution of Peter Kroth who made us aware of the similarity of the TreT function to the plant enzymes forming UDP-glucose from sucrose in cellulose biosynthesis. We thank Reinhold Horlacher for providing [14C]trehalose and purified trehalase, Xiangzhen Li for preparing T. litoralis cell extract, Christoph Mayer for measuring sugars with HPLC, Irena Hendekovic for kinetic analyses, and E.

https://openalex.org/W2090079916,"Numerous members of the IAP family can suppress apoptotic cell death in physiological settings. Whereas certain IAPs directly inhibit caspases, the chief proteolytic effectors of apoptosis, the protective effects of other IAPs do not correlate well with their caspase inhibitory activities, suggesting the involvement of alternative cytoprotective abilities. To examine this issue, we have characterized the protective effects of an ancestral, baculoviral IAP (Op-IAP) in mammalian cells. We show that although Op-IAP potently inhibited Bax-mediated apoptosis in human cells, Op-IAP failed to directly inhibit mammalian caspases. However, Op-IAP efficiently bound the IAP antagonist Smac/Diablo, thereby preventing Smac/Diablo-mediated inhibition of cellular IAPs. Whereas reduction of Smac/Diablo protein levels in the absence of Op-IAP prevented Bax-mediated apoptosis, overexpression of Smac/Diablo neutralized Op-IAP-mediated protection, and an Op-IAP variant unable to bind Smac/Diablo failed to prevent apoptosis. Finally, Op-IAP catalyzed the ubiquitination of Smac/Diablo, an activity that contributed to Op-IAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. These data show that cytoprotective IAPs can inhibit apoptosis through the neutralization of IAP antagonists, rather than by directly inhibiting caspases.

These data show that cytoprotective IAPs can inhibit apoptosis through the neutralization of IAP antagonists, rather than by directly inhibiting caspases. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an intrinsic cellular suicide program critical for normal development and the maintenance of homeostasis in all metazoa (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar, 2Vaux D.L. Haecker G. Strasser A. Cell. 1994; 76: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). This process is also an effective defense mechanism against viral infection, since upon infection many cells respond by undergoing apoptosis, curtailing viral replication and preventing spread to other cells and tissues (3Shen Y. Shenk T.E. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1995; 5: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In turn, viruses have developed a number of mechanisms to prevent host-cell apoptosis and complete the viral life cycle, often through expression of viral proteins that inhibit the activity of caspases, cysteinyl proteases activated during apoptosis that are responsible for the majority of cellular proteolysis during cell death (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). Caspase activation occurs in a hierarchical pattern in which upstream caspases are activated by initial apoptotic signals, and then proceed to cleave and activate downstream caspases, which carry out the subsequent proteolysis of cellular death targets (5Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Given their central role in carrying out the apoptotic program, caspases are subject to regulation at a number of levels, both through prevention of the initial cleavage events leading to their activation, as well as by direct inhibition of activity following proteolytic maturation (6Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar).The genomes of many viruses have been found to encode several proteins that are capable of preventing apoptosis, often through inhibiting caspase activity (7Clem R.J. Hardwick J.M. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the founding members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; BIR, baculoviral IAP repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Smac, second mitochondrial activator of caspases; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; BIR, baculoviral IAP repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Smac, second mitochondrial activator of caspases; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. family were initially discovered in the genomes of the baculoviruses Cydia pomonella granulosis virus and Orgyia pseudotsugata Nucleopolyhedrovirus and were named Cp-IAP and Op-IAP, respectively (8Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Birnbaum M.J. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the discovery of baculoviral IAPs, cellular IAP homologs have been identified in species ranging from yeast to humans (10Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Liston P. Fong W.G. Korneluk R.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8568-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The defining structural motif of the IAP family is a domain known as the BIR, and all IAP proteins contain at least one BIR domain. A second structural motif, the RING domain, is also present at the C terminus of many IAP homologs. Overall, a remarkable number of distinct biological properties have been described for IAP proteins including regulation of cell division, participation in intracellular signaling cascades, and facilitation of protein degradation through E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (11Liston P. Fong W.G. Korneluk R.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8568-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar).Despite the multiple functions reported for IAP proteins, the most well recognized property possessed by IAPs is the ability to prevent apoptosis, and this has generally been attributed to direct caspase inhibition (13Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). Among mammalian IAP proteins, XIAP appears to be the most potent direct caspase inhibitor, having been shown to directly bind and inhibit caspases both in vitro and in vivo (14Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Other mammalian IAPs, such as NAIP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, ILP-2, and ML-IAP (Livin) have been reported to inhibit caspase activity (11Liston P. Fong W.G. Korneluk R.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8568-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro affinity many of these IAPs possess for caspases is many fold lower when compared with XIAP (15Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the method by which they mediate cellular protection may involve mechanisms beyond direct caspase inhibition.Recent studies have led to the discovery of a number of additional apoptotic regulators that function to neutralize IAP-mediated caspase inhibition. The Drosophila proteins Reaper, Hid, Grim, and, more recently, Sickle have been shown to abrogate the ability of IAPs to inhibit caspases, and the functions of these proteins appear required for normal induction of apoptosis (16Salvesen G.S. Abrams J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In mammals, the caspase-inhibitory properties of XIAP are antagonized by mitochondrially localized proteins, including Smac/Diablo, Omi/HtrA2, and GSPT1/eRF3 (17Vaux D.L. Silke J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Madesh M. Wassell R. Zhang Z. Cheong N. Nejmeh J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Hoshino S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38699-38706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These proteins are normally localized to the mitochondria, but are released into the cytoplasm during apoptosis where, much like the Drosophila IAP antagonists, they bind IAPs in a manner similar to caspases, therefore functioning as competitive inhibitors of the caspase inhibitory function of IAPs.The prototype IAP protein, Op-IAP, contains two N-terminal BIR domains and a C-terminal RING domain, and shares significant homology to cellular IAP proteins from diverse species, including Sf-IAP from Spodoptera frugiperda and XIAP in humans (19Huang Q. Deveraux Q.L. Maeda S. Salvesen G.S. Stennicke H.R. Hammock B.D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Duckett C.S. Nava V.E.

When expressed in S. frugiperda cells, Op-IAP is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including viral infection, UV irradiation, and actinomycin D treatment (21Manji G.A. Hozak R.R. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13606-13611Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Op-IAP is also capable of potently inhibiting apoptosis induced by the overexpression of the pro-apoptotic Drosophila proteins Hid, Reaper, and Grim (23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Op-IAP has been shown to protect cells from a variety of distinct death-inducing stimuli (20Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van Dongen J.L. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2685-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 25Hawkins C.J. Ekert P.G.

Thus, Op-IAP prevents cell death in a diverse range of species, suggesting a conserved mechanism of action.Despite the ability of Op-IAP to inhibit apoptosis in a wide range of systems, the mechanism by which this protection is mediated remains unclear. When expressed in Sf-21 cells, Op-IAP generally prevents caspase activation (22Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13606-13611Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Manji G.A. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16704-16710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but fails to inhibit activated Sf-caspase-1 (21Manji G.A. Hozak R.R. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), an effector caspase in S. frugiperda. Op-IAP appears unable to directly inhibit caspases in Drosophila cells, and cannot directly bind and inhibit the Drosophila caspases Dronc, Drice, or Dcp-1 in vitro. 2C. Wright and R. Clem, personal communication.2C. Wright and R. Clem, personal communication. Overall, the lack of compelling data supporting direct caspase inhibition as a general property of Op-IAP suggests that the mechanism by which Op-IAP prevents cell death may be divergent from that used by XIAP, and this mechanism may also account for the protective properties of those IAPs with low or no affinity for caspases.This study characterizes the ability of Op-IAP to prevent Bax-mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells. While Op-IAP is a potent inhibitor of mammalian apoptosis, this protein failed to inhibit the activity of any human caspase tested. However, Op-IAP efficiently bound Smac/Diablo, and the Smac/Diablo binding properties of Op-IAP were necessary for prevention of apoptosis. Furthermore, the RING domain of Op-IAP facilitates ubiquitination of Smac/Diablo, and this property contributes to Op-IAP-mediated protection of mammalian cells. Thus, based on characterization of an ancestral IAP protein, Op-IAP, these findings demonstrate the ability of certain IAPs to suppress cell death through the neutralization of IAP antagonists, rather than through direct caspase inhibition, and this mechanism may account for the protective effects of IAPs with low affinity for caspases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Reagents were obtained as follows: protein G-coupled agarose, Ni-NTA-agarose, l-glutamine, and PBS (Invitrogen); glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences); fetal bovine serum (HyClone); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech); ApoTarget protease assay kit (BIOSOURCE); DEVD-AFC, Ac-VDVAD-AFC, Ac-DEVD-AFC, Ac-IETD-AFC, and Ac-LEHD-AFC (BioMol); site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete mini) (Roche Applied Science); all other chemicals were from Sigma.

A standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol (20Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van Dongen J.L. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2685-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) was used to transfect 293 cells with both plasmids and siRNA oligonucleotides.Cell Lysate Preparation—Cells were lysed in either radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) or Triton lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 10 ml; protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to manufacturer's instructions.Viability Experiments—Cells (3.0 × 105) were transfected as described above with pEBB-GFP, pCDNA3-Bax, and other plasmids and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Morphological assays for cell viability were performed by observing GFP fluorescent cells with a Leica DM IRB inverted fluorescence microscope.In Vitro Caspase Inhibition—GST, GST-XIAP, and GST-Op-IAP were produced in Escherichia coli (strain BL21) as described (14Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar) and preincubated with caspase-2 (500 pm), caspase-3 (200 pm), caspase-6 (500 pm), caspase-7 (500 pm), caspase-8 (500 pm), or caspase-9 (2 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C in modified caspase buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2). Substrates were added to 100 μm (caspase-2: AcVDVAD-AFC, caspase-3, 6, 7: AcDEVD-AFC; caspase-8: Ac-IETD-AFC; caspase-9: Ac-IETD-AFC). Residual enzyme activity was determined by monitoring substrate hydrolysis for 15 min at 37 °C with a ŸMAX Fluorescence Plate Reader (Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm.In Vitro Binding Experiments—GST, GST-XIAP, and GST-Op-IAP from E. coli lysates were allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at room temperature in PBS. Beads were washed in binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20), and then incubated with 100 nm Smac (purified from E. coli) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed in binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer prior to electrophoresis on 8–18% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and either Coomassie-stained or immunoblotted using anti-His antibody.Whole Cell Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates (60 μg) were prepared in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS containing 0.02–0.2% Tween, then incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using Kodak XAR film.Immunoprecipitations—Cell lysates were prepared in Triton lysis buffer, normalized for protein content, and incubated with anti-HA antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-coupled agarose beads were then added and the incubation was continued for 1 h. For precipitation of GST-tagged proteins and for precipitation of His6-Ubiquitin conjugated proteins, glutathione-Sepharose beads or nickel-agarose beads were added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Agarose beads, were recovered by centrifugation, washed in Triton buffer, and precipitated proteins were eluted by adding LDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Recovered proteins were then separated by electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis was carried out as described above.Intact Cell Caspase Activity Assays—Floating and attached cells were harvested and caspase-3 assays were performed using the Apo-Target protease assay kit (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AFC release over time (a total of 20 measurements at 90-s intervals) was then measured at 37 °C using a Cytofluor 4000 multiwell plate reader (Applied Biosystems) with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 508 nm.RNA Interference—Cells (105 cells/transfection) were transfected with 2 μg of double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (Xeragon/Qiagen) by calcium phosphate. Gene-specific targeting of Smac/Diablo was performed using an oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 156–176 (aaccctgtgtgcggttcctat) of the coding sequence of Smac/Diablo. As a negative control, an oligonucleotide targeting nucleotides 322–342 (aagacccgcgccgaggtgaag) of the coding sequence of GFP was used. 24 h following transfection, media was changed. 48 h after transfection, cells were used for viability experiments, immunoblot analysis, and caspase assays as described above.RESULTSTo characterize the anti-apoptotic properties of Op-IAP in human cells, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, in the absence and presence of Op-IAP expression plasmids. Normally, Bax induces mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, oligomerization of Apaf-1, and the subsequent catalytic activation of caspase-9, all of which results in the cleavage and activation of caspase-3, the principal effector caspase in this cell type (33Bratton S.B. Lewis J. Butterworth M. Duckett C.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, Op-IAP abrogated Bax-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-3 processing (Fig. 1B) and activity (Fig. 1C) were potently inhibited by Op-IAP, to an extent equivalent to that of XIAP.The mechanism accounting for the ability of Op-IAP to prevent Bax-mediated death was next assessed. Op-IAP shares significant homology to XIAP, which potently inhibits caspases-3, -7, and -9 (34Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Since both IAP proteins effectively prevented Bax-induced apoptosis, the ability of Op-IAP to directly inhibit caspase activity was examined. GST-tagged Op-IAP was produced in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. As a positive control, GST-XIAP was also expressed and purified. These two IAP proteins were then incubated with various recombinant human caspases in the presence of the appropriate caspase substrates, and the total amount of caspase activity was determined fluorometrically. As shown in Fig. 2A, XIAP potently inhibited the activities of caspases-3 and -7, and significantly inhibited the activity of caspase-9. Op-IAP, however, failed to inhibit any of the caspases tested, even when used at much greater concentrations than XIAP (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that unlike XIAP, the anti-apoptotic properties of Op-IAP are not because of the direct inhibition of caspases.Fig. 2In vitro inhibition of caspase activity. GST-XIAP (A) and GST-Op-IAP (B) were preincubated with caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 prior to the addition of caspase substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Residual caspase activity was then assessed by monitoring hydrolysis of the fluorescent substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These findings suggested that Op-IAP prevents cell death through a mechanism that does not involve direct caspase inhibition. During Bax-mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells, the pro-apoptotic protein Smac/Diablo is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm with kinetics similar to that of cytochrome c, where it can then bind to XIAP, thereby preventing XIAP from inhibiting caspases (35Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). Op-IAP has been shown to bind Hid, Reaper, and Grim, functional homologs of Smac/Diablo found in Drosophila (23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and this binding is necessary for Op-IAP mediated prevention of apoptosis following overexpression of these proteins in heterologous systems (36Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction between Op-IAP and Hid is highly similar to the interaction between XIAP and Smac/Diablo (37Wright C.W. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2454-2462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In light of these observations, a possible mechanism by which Op-IAP inhibits apoptosis in mammalian cells is through binding to Smac/Diablo in a manner that prevents Smac/Diablo-mediated inhibition of XIAP, allowing endogenous XIAP to continue to inhibit caspases. To test this possibility, the ability of Op-IAP to bind Smac/Diablo was examined in cells. HA-Op-IAP and HA-XIAP were expressed in HEK293 cells along with a cytosolic form of Smac/Diablo containing a FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus. This form of Smac/Diablo was generated by replacing the N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal found in the immature form of Smac/Diablo with ubiquitin (32Hunter A.M. Kottachchi D. Lewis J. Duckett C.S. Korneluk R.G. Liston P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7494-7499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During synthesis, the ubiquitin moiety is immediately cleaved by constitutive ubiquitin specific proteases, generating cytoplasmically targeted, mature Smac/Diablo. Cytosolic Smac/Diablo containing either a FLAG or GST tag at the C terminus was used for this and all subsequent experiments. Following transfection, cell lysates were precipitated with HA-specific antibodies, and the presence of Smac/Diablo in precipitated material was determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3A, Smac/Diablo was efficiently precipitated by both Op-IAP and XIAP, whereas no Smac/Diablo was observed in precipitates from control transfected cells. Interestingly, immunoblots of Smac/Diablo input material displayed ladders of high molecular weight species, which appeared to be enriched in cells transfected with either Op-IAP or XIAP. Furthermore, these high molecular weight species co-precipitated in the immunoprecipitation experiments. These bands likely represent ubiquitinated Smac/Diablo, and the increase in ubiquitinated material observed in Op-IAP and XIAP transfected samples is consistent with the ability of both Op-IAP and XIAP to ubiquinate Smac/Diablo, as addressed below. Using the GST fusion proteins employed in Fig. 2, the ability of Op-IAP to bind Smac/Diablo was also assessed in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3B, Smac/Diablo was efficiently precipitated by GST-XIAP and GST-Op-IAP, but not GST alone, confirming the intact cell studies and indicating that the interaction between Op-IAP and Smac/Diablo is direct. Overall, these data show that Op-IAP and Smac/Diablo directly interact.Fig. 3Op-IAP associates with Smac/Diablo in vitro and in vivo. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with control or expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged XIAP or Op-IAP in the presence of FLAG-tagged Smac/Diablo. Cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, and the presence of HA-tagged proteins in precipitated complexes was determined by immunoblot analysis. B, GST, GST-XIAP, and GST-Op-IAP were bound to glutathione beads and incubated with recombinant Smac containing a His6 tag at the C terminus. Following washing, the presence of Smac in precipitated complexes was evaluated by immunoblotting using anti-His (top panel). Integrity of GST proteins was verified by Coomassie staining (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W1991656500,"Cell-to-cell virus transmission is one of the most efficient mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spread, requires CD4 and coreceptor expression in target cells, and may also lead to syncytium formation and cell death. Here, we show that in addition to this classical coreceptor-mediated transmission, the contact between HIV-producing cells and primary CD4 T cells lacking the appropriate coreceptor induced the uptake of HIV particles by target cells in the absence of membrane fusion or productive HIV replication. HIV uptake by CD4 T cells required cellular contacts mediated by the binding of gp120 to CD4 and intact actin cytoskeleton. HIV antigens taken up by CD4 T cells were rapidly endocytosed to trypsin-resistant compartments inducing a partial disappearance of CD4 molecules from the cell surface. Once the cellular contact was stopped, captured HIV were released as infectious particles. Electron microscopy revealed that HIV particles attached to the surface of target cells and accumulated in large (0.5–1.0 μm) intracellular vesicles containing 1–14 virions, without any evidence for massive clathrin-mediated HIV endocytosis. The capture of HIV particles into trypsin-resistant compartments required the availability of the gp120 binding site of CD4 but was independent of the intracytoplasmic tail of CD4. In conclusion, we describe a novel mechanism of HIV transmission, activated by the contact of infected and uninfected primary CD4 T cells, by which HIV could exploit CD4 T cells lacking the appropriate coreceptor as an itinerant virus reservoir.

In conclusion, we describe a novel mechanism of HIV transmission, activated by the contact of infected and uninfected primary CD4 T cells, by which HIV could exploit CD4 T cells lacking the appropriate coreceptor as an itinerant virus reservoir. For many viruses, cell-to-cell virus transmission is the most efficient mechanism of viral spread because of the extremely low infectivity of free viral particles (1Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C.

Chang L.J. Blumenthal R. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2182-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This latter phenomenon is favored by the polarization of viral production in the infected cell (4Deschambeault J. Lalonde J.P. Cervantes-Acosta G. Lodge R. Cohen E.A. Lemay G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5010-5017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the viral receptors and coreceptors in the target cell leading to the formation of a functional (infectious) virological synapse (5Fais S.

Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Cell-to-cell virus transmission is probably involved in the spread of HIV among different populations of CD4+ cells in vivo and seems to play an essential role in sexual or vertical transmission through epithelia (7Bomsel M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 8Lagaye S. Derrien M. Menu E. Coito C. Tresoldi E. Mauclere P. Scarlatti G. Chaouat G. Barre-Sinoussi F. Bomsel M. J.

The process of membrane fusion induced by the envelope glycoprotein complex of HIV is independent of pH, and therefore endocytic internalization and endosomal acidification are not required to activate HIV entry into the cytoplasm (9Kielian M. Jungerwirth S. Mol. Biol. Med. 1990; 7: 17-31PubMed Google Scholar, 10Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar, 11Bedinger P.

Instead, viral entry involves direct fusion of viral and plasma cell membrane that allows for the delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm of target cells (13D'Souza M.P. Cairns J.S. Plaeger S.F. JAMA. 2000; 284: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). First, HIV envelope (gp120/gp41, Env) binds to CD4 and then to a chemokine receptor (CXCR4 for X4 strains and CCR5 for R5 strains), which is used by HIV particles to activate the gp41-mediated membrane fusion. A variety of cell types such as macrophages, endothelial and epithelial cells, and also lymphoid cells are able to bind and to internalize HIV particles into vesicular structures coordinately or independently of HIV receptors (7Bomsel M.

Nevertheless, the exact contribution of endocytic pathways to the infection of CD4 T lymphocytes and to HIV pathogenesis in vivo is mostly unknown, and the mechanisms involved in endocytosis are unclear. The term endocytosis includes at least four mechanisms: phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis (21Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar), showing different properties such as vesicular size, markers, and regulation. Macropinocytosis, which is characterized by big sized vesicles, and clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis seem to be the major nonfusogenic HIV entry pathway in most cell types (15Liu N.Q. Lossinsky A.S. Popik W. Li X. Gujuluva C. Kriederman B. Roberts J. Pushkarsky T. Bukrinsky M. Witte M. Weinand M. Fiala M. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 11166-11177Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). HIV transmission during cell-to-cell contacts follows the same mechanism as cell-free HIV particles for entry into target cells. However, the potential implications of synaptic structures in the mechanism of transmission are still unclear. We have used previously developed experimental models to study cell-to-cell contacts during HIV infection (22Blanco J. Barretina J. Ferri K.F. Jacotot E. Gutierrez A. Armand-Ugon M. Cabrera C. Kroemer G. Clotet B. Esté J.A. Virology. 2003; 305: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Barretina J. Blanco J. Armand-Ugón M. Gutiérrez A. Clotet B. Esté J.A.

We observed that during cellular contacts primary cells underwent massive cell-to-cell viral transmission. The characterization of this phenomenon showed that in addition to fusion-dependent HIV transmission, high amounts of HIV were reversibly transferred from infected cells to trypsin-resistant compartments of target cells by a mechanism that required gp120 binding to CD4 but not to coreceptor function. CD4 T cells lacking the appropriate coreceptor may therefore become an itinerant virus reservoir that may contribute to the spread of HIV infection. Cells—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation. When necessary, CD4 T cells were immediately purified (>95%) from PBMC by negative selection using the CD4 T cells enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Unless indicated, primary cells were used without previous stimulation. The CEM cell line derivative A201 lacking CD4 expression and several clones expressing either wild type CD4 (A301), a truncated form of CD4 at the position 403 which lacks the cytoplasmic tail (A201/403), and a chimeric CD4/CD8 protein (A201/CD8) that contains the gp120 binding site of CD4 were described by Dr. D. Littman (11Bedinger P. Moriarty A. von Borstel Jr., R.C. Donovan N.J. Steimer K.S. Littman D.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and obtained through Dr. M. Biard (Montpellier, France). Primary cells and CEM derivatives were cultured in RPMI. HeLa P4R5 and U87.CD4/CCR5 (NIBSC and NIH, AIDS Reagent Programs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and selection antibiotics when required. Viruses and Chronically Infected Cells—Recombinant viruses carrying envelope (Env) sequences corresponding to the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3 or the R5 HIV-1 strain BaL were constructed in a HIVHXB2 backbone as described previously (25Blanco J. Barretina J. Cabrera C. Gutierrez A. Clotet B. Esté J.A. Virology. 2001; 285: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and used to infect MOLT-4/CCR5. After the infection peak, persistently infected cultures were grown and characterized for Env expression and virus production (24Blanco J. Barretina J. Clotet B. Esté J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Uninfected MOLT-4/CCR5 cells were used as negative controls in all experiments. 8E5 cells, which carry one copy of the HIV genome defective for reverse transcriptase activity and produce noninfectious viral particles (26Gendelman H.E. Theodore T.S. Willey R. McCoy J. Adachi A. Mervis R.J. Venkatesan S. Martin M.A. Virology. 1987; 160: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were cultured in RPMI. Cocultures of Infected and Uninfected Cells—Primary cells (PBMC or purified CD4 T cells, 2 × 105 cells) were usually cultured in 96-well plates with effector (uninfected or infected) MOLT-4/CCR5 cells at a ratio of 1:1 in the absence or the presence of the following HIV inhibitors: 10 μg/ml murine IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), 0.25–5 μg/ml anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a or 10 μg/ml L120.3 (Becton & Dickinson), 10 μg/ml neutralizing anti-gp120 mAb IgGb12 or 2G12, 1 μm CCR5 antagonist TAK779 (all reagents from NIH AIDS Reagent Program and NIBSC AIDS Reagent Project), 1 μm gp41 inhibitor C34 (Service of Peptide Synthesis, University of Barcelona), and 2 μm reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT (Sigma). Other drugs used (all from Sigma) were 100 nm bafilomycin A1, 1 nm concanamycin A, 30–100 μm amiloride, and 1–3 μm cytochalasin D. The A201 cell line and its derivatives were cultured for 6 h in conic bottom tubes with effector (uninfected or BaL-infected) MOLT-4/CCR5 cells at a ratio of 1:1 in the absence or the presence of 0.25 μg/ml of the anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a or 1 μm gp41 inhibitor C34. Target cells were labeled with 1 μm CMFDA (green cell tracker, Molecular Probes) and washed exhaustively before being cocultured with effector cells. Evaluation of HIV Transfer—After coculture, cells were stained with anti-CD8-PerCP and anti-CD3-FITC to identify cellular populations, or with Leu3a or L120.3 anti-CD4 mAbs to evaluate CD4 internalization. Binding of gp120 to CD4 masks the Leu3a but not the L120.3 epitope (27Healey D. Dianda L. Moore J.P. McDougal J.S. Moore M.J. Estess P. Buck D. Kwong P.D. Beverley P.C. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After surface staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized (Fix & Perm, Caltag, Burlingame, CA), and stained with KC57 anti-HIV-p24 antigen (p24) mAb (Coulter, Barcelona, Spain) and analyzed in a FAC-Scalibur flow cytometer (Becton & Dickinson) or visualized in a Nikon eclipse TE-200 microscope coupled to a CCD Kappa camera. In cocultures involving PMBC, primary CD4 T cells were identified after simultaneous staining of HIV antigen p24, CD3, and CD8. When CD4 T cells were purified prior to coculture, target cells were gated by morphological parameters. Morphologically gated cells were 98% single CD4 T cells (24Blanco J. Barretina J. Clotet B. Esté J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In some experiments, in which morphological identification was not feasible, target cells were labeled with the CMFDA green cell tracker. For trypsin treatment, prior to staining, cells were washed and were treated (5′–20′, reverse transcriptase) with 0.25% trypsin solution (Invitrogen). The action of trypsin was controlled by the disappearance of the Leu3a epitope of CD4 in trypsin-treated cells (28Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin action was stopped by the addition of fetal calf serum. Cells were then washed and stained as indicated above. Quantification of HIV transfer was either assessed by the percentage of p24+ cells (using uninfected cells as control) or by the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI), which reflects the ratio of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values obtained from infected and uninfected samples. In some experiments, up to 1 mg/ml Alexa 488-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes) was added to cells 30 min prior to mixing and maintained during the coculture period (6–24 h). Analysis of dextran uptake was performed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Fusion Assays—HIV-mediated fusion was determined in cocultures of uninfected or infected MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with reporter HeLa P4R5 cells (ratio 1:1) in the absence or presence of the above-mentioned drugs. Reporter cells express β-galactosidase under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, which is activated after cell-to-cell or virus-to-cell fusion. After 24 h of coculture, syncytium formation was scored by visualizing cultures in a Nikon Eclipse TE-200 microscope, and long terminal repeat transactivation was measured by determining β-galactosidase activity in lysed (0.5% Nonidet P-40) cells as described previously (24Blanco J. Barretina J. Clotet B. Esté J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Cocultured cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h, and washed twice in cacodylate buffer before postfixation in 1% osmium (1 h) and final wash in cacodylate buffer. Hot (50 °C) agar was then added to the cells. After solidification, small (1 mm3) blocks were cut, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, included in araldite, and incubated at 60 °C for 48 h. Thin sections were cut to select areas of the block to be processed for analysis of ultrathin sections in a Jeol JEM 1010 electron microscope. Infectivity of Captured Virions—To analyze the fate of captured virions, we purified CD4 T cells after coculture with BaL-infected MOLT-4/CCR5 cells. Briefly, 10 × 106 CD4 T cells were cultured with 10 × 106 BaL-infected MOLT-4/CCR5 in 15-ml tubes in a final volume of 1 ml in the absence or presence of 10 μm TAK779 or 10 μg/ml mAb IgGb12. After 6 h of coculture, cells were recovered, and CD4 T cells were purified again by negative selection using the CD4 T cells enrichment kit. Purified cells were assayed for the percentage of contaminating MOLT-4/CCR5 cells by both morphological parameters and p24 staining and treated with trypsin for 10 min to remove extracellular attached viruses and antibodies. After extensive washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the absence or presence of 1 μm AZT to prevent productive infection. The content of p24 antigen was evaluated at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h in the supernatant (Innogenetics enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, Barcelona, Spain) and in the purified cells by flow cytometry as indicated above. Supernatants were recovered at 12 h of culture, and their infective titer was evaluated in U87.CD4/CCR5 cells. Syncytium formation were evaluated at day 6 postinfection by visualizing cultures in a Nikon Eclipse TE-200 fluorescence microscope after staining with 1 μm Hoechst 33324. Wells showing syncytia with more than four nuclei were scored as positive to calculate infectious titers. Analysis of HIV Transfer in Primary Cells—PBMC were stimulated for 48 h with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin and 10 IU/ml interleukin (IL)-2 and then infected with the R5 HIV-1 BaL strain (100 ng of p24 antigen/107 cells) for 4 h at 37 °C. After removal of unbound virus, cells were cultured at 106 cells/ml in RPMI containing 20% fetal calf serum and 10 IU/ml IL-2. In the following days, the expression of p24 antigen, CD3, CD4, and CD8 was monitored by flow cytometry as described above. Usually at day 4 after infection, the percentage of CD8-/CD4-/p24+ cells reached a plateau (4–6% of total lymphocytes), and CD8+ and CD4+ cells were depleted from the culture using a combination of CD8 and CD4 T cells enrichment kits. Only CD8-/CD4-/p24+ cells were considered to be productively infected because of the complete disappearance of CD4 from the surface of HIV-infected cells. Selected cells were reanalyzed for p24 antigen expression and were cocultured for 24 h with unstimulated uninfected fresh CMFDA-labeled CD4 T cells (ratio 1:1) in the presence of IL-2 (10 IU/ml) to maintain HIV expression by infected cells. Transfer of p24 antigen from infected to uninfected cells labeled with CMFDA was assayed as described above. Transfer of HIV Antigens during Cell-to-cell Contacts—We studied cell-to-cell virus transmission in cocultures of unstimulated PBMC (target cells) with several MOLT-4/CCR5 cell lines (24Blanco J. Barretina J. Clotet B. Esté J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) either uninfected or infected with the CXCR4-using HIV isolate NL4-3 or the CCR5-using HIV isolate BaL (effector cells). After 24 h of coculture, staining for HIV antigen p24 (p24) revealed high levels of HIV antigens in PBMC (21 and 55% of primary cells stained positive for p24 after contacting HIV-1 NL4-3- and BaL-infected cells, respectively, Fig. 1A). Cell-free virus preparations containing amounts of p24 equivalent to infected cells failed to transfer HIV antigens to unstimulated primary lymphocytes 24 h postinfection (<3% of p24+ cells, Fig. 1B), indicating that p24 antigen uptake occurred during cell-to-cell contacts. Combined CD3 and CD8 staining showed a low level of transfer of p24 (less than 10% of p24+ cells) to CD4- lymphocyte subsets (CD3+/CD8+, CD3-/CD8+, or CD3-/CD8-, Fig. 1C), whereas a high percentage of CD3+/CD8- cells (identified as CD4+ cells, Fig. 1D) were positive for p24 antigen staining. In all experiments performed, BaL-infected cells induced the highest level of HIV antigen transfer, albeit of low CCR5 and high CXCR4 expression in target cells (10 ± 2% and 96 ± 4% of positive cells, respectively; data not shown). Moreover, the transfer of BaL antigens from infected to target cells was blocked by the neutralizing anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a (Fig. 2A) but was unaffected by a coreceptor antagonist, a gp41 peptide or a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (TAK779, C34, or AZT, respectively) (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed when NL4-3-infected MOLT-4/CCR5 cells were used. In this case, the blockade of CXCR4 with AMD3100 or gp41 with C34 induced a significant increase in the amount of transferred NL4-3 antigens (Fig. 2B), concomitant to a total inhibition of cell-to-cell fusion and cell death (22Blanco J. Barretina J. Ferri K.F. Jacotot E. Gutierrez A. Armand-Ugon M. Cabrera C. Kroemer G. Clotet B. Esté J.A. Virology. 2003; 305: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The activity of anti-HIV drugs was evaluated in cocultures of MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with HeLa P4R5 cells and contrasted with the lack of inhibition or enhancing effect on virus transfer (Table I). To confirm that p24 content in CD4 T cells was the result of direct antigen transfer, we cocultured PBMC with 8E5 cells, which produce replication-defective HIV particles (26Gendelman H.E. Theodore T.S. Willey R. McCoy J. Adachi A. Mervis R.J. Venkatesan S. Martin M.A. Virology. 1987; 160: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Coculture resulted in the transfer of high amounts of HIV antigens to CD4 T cells (Fig. 2C) which was inhibited by Leu3a, unaffected by the reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT, and increased by the fusion inhibitor C34 (Fig. 2D). Taken together these results suggested that accumulation of p24 in CD4 T cells occurred by fusion-independent transfer of HIV antigens from infected to target cells in the absence of de novo viral production in CD4 T cells.Table IInhibition of HIV Env-mediated fusion and transfer by HIV entry inhibitorsHIV Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusionaPercent inhibition assayed after 24 h of coculture of MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with HeLa P4R5 cells by determining β-galactosidase activityHIV-Env mediated cell-to-cell transferbPercent inhibition assayed after 24 h of coculture of MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with CD4 T cells by p24 stainingNL43BaLNL43BaL%%Leu3a94 ± 896 ± 596 ± 297 ± 3AMD310094 ± 7<20330 ± 27(enh)c(enh) indicates significant enhancing effect compared with untreated cocultures<20TAK779<2091 ± 2<20<20C3485 ± 596 ± 5310 ± 22 (enh)<20AZT<20<20<20<20a Percent inhibition assayed after 24 h of coculture of MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with HeLa P4R5 cells by determining β-galactosidase activityb Percent inhibition assayed after 24 h of coculture of MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with CD4 T cells by p24 stainingc (enh) indicates significant enhancing effect compared with untreated cocultures Open table in a new tab CD4 T Cells Internalized HIV Particles and Cell Surface CD4 during Cell-to-cell Contacts—To evaluate the role of HIV binding to CD4 in viral transfer, we measured the occupancy of the gp120 binding site of CD4 using the Leu3a mAb, directed against this site. Cell surface CD4 expression was monitored using the gp120-insensitive mAb L120.3. Cocultures of HIV BaL-infected cells with CD4 T cells reduced the levels of CD4 expression in target cells as measured by both Leu3a and L120.3 mAbs (Fig. 3A). Reduction of MFI was higher for the Leu3a mAb but was also significant for the L120.3 epitope. Interestingly, the extent of CD4 down-modulation correlated with the extent of HIV uptake (35 ± 14% and 69 ± 4% reduction induced by NL4-3 and BaL-infected cells, respectively, Fig. 3B), suggesting that a fraction of CD4 molecules disappears from the cell surface during cell-to-cell contacts. Because HIV binding has been associated with endocytosis in different cell lines including primary cells (29Marechal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the role of HIV internalization in virus transfer. Trypsin treatment of CD4 T cells cocultured for 24 h with uninfected or BaL-infected MOLT-4/CCR5 cells removed almost completely (more than 90%) cell surface CD4. However, trypsin had a low impact in the percentage of p24+ cells (89% versus 86%, Fig. 3C), although the MFI of p24 antigen staining was lowered by 58 ± 4%. Increasing the time of trypsin treatment failed to increase p24 removal (Fig. 3D). Moreover, similar amounts of trypsin-resistant p24 antigen were observed in the presence of the inhibitors TAK779 and C34 (Fig. 3E). Kinetic analysis of trypsinized or untreated cocultures of MOLT-4/CCR5 cells with CD4 T cells showed HIV transfer at short incubation times (2–4 h) that rapidly directed p24 antigen to trypsin-resistant compartments. Longer incubation times (up to 24 h) allowed for the progressive accumulation of extracellular HIV antigens from BaL-infected cells. In contrast, NL4-3-infected cells transferred p24 antigen with a different profile, showing a stable and low level of trypsin-resistant antigen transfer (Fig. 3F). In fluorescence microscopy analysis of trypsinized cocultures, HIV BaL-infected cells showed homogeneous p24 antigen staining, whereas the smaller target cells showed punctuated trypsin-resistant staining (Fig. 4A, i–iii). We further confirmed HIV internalization by electron microscopy. Effector and target cells were clearly identified by size, heterochromatin structure, and cytoplasm opacity. Ultrastructural analysis revealed strong cell-to-cell contacts between HIV-infected MOLT-4/CCR5 and CD4 T cells in which viruses accumulate. HIV particles were readily identified on the surface of CD4 T cells at the sites of cell-to-cell contacts (Fig. 4B, i) and at sites of membrane appendage (Fig. 4B, ii), inducing lamellipodia that seemed to engulf HIV particles. Moreover, 14% of cells showed large intracellular vesicles ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 μm, with an average diameter 0.7 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 4B, iii–vi). Most positive cells displayed at least one vesicle that contained 1–14 (8 ± 4) viral particles, confirming that primary CD4 T cells internalize HIV by endocytic mechanisms after viral presentation by infected cells. HIV Uptake Required Intact Actin Cytoskeleton and Binding of gp120 to CD4 but Not the Cytoplasmic Tail of CD4—To characterize the requirements for the activation of HIV uptake induced by cellular contacts, we investigated the effect of several mAbs directed against different epitopes of CD4 or gp120. The anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a and the anti-gp120 mAb IgGb12 that block gp120-CD4 interaction inhibited HIV uptake by CD4 T cells either measured as the percentage of p24+ cells (Fig. 5) or as the MFI of p24 staining in CD4 T cells (data not shown). This effect was concomitant with a near total inhibition (80–100%) of HIV envelope-induced fusion (Fig. 5). In contrast, anti-gp120 or anti-CD4 antibodies (2G12 and L.120.3, respectively) shown not to block the binding of gp120 to CD4 (27Healey D. Dianda L. Moore J.P. McDougal J.S. Moore M.J. Estess P.

https://openalex.org/W1522870487,"β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a membrane-bound aspartic protease that cleaves amyloid precursor protein to produce a neurotoxic peptide, Aβ, and is implicated in triggering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. We previously reported that BACE1 cleaved rat β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I) that was overexpressed in COS cells and that the NH2 terminus of ST6Gal I secreted from the cells (E41 form) was Glu41. Here we report that BACE1 gene knock-out mice have one third as much plasma ST6Gal I as control mice, indicating that BACE1 is a major protease which is responsible for cleaving ST6Gal I in vivo. We also found that BACE1-transgenic mice have increased level of ST6Gal I in plasma. Secretion of ST6Gal I from the liver into the plasma is known to be up-regulated during the acute-phase response. To investigate the role of BACE1 in ST6Gal I secretion in vivo, we analyzed the levels of BACE1 mRNA in the liver, as well as the plasma levels of ST6Gal I, in a hepatopathological model, i.e. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats. This rat is a mutant that spontaneously accumulates copper in the liver and incurs hepatic damage. LEC rats exhibited simultaneous increases in BACE1 mRNA in the liver and in the E41 form of the ST6Gal I protein, the BACE1 product, in plasma as early as 6 weeks of age, again suggesting that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I in vivo and controls the secretion of the E41 form. β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a membrane-bound aspartic protease that cleaves amyloid precursor protein to produce a neurotoxic peptide, Aβ, and is implicated in triggering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar). Aβ, a 39-43-residue peptide, is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of β-and γ-secretases. APP is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein which is present in the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. Cleavage of APP by β-secretase (BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1)) initially produces a soluble NH2-terminal fragment (APPsβ) and a 12-kDa COOH-terminal fragment (C99) that remains membrane-bound. Subsequently, C99 is cleaved by γ-secretase in its transmembrane region, resulting in production of the pathogenic Aβ peptide (2De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and secretion is enhanced during acute-phase hepatic reactions (23Kaplan H.A. Woloski B.M. Hellman M. Jamieson J.C. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We previously found that BACE1 is involved in the cleavage and secretion of ST6Gal I, at least in cultured cells (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Kotani N. Ogawa K. Suzuki M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol.

To confirm in vivo cleavage of ST6Gal I by BACE1, in the present study we analyzed plasma ST6Gal I levels in BACE1-deficient and BACE1-transgenic mice. We also used a mutant animal strain, the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat, to analyze the mechanisms of ST6Gal I secretion in hepatopathological conditions. The LEC rat, a model of Wilson disease, has a deletion in the gene for the copper-transporting ATPase gene (ATP7B) (27Yoshida M.C. Masuda R. Sasaki M. Takeichi N. Kobayashi H. Dempo K. Mori M. J. Hered. 1987; 78: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Li Y. Togashi Y. Sato S. Emoto T. Kang J.H. Takeichi N. Kobayashi H. Kojima Y. Une Y. Uchino J. J. Clin.

Golgi-localized ATP7B is involved in copper secretion into the plasma, which is coupled with ceruloplasmin synthesis and biliary copper excretion (30Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Like patients with Wilson disease, LEC rats suffer from toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and eventually develop hepatitis and then hepatocellullar carcinoma (31Mori M. Yoshida M.C. Takechi N. Taniguchi N. The LEC Rat, A New Model for Hepatitis and Liver Cancer. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1991Google Scholar). This rat strain is often utilized for studying the pathogenesis of hepatitis and hepatoma. On the assumption that ST6Gal I secretion is stimulated in the hepatopathological model of LEC rats and that such stimulation is related to the level of BACE1 activity, we analyzed the expression profiles of mRNAs of ST6Gal I and BACE1 in the liver of LEC rats and also the secretion of ST6Gal I into plasma. Materials—Male LEC and Wistar rats, maintained in specific-patho-gen-free conditions, were purchased from Charles River Japan Inc. (Yokohama, Japan) and the Shizuoka Agricultural Cooperative Association for Laboratory Animals (Shizuoka, Japan), respectively. Samples of LEA (Long-Evans Agouti) rats were kindly provided by Dr. Noriyuki Kasai, Tohoku University. BACE1 knock-out mice and their control mice from Amgen were maintained in the Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). BACE1-transgenic mice were prepared by using an overexpression cassette, in which the chicken β-actin promoter drived the expression of human BACE1 (32Shitara H. Kaneda H. Sato A. Iwasaki K. Hayashi J. Taya C. Yonekawa H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sources of materials used in this work were as follows: tissue culture media and reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and William's E medium, were from Invitrogen; Expre35S35S protein labeling mix was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; recombinant N-glycosidase F from Roche Diagnostics, CMP-[14C]NeuAc and protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow were from Amersham Biosciences; affinity Gel-CDP from Merck/EMD Bioscience (San Diego, CA); protein molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad; and all other chemicals from Sigma or Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Protein concentration was determined with Pierce BCA protein assay reagents. Anti-BACE1 antibody was purchased from MoBiTec Co. (Göttingen, Germany). We used anti-ST6Gal I polyclonal antibodies to detect ST6Gal I from plasma and to immunoprecipitate ST6Gal I proteins from cell lysates and media of hepatocytes (33Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13845-13853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E41 antibody that specifically recognizes ST6Gal I starting at Glu41 was obtained from IBL Co. (Fujioka, Japan). Pulse-Chase Analysis and Immunoprecipitation of ST6Gal I Using Rat Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes (∼5 × 106 cells), isolated from 10-week-old male Wistar rats by two-step collagenase perfusion (34Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar), were seeded on collagen type I-coated plates (100-mm, Iwaki, Funabashi, Japan) and were grown in William's E medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Metabolic labeling of cells and immunoprecipitation of expressed proteins were performed essentially as described previously, using Expre35S35S protein label (100 μCi/ml) (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 35Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsuji S. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 18 h, or labeled with 2 h and chased for 6 or 18 h, in 4 ml of William's E medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The collected media were diluted with 4 ml of Pierce binding buffer, and the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). From the cell lysates and media, ST6Gal I proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ST6Gal I or E41 polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in Laemili sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol by boiling for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5-20% gradient of polyacrylamide), and radiolabeled proteins were visualized with a BAS 2000 radioimage analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from rat livers using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5-10 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers by using a Super Script II RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was then amplified with 900 nm forward primer, 900 nm reverse primer, 250 nm fluorogenic probe, and 25 μl of Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 20 μl, using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 50 °C for 1 min. All primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The sequences of primers and probes were as follows: ST6Gal I, 5′-CAGCAAGCAAGACCCTAAGGA-3′ (forward primer), and 5′-CTGGAAGGAAGGCTGTGGTTT-3′ (reverse primer), 5′-CCAATCCTCAGTTACCACAGGGTCACAGC-3′ (probe); BACE2, 5′-AGAACGCCAGTCGCTCCTT-3′ (forward primer), 5′-ATTGAAACCAGCTCCCATCATG-3′ (reverse primer), 5′-CACCATTCTGCCACAGCTCTACATTCAGC-3′ (probe). For BACE1 and GAPDH primers and probes, we used Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression Products, and cDNAs were added to the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), which contained all reagents for PCR. The probes for ST6Gal I, BACE1, and BACE2 were labeled with the reporter fluorescent dye FAM. The probes for GAPDH were labeled with VIC at the 5′ ends and at the 3′ ends were labeled with the quencher dye TAMRA. The expression levels of target genes were measured in duplicate and were normalized to the GAPDH expression levels. Characterization of BACE1-deficient and BACE1-transgenic Mice—Genotypes of BACE1-deficient and control mice were confirmed by PCR analysis using genomic DNA prepared from livers and primers (primer 1, 5′-TGG ATG CCC ATT CTT TCT GAC GA-3′ and primer 2, 5′-AGG CAC TAA CCA CTA GCC TGT TCA-3′). A 770-bp fragment was detected in wild-type mice, and a 3.5-kb fragment was detected in the BACE1-deficient mice. We also examined the level of BACE1 protein in the livers of BACE1-deficient and BACE1-transgenic mice by Western blot analysis. Mouse livers were homogenized with buffer H (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl). Microsome fraction (50 or 100 μg) that was solubilized with buffer S (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) was treated with Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5-20% gradient), and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-BACE1 (1:1,000). horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, 1:1,000) was used as the secondary antibody, and chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for detection (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Detection of ST6Gal I Protein—Plasma from mice (50 μl) were diluted with 10 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then loaded onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (1 ml of gel volume, Amersham Biosciences) using an Akta Prime system. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A, and protein was then eluted with a gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl for 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were collected every minute, and the ST6Gal I elution pattern was monitored by immunostainingwith anti-ST6Gal I antibody. ST6Gal I-containing fractions were pooled and precipitated with ice-cold acetone. Plasma from rats (600 μg of protein) were treated by the Montage Albumin Depletion kit from Millipore (Bedford, MA) and then precipitated with ice-cold acetone. To see the level of soluble ST6Gal I, protein samples were suspended in PBST buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5-20% gradient), and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-ST6Gal I (1:100). horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, 1:10,000) was used as the secondary antibody, and chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for detection (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). ST6Gal I detected by anti-ST6Gal I antibody was quantified with a Luminoimage Analyzer LAS-1000 PLUS (Fuji). For N-glycosidase F treatment, the sample precipitated with acetone was resuspended in 60 μl of N-glycosidase F buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and then divided into two. The subsamples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in the presence or absence of 1 unit of N-glycosidase F. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ST6Gal I antibody. Partial Purification of ST6Gal I Proteins from Rat Plasma—Plasma (10 ml) from Wistar rats was diluted with 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and dialyzed against buffer A. The sample was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (26 mm inner diameter × 100 mm, Amersham Biosciences) using an FPLC system. The column was washed with 250 ml of buffer A, and protein was then eluted with a gradient of 0-0.6 m NaCl for 120 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions were collected every minute, and the ST6Gal I elution pattern was monitored by immunostaining samples of the eluant with anti-ST6Gal I antibody. The fraction rich in ST6Gal I protein was dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 0.1 m NaCl) and then loaded onto a 2-ml CDP-gel column. Unbound material was washed out with buffer C, and bound material was eluted with a stepwise gradient of buffer D (10 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 0.075 n NaCl, 10 mm CDP). Sialyltransferase Assay—Enzyme assays were carried out in the presence of 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.5% Triton CF-54, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mg/ml asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein, 0.2 mm CMP-[14C]NeuAc (1.8 mCi/mmol), and 50 μl of enzyme fraction, in a total volume of 100 μl, as described previously (33Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13845-13853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 or 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction products were subjected to Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography to separate the radioactive product from unreacted CMP-[14C]NeuAc. The elution profiles were monitored by scintillation counting. Plasma ST6Gal I Levels Were Decreased in BACE1-deficient Mice—ST6Gal I is highly expressed in the liver (20Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a membrane-bound form of ST6Gal I is proteolytically cleaved in the trans-Golgi network and then secreted into the plasma (22Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13845-13853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that secretion of ST6Gal I was markedly increased by overexpression of BACE1 in COS cells (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), indicating that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I at least in the cultured cells. To demonstrate cleavage of ST6Gal I by BACE1 also in vivo, we utilized BACE1-deficient mice for analyzing plasma ST6Gal I levels, expecting ST6Gal I cleavage and secretion to be lacking or diminished. At first we examined geno-types of BACE1-deficient and control mice by PCR (Fig. 1A), and then confirmed the absence or presence of BACE1 protein in the microsome fraction prepared from the liver (Fig. 1B). From mouse plasma, ST6Gal I was partially purified or enriched by HiTrap Q anionic exchange chromatography. Western blot analysis of ST6Gal I-enriched fraction revealed that ST6Gal I levels in BACE1-deficient mice were decreased to ∼30% that of control mice (Fig. 1C), suggesting that BACE1 is a major protease that cleaves ST6Gal I to induce its secretion in vivo and that the remaining plasma ST6Gal I in BACE1-deficient mice may be cleaved by some other protease(s). We next studied whether the elevated level of BACE1 could cause the elevation of the plasma ST6Gal I in vivo. To do so, we have generated the two lines of BACE1-transgenic mice that express human BACE1 under the control of actin promoter for ubiquitous expression. We detected high BACE1 expression in the liver of both of two lines (Fig. 2, upper panel). Both of BACE1-transgenic mice had elevated levels of plasma ST6Gal I as compared with the control mice (Fig. 2, lower panel).Fig. 2BACE1-transgenic mice had elevated levels of plasma ST6Gal I. Human BACE1 was overexpressed under the control of the actin promoter in BACE1-transgenic mice (#1 and #6). BACE1 proteins in the microsome fraction (50 μg of protein), prepared from liver homogenates of BACE1-transgeninc and control mice, were analyzed by immunostaining with anti-BACE1 antibody (upper panel). ST6Gal I in plasma was partially purified and its level was quantified by immunostaining with anti-ST6Gal I antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ST6Gal I Secretion in Rat Plasma—We previously reported that rat ST6Gal I secreted from COS cells has a sequence of Glu41-Phe42-Gln43 at its amino terminus (E41 form) (25Kitazume S.

Tsuji S. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BACE1 in COS cells markedly increased the secretion of the E41 form (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We found that BACE1 first cleaved rat ST6Gal I between Leu37 and Gln38 to generate the sequence Gln38-Ala39-Lys40-Glu41-Phe42-Gln43 at the amino terminus, and then the three terminal amino acids, Gln-Ala-Lys, were trimmed by a luminal aminopeptidase(s) to produce the E41 form that is secreted from the cells (26Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Kotani N. Ogawa K. Suzuki M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14865-14871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For further clarification of the in vivo cleavage and secretion of ST6Gal I, we looked for the E41 form in rat plasma. Western blot analysis using anti-ST6Gal I antibody revealed two isoforms of soluble ST6Gal I in the plasma of Wistar rats (Fig. 3). After N-glycosidase F treatment to remove N-glycans, the two isoforms were still detected as a pair of bands on an immunoblot, but with slightly increased mobility, suggesting that the difference between the isoforms is not due to the presence of N-glycan structures but rather to the position of the cleavage sites. The two isoforms were separated by anion-exchange FPLC chromatography (Fig. 4A). These isoforms were subjected to immunostaining in which we used an E41-antibody that specifically recognizes the E41 form (25Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 26Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Kotani N. Ogawa K. Suzuki M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. J.

E41-antibody reacted only with the higher molecular weight isoform, suggesting that it is the E41 form, most likely produced by BACE1 (Fig. 4B). The lower molecular weight isoform (LMW form) has a distinct cleavage site, possibly produced by some other protease(s).Fig. 4Higher molecular weight isoform starts at Glu41. A, a profile of Mono Q HR anion-exchange FPLC for rat plasma sample is shown (lower panel). Aliquots were taken from every third or fourth fraction for immunostaining with anti-ST6Gal I antibody (upper panel).

We queried the Arabidopsis thaliana genome data base in search of genes with similarity to the human telomere proteins hTRF1 and hTRF2. hTRF1/hTRF2 are distinguished by the presence of a single Myb-like domain in their C terminus that is required for telomeric DNA binding in vitro. Twelve Arabidopsis genes fitting this criterion, dubbed TRF-like (TRFL), fell into two distinct gene families. Notably, TRFL family 1 possessed a highly conserved region C-terminal to the Myb domain called Myb-extension (Myb-ext) that is absent in TRFL family 2 and hTRF1/hTRF2. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that recombinant proteins from TRFL family 1, but not those from family 2, formed homodimers and heterodimers in vitro. DNA binding studies with isolated C-terminal fragments from TRFL family 1 proteins, but not family 2, showed specific binding to double-stranded plant telomeric DNA in vitro. Removal of the Myb-ext domain from TRFL1, a family 1 member, abolished DNA binding. However, when the Myb-ext domain was introduced into the corresponding region in TRFL3, a family 2 member, telomeric DNA binding was observed.

Telomeres are the specialized nucleoprotein structures that comprise the natural ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes and ensure their complete replication and stability (1Blackburn E.H.

In most eukaryotes, telomeric DNA is composed of tandem arrays of simple G-rich repeat sequences terminating in a single-strand 3′-overhang, which is maintained through the action of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3006) Google Scholar). Both the double and single-strand regions of the telomere are coated with non-histone proteins that provide protection for telomeric DNA and regulate telomerase access to the chromosome terminus. Proteins that bind double-strand telomeric DNA are typified in vertebrates by TRF1 and TRF2 and in budding and fission yeast by Rap1 and Taz1, respectively (3Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D.

Inhibition of hTRF2 in cultured human cells results in the loss of the 3′-overhang and the formation of covalently fused telomeres (15van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). In addition, compromised hTRF2 function culminates in cell cycle arrest and ATM/p53-mediated apoptosis (16Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The functional domains of vertebrate TRF1 and TRF2 have been studied in some detail (17Rhodes D. Fairall L. Simonsson T. Court R. Chapman L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The two proteins have similar molecular masses (50–60 kDa), and resemble each other in domain structure. Although the N terminus is highly acidic in hTRF1 and highly basic in hTRF2, both proteins harbor a centrally located flexible hinge region called the TRF homology (TRFH) domain that is required for homodimer formation and interactions with other telomere-associated proteins (18Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The most strongly conserved feature is a Myb/homeodomain-type helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif near the C terminus (5Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat.

The Myb domain is sufficient for specific binding to the telomeric DNA in vitro, but dimerization through the TRFH domain is required for TRF protein association with DNA in vivo (18Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Bilaud et al. noted a sequence within the Myb domain of hTRF1 and hTRF2, VDLKDKWRT, that is also conserved in yeast double-strand telomere-binding proteins and dubbed it the telobox consensus (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). An NMR structure of the Myb motif from hTRF1 revealed specific contacts between amino acid residues within the telobox consensus and the human telomere repeat sequence TTAGGG (22Nishikawa T. Okamura H. Nagadoi A. Koig P. Rhodes D. Nishimura Y. Nucleic Acids Res. Suppl. 2001; 1: 273-274Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although the plant telomere repeat sequence, TTTAGGG, is closely related to that of humans (23Richards E.J. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), almost nothing is known about the protein composition of plant telomeres.

Genome. 2004; 47: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). From Arabidopsis these include several relatively small (∼30 kDa) proteins with N-terminal Myb domains (30Schrumpfova P. Kuchar M. Mikova G. Skrisovska L. Kubicarova T. Fajkus J. Genome. 2004; 47: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Marian C.O. Bordoli S.J. Goltz M. Santarella R.A. Jackson L.P.

Two other telomeric DNA binding proteins, TRP1 and TBP1, more closely resemble vertebrate TRF1 and TRF2 in size (65 and 70 kDa, respectively) and in architecture as they harbor a single Myb domain in their C terminus. TRP1 from Arabidopsis was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screen for proteins that bind double-strand telomeric DNA (26Chen C.M. Wang C.T. Ho C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16511-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Like vertebrate TRF1 and TRF2, full-length TRP1 shows a strong in vitro preference for extended telomeric DNA tracts with a minimum binding site of five TTTAGGG repeats. Another Arabidopsis gene that harbors a single Myb domain at its C terminus is TBP1. TBP1 encodes a homolog of the rice RTBP1, which has been shown to specifically bind plant telomeric DNA in vitro (27Hwang M.G. Chung I.K. Kang B.G. Cho M.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Yu E.Y. Kim S.E. Kim J.H. Ko J.H. Cho M.H. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24208-24214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study we employed a BLAST search to identify Arabidopsis homologs of hTRF1 and hTRF2 using their Myb domains as the query. Although Arabidopsis harbors more than 100 genes with Myb domains (32Kranz H.D. Denekamp M. Greco R. Jin H. Leyva A. Meissner R.C. Petroni K. Urzainqui A. Bevan M. Martin C. Smeekens S. Tonelli C. Paz-Ares J. Weisshaar B. Plant J. 1998; 16: 263-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found only 12 with a single Myb domain in their C terminus that contains the telobox consensus motif. We designated this group of genes TRF-like (TRFL). Here we provide a molecular characterization of the TRFL proteins. Our data reveal that the TRFL genes encode two distinct families of proteins that differ dramatically in their amino acid sequences, DNA binding properties, and protein interactions. Furthermore, we define a novel functional domain C-terminal to the Myb domain that is required for specific binding to duplex plant telomeric DNA. Computer Search for Myb-containing Genes and Evolutionary Tree Analysis—The Myb-domains of hTRF1, hTRF2, and Arabidopsis TRP1 were used in separate NCBI Blast searches to identify Arabidopsis thaliana genes predicted to encode proteins with a single Myb repeat at the C terminus. The telobox consensus motif was used as an additional criterion (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Twelve TRFL genes were identified (see GenBank™ accession numbers in Table I). Multiple protein alignments were conducted using the Oxford Molecular Group's sequence analysis software MacVector 7.0 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). A tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method (33Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with the bootstrap mode (34Felsenstein J.

Open table in a new tab Expression Analysis, Molecular Cloning, and Production of Recombinant Proteins in Vitro—Reverse transcription PCR was performed for 35 cycles using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Sigma) to determine whether TRFL genes were expressed in different Arabidopsis tissues. For most of the TRFL genes, primers flanked intron junctions, ruling out the possibility of genomic DNA contamination. Full-length cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription PCR using total RNA from flowers. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs verified the NCBI annotations. For protein interaction studies, the full-length cDNAs of TRFL genes were subcloned into pET-28A and pCITE 4A. For DNA binding studies, PCR was used to amplify either full-length coding regions or the Myb domains and the adjacent C-terminal region using plasmids that contained full-length cDNAs (see Table I for specific residues amplified). Overlapping PCR (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) was applied to create the fusion constructs shown in Fig. 6A. A T7 phage promoter was introduced into all the constructs by PCR, and the products were used as templates for in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). Transcripts were translated in either rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) or a wheat germ translation system (Promega) in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). An aliquot of the labeled protein was used to verify the expected apparent molecular weight of translated protein products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Telomeric DNA probes and competitors were 5′-AGCATGCAGC(TTTAGGG)8-3′, 5′-AGCATGCAGC(TTTAGGG)6-3′, 5′-AGCATGCAGC(TTTAGGG)4-3′, and 5′-AGCATGCAGC(TTTAGGG)2-3′ from Arabidopsis, 5′-AGCATGCAGC(TTTGGG)8-3′ from Paramecium, and 5′-AGCATGCAGC(TTAGGG)8 from Homo sapiens. Double-strand DNA probes were obtained by annealing the corresponding complementary oligonucleotides. For gel shift assays, peptides consisting of the Myb domain and the remainder of the C terminus (see above) were tested for DNA binding activity. Preparation of the probes and binding reactions were carried out as described previously (36Hall A.R. Milner J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA and subjected to electrophoresis for 4 h at 120 V. Dried gels were exposed for autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation—For each TRFL protein analyzed, two constructs were made, one with a T7 protein tag and one without. [35S]methionine-labeled non-tagged proteins or T7-tagged unlabeled proteins were synthesized in a TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system following the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Translation of T7-tagged proteins was verified in the presence of [35S]methionine on a small aliquot from the same master mix. T7-tagged and untagged radiolabeled proteins were combined and subjected to immunoprecipitation using agarose beads (Novagen) containing the T7 monoclonal antibody as described (37Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24199-24207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Precipitate and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Identification and Expression of TRFL Genes in Arabidopsis—We performed a BLAST search to identify TRFL genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Three query sequences were employed consisting of the Myb domains from human TRF1 and TRF2 and from Arabidopsis TRP1. Twelve genes were uncovered that encode proteins with a single Myb domain at their C terminus (Fig. 1 and Table I). As expected, the searches found TRP1 and TBP1 (26Chen C.M. Wang C.T. Ho C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16511-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Hwang M.G. Chung I.K. Kang B.G. Cho M.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), along with 10 uncharacterized genes that were designated TRFL1–10. With the hTRF1 Myb domain as the query, the most closely related sequence was the Myb domain for TRFL6 (E value = 3e–05), whereas for hTRF2 the Myb domain of TRFL3 displayed the most similarity (E value = 3e–06). A conceptual protein alignment of the C-terminal Myb-containing region of TRFL proteins with the corresponding regions in hTRF1 and hTRF2 is shown in Fig. 1. The NMR structure of the Myb domain of hTRF1 bound to the human telomeric DNA repeat sequence reveals that the N-terminal arm of the first helix interacts with the TT sequence in the minor groove, whereas the third helix recognizes TAGGG in the major groove (22Nishikawa T. Okamura H. Nagadoi A. Koig P. Rhodes D. Nishimura Y. Nucleic Acids Res. Suppl. 2001; 1: 273-274Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The corresponding regions are well conserved among the Arabidopsis TRFL proteins and display extensive sequence similarity to hTRF1 and hTRF2 (Fig. 1A). The most highly conserved region within all of the TRFL proteins, VDLKDKWRT, lies within the telobox consensus. Evolutionary analysis indicated the presence of two distinct TRFL gene families (Fig. 1B). The TRFL family 1 includes TBP1, TRP1, TRFL1, TRFL2, TRFL4, and TRFL9, whereas the TRFL family 2 contains TRFL3, TRFL5–8, and TRFL10. The similarity within TRFL family 1 or family 2 members extends throughout their entire sequence, suggesting the DNA binding domains co-evolved with the remainder of the genes. Four of the TRFL genes reside in regions of the Arabidopsis genome that are known to be duplicated. These include TRP1 and TRFL1, which display 59% identity (70% similarity) and reside on chromosomes 5 and 3, respectively, and TRFL3 and TRFL6, which exhibit 52% identity (62% similarity) and are found in a duplicated region on chromosome 1. Although TBP1 and TRFL9 are not located in a duplicated region, they display a remarkably high degree of similarity (54% identity and 66% similarity) and, hence, may have been derived from a recent gene duplication. The same may also be true for TRFL2 and TRFL4 (30% identity and 40% similarity), although they share somewhat less conservation overall. Closer inspection of the predicted amino acid sequence for the TRFL proteins provided further evidence for distinct gene families. In all of the TRFL family 1 proteins, the region of amino acid conservation in the Myb domain extends further into the C terminus, creating a Myb extension (Myb-ext) domain (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, Myb-ext was absent from TRFL family 2 and from hTRF1 and hTRF2, which terminate immediately adjacent to the Myb domain. An additional region of substantial sequence conservation was detected in the central portion of TRFL family 1 members called the central domain (CD) (Fig. 2, A and B). This region bears no significant similarity to the TRFH domain in vertebrate TRF1/TRF2 proteins and is also absent in TRFL family 2. Aside from TRFL3 and TRFL6, which most likely represent a recent gene duplication, the remaining members of TRFL family 2 display no obvious sequence similarity outside their Myb domains. Reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that all of the TRFL genes are expressed in Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). Transcripts for each of the TRFL genes could be detected in all of the organs we examined (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Moreover, all of the genes were expressed at a relatively high level, with the exception of TRFL2 and TRFL4, which are both members of TRFL family 1. Although TRFL2 and TRFL4 were ubiquitously expressed, their transcripts were scarce and could only be observed by nested PCR (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the constitutive expression of TRFL genes is consistent with a structural role in the telomere complex. Proteins in TRFL Family 1 Can Form Homodimers and Heterodimers—Human TRF1 and TRF2 bind telomeric DNA as homodimers in vivo and in vitro (18Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether recombinant TRFL proteins could form homodimers in vitro using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For these studies, untagged [35S]methionine-labeled TRFL proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation in the presence of the corresponding unlabeled T7-tagged protein using a T7 antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). Following immunoprecipitation, a homomeric interaction with a tagged protein will allow a radiolabeled but untagged protein to precipitate with the beads. Control reactions performed in the absence of tagged proteins showed no interaction between the T7 antibody and untagged proteins (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 2 in all panels). However, specific homomeric protein interactions were detected for TRP1, TRFL1, TRFL2, TRFL4, and TRFL9 (Fig. 4A, upper panels, and Table I). All of these proteins are members of TRFL family 1. In contrast, TRFL3, TRFL5, and TRFL6, members of TRFL family 2, did not exhibit the capacity for homodimerization in vitro (Fig. 4A, lower panels, and Table I). Despite significant amino acid similarity in the TRFH domains of hTRF1 and hTRF2, steric hindrance prevents the formation of heterodimers (18Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRFL proteins have the capacity to heterodimerize in vitro, additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with family 1 members TRP1, TRFL1, and TRFL9 (Fig. 4B). These data showed that TRP1 and TRFL1 can heterodimerize, as can TRP1 and TRFL9. Interestingly, although TRP1 is closely related to TRFL1, it bears only limited sequence similarity to TRFL9 (38.2% identity and 46.3% similarity). Thus, it is conceivable that functionally distinct TRFL proteins interact directly in vivo. DNA Binding Properties of TRFL Proteins—We used EMSAs to see whether TRFL proteins bind telomeric DNA in vitro. Initially, several full-length recombinant proteins expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were tested for DNA binding. As expected from a previous study (26Chen C.M. Wang C.T. Ho C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16511-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), full-length TRP1 bound a duplex telomeric DNA probe consisting of eight TTTAGGG telomeric repeats (AtTR8) and formed a discrete protein-DNA complex that migrated into the gel, as well as complexes that stayed in the well (data not shown). Assays with other full-length TRFL proteins, including TRFL4 (Fig. 5A), produced complexes that failed to exit the well. However, such complexes were sequence-specific (Fig. 5A, left panel) and displayed length dependence in DNA binding (Fig. 5A, right panel). To alleviate the concern of protein aggregation and to further analyze protein-DNA interactions, we tested whether the isolated Myb domains from TRFL proteins would bind telomeric DNA in an EMSA. Previous studies showed that the corresponding regions of hTRF1, TRP1, and TBP1 were sufficient for specific interaction with duplex telomeric DNA in vitro (26Chen C.M. Wang C.T. Ho C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16511-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Hwang M.G. Chung I.K. Kang B.G. Cho M.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We expressed the corresponding region of TRFL proteins (Myb domain and the adjacent C-terminal region) in wheat germ extract, which we found yielded a higher amount of recombinant TRFL protein than did rabbit reticulocyte lysate. A summary of DNA binding results for the truncated TRFL proteins is shown in Table I. All members of TRFL family 1 bound specifically to plant telomeric DNA (Table I and Fig. 5, B and C). Surprisingly, the minimal number of repeats required for binding varied among the different proteins. For example, TRFL1 449–553 required a minimum of six telomere repeats for optimal binding (Fig. 5B, lane 6). Although a weak interaction was detected with probes consisting of four telomere repeats (Fig. 5B, lane 4), the complex appeared to be unstable, as no discrete band was observed. In contrast, binding assays with TRFL9 505–620 yielded a more discrete DNA-protein complex with a probe containing four telomeric repeats (Fig. 5C, lane 4, and data not shown). Although the relative migration position of the DNA-protein complexes appears different for TRFL1 449–553 and TRFL9 505–620 (Fig. 5, B and C), slightly different running conditions were used in the two gels. When the complexes were analyzed side-by-side on the same gel, they migrated at approximately the same position (Fig. 5D). Competition experiments revealed that the association of TRFL family 1 proteins with plant telomeric DNA is specific (Fig. 5B, lanes 8–12 and Fig. 5C, lanes 10–13, and data not shown). Competition was observed with probes consisting of double-stranded plant telomeric DNA, but not with nonspecific duplex DNA or duplex DNA comprised of human or Paramecium telomeric repeats (Fig. 5, A–C, and data not shown). Assays with single-stranded telomeric DNA competitor also failed to compete with duplex plant telomeric DNA for binding (data not shown). Strikingly, no DNA binding was detected in the EMSA with TRFL family 2 members using either full-length proteins or isolated Myb domains (plus the remaining C terminus) (Table I, and see Fig. 6). As for TRFL family 1 members, all of the recombinant proteins generated from TRFL family 2 genes expressed well in the wheat germ translation system and were soluble (data not shown). Hence, the lack of telomeric DNA binding is likely to reflect inherent differences in the properties of the two TRFL families rather than protein misfolding. We conclude that, in contrast to the situation with human TRF1 (39Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the capacity t"

The Gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri is the etiological agent of human bacillary dysentery (1Sansonetti P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). Shigellosis is caused by invasion of epithelial cells of the colonic mucosa leading to an acute inflammatory reaction. Pathogenicity of Shigella is linked to a large virulence plasmid carrying the 30-kb ipa-ipg/mxi-spa locus, considered as a pathogenicity island. The ipa and ipg genes encode effectors that mediate bacterial entry, as well as their chaperones. The mxi and spa genes encode the type III secretion system (TTSS) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; RBC, red blood cell; MeCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCRL, sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich liposome. that is required to transport type III effectors from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host cell plasma membrane/cytosol (2Blocker A.

Electron microscopy analysis of the Shigella TTSS indicated that it is composed of an internal cytoplasmic bulb, a transmembrane domain, and an external needle (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The needle has a length reaching up to 500 Å with an external diameter of ∼70 Å and an internal diameter of 20–30 Å (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.

A. 2003; 100: 3027-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). TTSSs share features with the bacterium flagellum suggesting a common evolutionary origin (13Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3027-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Aizawa A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 202: 157-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flagella are terminated by a flexible filament and a hook, the length of which is controlled by the fliK gene, i.e. FliK mutants show shorter hooks (15Hirano T. Yamaguchi S. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5439-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16Makishima S. Komoriya K. Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S. Science. 2001; 291: 2411-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, fliK is synthetically lethal to invJ in Salmonella and spa32 in Shigella, and spa32 mutants also show needle length defects (17Kubori T. Sukhan A. Aizawa S. Galan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10225-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Magdalena J. Hachani A. Chamekh M. Jouihri N. Gounon P. Blocker A. Allaoui A. J.

Recently, the Yersinia enterolitica yscP protein was shown to act as a molecular ruler with a strict linear relationship between the needle length and the number of amino acids in the central primary sequence of yscP (1.9 Å per amino acid) (20Journet L. Agrain C. Broz P. Cornelis G. Science. 2003; 302: 1757-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism applies also to FliK, InvJ, and Spa32 that behave as homologues remains to be demonstrated. Although the TTSS of Shigella is preassembled, it does not secrete type III effectors (21Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) until it is activated by contact of the needle tip with the host cell surface (22Menard R. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5293-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 23Watarai M. Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Upon cell contact, IpaB and -C are thought to perforate the host cell membrane making a proteinaceous 25 Å in diameter pore as suggested by hemolysis assays using osmoprotectants of various sizes (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Also, purified IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD are able to bind directly to liposomes (24De Geyter C. Vogt B. Benjelloun-Touimi Z. Sansonetti P. Ruysschaert J. Parsot C. Cabiaux V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25De Geyter C. Wattiez R. Sansonetti P. Falmagne P. Ruysschaert J.M. Cabiaux V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267 (J. P. C.): 5769-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, YopB and YopD, the Yersinia counterparts of IpaB and IpaC, possess hemolytic activity and channel-like activity in planar lipid bilayers (26Hakansson S. Schesser K. Persson C. Galyov E. Rosqvist R. Homble F. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Neyt C. Cornelis G. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6793-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). YopB and YopD can be replaced by the PopB and PopD of Pseudomonas (29Frithz-Lindsten E. Holmstrom A. Jacobsson L. Soltani M. Olsson J. Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1155-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PopD was shown to form oligomeric complex and disrupts membranes at acidic pH (30Schoehn G. Di Guilmi A. Lemaire D. Attree I. Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4957-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PopB and PopD together generate ring-like structures of 80 Å in outer diameter with a 40-Å-wide central hole (30Schoehn G. Di Guilmi A. Lemaire D. Attree I. Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4957-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that initial binding of S. flexneri and its subsequent cell entry critically depend on cholesterol and sphingolipid rich microdomains of the host cell membrane, so-called lipid rafts (31Lafont F. Tran Van Nhieu G. Hanada K. Sansonetti P. van der Goot F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4449-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A number of studies have now shown that rafts are preferential sites of entry for many bacteria (32Lafont F. Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33Grassme H. Jendrossek V. Riehle A. von Kurthy G. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weller M. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Although raft cholesterol might be important for more than one aspect of invasion by these bacteria, it might be particularly important for perforation of the host cell membrane by the TTSS. This could in particular be the case for Pseudomonas because membrane lysis by PopB and PopD, in contrast to membrane binding, was found to be dependent on cholesterol, suggesting that rafts may play a key role in structural rearrangements leading to pore formation and membrane disruption (30Schoehn G. Di Guilmi A. Lemaire D. Attree I. Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4957-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could govern pore formation by IpaB and IpaC. Rafts would thus be important for the initial binding of Shigella (31Lafont F. Tran Van Nhieu G. Hanada K. Sansonetti P. van der Goot F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4449-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and for subsequent generation of the IpaB-IpaC pore. Here, we were interested in determining whether the intermediate step, contact-mediated secretion of Ipas, was also dependent on rafts. Bacteria used in this study were the invasive S. flexneri wild type M90T serotype 5 and an isogenic strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (M90T-GFP) (34Rathman M. Jouirhi N. Allaoui A. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Tran Van Nhieu G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 974-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of recombinant GST and GST-IpaB proteins were performed as described previously (31Lafont F. Tran Van Nhieu G. Hanada K. Sansonetti P. van der Goot F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4449-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) preparation we used HeLa cells. We also used the CD44 expression-deficient RPM-MC cell line that is derived from a human recurrent cutaneous melanoma (35Thomas L. Byers H. Vink J. Stamenkovic I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The parental cells were stably transfected with the cDNA of the p85 CD44 standard form (35Thomas L. Byers H. Vink J. Stamenkovic I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The sphingoid-based lipid deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line (SPB-1) and the recomplemented cells (SPB-1/LCB1) kindly provided by K. Hanada (Tokyo, Japan) were described previously (36Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, SPB-1 cells carry a temperature-sensitive mutation in the serine palmitoyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, in which l-serine condenses with palmitoyl-CoA to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. In SPB-1/LCB1 the serine palmitoyltransferase activity is restored by stable transfection with the cLCB1 gene corresponding to the Chinese hamster ovary cDNA homolog of the yeast LCB1 gene. Iodixanol (OptiPrep™) was from Axis-Shield (Oslo, Norway). Brain sphingomyelin and brain cerebrosides were from Aventi Polar Lipids. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine were from Sigma. Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody and anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal (N20) were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Anti-IpaB, anti-MxiH, and anti-flotillin antibodies were polyclonals (38Mounier J. Bahrani F. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 774-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Abrami L. Liu S. Cosson P. Leppla S. van der Goot F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-CD44 Hermes-3 epitope (exon 5 CD44s standard form) was kindly provided by Sirpa Jalkanen (University of Turku, Finland). Anti-rab5 monoclonal antibody was from R. Jahn (Max-Planck Institute, Tübingen, Germany). The protocol was modified from Ref. 2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar. Overnight pre-cultures were diluted 1:100 in aerated flasks of Trypticase soy broth (BD Biosciences) for 4 h at 37 °C to optical density A600 = 2. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed in hemolysis assay buffer (HAB: 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and resuspended at 1010 bacteria/ml at 4 °C. Human red blood cells (RBCs) were washed three times in HAB at 2,500 × g and resuspended at 109/ml. For methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MeCD) (Sigma) treatment, RBCs were incubated with the indicated concentration for 20 min at 37 °C, then cells were centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, cells were washed once, and the cell pellet was resuspended in an identical volume. 50 and 100 μl of RBCs were mixed with 100 μl of bacteria in round bottom 96-well plates, centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 10 °C, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were resuspended, and the sample was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of supernatant were transferred to a new plate, and the A600 was measured. The percentage of total hemolysis (P) was calculated using the equation: P = [(X – B)/(T – B)] X100, where X is the A600 of the sample analyzed, B is the baseline of the assay sets with RBCs incubated with Tris-saline alone, and T is the value obtained after incubating RBCs with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in HAB (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A control with MeCD-treated RBCs without bacteria was introduced in all assays (see text). Each condition was performed in quadruplicate. Data presented were obtained with four independent experiments, and error bars represent standard deviations. DRMs were prepared as described previously with modifications (40Lafont F. Verkade P. Galli T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 41Lafont F. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared from scraped HeLa cells in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (TNE), by iterative passages through yellow tips (15 times) and a 25-gauge needle (at least 25 times until nuclei were isolated from cells as seen under the microscope). An aliquot of the PNS was kept, and the remainder was extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min in TNE and then adjusted to 40% iodixanol (600 μl final). The sample was transferred into a Beckmann TLS 55 tube. The sample was layered with 30% iodixanol (1.25 ml) and TNE (400 μl), and centrifuged for 2 h at 4 °C at 55,000 rpm in a Sorvall RC M150GX centrifuge. Floated DRMs were recovered at the interface between the top layers. DRMs pooled from two tubes were transferred in a new TLS 55 tube and resuspended in TNE (2.3 ml final). Membranes were pelleted by 30 min centrifugation at 55,000 rpm (Sorvall RC M150GX) at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in PBS (40 μl) and sonicated (Ultrasonik™ 19B) two times for 5 min. An aliquot from PNS and DRM was used for protein assay analysis (Bradford based protein assay, Bio-Rad). Alternatively, scraped HeLa cells were directly incubated in TNE with Triton X-100 1% for 30 min on ice, and density step gradient was performed as mentioned above. After the run, five fractions (450 μl each) were collected from the top and transferred into a new TLS 55 tube where membranes were resuspended in TNE (2.3 ml final). Membranes from each fraction were pelleted by 30 min of centrifugation at 55,000 rpm (Sorvall RC M150GX) at 4 °C. These membranes were resuspended and incubated with bacteria. Proteins from each fraction were assayed (Bradford based protein assay, Bio-Rad). Multilamellar liposomes were prepared following a protocol described previously (42Schroeder R. Ahmed S. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were resuspended in CHCl3, dried under N2 gas, and resuspended in PBS at 85 °C. Lipids were vortexed for 30 s and incubated for 30 min, vortexed again and further incubated for 15 min at 85 °C, and finally allowed to cool to room temperature for at least 30 min. Liposomes used were: dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine:dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 1:1 (mole ratio); phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol, 7:1 (mole ratio); sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich liposomes (SCRLs) containing phosphatidylcholine:sphingomyelin:cerebrosides:cholesterol, 2:1: 1:2 (mole ratio); and low SCRLs containing the same lipid in 56.7:5:5:33.3 mole ratio. That this protocol leads to multilamellar liposomes for all lipid compositions tested was controlled by electron microscopy (not shown). Secretion was analyzed according to an established assay using either cellular membranes or liposomes (43Bahrani F. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria from overnight precultures diluted 1:100 and incubated at 37 °C under aerated condition in TSB until A600 = 1 were used in the assays. Cellular Membranes—Either step density fractions (yield analysis) or equal quantities (2 μg) of PNS and DRMs (enrichment analysis) were used in secretion assays. Bacteria (100 μl) washed in PBS were incubated with membranes at 37 °C for 45–60 min and further spun at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The secretion inducer Congo red (20 μm) was used as positive control (43Bahrani F. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins precipitated from supernatant using a MeOH/CHCl3-MeOH procedure (44Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and those from pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. Liposomes—100 μl of bacteria were pelleted and directly resuspended with 200 μg of liposomes, centrifuged 5 min at 1,500 × g, and incubated for 40–50 min at 37 °C. Samples were adjusted to 40% iodixanol (600 μl final) and layered with 25% (600 μl), 20% (400 μl), 10% (400 μl), and 5% iodixanol (200 μl), and PBS (200 μl). Samples were spun for 2 h at 55,000 rpm (Sorvall RC M150GX). Six fractions (400 μl each) were collected from the top and processed for immunoblotting analysis (proteins were precipitated as mentioned above), lipid extraction, or agarose plating. For agar plate assay, 1 μl from an aliquot of each fraction, diluted 1:10, was plated on one agarose-TSB-Congo red (0.01%) plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. When experiments were performed with the M90T-GFP strain ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plates were used. For TLC analysis, liposomes or step density gradient fractions were adjusted to 800 μl PBS in a glass tube, mixed with 2 ml MeOH and 1 ml CHCl3, and vortexed and incubated for at least 30 min. Then, 1 ml of CHCl3 and 1 ml of acid salin (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm HCl) were added to the mix, vortexed, and incubated for 10 min before centrifugation for 5 min at 100 × g. The lipidic (lower) phase was transferred to a new glass tube and dried under N2 flux. Samples were resuspended with a CHCl3: MeOH (19:1 (v/v)) mix and spotted with a capillary on a TLC plate (silica gel 60, Merck). Migration was performed in a glass box saturated with a CHCl3:MeOH:NH3 (13:5:1 (v/v)) mix. Dried plates were shortly (1 min) immersed in 8% H3PO4-CuAc (3g/100 ml), dried, and incubated at 160 °C. For cholesterol extraction efficiency determination, a quantitative TLC analysis was performed as described previously (45Abrami L. Fivaz M. Kobayashi T. Kinoshita T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30729-30736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Role of Cholesterol in Contact-mediated TTSS-induced Hemolysis—The mechanism of contact-mediated secretion of Shigella effectors was studied using contact-mediated hemolysis, which was shown to be TTSSand IpaB-, IpaC-, and IpaD-dependent (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 21Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J.

Benjelloun-Touimi Z. Phalipon A. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contact between wild-type S. flexneri (M90T strain) and RBCs was induced by centrifugation at 1,500 × g, shown previously to be optimal (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Centrifugation was indeed shown to deform the RBC membrane in a way that maximizes the interaction with the bacterial membranes (2Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We observed that after extraction of 40–60% of cellular cholesterol with MeCD (Fig. 1B), RBCs were far more resistant to contact-mediated hemolysis induced by S. flexneri (Fig. 1A). Indeed, this treatment was rather dramatic as hemolysis was reduced to about 10% for RBCs treated with 1.0 mm MeCD and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 20 (Fig. 1A). For the concentrations (0.5 mm and 1.0 mm) and treatment time (20 min at 37 °C) used, MeCD had no detectable hemolytic activity per se (data not shown). At concentration of MeCD higher than 1 mm, we noticed RBC hemolysis that can be explained by the recent study using atomic force microscopy showing that 1.25 mm MeCD leads to the formation of holes in model membranes (49Giocondi M. Milhiet P. Dosset P. Grimellec C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 861-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Detergent-resistant Membranes Elicit TTSS Activation—The above results show a requirement for cholesterol in contact-mediated S. flexneri TTSS-dependent hemolysis suggesting a possible involvement of lipid rafts. Because rafts have the biochemical property of being insoluble in detergents at 4 °C (50Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether purified DRMs could trigger TTSS-mediated secretion. As a positive control for secretion, we used Congo red, well documented as a potent inducer of secretion for TTSS (22Menard R. Sansonetti P. Parsot C.

Cells were solubilized in Triton X-100 at 4 °C and submitted to floatation on a step iodixanol density gradient (40Lafont F. Verkade P. Galli T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 41Lafont F. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Five fractions (1 to 5, DRMs being in fractions 1 and 2) were recovered from the gradient. Each of these fractions was diluted in a detergent and iodixanol-free medium and submitted to high speed centrifugation to recover the membranes, which were then resuspended. Each of these samples was submitted to protein quantification (Fig. 2A) and incubated with bacteria. The bacteria were then separated from the host cells membranes by low speed centrifugation, and both the pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of IpaB used as a read out for secretion (Fig. 2B). The raft marker flotillin was used as control for DRM quality and was recovered in the supernatants originating from fractions 1 and 2, as expected (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, fractions 1 and 2, obtained from purified DRMs and corresponding to a minor fraction of total proteins (Fig. 2A), efficiently triggered secretion of IpaB, which appeared in the supernatant (Fig. 2B). Upon extraction of cholesterol with MeCD, the secretion promoting activity was redistributed to high density fractions of the iodixanol gradient as was flotillin-1 presumably because cholesterol extraction changed the density of the membranes. These fractions were most likely still detergent-insoluble because our protocol involves a high speed centrifugation step after the iodixanol gradient that should not allow recovery of solubilized components. To facilitate the comparison of the capacity of DRMs from different cell lines to activate secretion, we analyzed this capacity relative to that of a PNS using equal amounts of protein for each. As shown in Fig. 3A for HeLa cells, the ability to trigger secretion of IpaB was 2-fold higher for DRMs versus PNS. A similar observation (even more pronounced) was made for IpaC (Fig. 3A). DRM-triggered TTSS Activation Is Independent of CD44—It has been shown previously that the hyaluronate receptor, CD 44, is able to mediate adhesion of Shigella to host cells (54Skoudy A. Mounier J.

https://openalex.org/W2075848594,"Chemical signaling in autonomic neuromuscular transmission involves agents that function as neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators. Using high performance liquid chromatography techniques with fluorescence and electrochemical detection we observed that, in addition to ATP and norepinephrine (NE), electrical field stimulation (EFS, 4–16 Hz, 0.1–0.3 ms, 15 V, 60–120 s) of isolated vascular and non-vascular preparations co-releases a previously unidentified compound with apparent nucleotide or nucleoside structure. Extensive screening of more than 25 nucleotides and nucleosides followed by detailed peak identification revealed that β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NAD) is released in tissue superfusates upon EFS of canine mesenteric artery (CMA), canine urinary bladder, and murine urinary bladder in the amounts of 7.1 ± 0.7, 26.5 ± 4.5, and 15.1 ± 3.2 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively. Smaller amounts of the β-NAD metabolites cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose (cADPR) and ADPR were also present in the superfusates collected during EFS of CMA (2.5 ± 0.9 and 5.8 ± 0.8 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively), canine urinary bladder (1.8 ± 0.5 and 9.0 ± 6.0 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively), and murine urinary bladder (1.4 ± 0.1 and 6.2 ± 2.4 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively). The three nucleotides were also detected in the samples collected before EFS (0.2–1.6 fmol/mg of tissue). Exogenous β-NAD, cADPR, and ADPR (all 100 nm) reduced the release of NE in CMA at 16 Hz from 27.8 ± 6.0 fmol/mg of tissue to 15.5 ± 5.0, 12 ± 3.0, and 10.0 ± 4.0 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively. In conclusion, we detected constitutive and nerve-evoked overflow of β-NAD, cADPR, and ADPR in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles, β-NAD being the prevailing compound.

These substances modulate the release of NE, implicating novel nucleotide mechanisms of autonomic nervous system control of smooth muscle. Chemical signaling constitutes a major mechanism in neuroeffector transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Postganglionic nerve terminals, in particular, characteristically release multiple factors upon action potential, a process referred to as plurichemical neurotransmission (1Furness J.B. Morris J.L. Gibbins I.L. Costa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or co-transmission (2Burnstock G. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn.

Postganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals, on the other hand, release acetylcholine and ATP (2Burnstock G. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1990; 304: 7-33PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, neural control of effector cells involves molecules that implement potent excitatory or inhibitory actions at the neuroeffector junction in the absence of stringent evidence for transmitter function. These effects, collectively referred to as neuromodulation, are usually poorly understood, often due to lack of potent and selective antagonists (6Lundberg J.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 113-178PubMed Google Scholar); nonetheless, neuromodulation is an important mechanism, as is neurotransmission (7Ernsberger U. Auton. Neurosci. 2001; 94: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Boehm S. Kubista H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 43-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We report here that postganglionic nerve terminals in several smooth muscle preparations that are under autonomic nervous system control release novel factor(s) along with NE, ATP, and the ATP metabolic products ADP, AMP, and ADO. We hypothesized that this novel factor has a nucleotide/nucleoside structure and acquires fluorescence properties upon etheno-derivatization. Extensive screening revealed that the compound is a member of the β-NAD/cADPR/ADPR family. Further experimentation in canine mesenteric artery and vein, and canine and murine urinary bladders, established that all three nucleotides, β-NAD, cADPR, and ADPR, are present in tissue superfusates collected during EFS at parameters specific for neural activation, β-NAD being the prevailing nucleotide. Smaller amounts of β-NAD, cADPR, and ADPR were found in superfusates from non-stimulated tissues. Exogenous application of β-NAD and its metabolic products cADPR and ADPR modulate the release of the classic sympathetic neurotransmitter NE in vascular preparations. To our knowledge, release of members of this nucleotide axis at rest or during stimulation of postganglionic nerve terminals has not been reported. Therefore, novel mechanisms of autonomic neural control of vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle functions are implicated. Tissue Preparations—Mongrel dogs of either sex (averaging 15 kg), male guinea pigs (400–500 g), male Wistar rats (200–250 g), male New Zealand rabbits (3–5 kg), and male C57BL6 mice (15–20 g) were obtained from vendors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture. The use of the laboratory animals for these experiments was approved by the University of Nevada's Animal Care and Use Committee. The animals were euthanized either with pentobarbitone sodium, 100 mg kg–1 intravenously (dogs and rabbits) or an overdose of CO2 (guinea pigs, rats, and mice). The abdomens were opened, and segments of second and third order branches of the canine superior and inferior mesenteric artery (0.5–1 mm in diameter) and vein (0.7–1.2 mm in diameter), or canine urinary bladder, or first and second order branches of guinea pig inferior mesenteric artery (0.2–0.4 mm in diameter) and vein (0.3–0.5 mm in diameter), or vasa deferentia from rats and guinea pigs, or murine urinary bladder were dissected out and bathed in oxygenated Krebs solution containing (mm): 118.5 NaCl, 4.2 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 23.8 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.0 dextrose, 1.8 CaCl2 (pH 7.4). In some experiments the tail arteries of rats (∼100 mm artery length) and mice (∼50 mm artery length) were dissected out and bathed in oxygenated Krebs solution. The urothelium was removed from the urinary bladders. All vascular preparations were rubbed with a rough-surface needle and perfused with distilled water to remove the endothelium. This procedure has been shown to successfully remove endothelium while the smooth muscle contractility remains intact (9Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Carolan B.M. Harden T.K. Keef K.D. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overflow Experiments—The tissue segments were placed in 200-μl water-jacket BRANDEL superfusion chambers as described previously (10Todorov L.D. Mihaylova-Todorova S. Craviso G.L. Bjur R.A. Westfall D.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 731-748Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Westfall D.P. Br. J.

Briefly, after 45-min equilibration, the tissues were subjected to a 15-s “conditioning” stimulation with a train of square wave pulses of 0.1-ms duration and a frequency of 4 Hz. Previous experiments have shown that the transmitter overflow evoked by stimulations subsequent to the conditioning stimulation is more consistent than in the absence of a conditioning stimulation. 30 min after the conditioning stimulation, the preparations were subjected to EFS for 60–120 s with a train of supra-threshold pulses of 0.1–0.3 ms at 4–16 Hz depending on the tissue. The EFS parameters were chosen after preliminary optimization experiments and verification that NE overflow is abolished by either tetrodotoxin (0.3–1 μm) or ω-conotoxin GVIA (5 nm). Samples of the superfusion solution were collected before the electrical stimulation (resting overflow) and during the electrical stimulation (electrically evoked overflow) in ice-cold test tubes. Samples were analyzed for nucleotide/nucleoside contents by HPLC techniques with fluorescence detection as described previously (12Bobalova J. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Bobalova J. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. J. Autonomic Pharmacol. 2001; 21: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Bobalova J. Bobal P. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Analyt. Biochem. 2002; 305: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Aliquots of some superfusate samples were processed for NE assay by HPLC techniques with electrochemical detection as described previously (15Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Smyth L. Bobalova J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A more detailed characterization of the EFS-evoked overflow of nucleotides, nucleosides (i.e. ADO), and NE was carried out in canine isolated mesenteric arteries. In some experiments the tissue segments were superfused with either TTX (0.3–1 μm) or ω-conotoxin GVIA (5 nm) for 30 min before EFS to block neuronal fast Na+ channels and N-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. Other tissue segments were treated with guanethidine (3–10 μm) for 1.5 h to inhibit action potential-induced activation of sympathetic nerve terminals. In some experiments tissues were treated with 6-OHDA using a method modified from Aprigliano and Hermsmeyer (16Aprigliano O. Hermsmeyer K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 198: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar) to “denervate” adrenergic neurotransmission. Briefly, a modified Krebs-Ringer solution that lacked NaHCO3 and NaH2PO4 was prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 4.9 using 20 μm glutathione. 6-OHDA was dissolved in this solution at a concentration of 300 μg/ml. The tissue was placed in the 6-OHDA solution for 10 min. The tissue was then placed in regular oxygenated Krebs for 30 min and then subsequently placed in the 6-OHDA solution for an additional 10 min. The tissue was then loaded in the chambers and equilibrated as usual. Samples were collected after a perfusion of 2 h and 15 min with regular Krebs. Parallel “no-6OHDA” time controls were carried out, as well. In some experiments NE content of the “pre-stimulation” and “during stimulation” samples were also determined in the absence or presence of exogenous nucleotides (e.g. β-NAD, cADPR, ADPR, α-NAD, NAAD, NGD, cGDPR, 8-Br-cADPR, and ADO, 100 nm). To test the possibility that contraction of the smooth muscle is the primary cause of nucleotide/nucleoside overflow, tissues were perfused either with ET-1 (0.05 μm), U46619 (1 μm), ANGII (0.1 μm), or PMA (0.1 μm) for 20 min. Sample Preparation—A method modified from Levitt et al. (17Levitt B. Head R.J. Westfall D.P. Analyt. Biochem. 1984; 137: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which originally describes a procedure for detection of 1,N6-etheno-derivatives of ATP, ADP, AMP, and ADO, was employed. Briefly, 100 μl of a citrate phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) was added to 200 μl of the superfusate sample in a borosilicate glass culture tube (Fisher Scientific). Chloroacetaldehyde was synthesized according to a method modified from Secrist et al. (18Secrist J.A. II I Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and Levitt et al. (17Levitt B. Head R.J. Westfall D.P. Analyt. Biochem. 1984; 137: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and described previously (14Bobalova J. Bobal P. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Analyt. Biochem. 2002; 305: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 10 μl of 2-chloroacetaldehyde was added to the samples in a fume hood; the culture tubes were covered with glass marbles, and the samples were heated for 40 min at 80 °C in a dry bath incubator (Fisher Scientific) to produce 1,N6-ethenonucleotides and 1,N6-etheno-nucleosides. Chemical substances with nucleotide/nucleoside structure were subjected to etheno-derivatization and subsequent HPLC analysis. The following chemicals were tested: adenine compounds (i.e. ATP, ADP, AMP, ADO, diadenosine polyphosphates, namely Ap6A, Ap5A, Ap4A, Ap3A, and Ap2A), pyridine compounds (i.e. UTP), guanidine/guanosine compounds (i.e. GTP, GDP, GMP, diguanosine polyphosphates, namely Gp5G, Gp4G, Gp3G, and Gp2G), cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP, and cADPR), NAAD, NAADP, α-NAD, β-NAD, NADP, and ADPR. In some experiments authentic nucleotides were subjected to ethenoderivatization with 2-chloroacetaldehyde at 80 °C, and the samples were desalted as described previously (14Bobalova J. Bobal P. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Analyt. Biochem. 2002; 305: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The nucleotides were then eluted with a binary system consisting of eluant A (water) and eluant B (100% acetonitrile) by a gradient according to the following linear program: time 0, 0% eluant B; 40 min, 80% eluant B; 80 min, 80% eluant B. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The absorbing fraction was collected. The fraction was then lyophilized and kept at –16 °C until processed for mass spectra verification of the etheno-nucleotide. HPLC Assay of Etheno-nucleotides and Etheno-nucleosides—The liquid chromatographic system used throughout this study was an HP1100 LC module system (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) as described previously (14Bobalova J. Bobal P. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Analyt. Biochem. 2002; 305: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mobile phase comprised 0.1 m KH2PO4 (pH 6.0) as eluant A; eluant B consisted of 35% methanol and 65% eluant A. Gradient elution was employed according to the following linear program: time 0, 0% eluant B; 18 min, 100% eluant B. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, run time was 20 min, and post-run time was 5 min. Column temperature was ambient, whereas the autosampler temperature was 4 °C. The fluorescence detector was set to record signals at an excitation wavelength of 230 nm and emission wavelength of 420 nm, which are the optimum conditions for detection of etheno-derivatives of nucleotides and nucleosides as shown previously (14Bobalova J. Bobal P. Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Analyt. Biochem. 2002; 305: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The non-derivatized compounds were detected at an excitation wavelength of 270 nm and emission wavelength of 410 nm according to preliminary optimization of the HPLC application. Fraction Collection and Sample Concentration—To identify the compound that is released during EFS in canine mesenteric arteries, superfusate samples from 12 chambers containing ∼65 mg tissue per chamber were placed together in two 2-ml Eppendorf tubes containing the pre-stimulation samples and the samples collected during EFS, respectively. The two resulting samples were further concentrated by speed vacuuming (Savant SVC100, Thermo Electron Corp., Westmont, IL) to 1-ml volume. 750 μl of each concentrated sample was injected into the HPLC system, and 400-μl fractions corresponding to the retention times of cADPR (7.0–7.4 min, “7.2-min fraction”), ADPR (8.3–8.7 min, “8.5-min fraction”), and β-NAD (10.3–10.7 min, “10.5-min fraction”) were collected in borosilicate culture tubes containing 160 μl of citric buffer. The exact retention times for the three nucleotides were determined by injecting β-NAD, cADPR, and ADPR standards (40 nmol/injection) in the same sequence prior to the concentrated superfusate samples. The fractions were further subjected to etheno-derivatization with 17 μl of 2-chloroacetaldehyde as described under “HPLC Assay of Etheno-nucleotides and Etheno-nucleosides.” The derivatized samples were injected into the HPLC and analyzed for 1,N6-etheno-ADPR content. To identify the compound that is released in urinary bladder, superfusate samples from 16–20 chambers containing either canine detrusor strips (∼70 mg/chamber) or mouse bladder detrusors (two bladders averaging ∼15 mg per chamber) were processed as described for canine mesenteric artery segments. The experiments were performed in triplicate with each species. In another series of experiments, superfusate samples (either PS or during EFS) form 24 chambers containing canine mesenteric artery strips were first put together, then concentrated with a speed vacuuming, and processed through the HPLC. The 400-μl HPLC fractions corresponding to cADPR (“7.2-min fraction”), ADPR (“8.5-min fraction”), and β-NAD (“10.5-min fraction”) of superfusate samples were mixed with 400-μl Krebs solution to add Mg2+. The fractions were then again concentrated via a speed vacuuming to 600 μl. NPP (EC 3.6.1.9), 0.2 unit, was added to each sample, and the samples were incubated with the enzyme for 10 min at 26 °C. The reaction was stopped with 275 μl of ice-cold citric buffer. The samples were then etheno-derivatized with 30 μl of 2-chloroacetaldehyde for 40 min at 80 °C and processed again through the HPLC to re-verify availability of cADPR, ADPR, and β-NAD in the 7.2-min fraction, 8.5-min fraction, and 10.5-min fraction, respectively, by assessing the content of 1,N6-etheno-AMP in each sample. HPLC Assay of NE—The overflow of NE was assayed as described previously (15Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Smyth L. Bobalova J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 115-μl aliquots from the samples were acidified with 3 μl of 1 m perchloric acid to pH 2.6 and injected (70 μl) into an isocratic HP1100 HPLC system equipped with an HP1049A electrochemical detector (Agilent Technologies) and a MD-150 column (ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA). The mobile phase for separation consisted of the following: 50 mm Na2PO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3.0 liters of heptanesulfonic acid, 10 mm LiCl, and methanol 3% v/v in deionized water (pH 2.6). The HPLC systems were controlled, and data collected, by a HP Kayak XA computer equipped with HP ChemStation (A.06.03) software from Agilent Technologies. The amounts of NE in each sample were calculated from calibration curves of NE standards run simultaneously with every set of unknown samples. Results were normalized for sample volume and tissue weight, and the overflow of NE was expressed in femtomoles/mg of tissue. MALDI-MS Identification—The chemical identities of the molecules in the absorbing fraction from reversed-phase HPLC-FLD of ADPR standards, β-NAD standards, and cADPR standards subjected to etheno-derivatization were validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile: 2% trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl was then loaded on a sample spot. Mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Proflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in linear mode, with delayed ion extraction. Degradation of β-NAD and cADPR in Contact with Tissue—Canine mesenteric artery segments were loaded in a BRANDEL superfusion system as described under “Overflow Experiments.” Following a 45-min equilibration period, the tissues were superfused either with β-NAD (0.2 mm), cADPR (0.2 mm), or NGD (0.2 mm). A 200-μl sample from the beaker containing the substrate (no tissue present) was collected (S1). The superfusion was stopped, and 2 min later the content of the chamber containing the tissue was drained and collected (S2). All samples were collected in ice-cold test tubes, and the reaction was stopped with liquid N2. The samples were then processed for nucleotide detection by a reverse-phase HPLC technique in conjunction with fluorescence detection as described above. Ecto-enzyme activity was determined by measuring the amount of substrate that had decreased in the S2 as compared with S1. Force Development—Ring preparations (5 mm long) of canine isolated mesenteric artery were mounted in 3-ml organ baths by inserting two stainless steel triangle mounts into the lumen, and force displacements were further investigated as described previously (9Mutafova-Yambolieva V.N. Carolan B.M. Harden T.K. Keef K.D. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A resting force of 1 g was applied to the arterial segment. This was found to stretch vessels to near the optimum length for tension development. In all experiments tissues were initially equilibrated for 1 h followed with at least three alternating 3-min exposures every 15 min to KCl (70 mm) and NE (1 μm) to establish viability and equilibrate the tissue. Single applications of ET-1 (50 nm), ANGII (100 nm), U46619 (1 μm), or PMA (100 nm) were applied to the preparations to verify that at these concentrations the chemicals induce robust vasoconstrictions. Once this was validated, the effects of the above-mentioned vasoconstrictors on the resting overflow of nucleotides were measured. Drugs—TTX, guanethidine, 6-OHDA, ω-conotoxin GVIA, ET-1, U46619, ANGII, PMA, cADPR, ATP, ADP, AMP, ADO, Ap6A, Ap5A, Ap4A, Ap3A, Ap2A, UTP, GTP, GDP, GMP, Gp5G, Gp4G, Gp3G, cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, NAAD, α-NAD, β-NAD, NGD, NADP, and NPP were all purchased from Sigma. ADPR was purchased from Calbiochem, and cADPR was purchased from Biolog (San Diego, CA). Gp2G was a gift from Dr. Antonio Sillero. All drugs were initially dissolved in redistilled water with the exception of PMA and U46619, which were initially dissolved in Me2SO, and further diluted in Krebs solution (final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO). 6-OHDA was dissolved in Krebs solution, which lacked NaHCO3 and NaH2PO4, and contained 20 μm glutathione. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Means were compared by analysis of variance (one-way and two-way, GraphPad Prism version 3, GraphPad Software, Inc.). A probability value of <0.05 was considered significant. EFS Evokes Overflow of Nucleotides, Nucleosides, and NE—Fig. 1 shows typical results from canine isolated mesenteric artery subjected to EFS at 4, 8, and 16 Hz. In aliquots from samples collected before EFS (prestimulation) and analyzed with an electrochemical detector, no spontaneous release of NE was detected (Fig. 1A, PS). However, in samples collected during EFS, increasing amounts of NE were observed with the increase in the EFS frequency (Fig. 1A, 4, 8, and 16 Hz). In aliquots subjected to etheno-derivatization and analyzed with a fluorescence detector, peaks that correspond to 1,N6-etheno-ATP (eATP, elution time ∼9.9 min), 1,N6-etheno-ADP (eADP, elution time ∼10.8 min), 1,N6-etheno-AMP (eAMP, elution time ∼12.6 min), and 1,N6-etheno-ADO (eADO, elution time ∼16.6 min) were observed (Fig. 1B). The overflow of all four purines was also enhanced when the stimulation frequencies were increased. In chromatograms from samples subjected to etheno-derivatization, an additional peak with elution time of 11.2 ± 0.2 min and unknown nature was observed (Fig. 1B, shown as “?”). Likewise, the area of this peak increased with the increase in stimulation frequency. Besides the canine mesenteric artery, a peak with the same elution time was detected in several other autonomically innervated vascular (Fig. 2A) and non-vascular (Fig. 2B) smooth muscle preparations upon EFS, including canine isolated mesenteric vein, guinea pig isolated mesenteric artery and vein, rat and murine tail artery, canine, guinea pig, rabbit, and murine urinary bladder, and rat vas deferens. We have also detected this peak in chromatograms from tissue superfusate samples of stimulated rat tail artery, rat, and guinea pig vas deferens and monkey urinary bladder. 2L. M. Smyth, J. Bobalova, M. G. Mendoza, C. Lew, and V. N. Mutafova-Yambolieva, unpublished observations. Therefore, release of this factor is not restricted to one species or one nerve-smooth muscle preparation and may have a universal role. The compound that elutes at ∼11.2 min is subjected to changes by agents affecting neurotransmitter release (see below) and, therefore, might represent a novel factor in the autonomic nervous system control. The present study was designed, therefore, to identify this novel factor or the chemical group to which this compound belongs.Fig. 2An unidentified peak with elution time ∼11.2 min is observed in superfusate samples collected during EFS (0.1 ms, 15 V, 16 Hz) of several vascular and non-vascular preparations. Original chromatograms from HPLC-FLD analysis of samples collected from vascular smooth muscle (A), including canine mesenteric vein (CMV), guinea pig mesenteric artery (GPMA), guinea pig mesenteric vein (GPMV), rat tail artery (RTA), and mouse tail artery (MTA), and non-vascular smooth muscles (B), including canine (CUB), rabbit (RbUB), guinea pig (GPUB), murine (MUB) urinary bladder, and rat vas deferens (RVD). Aliquots were derivatized with 2-chloroacetaldehyde (80 °C, pH 4, 40 min) to 1,N6-etheno (e)-nucleotides (i.e. eATP, eADP, and eAMP) and 1,N6-etheno-(e)ADO. At all frequencies of stimulation an additional peak with unknown identity (marked “?”) with an elution time of ∼11.2 min i"

We have identified a peptide that most closely resembles a short region of the protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2) by screening of a random 12-mer peptide library displayed on the surface of the M13 bacteriophage with NS5B proteins immobilized on microwell plates. Competitive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a synthetic peptide showed that the phage clone displaying this peptide could bind HCV RNA polymerase with a high affinity. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies demonstrated in vivo interaction of NS5B with PRK2. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that PRK2 specifically phosphorylates NS5B by interaction with the N-terminal finger domain of NS5B (amino acids 1–187). Consistent with the in vitro NS5B-phosphorylating activity of PRK2, we detected the phosphorylated form of NS5B by metabolic cell labeling. Furthermore, HCV NS5B immunoprecipitated from HCV subgenomic replicon cells was specifically recognized by an antiphosphoserine antibody. Knock-down of the endogenous PRK2 expression using a PRK2-specific small interfering RNA inhibited HCV RNA replication. In contrast, PRK2 overexpression, which was accompanied by an increase of in the level of its active form, dramatically enhanced HCV RNA replication.

HCV is an enveloped virus with a positive stranded RNA genome of ∼9.6 kb belonging to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family (3Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1042Google Scholar). The HCV viral genome encodes a single polyprotein of ∼3,010 amino acids, which is proteolytically processed by a combination of host and viral proteases into at least 10 distinct structural and nonstructural proteins. The structural proteins include C, E1, E2, and p7, and the nonstructural (NS) proteins include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (4Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 6199-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RdRp of turnip yellow mosaic virus is phosphorylated in a PEST region residue, and the phosphorylation of the PEST-rich sequences in turnip yellow mosaic virus RdRp may be involved in selective processing by the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation system (30Hericourt F. Blanc S. Redeker V. Jupin I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, phosphorylation of the N-terminal 126-amino acid region of cucumber mosaic virus RNA polymerase 2a protein by a 60-kDa tobacco plant origin protein kinase was demonstrated to inhibit interaction of 2a RNA polymerase with the 1a protein, which is essential for replication of cucumber mosaic virus (31Kim S.H. Palukaitis P. Park Y.I. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2292-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated form of HCV NS5B was observed when expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus (32Hwang S.B. Park K.J. Kim Y.S. Sung Y.C. Lai M.M. Virology. 1997; 227: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of HCV NS5B in human liver cells has not been demonstrated, and the cellular kinase that phosphorylates HCV NS5B has not been yet identified.In this work, we identified one peptide with amino acid sequences homologous to protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2) by screening a phage-displayed 12-mer random peptide library with HCV NS5B protein as bait. We characterized the interaction of NS5B and PRK2 both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that PRK2 is the specific cellular kinase phosphorylating HCV NS5B. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of NS5B is involved in the regulation of HCV RNA replication in an HCV subgenomic replicon cell line.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids and a Random Peptide Library—Plasmid pThNS5B used for expression of full-length HCV NS5B in Escherichia coli has been described previously (7Oh J.W. Ito T. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences corresponding to the finger-palm domain (amino acids 1–371), the palm-thumb domain (amino acids 188–591), and the thumb domain (amino acids 372–591) of HCV NS5B were amplified by PCR using pThNS5B as a template and cloned into the NheI-EcoRI site of pET-28a(+) (Novagen) to obtain pET-28a(+)/NS5B(1–371), pET-28a(+)/NS5B(188–591), and pET-28a(+)/NS5B(372–591), respectively. The NheI and EcoRI sites were included at the N and the C termini of oligonucleotides, respectively, to facilitate cloning. Stop codons were introduced at the end of each of the cloned sequences from 5′ to the EcoRI site.pcDNA4.0-HCVns was constructed to obtain a Tet-ON inducible system for Huh7 human hepatoma cells expressing the HCV proteins NS3 to NS5B. The HCV nonstructural gene for NS3 to NS5B was amplified by PCR with the region-specific primers HCV-NS3F (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCACCATGGCGCCCATCACGGCCTACTCC-3′) and NS5B-BIII (5′-GCTCTAGATCGGTTGGGGAGCAGGTAAATG-3′) using pCV-J4L6S (33Yanagi M. St. Claire M. Shapiro M. Emerson S.U. Purcell R.H. Bukh J. Virology. 1998; 244: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) as a template. Purified PCR product digested with NotI and XbaI was then cloned into pcDNA4.0/TO/myc-hisB (Invitrogen) to obtain pcDNA4.0-HCVns.For small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock-down of PRK2, pSUPER-PRK2 was constructed by cloning annealed DNA oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCCCCATCAGTTGCACTGCCTGGTTCAAGAGACCAGGCAGTGCAACTGATGTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAACATCAGTTGCACTGCCTGGTCTCTTGAACCAG GCAGTGCAACTGATGGGG-3′; siRNA targeting sequence (nucleotides 1055–1073) of PRK2 (GenBank accession number NM_006256 is in bold)) into the BglII and HindIII sites of the pSUPER vector (OliogoEngine) (34Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar).A random 12-mer peptide library constructed in the pCANTAB5E vector (Amersham Biosciences) was obtained from Dr. Suk-Jung Choi (Kangnung National University, Korea). NNK12 (N = A, C, G, or T; K = G or T) random sequences were cloned into the SfiI and NotI sites of the pCANTAB5E vector to express the random peptide fused to the N terminus of the gene III protein on the surface of the M13 phage. This random peptide phage library consisted of phages collected from 1.5 × 108 independent transformants.Expression and Purification of Histidine-tagged Full-length and Truncated Forms of the HCV NS5B Protein—Full-length and truncated forms of the HCV NS5B protein were expressed individually as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 and BL21(DE3), respectively, at 25 °C by induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification of His6-tagged fusion protein was performed as described previously (35Oh J.W. Sheu G.T. Lai M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17710-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of NS5B were partially purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic (NTA)-Sepharose resin (Qiagen) in a binding buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Isolation of HCV NS5B-binding Peptides by Biopanning—For phage screening, each well of a Ni-NTA HisSorb plate (Qiagen) was coated with 800 ng of purified NS5B protein in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C, then blocked with 0.1% BSA (for the first and third rounds of biopanning) or 5% skimmed milk (for the second round of biopanning) in 250 μlofPBS for2hat room temperature. The phage library (1.08 × 1012 colony-forming units of phage/well) diluted in 250 μl of PBS was applied to the wells coated with purified NS5B protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing extensively with PBS at room temperature, bound phages were eluted using 0.1 m HCl-glycine (pH 2.2) for 20 min with agitation at room temperature, and the eluted phage solution was immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). Eluted phages were used for monitoring phage titers by infecting E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and counting the number of colonies grown on LB medium containing 125 μg/ml tetracycline and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The eluted phages were also amplified in E. coli SOLR cells (Stratagene) using the M13-VCS helper phage (Stratagene) for the next round of biopanning. E. coli SOLR cells infected with phages were grown in LB medium containing 250 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 nm of 0.4 at 37 °C. The cell pellet resuspended in LB medium to an A600 nm of 1.0 was then infected with the M13-VCS helper phage (2.46 × 1011 plaque-forming units of phage/ml of cell suspension) and cultivated further in LB medium containing kanamycin and ampicillin. A supernatant was obtained by centrifugation, then PEG 8,000 and NaCl were added at a final concentration of 30% and 2.5 m, respectively, to the supernatant, mixed by inverting, and incubated on ice for 20 min. The phage pellet was then obtained by centrifugation and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) followed by phage titering. After three rounds of binding selection, selected phages were subjected to sequence analysis.Competitive Phage ELISA—Synthetic HCV NS5B-specific peptide SC1 (TSTAGRIVRRAI-COOH) was obtained from Peptron Co. (Daejeon, Korea) and used for competitive phage ELISA. Each well of a Ni-NTA HisSorb plate was coated with 800 ng of purified NS5B protein in 250 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 1% BSA in 250 μl of PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, mixtures of phage C1 displaying NS5B-specific peptide (1.08 × 1010 colony-forming units of phage/well) and various concentrations (0.01 fmol–10 pmol) of SC1 diluted in PBS were incubated with the immobilized NS5B overnight at 4 °C. After removal of the unbound C1 phage and the SC1 peptide by washing extensively with PBS and with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the amount of bound C1 phage was detected with a monoclonal anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Assay plates were developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma) with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) as a substrate and read spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices).Cell Culture—Human hepatoma Huh7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acid, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol.Establishment of a Tetracycline-inducible Stable Cell Line Expressing HCV Nonstructural Proteins (NS3–5)—The human hepatoma stable cell line Huh7TR expressing the tetracycline repressor was obtained by transfection of pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) carrying a gene encoding the selectable marker blasticidin and a gene coding for the tet operon repressor protein (TetR) and by selection of stably transfected cell lines resistant to 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen). The pool of resulting colonies expanded under blasticidin selection was transfected with either pcDNA4.0-HCVns (for the Huh7TR-NS cell line) or the pcDNA4.0/TO/myc-hisB vector alone (for the Huh7TR-4 cell line). Cell lines transfected with each plasmid were selected by using 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml blastacidin S for 3 weeks. Stable Huh7TR-NS and Huh7TR-4 cell lines were maintained under the selection conditions described above. For the analysis of HCV nonstructural protein expression, Huh7TR-NS cells were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 48 h before immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-NS5B (kindly provided by Dr. S. B. Hwang at Hallym University, Korea), anti-NS3 (clone 781; Biodesign International), or anti-NS5A (clone 381; Biodesign International) antibodies. The monoclonal antibody specific to α-tubulin (Oncogene) was used to verify the equivalent amounts of cell lysates used for immunoblotting.Establishment of an HCV Replicon Cell Line—An HCV subgenomic replicon, pZS2 (36Zhu Q.

Virol. 2003; 77: 9204-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), derived from the parental HCV Con-1 replicon I377/NS3–3′ (AJ242652) was kindly provided by Dr. Christoph Seeger (Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia). pZS2 linearized with ScaI was used for in vitro transcription as described previously (7Oh J.W. Ito T. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7694-7702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An Huh7 cell line expressing HCV subgenomic RNA, R-1, was established by transfection of in vitro transcribed HCV subgenomic RNA using a Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad) followed by selection with 1 mg/ml G418 as described previously (37Guo J.T. Bichko V.V. Seeger C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8516-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 38Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For the PRK2-NS5B coimmunoprecipitation, Huh7TR-NS or Huh7 R-1 cells grown in a 10-cm plate were suspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The resuspended cells were incubated for 10 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. PRK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PRK2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoblottings were performed using anti-PRK2, anti-NS5B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-NS5A antibodies. For immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated form of NS5B, Huh7 or HCV R-1 subgenomic replicon cells grown in a 3 × 10-cm plate were either untransfected or transfected with pSUPER-PRK2 or pcDNA3.1-PRK2 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) before lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphoserine (clone PSR-45; Sigma), anti-phosphothreonine (Zymed Laboratories), or anti-phosphotyrosine (clones PY-7E1 and PY20; Zymed Laboratories) antibodies. Immunoblottings were performed with anti-NS5B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p85 PI3-kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Expression levels of PRK2 and the phosphorylated form of PRK2 were determined by immunoblotting with anti-PRK2 or anti-phospho-PRK2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology).Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—For the PRK2-NS5B coimmunoprecipitation, HEK 293T or Huh7 (for transient expression by transfection of pFLAG-PRK2) cells grown in a 10-cm plate were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. The resuspended cells were stored for 10 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain cell lysates. Proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-PRK2 antibodies, polyclonal antibodies against a consensus sequence present in the three PKC isoforms (α, β, γ) (anti-pan-PKC; Zymed Laboratories), or rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies (Sigma) for1hat4 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl) containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The immunocomplexes from HEK 293T cells were washed three times with binding buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gel), and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PRK2, anti-pan-PKC, or anti-panta-His antibodies. For the in vitro PRK2 kinase assay, the PRK2-immunocomplexes were washed three times with binding buffer and once with ice-cold 1× kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm MnCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol). An in vitro kinase reaction was performed in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of purified full-length NS5B or its deletion derivatives, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. When indicated, in vitro kinase reactions were performed in the presence of various kinase inhibitors at IC50 (39Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V.

The inhibitors were 20 μm HA1077 (PRK2 inhibitor; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 50 μm LY294002 (PI3-kinase inhibitor; Calbiochem), 1 μm wortmannin (PI3-kinase inhibitor; Sigma), 10 μm SB203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor; Calbiochem), 50 μm PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 inhibitor; Calbiochem), and 10 μm GF109203X (PKC inhibitor, Calbiochem). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× SDS sample buffer, followed by heating at 95 °C. The supernatants containing phosphorylated proteins were pooled by centrifugation, subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gel), and analyzed by autoradiography.Cell Labeling and PRK2 Knock-down by siRNA—Huh7TR-4 and Huh7TR-NS stable cell lines cultured in 10-cm-diameter plates were preincubated for 30 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were then labeled with 80 μCi of 32Pi (Amersham Biosciences, carrier-free; 10 mCi/ml)/ml of culture medium for 4 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100) containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture by incubation on ice for 10 min. Cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-NS5B antibody, washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (8% gel), and analyzed by autoradiography. To test the effect of PRK2 knock-down on NS5B phosphorylation, Huh7TR-NS stable cells seeded in a 10-cm-diameter plate were induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline and transfected with 5 μg of either pSUPER or pSUPER-PRK2 using FuGENE 6. After further growth for 48 h, cell labeling with 32Pi was performed as described above. Expression levels of PRK2 were determined by immunoblotting with anti-PRK2 antibodies.Immunofluorescence Staining—Huh7TR-NS cells were cultured in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) to ∼60% confluence. At 48 h postinduction with 1 μg/ml tetracycline, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at –20 °C, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were then treated with a blocking solution (PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% gelatin, and 5% goat serum) for 30 min at room temperature, incubated with rabbit anti-PRK2 antibodies and a monoclonal anti-NS5B antibody overnight at 4 °C, and washed five times with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% gelatin. The cells were incubated further with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Vector Laboratories) and Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) antibodies for 2 h and washed five times with PBS. Nuclei were visualized using 1 μm 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 10 min. Confocal images were obtained with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope.TaqMan Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—R-1 cells grown to 60% confluence were transfected with pSUPER-PRK2 or pcDNA3-PRK2 (41Cryns V.L.

After 48 h, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HCV replicon RNA levels were quantified with the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. Triplicate RNA samples (1 μg each) were amplified with the TaqMan EZ reverse transcription-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). The primer and probe sequences specific for the HCV 5′-untranslated region (UTR) were as follows: sense primer 5′-UTR-F, 5′-GCGTCTAGCCATGGCCTTAGTATGAGTGTC-3′; antisense primer 5′-UTR-R, 5′-ACCACAAGGCCTTTCGCGACCCAACACTAC-3′; and a dual fluorophore-labeled probe, 5′-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)-CTGCGGAACCGGTGAGTACAC-TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-3′. The target was reverse transcribed with recombinant Tth DNA polymerase at 50 °C for 2 min and 65 °C for 30 min followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 20 s and 62 °C for 1 min. Cellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA from the same RNA extract was used as an internal control. RNA standards (HCV 5′-UTR), run in triplicate in every reaction, were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and purified by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea as described previously (35Oh J.W.

Although in insects the evidence indicates that the cross-reaction results from the presence of core α1,3-fucosylated N-glycans, the molecular basis for anti-horseradish peroxidase staining in nematodes has been unresolved to date. By using Western blots of wild-type and mutant C. elegans extracts in conjunction with specific inhibitors, we show that the cross-reaction is due to core α1,3-fucosylation. Of the various mutants examined, one with a deletion of the fut-1 (K08F8.3) gene showed no reaction to anti-horseradish peroxidase; the molecular phenotype was rescued by injection of either the K08F8 cosmid or the fut-1 open reading frame under control of the let-858 promoter. Furthermore, expression of fut-1 cDNA in Pichia and insect cells in conjunction with antibody staining, high pressure liquid chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses showed that FUT-1 is a core α1,3-fucosyltransferase with an unusual substrate specificity. It is the only core fucosyltransferase in plants and animals described to date that does not require the prior action of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I.

The structures of the oligosaccharides expressed by different organisms and tissues or on individual glycoproteins vary greatly. Over the years, it has become obvious that the glycosylation of invertebrate glycoproteins is significantly different from that of mammals, but although organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans have been studied to a great extent in terms of molecular and developmental biology, an exact understanding of their glycosylation has lagged behind. Recently, however, a number of studies have indicated that the glycoconjugates of C. elegans have a number of unusual features (1Altmann F. Fabini G. Ahorn H. Wilson I.B.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Natsuka S. Adachi J. Kawaguchi M. Nakakita S. Hase S. Ichikawa A. Ikura K. J. Biochem.

Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 1-21Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). None of the studies published so far agree absolutely as to the types of N-linked oligosaccharides, but the consensus would appear to be that this organism has a range of N-glycans carrying one or many fucose residues, with or without methyl or phosphorylcholine groups, as well as the standard oligomannose structures (7Haslam S.M. Dell A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Multiantennary structures may also exist, but there are no sialylated complex glycans of the types found in vertebrates. Glycolipids of the arthro-series carrying phosphorylcholine (8Gerdt S. Dennis R.D. Borgonie G. Schnabel R. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well as unusual fucosylated O-glycans have also been described (9Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Some of these features have already been found in parasitic nematodes and are a source of immunomodulatory, immunogenic, or allergenic activity (10Dell A. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Khoo K.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Still, however, the exact structures of many of the N-glycans from the worm are unknown; in particular, the nature of the linkages of the multiple fucose residues is not resolved, although RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; dabsyl, 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)-benzolsulfonyl.1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; dabsyl, 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)-benzolsulfonyl. evidence (2Natsuka S.

(Tokyo). 2002; 131: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicates that both core α1,3- and core α1,6-fucosylation of N-glycans occur. The former is also a feature of plant glycoproteins and is the major epitope of many antibodies raised against plant glycoproteins, such as anti-horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP) (11Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N.P. Ashford D.A. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); this antibody also recognizes neuronal tissue in C. elegans (12Siddiqui S.S. Culotti J.G. J. Neurogenet. 1991; 7: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Haase A. Stern M. Wachtler K. Bicker G. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because of the known specificity of anti-HRP, this cross-reaction could be inferred to be due to the presence of core α1,3-fucose; however, the actual molecular origin of the cross-reaction observed remained unresolved, particularly due to a lack of knowledge about the exact glycosylation capacity of C. elegans. Because the glycosylation machinery of any organism is genetically determined, examination of genomes is useful in modern glycobiology. Indeed, a large number of glycosyltransferase homologues can be identified in the genome of C. elegans. However, in only a few cases has their activity been determined. In particular, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases with roles in O-glycan (14Hagen F.K. Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8268-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and, potentially, N-glycan and glycolipid biosynthesis (specifically, the β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase BRE-4) (15Kawar Z. van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have been expressed in recombinant form. An α1,2-fucosyltransferase with an unknown biological function (16Zheng Q. van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39823-39832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), one N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V homologue (17Warren C.E. Krizius A. Roy P.J. Culotti J.G. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22829-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), one glucosyltransferase that potentially modifies O-glycans (18Warren C.E. Krizius A. Partridge E.A. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: G8-G9Google Scholar), and three genes encoding proteins with N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I activity have also been described (19Chen S.H. Zhou S.H. Sarkar M. Spence A.M. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of the latter three is intriguing because plants, insects, and mammals would appear to only have one such gene. In mammals, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I is necessary for the generation of complex N-glycans and is requisite for survival in utero (20Ioffe E. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 21Metzler M. Gertz A. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Schrader J.W. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2056-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the prior action of this enzyme is necessary in plants, insects, and mammals for both core α1,3- and core α1,6-fucosylation (22Staudacher E. Kubelka V. März L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Leiter H. Mucha J. Staudacher E. Grimm R. Glössl J. Altmann F. J. Biol.

Commun. 1976; 72: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the biosynthetic pathways required for the generation of the more unusual fucose modifications of C. elegans N-glycans have not been studied, although the initial assumption would be that core fucosylation would occur in a similar way as in other eukaryotes. Although there is putatively only one core α1,6-fucosyltransferase, there are five α1,3-fucosyltransferases (25Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) which in theory could be responsible for the core α1,3-fucosylation and the anti-HRP binding observed. Following our previous work on the anti-HRP epitope of Drosophila (26Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we have now re-examined the binding of anti-HRP to C. elegans proteins. By using glycan analysis, Western blotting, and fucosyltransferase assays of extracts of both wild-type and mutant nematodes, we conclude that the cross-reaction is actually due to core α1,3-fucose. Furthermore, we have shown that one of the α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues is indeed a core α1,3-fucosyltransferase responsible in vitro and in vivo for generation of the anti-horseradish peroxidase epitope. Preparation of C. elegans Extracts—C. elegans, whether wild-type or mutant, were routinely maintained at 16 °C on a lawn of Escherichia. coli OP50 on NGM agar plates containing 250 units/ml nystatin. Each of the mutant strains VC182, VC212, VC378, RB511, and RB706 has a deletion in a different gene encoding an α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologue (Table I); deletions were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and genomic PCR.Table ICaenorhabditis α1,3-fucosyltransferase cDNAs, genes, and mutant strainsOpen reading frame no.Gene nameaThe names fut-1 and fut-4 are already listed in Wormbase; fut-2 is allocated to CE2FT-1 (EGAP9.3), an α1,2-fucosyltransferase; fut-8 is allocated to the core α1,6-fucosyltransferase.

Pellets were stored at –80 °C before use. C. elegans extracts were prepared from a total of 1 g of nematodes (wet weight) homogenized in 3 ml of 50 mm MES, pH 7, containing protease inhibitor cocktail (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. After incubating for 30 min on ice, the debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –20 °C before use. These extracts were used for both enzyme assays and Western blotting. Preparation of Transgenic Worms—Cosmids encoding fucosyltransferase homologues within their normal genetic environment were obtained from The Sanger Centre, Cambridge, UK. For constitutive expression of the fut-1 gene, the entire open reading frame was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using the primers K08F8.3/1/KpnI, GGGGTACCATGACTGCAAGAAGCATCAA, and K08F8.3/2/NheI, CTAGCTAGCTAATCTAACGGAATAGAATC. Both fragment and plasmid pPD118.25 (L3786), which contains an apparent internal enhancer from let-858, the sequences upstream of the let-858 translation start site, a multiple cloning site, a coding sequence for gfp, and the let-858 3′-region 2Fire Lab 1997 Vector supplement available on-line at www.ciwemb.edu/pages/firelab.html. were digested with KpnI and NheI and ligated. Recombinant clones in which the gfp sequence was replaced by the fut-1 open reading frame were selected; one of these clones was designated pPD118.25/fut-1. VC378 mutants were injected with mixtures of pRF4 (carrying a dominant rol-6 allele) with either cosmid DNA or pPD118.25/fut-1 at a ratio of 16:1 (27Mello C. Fire A. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C.

Worms injected with pRF4 alone were used as controls. For the preparation of genomic DNA from transformed lines, five singly picked adult rollers in 2 μl of water were incubated for 1 h at 60 °C with 20 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, and 60 μg/ml proteinase K); the extract was then heated for 15 min at 95 °C. From this mixture, 0.2 μl were used for PCR using MasterMix (Promega) and the primers K08F8.3/1/KpnI and K08F8.3/2/NheI (35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 °C). For protein extracts, 50 singly picked adult rollers were lysed in 1× SDS-PAGE buffer prior to electrophoresis and Western blotting. Genomic DNA and protein extracts were also prepared from singly picked controls. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. After blocking with 0.5% (w/v) BSA, membranes were incubated with either rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase, rabbit anti-bee venom, or rat monoclonal YZ1/2.23 at the dilutions described in the relevant figure legends. After washing, alkaline phosphatase conjugates of either goat anti-rabbit or anti-rat (1:2000) were used with subsequent color detection with SigmaFAST™ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. In some cases, and where indicated in the figure legends, the primary antibodies were preincubated for 1 h with the BSA neoglycoconjugates BSA-MUXF3 and BSA-MUX carrying, respectively, native and trifluoroacetic acid-defucosylated bromelain glycopeptides, as described previously (11Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N.P. Ashford D.A. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The degree of defucosylation resulting in BSA-MUX was estimated as being at least 95% as judged by monosaccharide analysis. Glycan Analyses—N-Glycans were prepared from mixed populations of either wild-type and mutant C. elegans as described previously (1Altmann F. Fabini G. Ahorn H. Wilson I.B.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Glycans were then analyzed by both average and monoisotopic MALDI-TOF MS using either the ThermoBioanalysis Dynamo with dihydroxybenzoic acid (20 mg/ml) as matrix or the Bruker Ultraflex TOF-TOF with 6-aza-2-thiothymine (5 mg/ml) as matrix, respectively. Internal calibration was performed using theoretical values for Hex3HexNAc2 and Hex9HexNAc2. Cloning and Expression of Fucosyltransferase Homologues—Total RNA was prepared from a mixed population of C. elegans with Trizol (Invitrogen) reagent and subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript III (Invitrogen) with T18 as primer. The full reading frames of cDNAs encoding each putative α1,3-fucosyltransferase were amplified from C. elegans cDNA using Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and the following primers: fut-1 with K08F8.3/1/KpnI, GGGGTACCATGACTGCAAGAAGCATCAA, and K08F8.3/2/XbaI, GCTCTAGACTAATCTAACGGAATAGAATC; fut-3 with F59E12.13/1/K-pnI, GGGGTACCATGAGGGTTCGGCCAGC, and F59E12.13/2/XbaI, GCTCTAGACTAACCACTGAGCCAACT; fut-4 with K12H6.3/1/KpnI, GGGGTACCATGTCTTCGACAAGTGGC, and K12H6.3/2/XbaI, GCTCTAGAGCTATATCAAATACTTCATTC; fut-5 with T05A7.5a/1/SpeI, GGACTAGTATGAAACATAATACTTTACGAG, and T05A7.5a/2/SacII, TCCCCGCGGTCATAAAAACCGAGTTGCAAA; and fut-6 with T05A-7.5b/1/KpnI, GGGGTACCATGTCTCAAATAGGCGGTG, and T05A-7.5b/2/XbaI, GCTCTAGACAACTACAAATATTTCGAAGC. In the case of the fut-5 PCR product, re-amplification by using KOD Hot Start polymerase (Novagen) and cloning using the Perfectly Blunt cloning kit (Novagen) was required to generate sufficient material for the subsequent manipulations. The cDNA fragments were cut with the relevant restriction enzymes and ligated into pIZTV5/His (Invitrogen), a vector suitable for expression in insect cells. The partial reading frame of fut-1 suitable for soluble expression in Pichia using pPICZα B, either in the form purchased from the supplier (Invitrogen) or in a form in which the vector was modified by inverse PCR to include a region encoding a FLAG tag just upstream of the multiple cloning site but downstream of the region encoding the Ste13 signal cleavage site, was generated by PCR using Expand polymerase with C. elegans cDNA and the primers K08F8.3/3/PstI, AACTGCAGCAAAATCTGAACAAAAGGATTG, and K08F8.3/2/XbaI, GCTCTAGACTAATCTAACGGAATAGAATC. The PCR product was purified from the PCR mix using the GFX DNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Both fragment and vector were digested with PstI and XbaI prior to ligation, transformation, selection, and sequencing. The expression vector was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115, and colonies were selected and expression performed with methanol induction at 16 °C as described previously (28Mucha J. Domlatil J. Lochnit G. Rendić D. Paschinger K. Hinterkörner G. Hofinger A. Kosma P. Wilson I.B.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Concentrated supernatants were assayed either directly or after Affi-Gel Blue-Sepharose chromatography as described previously for Drosophila α1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (28Mucha J. Domlatil J. Lochnit G. Rendić D. Paschinger K. Hinterkörner G. Hofinger A. Kosma P. Wilson I.B.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The N-terminally FLAG-tagged form was detectable after Western blotting by using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:10,000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000). Assays of Fucosyltransferases by HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS—Dabsyl- and dansyl-glycopeptides were prepared as described previously (26Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Roitinger A. Leiter H. Staudacher E. Altmann F. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the case of the dabsyl-glycopeptide from fibrin, the primary glycopeptide product after desialylation was dabsyl-GalGal (see Scheme I for a definition of the N-glycan nomenclature used), whereas after desialylation and degalactosylation the primary dansyl-glycopeptide product from IgG was dansyl-GnGnF6; β-galactosidase or α-fucosidase digestion provided the GnGn forms. Incubation with jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase was performed to generate dabsyl-MM, dansyl-MM, or dansyl-MMF6 from the relevant GnGn or GnGnF6 form, whereas a recombinant C. elegans hexosaminidase, 3K. Paschinger and I. B. H. Wilson, unpublished data. shown to cleave GlcNAc only from the α1,3-arm of GnGn, was used to specifically generate dabsyl-GnM. A dansylated glycopeptide carrying Man5GlcNAc2 was prepared after Pronase digestion of Aspergillus oryzae amylase. Dabsyl- or dansyl-glycopeptide (0.25 nmol) was typically incubated at room temperature (23 °C) overnight in the presence or absence of GDP-Fuc (5 nmol) in a final concentration of 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2 with 2 μl of enzyme solution (final volume 5 μl). In the case of C. elegans extracts, swainsonine was added to a final concentration of 12 mm. The incubation mixture was then subject to either MALDI-TOF MS (dabsyl) or RP-HPLC (dansyl) as described previously (26Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). N-Glycans from the VC378 strain (one-tenth of the glycans prepared from3gof worms) were incubated with FUT-1 and GDP-Fuc for 48 h at room temperature. The glycans were then purified by use of a mini-column (Lichroprep RP18, AG3, AG50) as described previously (30Kolarich D. Altmann F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The activity of FUT-1 (1 μl of culture supernatant) was also tested with 0.25 nmol of pyridylaminated lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1,3Glc-NAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc-PA) or lacto-N-neo-tetraose (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1, 3Galβ1,4Glc-PA) as potential acceptor and 5 nmol GDP-Fuc as donor in the presence of MES, pH 6.5, and MnCl2 in a final volume of 5 μl. After overnight incubation, the assay mixtures were analyzed by RP-HPLC with tomato Lewis-type fucosyltransferase used as a positive control (31Wilson I.B.H. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Enzyme Product—Larger scale incubations of dansyl-MM and dansyl-MMF6 (2 nmol) with FUT-1 were subject to RP-HPLC. The purified products (putatively dansyl-MMF3 and dansyl-MMF3F6) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and by methylation analysis. For the latter, the glycopeptides were permethylated, hydrolyzed, reduced, and peracetylated prior to analysis of the obtained partially methylated alditol acetates by capillary gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry by using the instrumentation and microtechniques described elsewhere (32Paz-Parente J. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricard G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Geyer R. Geyer H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 86-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Expression in Insect Cells—Drosophila S2 cells grown at 27 °C were transiently transfected using TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's protocol for adherent cells, with either empty pIZT/V5-His or pIZT/V5-His constructs containing complete open reading frames of either one of the five C. elegans fucosyltransferase homologues or Arabidopsis thaliana FucTA. Transfected cells were lysed 3 days post-transfection, and equal amounts of extracted proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-HRP antibodies as described above. Successful transfection was confirmed by the fluorescence of the gfp-zeoR gene product encoded by the vector. Incubation of Fucosyltransferase with a Neoglycoconjugate—A neoglycoconjugate, BSA-MM, consisting of a glycopeptide from bovine fibrin modified to remove sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine residues cross-linked to bovine serum albumin using dinitrodifluorobenzene (11Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N.P. Ashford D.A. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), was incubated with FUT-1 overnight in the absence and presence of GDP-Fuc prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. In parallel, the band corresponding to BSA-MM was excised from a Coomassie-stained gel and subjected to trypsin and peptide:N-glycosidase A digestion as described (30Kolarich D. Altmann F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Antibody Binding Studies—In initial studies we screened antibodies that recognize core α1,3-fucose with C. elegans extracts. Whereas anti-HRP is a polyclonal antibody shown previously to bind both core α1,3-fucose and β1,2-xylose (11Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N.P. Ashford D.A. Altmann F.

Mach L. Glössl J. März L. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the monoclonal antibody YZ1/2.23 has been shown to bind core α1,3-fucose (11Wilson I.B.H.

Vervelde L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were confirmed that showed that anti-horseradish peroxidase binds wild-type C. elegans glycoproteins; furthermore, anti-bee venom and YZ1/2.23 also showed cross-reactivity (Fig. 1A). The reactivities of both anti-horseradish peroxidase and anti-bee venom were greatly reduced in the presence of 0.5 μm of a neoglycoconjugate consisting of bromelain glycopeptides attached to bovine serum albumin (BSA-MUXF3) (Fig. 1A). Even 10 times more of the corresponding defucosylated conjugate (BSA-MUX) did not generate the same inhibitory effect; this is in contrast to the results with Schistosoma mansoni egg extracts with which the defucosylated conjugate also showed significant inhibitory effect (data not shown). On this basis we concluded that the cross-reaction of anti-horseradish peroxidase to C. elegans is due to core α1,3-fucose, whereas in the case of S. mansoni both xylose and fucose would appear to play a role. Indeed, to date, no xylose has been detected on the N-glycans of any nematode, whereas this monosaccharide is a known component of trematode N-glycans (40Khoo K.-H. Hu"
https://openalex.org/W2097068010,"Aspergillus sp. P37 is an arsenate-hypertolerant fungus isolated from a river in Spain with a long history of contamination with metals. This strain is able to grow in the presence of 0.2 m arsenate, i.e. 20-fold higher than the reference strain, Aspergillus nidulans TS1. Although Aspergillus sp. P37 reduces As(V) to As(III), which is slowly pumped out of the cell, the measured efflux of oxyanions is insufficient to explain the high tolerance levels of this strain. To gain an insight into this paradox, the accumulation of acid-soluble thiol species in Aspergillus sp. P37 when exposed to arsenic was compared with that of the arsenic-sensitive A. nidulans TS1 strain. Increasing levels of arsenic in the medium did not diminish the intracellular pool of reduced glutathione in Aspergillus sp. P37, in sharp contrast with the decline of glutathione in A. nidulans under the same conditions. Furthermore, concentrations of arsenic that were inhibitory for the sensitive A. nidulans strain (e.g. 50 mm and above) provoked a massive formation of vacuoles filled with thiol species. Because the major fraction of the cellular arsenic was present as the glutathione conjugate As(GS)3, it is plausible that the arsenic-hypertolerant phenotype of Aspergillus sp. P37 is in part due to an enhanced capacity to maintain a large intracellular glutathione pool under conditions of arsenic exposure and to sequester As(GS)3 in vacuoles. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of cell extracts revealed that the contact of Aspergillus sp. P37 (but not A. nidulans) with high arsenic concentrations (≥150 mm) induced the production of small quantities of a distinct thiol species indistinguishable from plant phytochelatin-2. Yet, we argue that phytochelatins do not explain arsenic resistance in Aspergillus, and we advocate the role of As(GS)3 complexes in arsenic detoxification. Aspergillus sp.

Yet, we argue that phytochelatins do not explain arsenic resistance in Aspergillus, and we advocate the role of As(GS)3 complexes in arsenic detoxification. Arsenic is a major environmental pollutant that typically contaminates the soil and water of areas subject to intensive mining and metallurgical activities. Some of such areas (such as the Rio Tinto district in Southern Spain) have been in operation since ancient times and can be traced to the mining of pyrites by the Phoenician colonizers several centuries B. C. (1Amaral-Zettler Gomez, F. Zettler E. Keenan B.G. Amils R. Sogin M.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Such long-term arsenic-rich niches have select microbial populations that thrive among concentrations of the metalloid that are altogether lethal for all other life forms. The strain Aspergillus sp. P37, isolated from Rio Tinto, exhibits a hypertolerant phenotype for arsenate (e.g. up to 0.2 m) that seems to approach the maximum resistance to the oxyanion found in the biological world to date. This strain exceeds by at least 20-fold the endurance to arsenic forms exhibited by the akin species Aspergillus nidulans (2Canovas D. Durán C. Rodríguez N. Amils R. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because arsenate, the main chemical form of arsenic encountered under aerobic conditions, is a phosphate analogue, it is taken up into cells through the phosphate uptake system (3Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Yet, in a previous study we demonstrated that the arsenic-hypertolerant phenotype of Aspergillus sp. P37 is not related to the transport (influx/efflux) of the oxyanion (4Canovas D. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding was evidenced by experiments showing that both arsenate and phosphate uptakes in Aspergillus sp. P37 were similar to those shown by a reference, the arsenic-sensitive A. nidulans strain. In contrast, Aspergillus sp. P37 reduced As(V) to As(III) more readily than did the control A. nidulans. On this basis, it was proposed that arsenic reduction contributed decisively to the hypertolerance phenomenon (4Canovas D. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Still, the reduction of arsenate originates arsenite, a more toxic derivative that requires further detoxification. Consequently, there should be additional features of this strain contributing to arsenic resistance. Because Aspergillus sp. P37 does not methylate arsenic to any significant extent, 1D. Cánovas and V. de Lorenzo, unpublished observations.1D. Cánovas and V. de Lorenzo, unpublished observations. the one plausible mechanism for such a detoxification is conjugation with a thiol species, as is the case in plants. In this case, reduced glutathione and poly-γ-glutamylcysteinylglycines, called phytochelatins (PCs), 2The abbreviations used are: PC, phytochelatin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; mBrB, monobromobimane.2The abbreviations used are: PC, phytochelatin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; mBrB, monobromobimane. bind metal ions, including arsenite, with high affinity, thereby counteracting the toxic effect of these ions. PCs have the general structure (γ-EC)nS, in which n varies between 2 and 11 (5Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PCs from GSH is catalyzed by phytochelatin synthase, a constitutive enzyme requiring activation by heavy metals or metalloids (6Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment of plants with a γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor, l-buthionine sulfoximine, produces arsenic hypersensitivity both in normal and arsenate-hypertolerant plants (7Schat H. Llugany M. Vooijs R. Hartley-Whitaker J. Bleeker P.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 2381-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), whereas the GSH-overproducing Arabidopsis thaliana presents only a moderately higher arsenic tolerance (8Dhankher O.P. Li Y. Rosen B.P. Shi J. Salt D. Senecoff J.F. Sashti N.A. Meagher R.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PC-deficient A. thaliana with normal GSH levels appeared to be hypersensitive to various heavy metals, including arsenic (9Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), revealing that PCs contribute decisively to arsenic tolerance. From this background, the question is whether PCs or other thiol compounds could also account for the tolerance of Aspergillus sp. P37 to arsenic. Functional PCs are present in all plants examined but have been found only in a small number of animals and fungi (5Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 10Mehra R.K. Tarbet E.B. Gray W.R. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The archetypical yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks functional PCs, and its arsenic tolerance depends on the efflux of arsenic across the plasma membrane and on the vacuolar sequestration of As(GS)3 (14Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (9Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) does produce PCs, which determine the metallo-tolerance of this yeast to a number of metal ions. In this work, we have investigated the role of thiol compounds in the arsenic resistance phenotype Aspergillus sp. P37. As shown below, we have found similarities and differences between the mechanisms that operate in this fungus and those driving arsenic tolerance in plants. Our data show that although intracellular pools of glutathione remain basically unaltered in Aspergillus sp. P37 upon exposure to arsenate for short periods, their intracellular location changes dramatically in the presence of the oxyanion. Furthermore, our results suggest that arsenic-glutathione complexes are accumulated into vacuoles, thereby contributing to the high tolerance in vivo to the heavy ion. Fungal Strains and Media—The arsenic-hypertolerant strain Aspergillus sp. P37 was isolated from the Rio Tinto in southwestern Spain and has been described in detail previously (2Canovas D. Durán C. Rodríguez N. Amils R. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reference strain A. nidulans TS1 (biA1 methG1 argB2) was kindly provided by T. Suárez (15Clutterbuck A.J. O'Brien S.J. Genetic Maps: Locus Maps of Complex Genomes. 6th Ed.

Isogenic gstA+A. nidulans MH3408 (bia1 niiA4 amds-lacZ) and ΔgstA A. nidulans MH9986 (amdS-lacZ gstA::riboB2) strains were obtained from Michael Hynes (17Fraser J.A. Davis M.A. Hynes M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2802-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sporulation conditions for A. nidulans (18Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were applied to produce conidiospores in Aspergillus sp. P37. Fungal strains were regularly cultured in complete YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) medium (19Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchel A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) to which glucose (1%) was added as a carbon source. Arsenic Resistance Assays—Arsenic resistance was estimated from plates containing a gradient concentration of arsenate or arsenite ranging 0–15 mm. The gradient of arsenic concentration was made as follow. First, a bottom layer of medium was poured in a Petri dish on a surface sloping 5°. After hardening of the medium, the plate was transferred from the slant to a flat plane. The upper layer of medium containing the desired concentration of the arsenic species to be assayed was then poured onto the plate, and the medium was allowed to solidify. Eight 2-μl drops of a suspension of fungal conidiospores (∼108 spores/ml) were placed along the gradient and allowed to dry. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C to allow fungal growth. Images on plates were recorded by using a Chemidoc device (Bio-Rad). Identification of Acid-soluble Thiols by HPLC—Fungi were grown for 5, 12, or 24 h in YPD medium containing increasing concentrations of arsenate at 37 °C. The biomass was filtered and washed with distilled water. Extraction of acid soluble compounds was carried out as described previously (20Hartley-Whitaker J. Ainsworth G. Vooijs R. Ten Bookum W. Schat H. Meharg A.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5–15 mg of freeze-dried fungal material was ground in a mortar in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with 6 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid at pH ≤ 1. N-Acetyl-cysteine was added during grinding as an internal standard. Samples were taken from a minimum of two separate experiments. The specimens under analysis were filter centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Freshly extracted samples were immediately derivatized according to Sneller et al. (21Sneller F.E. van Heerwaarden L.M. Koevoets P.L. Vooijs R. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To this end, 250 μl of each specimen was treated with monobromobimane (mBrB; Molecular Probes, Inc.) in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-1-propanesulphonic acid and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid buffer for 30 min at 45 °C in the dark. 300 μl of methanesulfonic acid was then added to stop the reaction. Derivatized samples were stored in the dark at 4 °C until analysis. At that point, derivatized thiols were separated in a Nova Pack C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted with a slightly concave methanol gradient of 12–25% (v/v) for 15 min and then with a linear methanol gradient from 25 to 50% (v/v) for 15–50 min (20Hartley-Whitaker J. Ainsworth G. Vooijs R. Ten Bookum W. Schat H. Meharg A.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Fluorescent molecular species were detected using a Waters 474 fluorescence detector. Compounds were identified and quantified by comparison with standards and corrected for different reactivities to mBrB as described (21Sneller F.E. van Heerwaarden L.M. Koevoets P.L. Vooijs R. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Determination of Arsenite-Glutathione Complexes—Whereas arsenite does not form stable complexes with glutathione at neutral pH, As(GS)3 species are stable at pH 3. Thus, for the determination of arsenite-glutathione complexes, samples of the fungal strains under scrutiny, grown in the presence or absence of arsenate, were extracted in trifluoroacetic acid at pH 3, separated by HPLC, and detected by the post-column derivatization method with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described previously (21Sneller F.E. van Heerwaarden L.M. Koevoets P.L. Vooijs R. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The As(GS)3 standard for this procedure was made by the chemical reaction of GSH with sodium arsenite at pH 3 (21Sneller F.E. van Heerwaarden L.M. Koevoets P.L. Vooijs R. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Microscopy—Cells were pictured without fixation by phase-contrast microscopy using a Sensys charge-coupled camera (Photometrics) and a Zeiss Axiolab HBO 50 microscope. For the visualization of thiol groups in the vacuoles, Aspergillus sp. P37 cells were induced with or without 50 mm arsenate for 3 h. After this period, the thiol-specific fluorescent reagent mBrB was added at a final concentration of 100 μm, still in the presence of arsenate. Incubation continued in the dark for one more hour, after which samples were washed with fresh medium and visualized with epifluorescence microscopy. Measurement of Arsenic in Fungal Samples—The total arsenic present in fungal biomass was determined in acid-soluble extracts prepared as explained above. The oxyanion was quantified on a flame atomic spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer 2100; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the method of hydride generation as described previously (22Bleeker P.M. Schat H. Vooijs R. Verkleij J.A.C. Ernst W.H.O. New Phytol. 2003; 157: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Exposure to Arsenate Triggers a Massive Accumulation of Thiolic Compounds in the Vacuoles of Aspergillus sp. P37— This work was prompted by our early observations of morphological changes in cells of Aspergillus sp. P37 exposed to growing concentrations of arsenate (2Canovas D. Durán C. Rodríguez N. Amils R. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A simple perusal of cells grown in the presence of 50 mm As(V) under a phase-contrast microscope revealed the formation of large vacuoles to the point of bulging out the hyphal filaments and causing a deformation in cell shape (2Canovas D. Durán C. Rodríguez N. Amils R. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Yet, this observation could not be interpreted rigorously per se, as a negative control was not feasible; the arsenic-sensitive A. nidulans reference strain could not grow at such high concentrations of the oxyanion. Furthermore, many generic stress conditions trigger formation of vacuoles in Aspergillus species (23Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24de Souza C.C. Pellizzon C.H. Hiraishi M. Goldman M.H. Goldman G.H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It was therefore unclear whether the buildup of vacuoles in arsenic-exposed Aspergillus sp. P37 had any connection with the mechanism(s) that accounts for the hypertolerant phenotype or whether it was part of a nonspecific response to stress. To address this question, we considered a number of alternatives including the possibility that, similarly to plants, arsenic could end up in vacuoles following conjugation with thiol compounds (see “Discussion”). To either regard or discard this possibility, we ran a simple test in which Aspergillus sp. P37 cells incubated in 50 mm arsenate were treated with the fluorescent thiol-specific reagent mBrB. This compound permeates freely cell membranes and reacts with -SH groups, producing a strong fluorescence. Fig. 1 shows that the bulk of mBrB-reactive material accumulates in the large vacuoles of arsenic-treated Aspergillus sp. P37. This outcome indicated that vacuoles served as sites of storage for thiol-containing compounds. In the absence of arsenate in the culture medium, cells did not show any significant vacuolation nor did they emit bright fluorescence in the presence of mBrB (Fig. 1). This could be due to a lower content of thiol species and/or a more even distribution of the -SH compound through the different cell compartments. The two outstanding questions originated by these results deal with the nature of the thiol compounds detected and whether or not they are conjugated with arsenic. The following sections address these aspects. Identification and Quantification of Acid-soluble Thiol Species in Aspergillus sp. P37—To provide a profile of the different solutes containing thiol groups that form or accumulate upon the exposure of cells to arsenic, fungi (either Aspergillus sp. P37 or control strain A. nidulans TS1) were grown at different times in media containing increasing concentrations of arsenate. Acid-soluble compounds were then extracted from the biomass, derivatized with mBrB, and submitted to HPLC analysis as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The use of standards allowed the unequivocal identification of most of the thiol compounds that reacted with mBrB. Fig. 2 shows one of such profiles from Aspergillus sp. P37 treated at the highest concentration of arsenic, 200 mm, and, for the longest time, 24 h (i.e. conditions favoring formation of thiol-containing vacuoles). The major peak in all cases (accounting for up to 95% of the whole of soluble -SH compounds) corresponded to GSH. This was accompanied by a number of other thiol-containing compounds (including cysteine and γ-glutamylcysteine; Fig. 2), which appeared in the chromatogram as minor components of the free thiol pool. It is thus reasonable to presume that the bulk of the free thiol species accumulated in vacuoles consist of GSH. Fig. 3A shows the evolution of GSH buildup in Aspergillus sp. P37 or A. nidulans TS1 through time under growing concentrations of arsenate. It is noteworthy that the accumulation of glutathione in Aspergillus sp. P37 did not change significantly when the cultures were induced with moderate concentrations of the oxyanion for relatively short periods of time (up to 5 h). Only after 12 h of incubation and with superior arsenic levels in the medium did Aspergillus sp. P37 cells accumulate significantly higher amounts of glutathione, and a peak of the intracellular GSH pool was reached after 24 h of incubation with the highest arsenic concentration (Fig. 3A). In contrast to Aspergillus sp. P37, A. nidulans TS1 accumulated the highest concentration of glutathione at a concentration of arsenate as low as 1 mm. This concentration was, in any case, only slightly higher (≤17%) than the GSH levels of the uninduced cells of A. nidulans TS1. Further increases in the level of the metalloid in the medium resulted in a reduction of the glutathione pool of A. nidulans TS1, surely due to the toxic effect exerted by arsenic on sensitive cells (Fig. 3A). Yet, the most informative outcome of the results shown in Fig. 3A is that GSH pools of Aspergillus sp. P37 treated with 50 mm arsenic for 5 h (a concentration that sufficed for a considerable vacuolation of thiol-containing compounds as detected with epifluorescence microscopy; Fig. 1) were not that different (≤ 10%) from the levels measured in non-treated control cells. This result suggested that, within a certain arsenic concentration range and exposure time, the effect of the oxyanion in the hypertolerant fungus is not so much to enhance GSH levels as to provoke a reallocation of the pre-existing cellular pool into the new vacuoles. A Role for Phytochelatin-2 in the Detoxification of Heavy Metals in Aspergillus Strains?—The type of analysis shown in Fig. 2 revealed also that a minor peak (labeled initially as Y) was recurrently present in samples of Aspergillus sp. P37 grown in the highest concentrations of arsenic for the longest period of time (Fig. 3B). Purification of the compound Y by HPLC and further analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy showed three major peaks (698, 714, and 730). One of these peaks corresponded to the molecular weight of plant phytochelatin-2 (PC2; Fig. 2) conjugated to one molecule of mBrB (730; data not shown), suggesting that the peak Y of Fig. 2 did correspond to PC2. The minor contribution of this peak to the pool of free thiols argues against any relevant role in tolerance to arsenic. Yet, its presence was specific to elevated concentrations of arsenate, as it was not detected in cultures with <100 mm of the oxyanion (Fig. 3B). Cultures amended with subinhibitory concentrations of other heavy ions such as Cd2+ (0.1 mm), As3+ (25 mm), Cr3+ (50 mm), or Cu2+ (50 mm) also failed to induce the peak at the PC2 position (data not shown). We could not detect this peak either in A. nidulans TS1 grown in the presence of arsenate, arsenite, copper, cadmium, or chromium. Furthermore, the presence of phytochelatin-like molecules is rare in arsenic-resistant microorganisms (9Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike in plants where PCs are major players in the response to the oxyanion and other heavy metals (20Hartley-Whitaker J. Ainsworth G. Vooijs R. Ten Bookum W. Schat H. Meharg A.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22Bleeker P.M. Schat H. Vooijs R. Verkleij J.A.C. Ernst W.H.O. New Phytol. 2003; 157: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), the low level of PC2 accumulation in Aspergillus sp. P37 seems to be a marginal phenomenon rather than a constituent of the arsenic detoxification system. Formation of Arsenic-Glutathione Complexes in Arsenic-stressed Aspergillus sp. P37 Cells—In view of the above data, the next logical question was whether the glutathione present at different levels and compartments in Aspergillus sp. P37 and A. nidulans TS1 was bound or not bound to arsenic when cells grow in the presence of the oxyanion. To address this issue, we first tackled the question of whether both As(III) and As(V) could form stable conjugates with reduced GSH under our analytical conditions. To this end, because arsenite does not make stable complexes with glutathione at neutral pH, the GSH solution was mixed with sodium arsenite at pH 3. An HPLC protocol was then employed to separate and quantify free GSH from its complex with arsenite, As(GS)3. By exploiting a post-column derivatization procedure with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (21Sneller F.E. van Heerwaarden L.M. Koevoets P.L. Vooijs R. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the two chemical species could be separated with HPLC with clear cut retention times (Fig. 4A). When As(V) was employed instead of As(III) we could not detect any significant conjugation of the oxyanion with GSH under the test conditions, as the very minor peak that appears at the As(GS)3 retention time point is likely to be a side reaction of some of the As(III) produced upon the chemical reduction of As(V) with the GSH of the reaction mixture (not shown). With this reference in hand, we set out to determine the presence of arsenite-glutathione complexes in Aspergillus sp. P37 strains under the conditions of vacuolation shown in Fig. 1. For this task, the fungi were grown in the presence or absence of 50 mm for 24 h, its biomass was collected and extracted in trifluoroacetic acid, and the soluble fraction was separated by HPLC and detected by the post-column derivatization method mentioned previously (21Sneller F.E. van Heerwaarden L.M. Koevoets P.L. Vooijs R. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that although the non-treated sample produced only the peak of arsenic-free GSH, the specimen exposed to arsenate yielded two major chemical species. As displayed in Fig. 4C, one peak matched GSH, whereas the other corresponded to As(GS)3. By judging the cognate peak areas, it would appear that the share of glutathione complexed with arsenite accounted for up to 35–40% of the whole GSH pool. Because the only form of arsenic that reacts non-enzymatically with GSH is As(III), the results of Fig. 4 also indicate that reduction of the oxyanion is a prerequisite for its conjugation with glutathione. To have a reference for the interpretation of the above data, A. nidulans TS1 was subjected to the same procedure for detecting the formation of As(GS)3. Yet, because this strain starts being sensitive to arsenic at concentrations >5 mm (2Canovas D. Durán C. Rodríguez N. Amils R. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we employed this maximum level of the oxyanion in our determinations. A. nidulans TS1 was thus cultured in 5 mm arsenate for 24 h, subjected to an acid extraction, and submitted to the same HPLC and post-column derivatization analysis as before. The share of As(GS)3 found in the intracellular pool of glutathione was in the range of 60 to 65%. An Involvement of Glutathione-S-transferase(s) (GST) in the Response to Arsenic?—The above data (Fig. 4A) reveal that GSH and arsenite (but not arsenate) can react non-enzymatically to yield As(GS)3. This compound is found in considerable levels both in arsenic-resistant and arsenic-sensitive Aspergillus strains when exposed to high concentrations of the heavy ion. The manifest question is whether the formation of such As(GS)3 compounds in vivo occurs also non-enzymatically or is it the result of a specific biocatalytic step. The ubiquitous enzyme GST has been conserved through the evolutionary scale, from bacteria to mammals, as a major instrument for responding to chemical and environmental stressors. This is because this broad substrate enzyme facilitates the binding of the free thiols of glutathione to a variety of substrates that are thus inactivated and, in some cases, channeled toward specifi"

Dephosphorylation of KSR1 on Ser392 by protein phosphatase 2A allows the translocation of KSR1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the activation of MEK by Raf (35Ory S. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1356-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Consequently, the dephosphorylation of Ser392 on KSR1 promotes ERK activation. Given its role in ERK activation, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Ser392 on KSR1 could modify the duration of ERK activation and, as a consequence, the mitogenic potential of growth factors.Phosphorylation of three residues, Thr274, Ser260, and Ser443, is inducible by pathway stimulation with growth factors or activated Ras (30Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The amino acids surrounding each of these phosphorylation sites is a consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequence (30Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Thr274 appears to be phosphorylated in response to treatment with PDGF (30Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) but not EGF (32Muller J. Ory S. Copeland T. Piwnica-Worms H. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Thr274 phosphorylation may be a mechanism by which KSR1 promotes the mitogenic action of PDGF and restricts that mitogenic action of EGF.In this study, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of KSR1 at residues Thr274 and Ser392 modulates the proliferative potential of specific growth factors. When expressed at levels observed in wild-type fibroblasts, ectopic KSR1 restored sustained ERK activation upon PDGF stimulation and transient ERK activation upon EGF stimulation. However, similar expression of KSR1 mutated at phosphorylation sites Thr274 or Ser392 promoted sustained ERK activation in response to stimulation with both EGF and PDGF and accelerated cell proliferation. Therefore, blocking KSR1 phosphorylation generated a PDGF-like response to EGF treatment, suggesting that KSR1 phosphorylation mediates ERK signaling specificity to EGF and PDGF stimulation. In combination, these mutations also inhibited KSR1 turnover. These data suggest that proliferative responses through the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade can be regulated by controlling the phosphorylation and stability of KSR1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—293T cells and immortalized KSR1–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nm minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids, and 2 mm l-glutamine and were incubated at 37 °C in a 6% CO2 atmosphere. KSR1–/– MEFs were generated from day 13.5 KSR1–/– embryos and were immortalized by a 3T9 protocol as described previously (16Nguyen A. Burack W.R. Stock J.L. Kortum R. Chaika O.V. Afkarian M.

KSR1 retroviruses were generated by cotransfecting MSCV·KSR1·IRES·GFP retroviral expression plasmids with an ecotropic packaging vector into 293T cells (below). KSR1–/– MEFs were infected by incubating with the retroviral supernatant for 24 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. The pool of infected cells was sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and the population of cells expressing the lowest 10% of GFP levels, and therefore, the lowest 10% of KSR1 levels, was collected (18Kortum R.L. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were excited at 458 nm and separated at 510/20 nm, with baseline fluorescence of uninfected cells having a mean intensity of 6 (range 0–15). Post-sorted cells were assessed for purity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. KSR1 expression was confirmed by Western blot.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaPPi, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate). Clarified cell lysates were normalized for total protein concentration using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with antibodies against β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), KSR1 (BD Biosciences), ERK/phospho-ERK Thr202/Tyr204 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cell Signaling Technology), RSK/phospho-RSK Ser380 (BD Biosciences and Cell Signaling Technology), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or MEK/phospho-MEK Ser217/Ser221 (BD Biosciences and Cell Signaling Technology). Western blots were probed with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) or IRdye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Blotted proteins were detected and quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR).ERK Time Courses—Time courses of ERK activation were performed using the in-cell Western blot analysis on the Odyssey system (LI-COR), which allows analysis and quantification of ERK phosphorylation in multiple samples by simultaneously probing fixed cells with antibodies against total ERK and ERK phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204. KSR1–/– MEFs expressing KSR1 constructs were seeded in triplicate at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate (BIOSOURCE). Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were serum-deprived for 4 h and stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) or PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml) for the indicated time points. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and stained for ERK/phospho-ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-94, 1:200; Cell Signaling Technology 9106, 1:200) according to the manufacturers' instructions and as described previously (18Kortum R.L. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, 1:200) and IRDye 800 anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, 1:200) were used as secondary antibodies. Plates were scanned using the Odyssey system. Results were analyzed using the in-cell Western blot Odyssey software (LI-COR) and Microsoft Excel.Proliferation Assays and BrdUrd Incorporation—To assay growth rate, cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at 2.5 × 104 cells/well. Cells from triplicate wells were trypsinized, harvested, and counted each day for 6 days using a Beckman Coulter counter.Cells were assayed for cell cycle progression by monitoring the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, BD Biosciences). Cells were plated at 1.6 × 104 cells/well on coverslips. Four hours after plating, cells were serum-starved for 72 h to induce quiescence. Cells were then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml), PDGF-BB (25 ng/ml), or serum (10% fetal bovine serum) in the presence of BrdUrd (10 μm) for 20 h. The cells were fixed in methanol:acetone (1:1) at –20 °C for 8 min and were rehydrated with Tris-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. After treatment with 1.5 m HCl for 10 min, cells were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) for 40 min and incubated for 40 min with anti-BrdUrd antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (Pharmingen, 1:1 with Odyssey blocking buffer). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye 33258. Cells were visualized on a fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filters.Transformation Assays—5 × 103 cells were resuspended in 0.325% noble agar (in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 15% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine) and plated on a layer of 0.65% noble agar. Colonies were counted after 3 weeks.Protein Turnover—KSR1–/– MEFs expressing ectopic KSR1 constructs were serum-starved in the presence of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) for 0–8 h. Cells were snap-frozen and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein levels were determined by Western blotting with antibodies against KSR1 and actin and were quantified using Odyssey software (LI-COR).RESULTSPhosphorylation of KSR1 Modulates the Duration of ERK Activation—KSR1 expression promotes ERK activation (18Kortum R.L. Lewis R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that phosphorylation of KSR1 contributes to its role in ERK activation by EGF and PDGF. To investigate this possibility, we expressed wild-type and mutated forms of KSR1 in KSR1–/– MEFs (16Nguyen A. Burack W.R. Stock J.L. Kortum R. Chaika O.V. Afkarian M. Muller W.J. Murphy K.M. Morrison D.K. Lewis R.E. McNeish J. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3035-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) at levels comparable with those in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1).KSR1–/– MEFs expressing ectopic KSR1 exhibited sustained ERK activation with PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2A). ERK activation peaked at 5 min after treatment but showed significant phosphorylation out to 90 min of stimulation. In contrast, upon treatment with EGF, the cells exhibited transient ERK activation (Fig. 2B), with ERK phosphorylation peaking at 5 min of stimulation but falling rapidly back to basal levels.Fig. 2Mutation of KSR1 phosphorylation sites enhances the duration of ERK activation. KSR1–/– MEFs expressing KSR1, KSR1.TVSA (left panels, closed and open circles, respectively) KSR1.TV, or KSR1.SA (right panels, open and closed triangles, respectively) were analyzed in an in-cell Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures” for ERK activation. The cells were probed for total ERK and phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in triplicate. Quantification of phosphorylated ERK normalized to total ERK is plotted versus time after stimulation by PDGF (A) and EGF (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined the effects of mutating Thr274 or Ser392 (Thr274 to Val, TV; Ser392 to Ala, SA) on the time course of ERK activation upon stimulation with both EGF and PDGF. Mutation of Ser392 on KSR1 promotes KSR1 membrane recruitment and Xenopus oocyte maturation (32Muller J. Ory S. Copeland T. Piwnica-Worms H. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 983-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). KSR1.SA caused sustained ERK activation in cells treated with PDGF (Fig. 2A). In cells treated with EGF, KSR1.SA promoted a burst of ERK activation that was sustained above the level obtained in cells expressing wild-type KSR1 (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that Ser392 dephosphorylation enhances both the intensity and the duration of ERK activation. ERK activation was decreased in both intensity and duration in KSR1–/– MEFs expressing KSR1.TV upon treatment with either PDGF (Fig. 2A) or EGF (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that blocking phosphorylation of this putative ERK phosphorylation site alone does not facilitate ERK phosphorylation.To determine which KSR1 mutation was dominant (SA or TV), we expressed KSR1 mutated at both Thr274 and Ser392 (TVSA) in KSR1–/– MEFs (Fig. 1). Cells expressing KSR1.TVSA demonstrated more sustained ERK activation upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2A) as compared with wild-type KSR1 expressed at the same level. Cells expressing KSR1.TVSA also exhibited markedly prolonged ERK activation upon stimulation with EGF (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the prolonged ERK activation generated by KSR1.SA was dominant to the decreased ERK activation induced by KSR1.TV. Furthermore, combined mutation of Ser392 and Thr274 synergistically promoted sustained ERK activation upon treatment with either EGF or PDGF. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of KSR1 on Thr274 and Ser392 can modulate the time course of ERK activation in response to specific growth factors.Phosphorylation of KSR1 Modulates S-phase Entry—In fibroblasts, sustained ERK activation allows quiescent cells to re-enter the cell cycle, whereas transient ERK activation does not (7Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar, 9Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Thr274 and Ser392 on KSR1 is important for modulating the duration of ERK activation (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, the ability of KSR1 phosphorylation to regulate S-phase entry was measured by BrdUrd incorporation into DNA.In comparison with untreated cells, fetal bovine serum and PDGF, but not EGF, were sufficient to promote S-phase entry in at least 90% of cells expressing ectopic KSR1 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Both KSR1.SA and KSR1.TV were similarly competent to promote cell cycle progression in the presence of serum. KSR1.SA expression caused S phase entry in 85% of cells treated with PDGF and in 40% of cells treated with EGF. In comparison with control cells, EGF and PDGF had minimal ability to induce S phase entry in cells expressing KSR1.TV (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Mutation of KSR1 phosphorylation sites regulates S-phase entry. Quiescent KSR1–/– MEFs expressing ectopic KSR1, KSR1.TV, KSR1.SA, or KSR1.TVSA were treated with EGF, PDGF, or serum for 20 h in the presence of BrdUrd (BrdU). DNA synthesis was detected by immunofluorescence using an anti-BrdUrd antibody and by counterstaining all nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. More than 100 cells were scored in each experiment to determine the percentage of BrdUrd-positive nuclei. The data represent mean values ± standard deviation for three independent trials. FBS, fetal bovine serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further investigate the role of KSR1 phosphorylation in mediating cell cycle progression, we assayed S-phase entry in cells expressing KSR1.TVSA. PDGF treatment of KSR1–/– MEFs expressing KSR1.TVSA was sufficient to promote cell cycle progression (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Upon expression of KSR1.TVSA, EGF treatment also induced S phase entry in 76% of cells. Thus, combined mutation of Ser392 and Thr274 in KSR1 conferred a PDGF-like response to cells treated with EGF. These data indicate that KSR1 phosphorylation can modulate growth factor-induced cell cycle progression by regulating the duration of ERK activation.KSR1 Phosphorylation Regulates Cell Proliferation—To determine whether KSR1 phosphorylation also regulates mitogenesis in cultured cells, we assessed proliferation rates of KSR1–/– MEFs expressing KSR1 or KSR1 phosphorylation mutants. KSR1.SA induced a modest increase in proliferation rate as compared with wild-type KSR1 (Fig. 4A). However, cells expressing KSR1.TVSA showed a 2-fold increase in proliferation rate during log-phase growth as compared with wild-type KSR1 and grew to an increased density (Fig. 4A). Expression of KSR1.TV alone slowed proliferation slightly in comparison with wild-type KSR1, consistent with its inhibitory effects on ERK activation. These data indicate that the phosphorylation of KSR1 on Ser392 and Thr274 is an important regulator of the proliferative potential of a cell.Fig. 4KSR1 phosphorylation regulates cell proliferation and transformation.A, KSR1–/– MEFs expressing ectopic KSR1 (closed circles), KSR1.TV (open triangles), KSR1.SA (closed triangles), or KSR1.TVSA (open circles) were seeded at 25,000 cells/well. Cells in triplicate wells were isolated by trypsin digestion on successive days after plating and counted using a Beckman Coulter counter. Cell numbers are plotted as the average ± standard deviation of three trials. B, KSR1–/– MEFs expressing ectopic KSR1 or KSR1.TVSA at increasing levels, as indicated by Western blot, were plated in soft agar to assess anchorage-independent growth. Colonies were grown for 3 weeks and then counted. Numbers of colonies (per 5000 cells plated) are plotted as the average ± the standard deviation of three trials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)KSR1 Phosphorylation Regulates Oncogenic Transformation—KSR1–/– MEFs are resistant to oncogenic transformation by activated RasV12, but reintroduction of wild-type KSR1 rescues the transformation defect in a dose-dependent manner"
https://openalex.org/W2055331020,"Activation of CXCR2 IL-8 receptor leads to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and rapid receptor endocytosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments showed that arrestin and CXCR2 form complexes with components of the ERK1/2 cascade following ligand stimulation. However, in contrast to the activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor, arrestin was not necessary for ERK1/2 phosphorylation or receptor endocytosis. In contrast, β-arrestin 1/2 double knockout cells showed greatly enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, as well as phosphorylation of the stress kinases p38 and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase. The stimulation of stress kinases in arrestin double knockout cells could be attenuated in the presence of diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase, suggesting that reactive oxidant species (ROS) participated in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. ROS could indeed be detected in IL-8-stimulated β-arrestin 1/2 knockout cells, and cytoplasmic Rac was translocated to the membrane fraction, which is a prerequisite for oxidant formation. The oxidative burst induced cell death within 6 h of IL-8 stimulation of these cells, which could be prevented in the presence of DPI. These results indicate a novel function for arrestin, which is protection from an excessive oxidative burst, resulting from the sustained stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors that cause Rac translocation.

Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). In the G-protein pathway GPCR activation by agonist leads to replacement of GDP on the Gα subunit by GTP, which results in the dissociation of the α subunit from the β,γ dimer. Both subunits are capable to activate numerous signaling cascades including phospholipase C and adenyl cyclase. The activated receptors are quickly phosphorylated by GPCR kinases, which increase the affinity of the receptors for β-arrestin. β-Arrestin binding to the GPCR leads to the termination of the interaction of the receptor with its respective G-protein (2Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) thereby arresting G-protein-mediated signaling. However, GPCRs coupled to arrestins can signal in a G-protein-independent fashion leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) (3DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S.

Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These kinase cascades assemble as complexes with β-arrestin and GPCRs. The ubiquitously expressed ERK1/2, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, are important cellular regulators (7Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). They can be activated by a variety of extracellular signals including growth factors, phospholipids, cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters, mediating a wide spectrum of cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, differentiation, movement, and angiogenesis (8Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 activation occurs through dual phosphorylation on a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif within the activation loop by upstream kinases (9Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 signaling pathway consists of a three kinase module comprised of a MAPK (ERK1/2), a MAPK activator (MAPK/ERK kinase, MEK), and a MEK activator (MEK kinase, MEKK), which are sequentially phosphorylated. Although ERK activation by GPCRs is often a Ras-dependent event, additional pathways can be involved. These vary for different receptors and occasionally cell type, and may be initiated by PKA, PKC, through protein-tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGF receptor, Src, FAK), or direct interaction with the β-arrestin scaffold (10Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Similar MAPK cascades consist of the stress-activated p38 and JNK (11Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). In addition to its complex formation with signaling cascades arrestin also associates with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP-2, which target the GPCR into coated pits and leads to endocytosis of the receptor (12Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor β-arrestin is absolutely necessary for receptor internalization (13Kohout T.A. Lin F.T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar), and internalization of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor is largely inhibited in the absence of arrestin (13Kohout T.A. Lin F.T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of β-arrestin in receptor internalization is not universal; for instance arrestin is not required in endocytosis of the N-formyl peptide receptor (14Vines C.M. Revankar C.M. Maestas D.C. LaRusch L.L. Cimino D.F. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Prossnitz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 169: 41581-41584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CXCR2 receptor, which is activated by IL-8 and gro-α, is a GPCR primarily coupled to Gi (15Murphy P.M. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), and is expressed by neutrophils, monocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, some fibroblasts, and cancer cells. It is rapidly internalized following receptor activation (16Luan J. Shattuck-Brandt R. Haghnegahdar H. Own J.D. Strieter R. Burdick M. Nirodi C. Beauchamp D. Johnson K.N. Richmond A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in a process that involves dynamin (17Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and AP-2 (18Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and therefore appears to involve clathrin-coated pits. However, a truncated receptor, which is not phosphorylated, and hence should have a low affinity for arrestin is normally internalized (18Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which raises the question whether arrestin plays a role during endocytosis of CXCR2. Here we show that CXCR2 forms complexes with arrestin, but that these complexes are not necessary for receptor internalization or ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, MAPK activation was enhanced in β-arrestin 1/2 double knockout cells to the point, where cells responded with cell death rather than cell proliferation. CXCR2 is one of a number of Gi-coupled GPCRs on neutrophils, which include CXCR1, the formyl peptide receptor, and C5a receptor. These last three receptors are all important for neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and in vivo. The physiological role of CXCR2 on these cells is, however not clear. Neutrophils clearly express functional CXCR2 receptors, which respond to stimulation with calcium mobilization, actin polymerization, and moderate enzyme release (19Schumacher C. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 10542-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but show little effect on activation pathways important for the immune surveillance functions of the neutrophil. Stimulation of neutrophilic CXCR2 neither supports chemotaxis (20Hammond M.E.W. Lapointe G.R. Feucht P.H. Hilt S. Gallegos C.A. Gordon C.A. Giedlin M.A. Mullenbach G. Tekamp-Olsen P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433PubMed Google Scholar), nor does it cause a respiratory burst (21Jones S.A. Wolf M. Qin S. Mackay C.R. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There is no good explanation for this behavior other than that the rate of phosphorylation, which can be detected within seconds of stimulation, and consequent uncoupling from the G-protein may supercede the rate of assembly of the NADPH oxidase complexes. While the NADPH oxidase system is best described in neutrophils (22Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), adherent cell types including endothelial and epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts can produce intracellular oxidants following receptor activation (23Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 24Li W.-G. Miller Jr., F.J. Zhang H.J. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Weintraub N.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6913-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although some of the components of these NADPH oxidase systems differ from those of the neutrophilic complexes (26Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), activation of all these systems depends on translocation of Rac from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane (27Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and activation of a flavin-dependent membrane-bound cytochrome, which is inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) (28Cross A.R. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Stimulation of various cell types expressing CXCR2 (neutrophils and microvascular endothelial cells, which express CXCR2 constitutively, NIH3T3 cells and HEK293 cells transfected with CXCR2) failed to respond with a respiratory burst (21Jones S.A. Wolf M. Qin S. Mackay C.R. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). 2I. U. Schraufstatter and M. Burger, unpublished observation. However, in β-arrestin1/2 double knockout fibroblasts stimulation with IL-8 caused a pronounced intracellular respiratory burst, which was responsible for later cell death. It therefore appears that arrestin is instrumental in suppressing or terminating activation of the respiratory burst in cells expressing CXCR2. Materials—Raf-1 kinase inhibitor and DPI were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-c-Raf, anti-MEK, anti-GFP, anti-β-arrestin 2, and anti-Rac1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antiphospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, antiphospho-p38, anti-p38, antiphospho-JNK, and anti-Myc antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Protein A beads were from Amersham Biosciences (Arlington Heights, IL). [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). IL-8 and SDF-1 were expressed and purified from transformed Escherichia coli cells as described before (29Schraufstatter I.U. Barrett D.S. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6418-6428PubMed Google Scholar). In short, cDNA encoding human SDF-1 was expressed in E. coli strain HMS7DE3 using the pET15b vector (Novagen/EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). After purification using immobilized metal ion chromatography, the oligohistidine leash was excised with thrombin, and the protein purified further using CM-Sephadex. Plasmid Constructs—CXCR2 in pSFFV.neo was described before (30Schraufstatter I.U. Burger M. Hoch R.C. Oades Z.G. Takamori H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GFP-fused CXCR2 was created by inserting CXCR2 cDNA 5′ to GFP into the EcoRI/KpnI restriction sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). Plasmids expressing CXCR4-GFP and β-arrestin 2-GFP fusion proteins were kindly provided by Dr. L. Chen (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine, San Diego). Expression vectors encoding red fluorescence protein (RFP)-tagged ERK2, Myc-c-Raf-1, and β-arrestin 2-FLAG were generously provided by Dr. L. Luttrell (Duke University). DNA encoding dominant-negative β-arrestin 2 (β-arrestin319-418) was a gift from Dr. E. Prossnitz (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque). Kinase-inactive c-Raf-1 mutant (K375M) was obtained from Dr. G. Romero (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293, human embryonic kidney epithelial cells, and SYF cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are immortalized triple knockouts for Src/Yes/Fyn (31Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) (both from ATCC), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Stable cells lines were selected with 800 μg/ml of G418. RBL2H3 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation as described (30Schraufstatter I.U. Burger M. Hoch R.C. Oades Z.G. Takamori H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and similarly selected with G418. MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) β-arrestin 1/2 knockout cells as well as β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 single knockout MEFs and the wild-type parental cell line, were obtained from Dr. R. Lefkowitz (Duke University) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000. All cells were serum-starved overnight prior to IL-8 or SDF-1 stimulation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, monolayer cells were stimulated as described in the figure legends, then lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm NaF) and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with primary antibodies for2hat4 °C, followed by capture of the immunocomplexes with protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The bound proteins were analyzed with immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, the clarified cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 3% dry milk in TBS-Tween, and exposed to specific primary antibodies as described for each experiment. Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Phosphoblots were re-probed with a second antibody, e.g. anti-ERK1/2 antibody to assure equal loading. Subcellular Fractionation—For the isolation of membrane fractions, cells were stimulated for the indicated times and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) by sonication. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min and the pellets were washed once. Supernatant fractions (cytoplasm) and pellet fractions (membranes) were separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels. To isolate nuclear fractions, cells were vortexed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, then microcentrifuged at highest speed for 2 min. The pellets were washed with buffer A, then resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4,1mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated on ice for 15 min followed by another 2 min centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatants (nuclear fraction) were transferred to clean tubes containing 5× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Raf Kinase Assay—Washed c-Raf immunoprecipitates were suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm ATP) containing 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.4 μg of purified kinase-inactive MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnologies), and then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling, followed by separation on SDS polyacrylamide gels, gel transfer, and autoradiography. To assess equal loading, membranes were probed with anti-c-Raf antibody and stained with the ECL kit. Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, HEK 293 cells grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips were transiently cotransfected with different combination of plasmids as described in the figure legends. After stimulation with 100 nm IL-8 or SDF-1 for the times indicated at 37 °C, cells were fixed for 25 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with AntiFade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Z-stack images were taken on a Leica DM Erbe microscope (Leitz, Bannockburne, IL) connected with an ORCA camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and deconvoluted using Openlab 3.1.5 software (Improvision, Boston, MA). To detect apoptosis an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining kit was used (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions and green-versus red-stained cells were counted under a fluorescent microscope. Detection of Intracellular Oxidant Formation—Two methods were used to detect intracellular oxidant formation. First, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT, Sigma) was added at 1 mg/ml at the time of addition of IL-8, which leads to the formation of blue formazan in the presence of(O2−)(32Woodman R.C. Newburger P.E. Anklesaria P. Erickson R.W. Rae J. Cohen M.S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1995; 85: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Second, membranes were prepared as described (33Pagano P.J. Clark J.K. Cifuentes-Pagano M.E. Clark S.M. Callis G.M. Quinn M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 14483-14488Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and H2O2 production was detected with the Amplex Red reagent (Molecular Probes). In short, serum-starved β-arrestin 1/2 knockout cells were stimulated for 10 min ± 100 nm IL-8 in the presence or absence of DPI, trypsinized, centrifuged through serum-containing medium at 4 °C, and resuspended in 400 μl of 340 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.1, 2 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The samples were sonicated on ice (4 × 15 s), and ultracentrifuged as described above. The pellets were rinsed twice with sucrose buffer, and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of sucrose buffer and homogenized with a Teflon pestle. The protein content was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce), and 10-15 μg of protein were used for each assay. H2O2 formation was detected with the Amplex red reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of horseradish peroxidase and in the presence or absence of 1 mm NADPH. Fluorescence intensities at 530 nm excitation, 590 nm emission were measured on 100-μl duplicates in a 96-well plate warmed to 37 °C. Measurements were made at 10-min intervals for 30 min using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroscan, Packard, Meriden, CT). IL-8-mediated Translocation of Arrestin and ERK1/2 Cascade Components in Cells Expressing CXCR2—Since arrestin translocation plays an important role in MAPK activation and endocytosis of a number of GPCRs (34Pierce K. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we asked whether activation of CXCR2 caused translocation of arrestin and the components of the MAPK cascade to the plasma membrane. As expected, arrestin, and the kinases c-Raf and MEK, were translocated to the membrane fraction of CXCR2-expressing cells following stimulation with IL-8 (Fig. 1A). This translocation of arrestin was seen in HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 1A) as well as in RBL2H3, rat basophilic leukemia cells (Fig. 1B), transfected with wild-type CXCR2. For comparison the same experiment was repeated in CXCR4-expressing cells, which showed only a rather subtle translocation of the same components to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). Activation of MAPK—Arrestin translocation has been shown to play an important role in MAPK activation of many GPCRs, e.g. the β2-adrenergic receptor (35Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), the AT1a-angiotensin receptor (36Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) thrombin receptor (37Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M.D. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (M300573200)Google Scholar). Therefore MAPK phosphorylation was assessed in CXCR2-expressing cells stimulated with IL-8. IL-8 was found to induce a robust, but transient ERK1/2 activation in all cells types tested (HEK293, RBL2H3, and SYF cells) (Fig. 2A), which was maximal around 2 min of stimulation. This activation did not depend on Src activity as it did not appear decreased in SYF cells, which are deficient of Src, Yes, and Fyn. Although activation of CXCR2 can cause transactivation of the EGF receptor (38Schraufstatter I.U. Trieu K. Zhao M. Rose D.M. Terkeltaub R.A. Burger M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6714-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), this pathway played only a minor role in signaling to ERK1/2, and inhibition of the EGF receptor with AG1478 showed no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (results not shown). In contrast, the ERK1/2 response was almost entirely inhibited by a Raf-1 kinase inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Kinase-deficient Raf (Raf K375M) similarly attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Involvement of c-Raf could further be shown directly in Raf activity assay, in which MEK1 is phosphorylated in the presence of activated c-Raf (Fig. 2C). Since c-Raf has been shown to be part of multicomponent complexes formed between the MAPK cascade, arrestin, and some GPCRs, we next asked whether this was the case for CXCR2. Coimmunoprecipitation and Colocalization of CXCR2, Arrestin, and Components of the MAPK Cascade—Since activation of the Raf/MAPK cascade has been shown to be mediated through complex formation with arrestin, e.g. in the β2-adrenergic receptor system (1Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar), we determined whether IL-8 would induce similar complexes. For this purpose, HEK293 cells expressing CXCR2-GFP were transiently transfected with β-arrestin 2-FLAG, Myc-c-Raf, and ERK2-RFP expression plasmids. After stimulation with IL-8, the amount of ERK2 and c-Raf in complex with β-arrestin 2 and CXCR2 increased considerably as shown in Fig. 3, A and B, and a high level of phosphorylation of ERK2 was detected in the complexes. This could be shown by immunoprecipitation with either an antibody, which recognizes the FLAG tag fused to arrestin (Fig. 3A) or an antibody that recognizes GFP, which is fused to CXCR2 (Fig. 3B). Similarly, components of the ERK cascade could be coimmunoprecipitated with GFP- or FLAG-arrestin following IL-8 stimulation of the untagged CXCR2, indicating that it was specific for the receptor and not a function of the GFP (Fig. 3C). These results provide strong evidence that CXCR2 stimulation causes recruitment of complexes consisting of β-arrestin, c-Raf, and ERK2, in which arrestin appears to function as a scaffold for signal transduction. As shown in Fig. 3D, the absence of ERK2 had no effect on the association of c-Raf with β-arrestin 2, whereas c-Raf expression significantly enhanced the precipitation of phospho-ERK2 with β-arrestin 2. Raf kinase inhibitor or dominant-negative c-Raf mutant both attenuated the complex formation (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that ERK2 activation and association with β-arrestin 2 depended on c-Raf, and that the interaction of c-Raf with β-arrestin 2 facilitated ERK2 activation, suggesting an integral role of c-Raf in these complexes, which was compatible with the fact that Raf-1 inhibitor almost totally blocked IL-8 induced ERK1/2 activation (see Fig. 2B). Complex formation could also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy of cells transfected with CXCR2-GFP, β-arrestin 2, and ERK2-RFP or with CXCR2, β-arrestin 2-GFP, and ERK2-RFP. In unstimulated cells CXCR2-GFP was located in the plasma membrane, GFP-fused arrestin homogeneously in the cytoplasm and ERK2-RFP homogeneously in the cytoplasm and to a lesser extent in the nucleus (results not shown). Following stimulation with IL-8, co-localization between CXCR2 and ERK2 or between β-arrestin 2 and ERK2 could be detected in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 3E.) These findings together with previous reports showing that GPCR-arrestin complexes are essential for MAPK activation (10Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), suggested that arrestin played an integral role in CXCR2-mediated MAPK activation. One known function of β-arrestin in complex with seven transmembrane receptors and components of the MAPK cascade, is to retain these complexes in the cytoplasm rather than to allow translocation of MAPK to the nucleus, where it induces transcriptional activation (36Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, in CXCR2-expressing cells a major fraction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation following stimulation with IL-8 was detected in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3F). So the function of CXCR2-mediated ERK1/2 nuclear translocation remains to be investigated. MAPK Activa"

In the original study, expression of a truncated version of ADAM12, lacking the prodomain and metalloprotease domain, was found to stimulate muscle-cell fusion in cultured C2C12 cells, whereas full-length ADAM12 inhibited the fusion process (25Yagami-Hiromasa T.

It was demonstrated later that ADAM12 overexpression in C2C12 cells induced a quiescence-like phenotype and that the cell-adhesion domains and cytoplasmic tail were required for mediating cell cycle arrest (31Cao Y.

However, little is known about the regulation of ADAM12 activation and translocation to the cell surface. Herein, we report that PKCϵ, a novel PKC isoform (34Ivaska J. Kermorgant S. Whelan R. Parsons M. Ng T. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 90-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induces the translocation of ADAM12 to the cell surface in a manner that is dependent on its catalytic activity. Cell Lines and Antibodies—The following cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection: human myoblastic rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD), breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7), African green monkey cells (COS-7), and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOK1). For all cell lines, except CHO-K1 cells, we used Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with GlutaMAX I, 4500 mg/l glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS (Invitrogen). CHO-K1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium with the same supplements. Differentiation of RD cells was induced in confluent cultures by substituting 10% FBS with 2% horse serum in otherwise complete growth medium. MCF-7 cells expressing full-length ADAM12 under a tetracycline-regulated system were generated according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences Clontech). In brief, ADAM12 full-length cDNA was subcloned into the SalI/EcoRV sites of a pTet-On regulatory plasmid. The resulting constructs were transfected into MCF-7 cells using electroporation in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin and 1 μg/ml tetracycline, both obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Vallensbaek, Denmark). The transfected MCF-7 cells were grown in medium (see above) containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline. In some experiments, cells were treated for 15 min with 0.1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem), 0.1 μm calphostin C (Calbiochem), or no additive. Antibodies against ADAM12 included mouse mAbs 6E6, 6C10, 8F8, and 4G2. To generate these mAbs, full-length recombinant human ADAM12 was produced in 293 cells, purified, and then used to immunize mice. Polyclonal antisera to human ADAM12 included rb122 raised against the recombinant cysteine-rich domain and rb134 raised against purified full-length recombinant ADAM12. Rabbit anti-human PKCα, -δ, and -ϵ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody recognizing MyoD (M3512) was obtained from DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark), antibodies to myosin (fast skeletal muscle) were from Sigma-Aldrich, and the monoclonal antibodies to actin (mAb 1501R) and desmin (M724) were from Chemicon (Hampshire, UK) and DakoCytomation, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies to vinculin were generously provided by M. Glukhova (Institut Curie, Paris, France). Control mouse IgG, goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase, goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase, swine anti-rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate, swine anti-rabbit-TRITC, and rabbit anti-mouse-TRITC were obtained from DakoCytomation. Goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa-546 was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate and mouse anti-GFP antibody (clone JL-8) were purchased from BD Biosciences (Brøndby, Denmark). The mouse monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody (clone 9E10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemical. Transient Transfection Assays—Cells were transfected using Fu-Gene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostic), or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed 1 or 2 days later. Full-length ADAM12 or vector control cDNA was transfected into CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells for use as positive or negative controls, respectively, in Western blot and immunostaining experiments. For positive controls in FACS experiments, CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding full-length ADAM12 or ADAM12-Δcyt, a membrane-inserted ADAM12 protein lacking the cytoplasmic tail (35Hougaard S. Loechel F. Xu X. Tajima R. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RD cells were transiently transfected using cDNA constructs encoding EGFP-tagged full-length PKC isoforms α, δ, and ϵ (PKCαFL-E, PKCδFL-E, PKCϵFL-E, respectively); EGFP-tagged PKCϵ catalytic domain (PKCϵCD-E) or regulatory domain (PKCϵRD-E) (36Zeidman R.

Cell. Signalling. 2004; 16: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and C2 subdomains (PKCϵC2-myc) generated by inserting the BglII/SalI fragment from PKCϵC2-EGFP (36Zeidman R. Lofgren B. Pahlman S. Larsson C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in BamHI/XhoI-digested pcDNA4-myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen); EGFP-tagged myristoylated full-length PKCα (Myr-PKCα-E) or PKCϵ (Myr PKCϵ-E) (38Zeidman R. Troller U. Raghunath A. Pahlman S. Larsson C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); GFP-tagged, full-length PKCϵ (GFP-PKCϵFL); or kinase-inactive PKCϵ mutants K552M (GFP-PKCϵFL-K/M) or K438R (PKCϵFLKD-E) (39Ling M. Troller U. Zeidman R. Lundberg C. Larsson C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that both of these kinase-inactive PKCϵ mutants gave similar results, so for simplicity we used PKCϵ-KD to refer to these constructs. Myristoylated PKCϵKD-E is generated by inserting the BglII/SalI-excised fragment from PKCϵFLKD-E in the corresponding sites of our previously constructed MyrPKϵFL-E vector (38Zeidman R. Troller U. Raghunath A. Pahlman S. Larsson C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cellular Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—RD cells, with or without PMA treatment, and CHO cells transfected with full-length ADAM12 were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% deoxycholate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Molecular Biochemical)). The protein concentration of extracts was measured using the BCA protein assay kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Pierce Biotechnology), and samples were normalized for protein content. To detect desmin and actin expression, total RIPA extracts (50 μg total protein/well) were separated by 4-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoprecipitation, protein extracts were pre-incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of protein-G beads alone to reduce nonspecific protein binding. The lysates were further incubated overnight with 50 μl of protein-G prebound with ADAM12 mAbs 6E6, 6C10, and 8F8. After incubation of protein extracts with protein-G beads/mAbs or control IgG, the beads were centrifuged and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted in sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were analyzed by 8, 14, or 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were stained using ADAM12 polyclonal antisera (rb 122), PKC (α, δ, or ϵ), desmin, actin, GFP, or myc antibodies as the primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, respectively, as the secondary antibody. The SuperSignal Western blotting detection system (Pierce) was used for visualization. To enrich for membrane fractions, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then scraped into cold buffer A (16.8 mm HEPES pH 8.0, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.88 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and the protease inhibitor mixture described above), homogenized by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice, and then centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were centrifuged, the protein content was measured, and aliquots with equal amounts of protein were further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting membrane-enriched pellets were dissolved in RIPA buffer and used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. An equal amount of 2× sample buffer was added, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting for ADAM12 (rb 122), and PKCα, δ, and ϵ content. Flow Cytometry—ADAM12 mAbs (clones 6E6 and 4G2) were biotinylated using EZ-link N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and allowed to recover for 5 min at 37 °C in growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS, then transferred to ice and washed twice in ice-cold washing buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were incubated with biotinylated 6E6 and 4G2 mAbs or isotype control Ab. After 20 min at 4 °C, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed twice with washing buffer. Cells were further incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by two washes. Cells were finally resuspended in 300 μl of washing buffer for flow cytometric analyses performed according to standard settings on a FACStar PLUS flow cytometer with CELLQUEST software (both from BD Biosciences). Cell Attachment Assays—Cell attachment assays were performed as described previously (18Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J.

In brief, MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc International) were coated (overnight at 4 °C) with 10 μg/ml of the IgG fraction of polyclonal anti-ADAM12 Ab (rb134) and the corresponding preimmune IgG in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.5.

The methylation has been implicated in transcriptional regulation and RNA and protein trafficking and signal transduction, but the mechanism by which these functions are achieved has remained undetermined. We show here that the predominant arginine methyltransferase in human cells, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), is associated with hnRNP complexes, dependent on the methylation status of the cell, and that it methylates its preferred substrates in situ.

More than 85% of the methylation of these substrates is catalyzed by PRMT1, the predominant protein arginine methyltransferase in human cells, which is located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (5Pawlak M.R.

PRMT1 is a type I methyltransferase that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to guanidino nitrogens of arginine residues to form monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (for review, see Ref. 9McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Other type I methyltransferases, such as PRMT3, -4, -6, and -7 have also been identified in higher eukaryotes, but not in yeast, and are characterized by differences in substrate specificity and subcellular localization (8Frankel A.

Recently, disruption of the Prmt1 gene in mice has shown that PRMT1 plays an essential and nonredundant role, as Prmt1–/– embryos die shortly after implantation, and ES cells derived from these embryos are defective in their ability to differentiate in vitro (5Pawlak M.R.

Biochem. 2002; 87: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, these ES cells are viable and able to assemble apparently normal hnRNP complexes, suggesting that arginine methylation is not required for vital processes under cell culture conditions. This is consistent with findings in yeast, where disruption of the only known arginine methyltransferase, RMT1, does also not affect cell viability (15Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Studies on known substrates reveal that PRMT1 preferentially methylates arginine residues in an RG or RGG context, a common feature of RNA-binding proteins, suggesting that methylation might modulate protein-RNA or protein-protein interactions (1Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This might then affect a variety of functions such as signal transduction, protein trafficking, or transcriptional regulation. In fact, methylation of the transcription factor Stat1 suppresses interactions with its inhibitory protein PIAS1 and thereby enhances Stat1-driven transcription (17Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In addition, PRMT1 and also PRMT4/CARM1 act as transcriptional co-activators, e.g. of nuclear hormone receptors, most probably because they methylate histones H3 and H4 and thereby facilitate histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling (10Chen D.

Importantly, PRMT1 has been found to interact physically with several proteins, such as the interferon α,β-receptor (22Altschuler L. Wook J.O. Gurari D. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Abramovich C. Yakobson B. Chebath J. Revel M.

Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is not clear in all cases whether PRMT-interacting proteins are also substrates that are methylated by PRMT1 or whether binding to PRMT1 itself has as regulatory role independent of the enzymatic activity. Even though several different functional consequences of arginine methylation have been described, the precise biological or biochemical role of arginine methylation has not been determined. One major problem concerns the finding that arginine methylation appears to be both constitutive and irreversible. The constitutively high activity of PRMT1, as well as the apparent lack of an arginine demethylase to remove the methyl group again, is difficult to reconcile with a dynamic role in signaling, as classical signals depend on transience. Indeed, most known substrates appear to be extensively methylated, with no detectable regulation (14Pawlak M.R. Banik-Maiti S. Pietenpol J.A. Ruley H.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This does not rule out that some proteins may exist in a hypomethylated state, e.g. because they are bound to other proteins that inhibit methylation due to steric hindrance, and only become methylated in response to different physiological stimuli. Up to now, however, no such proteins have been reported. It will therefore be important to investigate more substrate proteins with regard to the level of their methylation in vivo, and potential differences of the methylation status in different cell types and under different conditions. In the present article, we have investigated the methylation of scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A). SAF-A is a multifunctional nucleic acid-binding protein that interacts with both DNA and RNA in vivo (26Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Gohring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because of the specific interaction with putative architectural DNA elements in the genome, the so-called scaffold attachment regions, the protein has been implicated in higher order chromatin structure and in the functional architecture of the cell nucleus (28Romig H. Fackelmayer F.O. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3431-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interaction of SAF-A with RNA polymerase II, transcription factors such as the glucocorticoid hormone receptor, and the histone acetylase CBP/p300 has indicated a role in the regulation of gene expression (32Tang Y.

Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, a subpopulation of SAF-A is present in hnRNP particles, suggesting that the protein might also be involved in RNA maturation and transport. On the basis of these experiments, the protein is also known as hnRNP-U (38Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We show here that SAF-A physically interacts with PRMT1 and is methylated by its enzymatic activity. Using a novel methylation-sensitive antibody, we demonstrate that SAF-A is present in fully methylated state in cell lines from a multitude of different origins. These findings are compatible with a role of arginine methylation in protein structure, or “labeling,” rather than a dynamic role in signaling processes. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment with Periodate-oxidized Adenosine—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultivated on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were split 1:5 every second day. All cell lines used for the experiment shown in Fig. 6 were kept under conditions recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells were passaged the day before transfection, and transfection was performed with polyethylenimine as described previously (39Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency as determined by fluorescent cell sorting was routinely between 25 and 30%. Stable cell lines expressing SAF-A: Myc were created by selection with G418 for 5 weeks. For inhibition of methylation and preparation of hypomethylated cell extract, the medium of HEK293 cells was supplemented with 15 μm periodate-oxidized adenosine (adenosine-2′-3′-dialdehyde, Sigma A7154), and cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before harvesting. Preparation of Total Cell Extract—Cells were harvested by scraping off the culture dishes with a rubber policeman after two washes with PBS and collected by centrifugation (200 × g, 5min). For the preparation of hypomethylated extract, cells were resuspended in water and disrupted by sonication. Extract for immunoprecipitation was prepared by resuspending cells in lysis buffer (1.5× PBS, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), incubating them on ice for 5 min, and clearing by centrifugation for 15 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at full speed. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Immunofluorescence— For immunoprecipitation, cell extract from 1–5 × 106 cells was supplemented with 5 μg of antibodies against SAF-A (26Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or the Myc tag (clone 9B11, Cell Signaling) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for an additional hour. Immune complexes were washed thoroughly eight times before bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western blotting was performed as described previously (26Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) using antibodies against SAF-A and hnRNP-C (a generous gift from Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss, Philadelphia) or commercially available antibodies against the Myc tag as described above, the protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1, -3, -5, and -6 (Upstate Biotechnology 07-404, 07-256, and 07-405 and Imgenex IMG-506, respectively), or asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (Upstate Biotechnology ASYM24 or SYM10, respectively). For detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) were used. A methylation-sensitive antibody against SAF-A was developed by injecting rabbits with the synthetic peptide CRGNYNQNFRGRGNNRG, corresponding to amino acid residues 778–793 in wild type SAF-A, plus a single cysteine residue added to the amino terminus for purification and immobilization on thiopropyl-Sepharose (29Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Sera from different animals were tested, and a methylation-sensitive antibody, designated A232, was affinity-purified over immobilized peptide. Immunofluorescence was performed on periodate-oxidized adenosine (Adox)-treated and untreated HEK293 cells, using either the antibody K371 against total SAF-A or the methylation-sensitive antibody A232 in concentrations of 1:300 for 1 h at 37 °C. Alexa568-coupled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used for fluorescence detection. Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Native total cell extract was prepared as described for immunoprecipitation and layered over a 10–30% glycerol gradient (in lysis buffer) in a Beckman SW41 tube. The gradient was spun at 4 °C for 20 h at 25,000 rpm, optimized for 40 S hnRNP particles sedimenting in the middle of the gradient, and fractionated in 0.5-ml aliquots from the top. Aliquots of each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or detected by Western blotting. Purification of Recombinant PRMT1 and PRMT2 and Methylation Reactions—Vectors for bacterial expression of GST-fused PRMT1 and PRMT2 were kindly provided by Dr. Harvey Herschman (UCLA, Los Angeles) and Dr. Michael Henry (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Stratford, NJ). Recombinant PRMTs and GST were purified from transformed Escherichia coli (strain BL21RIL, Stratagene) by affinity chromatography over glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (40Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using the soluble protein fraction of enzyme from bacteria permeabilized with B-Per (Pierce). This fraction contained ∼10% of the expressed PRMT proteins, whereas the vast majority present in inclusion bodies was discarded; in contrast, GST was quantitatively recovered from the soluble fraction. All purified proteins showed the expected size in SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2 for purified PRMT1-GST) and were quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay. In addition, GST and GST fusion proteins were quantified by the CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) colorimetric assay for the enzymatic activity of the GST part of the fusion protein (41Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure the use of identical amounts of properly folded and active protein in comparative assays (e.g. in Figs. 2 and 5).Fig. 5A novel antibody against a cluster of potential methylation sites allows discriminating between methylated and unmethylated SAF-A. A, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 778 and 793 of SAF-A (wild type (wt) sequence, containing four potential methylation sites) and a mutated variant (mut) were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with a synthetic protein A-binding site and used for in vitro methylation assays with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine and recombinant PRMT1 and PRMT2. Enzymatic activity of the two PRMTs was monitored in parallel assays with hypomethylated cell lysate as substrate. Note that PRMT2 does not exhibit detectable methyltransferase activity on any tested substrate as described earlier (40Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and does also not methylate the SAF-A substrate. B, rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide of the wild type sequence and developed antibodies that detected unmethylated but not methylated SAF-A. Identical amounts of extracts from Adox-treated cells and untreated control cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with antibodies against total SAF-A (K371) or the synthetic peptide (A232). Note that A232 does not produce any signal on extract from untreated cells. An identical result was obtained for immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged SAF-A probed with either anti-Myc or the peptide antibody (right panel). C, unmethylated SAF-A was detected by immunofluorescence with A232 antibody in Adox treated cells (+Adox) but not untreated controls (–Adox). Note the identical subcellular localization of unmethylated (A232, +Adox) and methylated (K371, –Adox) SAF-A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For in vitro methylation, extract from hypomethylated cells was pretreated at 70 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous methyltransferases and then centrifuged for 10 min at full speed. The supernatant was adjusted to 1× PBS (final concentrations: 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 12.7 mm K2HPO4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.5) by adding concentrated PBS stock solution and centrifuged again. Per reaction, 20 μl of extract was combined with 500 ng of recombinant PRMT and 5 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences TRK865, specific activity 2.96 TBq/mmol), and reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography with enHance reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Motivated by earlier studies reporting that the multifunctional nuclear protein SAF-A is subject to arginine methylation (1Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 42Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we began to study this modification of SAF-A in more detail, with the ultimate goal of understanding its functional role in vivo. With at least six active protein arginine methyltransferases known to be present in human cells (13Miranda T.B. Miranda M. Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22902-22907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we first sought to identify the methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of SAF-A. In an initial experiment, we performed immunoprecipitation of SAF-A and used commercially available antibodies against various PRMTs to identify potential interactions (Fig. 1). We found that only PRMT1, but not the other tested PRMTs 3, 5, and 6, could be co-precipitated with SAF-A, suggesting a physical linkage between SAF-A and PRMT1. However, as SAF-A is a component of hnRNP complexes and PRMT1 can also be co-precipitated with antibodies against hnRNP-C1/C2, the interaction between SAF-A and PRMT1 could be indirect via other hnRNP proteins (Fig. 1C). To investigate this possibility, we performed a far Western analysis, in which a protein sample is resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted to a membrane, renatured, and incubated with recombinant protein. After extensive washing, immunodetection of the recombinant protein revealed signals for each protein that has bound the “prey.” We immunoprecipitated endogenous SAF-A, together with the attached hnRNP proteins, and incubated the blot with recombinant PRMT1 (Fig. 2). Immunodetection with either anti-GST or anti-PRMT1 antibodies resulted in clearly detectable signals at the position of SAF-A, providing evidence for a direct interaction of SAF-A and PRMT1. No signal was obtained with GST protein alone, even when 10-fold more protein was used (Fig. 2A), or in mock immunoprecipitations with protein G-Sepharose alone (Fig. 2B). Thus, SAF-A and PRMT1 directly interact with each other in the hnRNP complex. With the possible exception of very weak additional signals in the far Western analysis, no evidence for binding of PRMT1 to other hnRNP proteins was found in these experiments. The direct interaction of PRMT1 with SAF-A suggests that PRMT1 is also the enzyme that is responsible for methylation of SAF-A, which is indeed the case. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitated SAF-A can be methylated in vitro by recombinant PRMT1 (Fig. 3A). In addition to SAF-A, coprecipitated hnRNP proteins are also methylated by PRMT1 in this reaction, demonstrating that these proteins are accessible to the enzyme in the native hnRNP complex. Moreover, endogenous PRMT1 co-precipitated with SAF-A is catalytically active both in trans and in cis. Methylation in trans is observed after the addition of hypomethylated extract from cells treated with Adox, a well characterized inhibitor of cellular methylation reactions (Fig. 3B, left panel). More interestingly, co-precipitated PRMT1 is also able to methylate SAF-A and other substrate proteins in cis, in the hnRNP particle, after the addition of radioactive S-adenosylmethionine only (Fig. 3B, right panel). Consistent with a methylation by PRMT1, immunoprecipitated SAF-A was recognized by an antibody against asymmetric, but not symmetric, dimethylarginine (data not shown). Even though hnRNP proteins are well known as the preferred substrates of PRMT1, we were surprised to see a stable protein interaction between hnRNP particles and the enzyme. To validate the result from our immunoprecipitations, we performed glycerol gradient centrifugation to prepare native 40 S hnRNP particles and tested for the presence of PRMT1 in these complexes (Fig. 4). Although we were able to detect a subpopulation of PRMT1 that co-sedimented with the hnRNP particle, confirming the immunoprecipitation experiments, its amount was quite small. This changed dramatically when the experiment was repeated with extracts from cells that had been pretreated with Adox to inhibit methylation. In these cells, a high amount of PRMT1 was found in association with the 40 S hnRNP particle and multimers thereof, whereas the amount of soluble PRMT1 was significantly reduced. We conclude that PRMT1 preferentially associates with the hypomethylated hnRNP complex by protein-protein interaction that is independent of the actual methylation reaction. Methylation by PRMT1 primarily occurs in amino acid sequences RG and RGG, of which 15 of 19 in total SAF-A are located in the carboxyl-terminal sixth of the protein. The most prominent clustering of such sites is present in the short region from amino acids 778 to 793 in SAF-A, where four RG sites are found within 16 residues (Fig. 5A, wt sequence). This peptide, when expressed in E. coli as a fusion with a synthetic protein A binding site (Fig. 5A, lower panel) or with maltose binding protein (not shown), effectively serves as an in vitro substrate for methylation by recombinant PRMT1 but not PRMT2, which served as a control. Methylation occurs only in this peptide but not the fusion partner, as a similar construct with the relevant arginine residues replaced by lysines is not methylated. This finding confirms that methylation of SAF-A is catalyzed by PRMT1, suggesting that the region between amino acids 778 and 793 of SAF-A might also be a target for PRMT1 in vivo. If this was the case, it should be possible to discriminate between methylated and unmethylated SAF-A by probing this region. We therefore created a polyclonal antibody against an (unmethylated) synthetic 16-mer peptide of the wild type sequence RGNYNQNFRGRGNNRG. Fig. 5B shows that the resulting antibody detects SAF-A in Adox-treated HEK293 cells but did not reveal any signal in extracts from untreated cells; in contrast, an antibody against total SAF-A gave identical signals for both extracts. Thus, the peptide antibody is methylation-sensitive and allows the detection of unmethylated SAF-A only. This is confirmed in immunofluorescence experiments, where the peptide antibody reacts only on Adox-treated cells but not on untreated controls (Fig. 5C). In addition, the immunofluorescence experiment also demonstrates that the subcellular localization of SAF-A is independent of its methylation status, as the nuclear staining pattern is identical for both antibodies. It is also important to note that the total amount of SAF-A is not changed after treatment of cells with the methylation inhibitor Adox. This suggests that methylation does not affect the stability of SAF-A and that there is also no up- or downregulation of SAF-A expression. Characterization of the antibody against unmethylated SAF-A revealed no signal in cultured HEK293 cells even after prolonged exposure. Thus, the amount of unmethylated SAF-A in these cells is undetectably small. We wondered whether SAF-A, which is a housekeeping protein present in all nucleated cells, is differently methylated in cells from different origins. This could provide insig"

Although the conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domains of the mDia1 and Bni1 formins can nucleate actin polymerization in vitro, the activity of other FH2 domains and the relationship between actin polymerization and microtubule reorganization have been controversial. We show that, similar to the mDia1 FH2 domain, the FH2 domains of mDia2 and ld are sufficient for SRF activation in vivo. We demonstrate that an mDia1 mutant defective for microtubule rearrangement in vivo is also defective in SRF activation in vivo as well as actin polymerization in vitro and that the mDia2 FH2 domain promotes actin polymerization in vitro. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we show that mDia1 is oligomeric in its inactive autoinhibited state in vivo, that the active mDia1 and mDia2 FH2 domains form homo- but not hetero-oligomers in vivo, and that oligomerization is abolished by inactivating FH2 deletion and point mutations. Nevertheless, inactive mDia1 FH2 domain mutants retain the ability to interfere with cellular mDia activity. Our results show that self-oligomerization is essential for SRF activation in vivo and F-actin assembly in vitro and provide strong support for recent structural models of the FH2 domain.

Our results show that self-oligomerization is essential for SRF activation in vivo and F-actin assembly in vitro and provide strong support for recent structural models of the FH2 domain. Formin proteins are involved in many cytoskeletal processes such as cytokinesis, actin cable and stress fiber formation, neurite outgrowth, and intracellular trafficking because of their ability to regulate F-actin assembly and microtubule organization (reviewed in Ref. 1Wallar B.J. Alberts A.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Their ability to promote F-actin assembly also allows them to control the transcription factor SRF whose coactivator MAL/MKL1 responds to G-actin level (2Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J.

Although the formin family is defined by two conserved formin homology (FH) 1The abbreviations used are: FH, formin homology; DRF, diaphanous-related formin; RBD, Rho-binding domain; DAD, diaphanous autoregulatory domain. domains, FH1 and FH2, additional conserved domains were found in a formin subfamily, the diaphanous-related formins (DRFs). In the DRFs, an N-terminal Rho-binding domain (RBD) and C-terminal diaphanous auto-regulatory domain (DAD) inhibit the activity of the FH1 and FH2 domains through a physical interaction, which is disrupted by Rho binding, whereas a poorly defined FH3 domain appears important for DRF subcellular localization (5Watanabe N.

The function of the DRF proteins has remained unclear until recently. The bundling of F-actin filaments to form stress fibers requires cooperation between mDia proteins and the ROCK family of Rho effector kinases (5Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Nakano K. Takaishi K. Kodama A. Mammoto A. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The relative roles of the DRF FH1 and FH2 domains in this process, however, have been controversial. The expression of mDia proteins alone is sufficient to induce F-actin assembly (10Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and cell-biological analysis suggested that the mDia1 and mDia2 FH1 domains were essential for this assembly, implicating Src homology 3-containing FH1 ligands such as IRSp53, Src family kinases, and profilin-actin in the process (8Nakano K.

Moreover, an analysis of mDia-induced cell polarization identified a clustered FH2 domain point mutation competent for F-actin formation but not microtubule reorganization, suggesting that these functions are independent (12Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, quantitative analysis of mDia function by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of F-actin assembly or SRF reporter gene activity showed that the mDia1 FH2 domain is sufficient to induce F-actin assembly in vivo and that inactivating FH2 mutations also disabled derivatives containing the FH1 domain (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, certain inactive mDia FH2 mutants retained the ability to interfere with signal-induced activation of endogenous or co-transfected mDia proteins, although the molecular basis for this has been unclear (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro analysis of the mDia and Bni1 DRFs showed that the FH2 domain was sufficient to nucleate F-actin assembly in vitro (14Pring M. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Zigmond S.H.

The relationship between DRF oligomerization and function in vivo has remained unclear, although certain monomeric mDia1 derivatives failed to promote actin polymerization but retained the ability to cap filament-barbed ends (19Shimada A.

In this study, we have extended our analysis of the FH2 domain using our quantitative SRF activation assay and actin polymerization assays in vitro. We show that the FH2 domain is the minimal functional unit of mDia2 and of formin itself and that the mDia1 point mutant defective in microtubule reorganization is both profoundly defective for F-actin assembly and exhibits significant filament capping activity. We demonstrate that mDia proteins form obligate homo-oligomers and that FH2 oligomerization is essential for F-actin assembly in vitro and SRF activation in vivo. The results show that the FH2 domain complexes previously observed in solution (14Pring M. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Zigmond S.H.

Finally, our results suggest that at least some interfering DRF derivatives work, not by forming inactive complexes with endogenous intact DRF proteins but by capping actin filaments. Plasmids, Transfections, SRF Reporter Assays—Transfections, SRF reporter assays, and proteins mDia1 F1F2, F1F2Δ1, F1F2ΔC2, FH2, and mDia2 ΔRBDΔFH1 were described previously (9Tominaga T. Sahai E.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Other FLAG- or Myc epitope-tagged mDia and formin derivatives (see figures) were expressed similarly. For protein expression, mDia fragments were expressed by pGEX-6p. mDia1 point mutations were: KA3, Lys989/Lys994/Lys999 → Ala; LRR762A, Leu762/Arg763/Arg764 → Ala; KK753A, Lys753/Lys754 → Ala; and W767A, Trp767 → Ala. Protein Purification and in Vitro Actin Assays—Glutathione S-transferase-mDia derivatives were purified as described previously (16Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C. Science. 2002; 297: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and recovered following cleavage with Prescission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). Actin polymerization assays were performed with pyrene-labeled actin monomers (Cytoskeleton) according to the supplied protocol. The critical concentration experiments were performed as described previously (15Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). 10 μm 5% pyrene-labeled actin was allowed to polymerize for 2 h at 25 °C and then was diluted to the indicated concentrations and incubated with 100 nm indicated proteins for 16 h at 25 °C. Fluorescence was monitored on a Spectromax M2 fluorometer (Molecular Devices) (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm). Immunoprecipitations—Transfected cells were maintained at 37 °C overnight in 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors), and kept on ice for 10 min. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (15 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C), and incubated with precoupled anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Equal volumes of the lysate and precipitated samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Quantification of Immunoblots—Cell lysates were prepared for luciferase assays as per the supplied protocol (Promega). Samples of the lysate were diluted in 4× Laemmli buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted following standard procedures. The blotted proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) and detected with peroxidase-coupled anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of the ECL signal was performed on a Kodak Image Station 440. To study FH2 function in more detail, we examined mDia1 FH2 point mutants in which clusters of highly conserved FH2 residues were converted to alanine (Fig. 1A). Mutants KK753A, LRR762A, and W767A removed residues in the N-terminal region of the FH2 domain previously shown to be required for FH2 function (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas mutant KA3 disrupted a conserved helix in its central region (12Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These proteins were transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, and their ability to activate the SRF-dependent reporter gene 3D.ALuc was evaluated. All of the point mutants were expressed at similar or higher levels than the parental construct (for example see Fig. 4, D and E). Each of the three N-terminal point mutations completely inactivated the parental mDia1 F1F2 protein in the SRF activation assay (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the KA3 mutation also effectively abolished SRF activation by mDia1 F1F2 (Fig. 1A), even though this mutant has been reported not to affect F-actin assembly (12Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).Fig. 4FH2 oligomerization is required for FH2 function.

E, FH2 point mutants disrupt hetero-oligomerization with the wild-type mDia1 FH2 domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A previous study of mDia2, a protein highly related to mDia1, has suggested that both its FH1 and FH2 domains are required for SRF activation and F-actin reorganization (9Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Therefore, we directly compared functional domains in the two proteins using a series of mDia2 derivatives analogous to our original mDia1 mutants (Fig. 1B). As with mDia1, mDia2 F1F2, which contains the mDia2 FH1 and FH2 domains, strongly activated the SRF reporter and, as reported previously, an mDia2 derivative retaining the FH3 and FH2 domains but lacking FH1 was virtually inactive in the SRF assay (Fig. 1B) (9Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as with mDia1, the expression of the isolated mDia2 FH2 domain was sufficient to induce potent SRF activation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, as with mDia1, deletions that impinged upon the integrity of the mDia2 FH2 domain completely inactivated the protein, even when FH1 was present (Fig. 1B). Thus, the FH1 domain is not required for SRF activation in vivo by either mDia1 or mDia2, and the FH2 domain represents the minimal domain required for SRF activation. However, in the case of mDia2, sequences in FH3 act to constrain activity of the FH2 domain (see “Discussion”). To further confirm the general applicability of our observations, we also examined the ability of the expression of the FH1 and FH2 domains of the prototype formin, the mouse limb deformity protein (ld), to activate SRF. The expression of the ld FH1/FH2 domains also activated SRF, albeit to a significantly lower level than the mDia proteins (Fig. 1C). We used the SRF assay to test the effect of an N-terminal deletion of the ld FH2 domain, analogous to the inactivating deletions of mDia1 and mDia2, and found it to be inactive in the SRF assay (Fig. 1C). To assess the requirement for ld FH2 C-terminal sequences, we examined two C-terminal deletion mutants corresponding to two of the original limb deformity mutations, the strong Tg-Bri/Hd allele and the weak In2 allele (24Chan D.C. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23472-23477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on our analysis of mDia FH2 domains, the In2 deletion should leave the FH2 domain intact, whereas the Tg truncation should not. Indeed, in the SRF assay, the Tg derivative completely abolished function, whereas the less severe In2 mutation had no effect on FH2 activity (Fig. 1C). Thus, ld itself possesses an FH2 domain whose expression can activate SRF and it appears that the functional limits of this domain match those mapped in the mDia proteins. The results presented above show that FH2 constitutes the minimal formin domain sufficient for SRF activation. Our previous studies of the Rho-controlled signaling pathway to SRF are consistent with a model in which SRF is activated by depletion of the cellular G-actin pool (see Ref. 4Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the entire FH2 regions of Bni1 and mDia1 are sufficient for actin filament nucleation (15Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To confirm that this holds true for mDia2 and to investigate the nature of the defect in the KA3 mutant, we examined the ability of purified mDia derivatives to promote actin polymerization in vitro. Recombinant mDia1 and mDia2 were purified following cleavage from glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and tested for their ability to promote polymerization of pyrene-actin monomers in vitro. Purified mDia1 F1F2 and FH2 effectively induced actin polymerization (Fig. 2, A and B), as did the purified mDia2 FH2 domain (Fig. 2B). In contrast, purified F1F2Δ1 exhibited only background levels of actin polymerization activity in vitro, as did the mDia1 F1F2 KK753A and LRR762A FH2 domain mutants (Fig. 2, A and C; we were unable to express W767A). The F1F2.KA3 mutant also failed to promote polymerization under the assay conditions (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate a strict correlation between the ability to nucleate actin polymerization in vitro and the ability to activate SRF in vivo. Recent studies have suggested that monomeric FH2 derivatives may cap actin filament barbed ends (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured whether the different mDia1 derivatives affected actin critical concentration. The inclusion of F1F2 or its inactive derivative F1F2Δ1 in the reactions had no effect on critical concentration, but F1F2.KA3 significantly increased it (Fig. 2D). We conclude that, under the conditions of our assay, the KA3 mutant possesses effective barbed end capping activity. Although F1F2Δ1 did not induce capping under our assay conditions, we note that others have observed capping by an analogous mDia derivative, albeit at much higher protein concentrations (>2 μm) (19Shimada A.

A number of inactivating deletions at the N and C termini of the mDia1 FH2 domain render it able to interfere with DRF function in vivo (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the different inactive mDia point mutations act as interfering mutants. The inactive mDia1 F1F2 derivatives KK753A, LRR762A, and W767A inhibited SRF activation by co-expressed mDia1 or mDia2 FH1/FH2 domains as effectively as FH2 N-terminal deletion derivatives (Fig. 3A). The F1F2.KA3 mutant also effectively interfered with SRF activation by mDia1 F1F2 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, mDia1 FH2 C-terminal deletion mutants only slightly affected SRF activation by mDia1 F1F2 and left mDia2 F1F2 unaffected (Fig. 3A). To map the boundary of the sequences responsible for interference, further mDia1 FH2 deletion mutants were analyzed. N-terminal truncations to residue 808 of mDia1 were inactive and interfering, but the deletion of an additional 50 amino acids greatly reduced interference with mDia1 function (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when interference with mDia2 FH1/FH2 function was tested (Fig. 3A). The experiments in Fig. 2D showed that the inactive interfering mDia mutant F1F2.KA3 was able to efficiently cap filament barbed ends. Intriguingly, the region of FH2 required for interference in vivo was similar to the “core” FH2 domain, which at higher protein concentrations has been shown to cap the barbed end of filaments (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We did not observe capping of actin filaments by other inactive mDia1 derivatives under our assay conditions. Therefore, we performed titration experiments to compare the relative efficiency of interference by F1F2.KA3 and by the deletion mutant mDia1-(808–1181). F1F2.KA3 worked much more efficiently than mDia1-(808–1181) as assessed by the protein expression level required for effective inhibition of mDia-induced SRF activation (Fig. 3C), suggesting that interference may be due at least in part to filament capping (see “Discussion”). Previous studies have shown that purified formin derivatives containing the FH2 region are oligomeric in solution (15Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 20Zigmond S.H. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Forkey J. Pring M. Curr.

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between FH2 oligomerization in vivo and mDia activity. Derivatives of mDia1 bearing FLAG and Myc epitope tags were transiently co-expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, and their association was evaluated using a co-immunoprecipitation assay and visualized by immunoblotting. First we examined self-association of intact mDia1. Myc-mDia1 was readily detectable in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-mDia1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). Its recovery was dependent on FLAG-mDia1 expression and was not affected by inactivation of Rho signaling by co-expression of C3 transferase (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). It was not observed in control experiments using cells cotransfected with empty FLAG expression plasmid (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). We next examined oligomerization of the FH2 domain. Myc-mDia1 FH2 was readily detectable in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-mDia1 FH2. Its recovery was dependent on FLAG-mDia1 FH2 expression and was not observed in control experiments using cells co-transfected with empty FLAG expression plasmid (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2; data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitation was not affected by pretreatment of the extracts with the actin-binding drug Latrunculin B, demonstrating that the FH2-FH2 interaction was not a consequence of simultaneous binding to F-actin (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the mDia2 FH2 domain. Myc-FH2 mDia2 was efficiently recovered in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both FLAG- and Myc-tagged mDia2 FH2 (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). Strikingly, however, the FH2 domains of mDia1 and mDia2 did not form heteromeric complexes in this assay (Fig. 4, B and C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4). We used the co-immunoprecipitation assay to investigate whether inactivating FH2 domain mutations affected its oligomerization. FLAG-tagged mDia1 FH2 effectively bound Myc-mDia1 F1F2 but was severely deficient in binding inactive derivatives of this protein lacking sequences at the N or C termini of the FH2 domain (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with 7 and 10). Analogous results were obtained with the mDia2 derivative (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 5 and 6 with 7–10). We next examined oligomerization by mDia1 point mutants. Mutations KA3, LRR762A, W767A, and KK753A all significantly reduced the ability of mDia1 F1F2 to form homo-oligomers (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3–10) and also abolished its ability to interact with wild-type mDia1 FH2 (Fig. 4E, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3–10). Taken together, these results show that the mDia1 and mDia2 domains form homo-oligomers in vivo and that oligomerization is essential for actin-polymerization in vitro and in vivo. Formation of inactive mDia oligomers, however, cannot be the basis by which inactive mDia1 derivatives interfere with mDia function, because these mutants are also defective in oligomerization (see “Discussion”). In this study, we have shown directly that the FH2 domains of mDia1 and mDia2 were sufficient to induce actin polymerization in vitro and to activate the transcription factor SRF in vivo. Oligomerization of the FH2 domain, which is disrupted by point mutants at the FH2 N terminus and central core, was essential for both functions. Indeed, while this study was in progress, it was reported that the DRFs mDia1 and Bni1 are multimeric in solution (15Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 20Zigmond S.H. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Forkey J. Pring M. Curr.

The intact mDia1 protein is also oligomeric in the absence of Rho signaling. Actin polymerization appeared to be the core activity of the FH2 domain, since ld, the prototype formin, was also active in the SRF reporter assay. Our results provide direct support for our model that the ability of mDia1 to activate SRF results from a direct effect on F-actin assembly rather than from indirect effects on cellular signal transduction cascades (2Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our data strongly support the recent structural studies of the FH2 domain (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D.

Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and suggest that interfering mDia derivatives act not by forming inactive complexes with the intact protein but by acting as monomers to prevent actin filament assembly. The FH2 domain of mDia2 is both necessary and sufficient for SRF activation and actin polymerization, in apparent contrast to a previous report (9Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We found that sequences N-terminal to the mDia2 FH1 domain acted to inhibit activity of its FH2 domain, suggesting an explanation for this apparent discrepancy. Our previous experiments provided no evidence that mDia1 behaved in this fashion (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), although it is intriguing that the mDia1 FH3 domain has been reported to interfere with DRF function in epithelial cells (8Nakano K. Takaishi K. Kodama A. Mammoto A. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2481-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating interactions among FH3, FH2, and other factors. The mDia1 F1F2.KA3 mutation removes three highly conserved lysines in FH2 and substantially inactivates both actin polymerization and SRF transcription. It was previously reported that this mutant could induce actin polymerization in vivo but not polarization of microtubules (12Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our finding that this mutant is defective in vitro for actin polymerization cautions against use of this mutant to distinguish between microtubule and actin-dependent phenotypes induced by mDia proteins. Indeed, recent studies place the spectroplakin ACF7 downstream of mDia1 in coordination of F-actin and microtubule organization (25Kodama A. Karakesisoglou I. Wong E. Vaezi A. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 115: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As with our other inactive mDia1 mutants, F1F2.KA3 is also defective in its ability both to self-associate and to associate with the wild-type mDia1 FH2 domain. Deletion or point mutations that disrupt the N or C terminus of the FH2 domains of mDia1, mDia2, or ld-formin block the ability of these proteins to induce SRF activation in vivo and, where tested, their ability to nucleate actin polymerization in vitro. These mutations and the KA3 derivative also greatly reduce the ability of the FH2 domain of mDia1 and mDia2 to form homo-oligomers, demonstrating that oligomerization is essential for FH2 function. However, it is unlikely that multimerization of FH2 domains underlies the interference by dominant negative mDia1 derivatives for two reasons. First, mDia proteins with mutant FH2 domains lack the ability to oligomerize, so it is unlikely that interference reflects formation of inactive oligomers. Second, the interfering forms of mDia1 block mDia2 activity, even though hetero-oligomerization between mDia1 and mDia2 does not occur. One potential explanation for these observations is that the interfering mDia mutants block a step downstream of diaphanous function in the F-actin assembly pathway. An attractive notion is that the mutants act by capping actin filament barbed ends. Consistent with this finding, the KA3 mutant exhibited capping activity under our assay conditions (Fig. 2D). Although other interfering mDia mutants failed to cap under our assay conditions, an analysis of the mDia FH2 sequences required for interference suggested that their N-terminal border approximates to that of the minimal protease-resistant “core” FH2 domain (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We note that capping by such mDia derivatives has been observed, albeit at greater than 20-fold higher protein concentrations than those used in our assays (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and that an N-terminal deletion mDia derivative of this type interfered 10-fold less effectively than the KA3 mutant (Fig. 3). Given these considerations, we favor the idea that all of the interfering mDia derivatives work by acting as actin filament barbed-end capping proteins, although direct proof of this awaits further in vitro studies. Whereas the capping hypothesis would explain why mDia interfering mutants are not isoform-specific, it remains possible that interfering mDia derivatives interact with another limiting factor required for FH2 function in vivo. One such factor is VASP, which appears to function with mDia1 in the Rho-linked SRF activation pathway in fibroblasts (26Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T.P. Way M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Zhuang S. Nguyen G.T. Chen Y. Gudi T. Eigenthaler M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10397-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our results provide strong support at the functional level for recently determined structures of DRF FH2 domain fragments from yeast Bni1 (23Xu Y. Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Poy F. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and mammalian mDia1 (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The structure of a minimal, active Bni1 FH2 domain comprises a head-to-tail dimer in which the FH2 N terminus loops around a postlike structure formed by the core FH2 homology region, whereas the FH2 C terminus contacts the intervening sequence. Mutations at conserved residues at the contact points abolish actin polymerization (23Xu Y. Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Poy F. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). According to this structure, our inactivating mDia1 N-terminal point mutants and truncations and the KA3 mutation would disrupt the loop-post interaction, consistent with our finding that they greatly decrease the stability of the FH2 dimer. In contrast, the minimal proteolytically stable mDia1 FH2 fragment, which lacks the N-terminal sequences of the minimal functional FH2 domain as defined by our previous studies (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is monomeric and inactive in actin polymerization (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, consistent with this work, upon the addition of N-terminal FH2 domain sequences, the molecule dimerizes and becomes active in actin polymerization assays (19Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal RBD and C-terminal DAD regulatory domains interact to inhibit activity of the core FH1 and FH2 domains (5Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 6Takaishi K. Matozaki T. Nakano K. Takai Y.

Thus, the question arises of whether in the autoinhibited state the FH2 domain is monomeric and dimerizes following activation or dimeric but occluded prior to Rho binding (Fig. 5). The latter possibility is strongly supported by our finding that unactivated full-length mDia1 is oligomeric in vivo and by a recent study, which demonstrates inhibition of FH2-DAD function in trans by the mDia1 N terminus (15Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which relief of DRF autoinhibition exposes the active FH2 domain will be of great interest.

The antithrombotic effect of heparin, however, is due primarily to the specific interaction of a fraction of heparin chains with the related serpin antithrombin (AT). What currently prevents selective therapeutic activation of HCII is the lack of knowledge of the determinants of glycosaminoglycan binding specificity. In this report we investigate the heparin binding properties of HCII and conclude that binding is nonspecific with a minimal heparin length of 13 monosaccharide units required and affinity critically dependent on ionic strength. Rapid kinetics of heparin binding indicate an induced fit mechanism that involves a conformational change in HCII. Thus, HCII binds to heparin in a manner analogous to the interaction of AT with low affinity heparin. A fully allosteric 2000-fold heparin activation of thrombin inhibition by HCII is demonstrated for heparin chains up to 26 monosaccharide units in length.

Thrombin is the ultimate protease in the blood coagulation cascade and has many pro-coagulant functions (for review see Ref. 1Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thrombin inhibition is thus critical for the prevention of thrombosis, and is achieved by the circulating serpins antithrombin (AT) 1The abbreviations used are: AT, antithrombin; HCII, heparin cofactor II; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; UFH, unfractionated heparin; TNS, 2-(p-toluidinyl)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; LAH, low affinity heparin.1The abbreviations used are: AT, antithrombin; HCII, heparin cofactor II; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; UFH, unfractionated heparin; TNS, 2-(p-toluidinyl)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; LAH, low affinity heparin. and heparin cofactor II (HCII) in a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-dependent fashion (for review see Ref. 2Huntington J.A. Baglin T.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The antithrombotic effect of therapeutic heparin, however, is mediated primarily by its interaction with AT (3Sie P. Ofosu F. Fernandez F. Buchanan M.R. Petitou M. Boneu B. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 64: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), because of the presence of a specific AT-binding pentasaccharide sequence in one-third of heparin chains (4Oscarsson L.G. Pejler G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 296-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of heparin to appreciably activate HCII in vivo derives from the absence of such a high affinity HCII-specific sequence (5Sie P. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Dupouy D. Boneu B. Choay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Perly B. Berthault P. Bossennec V. Sie P. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8685-8690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus high heparin levels would need to be achieved before HCII could contribute to the antithrombotic effect of heparin. HCII could thus be considered an untapped source of anti-thrombin activity.Although HCII deficiency has not been established as a significant risk factor for thrombosis (7Tollefsen D.M. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2002; 126: 1394-1400PubMed Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that HCII may play a role in preventing arterial thrombosis (7Tollefsen D.M. Arch. Pathol. Lab.

Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Clot-bound thrombin is resistant to heparin anticoagulant therapy because of the obligate co-occupation of AT and thrombin on the same heparin chain (12Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 13Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, HCII inhibition of thrombin does not require the formation of a heparin bridge to thrombin (14Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); rather, HCII interacts directly with a part of thrombin that does not mediate its sequestration on fibrin (15Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The discovery or design of a specific agonist of HCII may thus provide a significant improvement in anticoagulant therapy by targeting clot-bound thrombin, resistant to inhibition by heparin-activated AT.The recently solved structures of native HCII and HCII in its Michaelis complex with thrombin support the hypothesis of an AT-like heparin activation mechanism for HCII (15Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). AT binds to a specific pentasaccharide sequence of heparin by an induced fit, conformational change mechanism (16Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. Bjork I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), which involves an initial weak interaction followed by a rapid conformational change and a 1000-fold improvement in binding affinity (Kd from 37 μm to 20 nm) (17Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could be in operation for HCII as its heparin-binding region (Fig. 1B), and native and activated conformations (Fig. 1C) are nearly identical to AT. If HCII shares the heparin-binding mechanism of AT it becomes possible to envision the discovery or design of GAGs that interact with HCII as the pentasaccharide does with AT. In this study we determined the heparin binding characteristics of HCII that support an induced fit, AT-like mechanism of heparin binding and resolve a 2000-fold allosteric activation toward thrombin inhibition by HCII. These findings confirm HCII as a target for the design of specific antithrombotic agents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Unfractionated heparin with an average molecular mass of 15,000 Da (UFH) was purchased from Rovi Pharmaceutical Laboratories (Madrid, Spain). Depolymerized heparins of lengths varying from 6 to 26 monosaccharide units were prepared as before (18Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The main disaccharide composition (75%) was the trisulfated IdoA,2S-GlcNS, 6S. Human thrombin was purchased from Sigma, and human HCII was purified from freshly frozen plasma as described previously (19Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2218-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-(p-Toluidinyl)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (TNS) was purchased from Molecular Probes and was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide.Equilibrium Binding Studies—Binding of heparin to HCII was followed by monitoring TNS fluorescence, essentially as previously done with AT variants (20Meagher J.L. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2698-2704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence emission spectra (360–500 nm) were collected on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B fluorometer exciting at 330 nm from solutions containing 250 nm HCII, 10 μm TNS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and ionic strength adjusted with NaCl (125 mm NaCl referred to as “physiological ionic strength buffer”). An average of two spectra was recorded for each titration point, and the emission at 448 nm was taken as the fluorescence maximum. The data were corrected for dilution and fitted to Equation 1,ΔF=ΔFmax×([HCII]o+[H]o+Kd−(([HCII]o+[H]o+Kd)2−4×[HCII]o×[H]o)1/2)/(2×[HCII]o)(Eq.1) where ΔF and ΔFmax are fractional and maximal fractional fluorescence change, [HCII]o and [H]o are total HCII and heparin concentrations, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant as described previously (21Belzar K.J.

Saturation of fluorescence signal was not achieved for heparin chains smaller than 8 monosaccharide units in length, even when no NaCl was added to the buffer. The dissociation constants obtained using the extrinsic fluorescence method were independent of the concentrations of either TNS or HCII, because identical dissociation constants were obtained for UFH when either concentration was doubled (data not shown). In addition, TNS fluorescence was found to be insensitive to the heparin additions in the absence of HCII (data not shown). Stoichiometric binding (i.e. one molecule of heparin binds only one molecule of HCII) was verified for the 26-mer heparin at 0 mm NaCl (data not shown), and thus the binding site density is inferred to be no greater than one for all studies. The dependence of binding affinity on heparin length was determined as previously (22Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 266: 6342-6352Google Scholar) using Equation 2,1/Kd,app=1/Kd,int×(N−L+1)(Eq.2) where Kd,app is the measured, apparent dissociation constant derived from Equation 1 for heparin chains of N monosaccharide units, and Kd,int is the intrinsic dissociation constant for a heparin chain of minimal binding site size L. The slope of the linear fit of the dependence of equilibrium association constant versus heparin length thus gives the intrinsic dissociation constant, and the x intercept is the minimal binding chain length minus one monosaccharide unit. The effect of ionic strength on binding affinity was determined as previously (21Belzar K.J. Dafforn T.R. Petitou M. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol.

Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The intrinsic nonionic dissociation constant, KNI,int, was determined from the linear plot of the dependence of apparent KNI on heparin chain length, according to Equation 2.Rapid Kinetics Studies—Rapid binding experiments were conducted under pseudo first order conditions in heparin (minimal 5-fold excess of heparin over HCII) using a BioLogic MOS-450 stopped flow fluorometer (Grenoble, France). The fluorescence signal from the extrinsic fluorescence probe TNS (100 μm) was followed by exciting at 330 nm using an emission cut-off filter of 360 nm. The method was validated by determining the rates of 16-mer binding in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (0 NaCl), where an accurate equilibrium dissociation constant had already been obtained. Good agreement between the equilibrium value and that calculated from the linear plot of observed rate constant versus 16-mer concentration (see Table II) suggested that the binding of TNS to HCII was rapid relative to the binding of heparin to HCII. The rapid binding of TNS to HCII was also established directly by rapidly mixing TNS with HCII and monitoring change in TNS fluorescence. Only 1% of the equilibrium signal was observed, indicating that the reaction was 99% completed in the dead time of the instrument (5.3 ms). As found for the equilibrium titrations, the fluorescence of TNS was not affected by heparin alone under stopped flow conditions (data not shown). Kinetics of UFH binding to HCII were measured at physiological ionic strength (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 polyethylene glycol 8000, 125 mm NaCl), with 100 μm TNS present in all solutions. The values for kobs were obtained from the fit of the average of at least six traces to the equation for single exponential decay and were plotted against total heparin concentration ([H]0). All of the data were then fit to Equation 4,kobs=k−2+k2[H]0/([H]0+K1)(Eq.4) where K1 is the initial rapid dissociation constant, k2 and k-2 are the rates of forward and reverse conformational change steps, respectively, according to the kinetic mechanism outlined in Fig. 1A. On and off rates were also measured by rapid dilution experiments, where one syringe was filled with 1 μm HCII, 50 μm UFH, and 100 μm TNS, and another was filled with 100 μm TNS alone, both in the 125 mm NaCl buffer. 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-fold dilutions were conducted, and the observed rate constant, kobs, was fit to Equation 5,kobs=koff+kon×([HCII]0+[UFH]0)(Eq.5) where koff and kon are the off and on rates, and [HCII]o and [UFH]o are the total concentrations of HCII and UFH, respectively.Table IIRapid kinetics data for the interaction of heparin with HCIIK1k2k-2konkoffKd,calcKd,measμms-1s-1μm-1 s-1s-1μmμmHCII + 16-meraConducted in the absence of NaCl---2.50.310.120.22HCII + UFH10411112.41.0712.41326 ± 6HCII + UFHbFrom rapid dilution experiments.

Solutions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and HCII and thrombin concentrations were 1 μm and 25 nm, respectively, in all experiments. Heparin chains of this size range are incapable of bridging HCII and thrombin, and thus any effect on the observed rates of thrombin inhibition is due to allostery alone. To determine whether the rate enhancement was due to the interaction of heparin with HCII or thrombin, the observed rate constants of thrombin inhibition were plotted against 10-mer heparin concentrations up to 100 μm. The resulting fit to Equation 1 (substituting the fluorescence signal with kobs) suggested that the interaction of heparin with HCII alone affected the observed rate of thrombin inhibition (more details in “Results”). Thus, it was possible to obtain the maximal catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition (kcat) for all heparin fragments used by fitting the plot of kobsversus total heparin concentration, [H]0 (up to 100 nm) according to Equation 6,kobs=kcat[H]0[HCII]0/([HCII]0+Kd)+kuncat[HCII]0(Eq.6) where [HCII]0 is the initial HCII concentration, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant for the HCII-heparin interaction (extrapolated for heparin chains smaller than 16 units in length), and kuncat is the rate constant for the uncatalyzed reaction.RESULTSThe Effect of Heparin Size and Ionic Strength on Affinity for HCII—Characterization of the binding affinity of HCII for heparin and other GAGs has been hampered by the lack of intrinsic fluorescence signal and by the poor affinity of the interaction (23Liaw P.C.

Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Hirsh J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We adapted an extrinsic fluorescence method used previously to determine the binding constants of AT variants with heparin (20Meagher J.L. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2698-2704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For AT, where a known conformational change is associated with heparin binding, a 50% quench in TNS fluorescence and a small blue shift are observed. Similarly, TNS fluorescence is altered in a saturable manner by the addition of heparin to solutions containing TNS and HCII. Interestingly, the fluorescence change depended on the length of heparin chain used in the titration, with chains 12 monosaccharide units and smaller resulting in a 40–70% fluorescence enhancement with a 1.5-nm blue shift, and chains 14 monosaccharide units and larger causing a 30–50% fluorescence quench with a 7.5-nm red shift (Fig. 2A). Both signals were saturable and allowed for the determination of apparent dissociation constants (Kd) (example titrations are given in Fig. 2B). The value obtained for UFH at physiological ionic strength using this method (26.6 μm) is in good agreement with previously obtained values (24Weitz J.I. Young E. Johnston M. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Hirsh J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Verhamme I.M. Bock P.E. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9785-9795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, Kd values were determined for heparin chains of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 26, and 50 (UFH) units in 50 mm Tris buffer (Table I), with ionic strength adjusted by adding NaCl. Even under low ionic strength conditions, saturation of fluorescence signal could not be achieved for any heparin chain shorter than 8 monosaccharide units in length. Analysis of the dependence of apparent equilibrium association constant (Ka,app = 1/Kd,app) on heparin chain length, according to Equation 2, resulted in experimentally indistinguishable heparin-binding site lengths (L) of 12.5, 14.5, and 11.2 monosaccharide units at 0, 20, and 125 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 2C). The minimal heparin length that can fully occupy the heparin-binding site of HCII is thus ∼13 monosaccharide units (the average value is 12.7). Consistent with a 13-mer being the minimal heparin size to fully occupy the heparin-binding site on HCII is the observation that a TNS fluorescence enhancement is observed for heparin chains smaller than 14 monosaccharide units in length, with a quench observed for all heparin lengths 14 monosaccharide units and larger. The saturable fluorescence enhancement for 10- and 12-mer heparin fragments was found to be followed by a fluorescence quench upon further addition (data not shown). This behavior supports the contention that full occupancy of the heparin-binding site on HCII yields a fluorescence quench under these experimental conditions. The slopes of the linear fits in Fig. 2C also provide values for the intrinsic dissociation constant, Kd,int, which is defined as the dissociation constant for the minimal 13-mer heparin chain at the three ionic strengths studied. The values obtained were 1.1 ± 0.2, 2.2 ± 0.1, and 695 ± 167 μm for 0, 20, and 125 mm NaCl, respectively, and correspond well to those directly determined for the 14-mer at 0 and 20 mm NaCl (0.4 and 2.4 μm) and the extrapolated value at 125 mm NaCl (275 μm). The apparent increase in binding affinity for heparin chain lengths greater than 13 monosaccharide units can be understood as the statistical effect of increasing the number of overlapping HCII sites available, with each monosaccharide addition resulting in an additional possible binding site (N - L + 1), according to Equation 2.Fig. 2HCII affinity for heparin is dependent on heparin size and ionic strength.A, the fluorescence spectrum of TNS in solution with HCII changes in response to heparin addition in a saturable manner, with an increase in quantum yield for heparin chains of 12 monosaccharide units or smaller and a fluorescence quench for chains 14 monosaccharide units and larger. The fluorescence spectrum of TNS with HCII alone is given as a solid line, with saturating 10-mer as a dotted line and saturating UFH (∼50-mer) as a dashed line. B, both fluorescence signals are saturable and yield accurate values for dissociation constants when fit. Representative data are shown for the 10-mer at 0 mm NaCl (circles) and for the 26-mer at 50 mm NaCl (squares). C, the x intercept of the linear plot of Ka versus heparin size is taken as the minimal heparin length (minus one) capable of full occupancy of the heparin-binding site of HCII. The values are similar for data obtained at 0 (circles, x intercept = 11.5), 20 (squares, x intercept = 13.7), or 125 mm NaCl (triangles, x intercept = 10.2). The slopes are related to the intrinsic Kd at each ionic strength used. D, the double log plots of the dependence of dissociation constant on ionic strength for the 10-mer (filled circles), 12-mer (open circles), 14-mer (squares), 16-mer (triangles), 18-mer (inverted triangles), 20-mer (open diamonds), and the 26-mer (filled diamonds) provide values for the number of ionic interactions (from the slopes) and the apparent strength of the nonionic interactions (from the y intercept).

The linear fit also provides information about the number of ionic interactions and the strength of the nonionic contribution, according to the polyelectrolyte theory of Record et al. (26Record M.T.J. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The number of ionic interactions (Z) is calculated from the slope, and the nonionic contribution to the apparent dissociation constant (KNI) is derived from the y intercept (Equation 3 and Table I). The number of ionic interactions increases from 2 for the 10-mer, to 4 for the 12-mer, to 4–5 for all other heparin lengths up to the 26-mer, where one or two additional ionic interactions are observed. Thus, our observation that 13 monosaccharide units is the minimal heparin size for full occupation of the heparin-binding site of HCII corresponds to between four and five ionic interactions and is identical to the value obtained for the interaction of AT with its specific pentasaccharide (Table I). The binding affinity appears to derive largely from the ionic contribution, with the apparent nonionic dissociation constants (KNI) in the millimolar range. The decrease in the apparent KNI with increasing heparin chain length is a product of the statistical effect of increasing the number of overlapping HCII-binding sites, as discussed above. When the apparent nonionic dissociation constants, KNI,app, are fit to Equation 2 (Fig. 2D, inset), an intrinsic KNI of 460 mm is obtained. This value is close to the theoretical maximum of 1 m and is indicative of a nonspecific binding model where nonionic interactions do not contribute appreciably to the overall binding affinity. Thus, heparin binding to HCII utilizes the same number of ionic interactions as does heparin binding to AT, and the low affinity of the heparin-HCII interaction is explained by the weak nonionic contribution.Rapid Kinetics Studies Support an Induced Fit Heparin-binding Mechanism—Long before crystal structures of AT revealed the conformational changes associated with heparin binding (27Schreuder H.A. de Boer B.

Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hyperbolic dependence of the rate of binding on the concentration of heparin (under pseudo first order conditions in heparin) indicated that a conformational change step was the limiting rate at high heparin concentrations. The shared native and activated conformations of AT and HCII suggest a similar induced fit mechanism for the interaction of HCII with heparin. We established that the extrinsic fluorescence method employed in equilibrium fluorescence studies could also be applied under stopped flow conditions by determining the on and off rates for the binding of 16-mer heparin to HCII in 50 mm Tris buffer (Table II). From the linear plot of kobsversus concentration of the 16-mer, we calculated a Kd of 120 nm (data not shown), which was similar to that obtained under equilibrium conditions (220 nm). Thus, to test the hypothesis that HCII binds heparin via an AT-like induced fit mechanism, we determined the effect of heparin conc"

Leukocyte-derived peroxidases, such as myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, use hydrogen peroxide and halides (Cl- and Br-) to generate hypohalous acids (HOCl and HOBr), halogenating intermediates. It has been suggested that these oxidants lead to the formation of halogenated products upon reaction with nucleobases. To verify the consequences of phagocyte-mediated DNA damage at the site of inflammation, we developed a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb2D3) that recognizes the hypohalous acid-modified DNA and found that the antibody most significantly recognized HOCl/HOBr-modified 2′-deoxycytidine residues. The immunoreactivity of HOCl-treated oligonucleotide was attenuated by excess methionine, suggesting that chloramine-like species may be the plausible epitopes of the antibody. On the basis of further characterization combined with mass spectrometric analysis, the epitopes of mAb2D3 were determined to be novel N4,5-dihalogenated 2′-deoxycytidine residues. The formation of the dihalogenated 2′-deoxycytidine in vivo was immunohistochemically demonstrated in the lung and liver nuclei of mice treated with lipopolysaccharides, an experimental inflammatory model. These results strongly suggest that phagocyte-derived oxidants, hypohalous acids, endogenously generate the halogenated DNA bases such as a novel dihalogenated 2′-deoxycytidine in vivo.

Biochem. 1980; 13: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), EPO preferentially oxidizes Br- to produce the brominating agent HOBr (14Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). HOBr also oxidizes biomolecules at the site of eosinophilic inflammation (15Wu W. Samoszuk M.K. Comhair S.A.A. Thomassen M.J.

Chronic inflammation increases the risk of cancer, raising the possibility that reactive intermediates generated by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages might damage nucleic acids and compromise the integrity of the genome (16Weitzman S.A. Gordon L.I. Blood. 1990; 76: 655-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ohshima H. Bartsch H. Mutat. Res. 1994; 305: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 18Wiseman H. Halliwell B.

Genetic epidemiological studies have found a relationship between cancer risk and a polymorphism in the promoter region of the MPO gene. Individuals with -463G → A MPO polymorphism that lowers MPO expression were at decreased risk for lung and laryngeal cancers (19Schabath M.B. Spitz M.R. Zhang X. Delclos G.L. Wu X.

Prev. 2000; 9: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, schistosomiasis, characterized by an intense eosinophilic granulomatous reaction to the eggs of the blood fluke Schistosoma, greatly increases the risk for cancer (23Ishii A. Matsuoka H. Aji T. Ohta N. Arimoto S. Wataya Y. Hayatsu H. Mutat. Res. 1994; 305: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MPO- and EPO-catalyzed reactions may play important roles in carcinogenesis. It has been suggested that reactive intermediates generated by phagocytes might damage nucleic acids in cells at the site of inflammation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that various modified nucleic acids and/or DNA strand breaks were formed in the reaction with reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (24Shacter E. Beecham E.J. Covey J.M.

Alternatively, in contrast to these stable carbon-chlorinated products, the formation of semistable or unstable nitrogen-chlorinated products, chloramines (RNHCl and RR′NCl), was also observed (31Hayatsu H. Pan S. Ukita T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1971; 19: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Patton W. Bacon V. Duffield A.M. Halpern B. Hoyano Y. Pereira W. Lederberg J. Biochem.

Unstable nucleoside chloramines, such as thymidine chloramine, are suggested to initiate DNA single and double strand breaks via nitrogen-centered radicals and to transfer their chlorine atoms to other nucleosides (35Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The formation of EPO-catalyzed brominated nucleobases has also been demonstrated (37Shen Z. Mitra S.N. Wu W. Chen Y. Yang Y. Qin J. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2041-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. McCormick M.L. Parks W.C. Ridnour L.A. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although these in vitro studies suggest that hypohalous acidderived halogenation of DNA bases may provide one pathway for mutagenesis and cytotoxicity at sites of inflammation, the in vivo formation and localization of halogenated nucleobases and the precise mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. In the current study, to investigate the mechanisms for the halogenation of nucleobases in vivo, we raised a monoclonal antibody directed to hypohalous acid-derived halogenated 2′-deoxycytidine residues and determined its production in the inflammation tissues in a mouse model. Our results showed that both carbon and nitrogen halogenation of nucleobases endogenously occurred in vivo and that the halogenated nucleobases may be implicated in the mutagenesis and cytotoxicity of target cells at sites of inflammation. Sodium hypochlorite was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Calf thymus DNA, polydeoxynucleotides, 2′-deoxynucleosides, DNase I, nuclease P1, and 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) were obtained from Sigma. Phosphodiesterases (I and II) were purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. Alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). MPO from human sputum was purchased from Elastin Products Co. Inc. (Owensville, MO). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Hokkaido System Science (Hokkaido, Japan). The dC 50-mer ((dC)50) containing three 5-BrdC residues, (5-BrdC)3-(dC)47, was obtained from Sigma-Genosys Japan (Hokkaido, Japan). The oligonucleotide sequence of (5-BrdC)3-(dC)47 was 5′-C11XC11XC11XC14-3′ (X = 5-BrdC). Methylated BSA (mBSA) was prepared as reported previously (39Sueoka N. Cheng T.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). HOBr was prepared as reported elsewhere (40Hawkins C.L. Brown B.E. Davies M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). General Procedures—Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed with a Micromass VG Platform II (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in electrospray ionization-positive mode. The concentration of H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ240 = 43.6 m-1 cm-1; Ref. 12Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 2′-Deoxynucleoside oxidation products were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a C18 column (Develosil ODS-HG-5; 5-μm resin, 4.6 × 250 mm; Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan) with monitoring of absorbance at 260 nm. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The column was equilibrated with 97% solvent A. Compounds were eluted with a discontinuous gradient of solvent B. The gradient was 3% solvent B for 10 min, 3–20% solvent B over 20 min. UV-visible spectra for individual HPLC peaks were obtained using a photodiode array detector (Jasco MD-910). For the isolation of products, a semipreparative C18 column (Develosil ODS-HG-5; 5-μm resin, 8.0 × 250 mm) was used at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. In Vitro Modification of 2′-Deoxynucleosides, Oligonucleotides, and DNA—2′-Deoxynucleosides (2 mm), oligonucleotides (polymer, 0.5 mg/ml; oligomer, 10-6 bases/ml), or calf thymus DNA (0.5 mg/ml) was treated with oxidant at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions with MPO were typically performed at 37 °C for 1 h in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 or 4.5; containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm NaBr, 100 μm NaNO2, or 100 μm tyrosine) using 10 nm MPO and 1 mm H2O2. These reactions were generally terminated with an excess of methionine (4 mm). Oxidation of DNA with a Fe2+/H2O2 system was performed at 37 °C for 1 h with 100 μm FeSO4 and 1 mm H2O2. Oxidation of DNA was confirmed by estimating the 8-oxo-dG level in the enzymatic hydrolysate of DNA using HPLC with a CoulArray electrochemical detection system (ESA, Cambridge, MA). Samples were injected onto a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) containing 6% methanol at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Peroxynitrite was prepared as described previously (41Kato Y. Ogino Y. Aoki T. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. Osawa T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 3004-3009Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA (0.5 mg/ml) was treated with peroxynitrite (1 mm) at 37 °C for 1 h. Preparation of a Monoclonal Antibody to HOCl-modified DNA—Calf thymus DNA (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 1 mm HOCl in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 100 mm sodium chloride at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 mm methionine; the DNA was ethanol-precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and quantitated by fluorescence measurement as described previously (42Kissane J.M. Robins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HOCl-treated calf thymus DNA (0.5 mg/ml) was electrostatically complexed with an equal volume of mBSA (0.5 mg/ml). The complex was emulsified with an equal volume of adjuvant. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally immunized with this emulsion (100 μl). After 2 weeks, the mice were boosted with the HOCl-treated DNA/mBSA emulsified with an equal volume of adjuvant. In the final boost, 100 μl of HOCl-treated DNA/mBSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was intravenously injected. Three days after the final boost, one of the mice was sacrificed, and the spleen was removed for fusion with P3/U1 myeloma cells. The fusion was carried out by polyethylene glycol. The cells were cultured in the hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. After a week, culture supernatants of the hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using HOCl-modified DNA and untreated DNA as the coating agents. The positive hybridomas were cloned by the limiting dilution method. After repeated screening and cloning, four specific clones were obtained. Among them, a clone (named mAb2D3) was used in the following experiment due to its specificity and high ability for cell growth. ELISA—The indirect noncompetitive ELISA procedure has been described previously (43Kawai Y. Kato Y. Nakae D. Kusuoka O. Konishi Y. Uchida K. Osawa T. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly 100 μl of antigens in PBS were coated in wells and kept at 4 °C overnight. After washing and blocking with 4% Block Ace (Dainihon Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan), 100 μl of the mAb2D3 (1:1000 dilution) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS) was then added, and the wells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing, 100 μl of peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (1:5000 in TPBS) was added, and the wells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, 100 μlof o-phenylenediamine solution (0.5 mg/ml containing 0.03% H2O2 in citrate-phosphate buffer) was added. The color developing reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2 n H2SO4. The binding of the antibody to the antigen was evaluated by measuring the optical density at 490 nm. Competitive indirect ELISA was performed as described previously (43Kawai Y. Kato Y. Nakae D. Kusuoka O. Konishi Y. Uchida K. Osawa T. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The HOCl-modified calf thymus DNA (0.5 μg/well) was used as the coating antigen. For the competitive reaction, 50 μl of competitors in PBS were mixed with an equal volume of the antibody (1:1000 dilution) in TPBS. The competitor solution was kept at 4 °C overnight, and 90 μl of the mixture was used as the primary antibody. The cross-reactivity of the antibody to the competitors was expressed as B/B0 where B is the amount of mAb2D3 bound to the coating antigen in the presence of the competitor and B0 is the amount of mAb2D3 bound to the coating antigen in the absence of a competitor. Detection of Halogenated dC by HPLC-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)—HPLC-MS/MS analyses were carried out on the API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) through a TurboIonSpray source. Chromatography was carried out on a Develosil ODS-HG-3 column (2.0 × 50 mm) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The chromatographic separation was performed by a gradient elution as follows: 0–20 min, linear gradient from 0.5% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.01% formic acid to 20% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.01% formic acid; 20–25 min, linear gradient to 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.01% formic acid; 25–30 min, linear gradient to 0.5% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.01% formic acid; flow rate = 0.2 ml/min. The instrument response was optimized by infusion experiments of the standard compounds using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Halogenated nucleosides were detected using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Specific transitions used to detect products in the positive ionization mode were those between the molecular cation of the products and the characteristic daughter ion formed from the loss of the 2′-deoxyribose moiety. Halogenated dC Analysis in DNA Samples—Enzymatic digestion of DNA with DNase I, nuclease P1, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphodiesterases I/II was performed reported previously (44Huang X. Powell J. Mooney L.A. Li C. Frenkel K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were hydrolyzed with alkaline phosphatase and phosphodiesterase I. Before digestion, DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation (for calf thymus DNA) or C18 solid phase extraction column (for oligonucleotides) to eliminate low molecular compounds. After digestion, the reaction mixtures were filtered through Ultrafree-MC membrane (nominal molecular weight limit 5000; Millipore) by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, HIMAC centrifuge, Hitachi, Japan) to remove enzymes; 10 μl of filtrates were injected for HPLC-MS/MS. Animal Experiment and Immunohistochemistry—Female C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks old) were given an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from Escherichia coli, Sigma) in PBS at a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight. They were sacrificed at 24 h after administration. Livers and lungs were quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately used for the MPO and GSH assays. MPO activity in tissues was monitored at 512 nm using H2O2 and 4-aminoantipyrine as substrates (45Nakamura Y. Murakami A. Ohto Y. Torikai K. Tanaka T. Ohigashi H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4832-4839PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of GSH in the cells was performed fluorometrically according to the method of Hissin and Hilf (46Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (3687) Google Scholar). In brief, tissues were homogenized and extracted with 25% (w/v) metaphosphoric acid solution containing 5 mm EDTA. After ultracentrifugation (105,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), 0.9 ml of 0.1 m phosphate solution (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 50 μl of the o-phthalaldehyde solution (1 mg/ml) were added to the resulting supernatant (50 μl). Then the fluorescence intensity at 420 nm was determined with excitation at 350 nm. For the immunohistochemical studies, tissues were fixed with 20% formalin neutral buffer solution (Wako), embedded in paraffin, and cut at 3-μm thickness. Immunostaining was performed using the avidinbiotin complex method with the Vectastain ABC-AP (alkaline phosphatase) kit and Vector Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate kit I (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Before the immunostaining, to provide maximal exposure of mAb2D3 to DNA, sections were boiled in a micro-wave oven for 5 min in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0). After cooling at room temperature, sections were treated with 0.1% trypsin solution (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% CaCl2, pH 7.8) for 15 min at room temperature. A competitive experiment was performed by staining with mAb2D3 preincubated with an excess of HOCl-modified calf thymus DNA (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. Sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunocytochemical Detection of Halogenated dC—HL-60 cells in PBS were treated with HOCl at 37 °C for 15 min. Residual HOCl was inactivated by adding 4 mm methionine. Cells were washed with PBS three times and then fixed overnight in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h. To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, the cells were washed two times in PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 2% BSA in TPBS. Membranes were permeabilized by exposing the fixed cells to PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated in the primary antibody (mAb2D3) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Dako Japan Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), rinsed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and mounted on glass slides using 50% glycerol in PBS. Images of cellular immunofluorescence were acquired using a Zeiss LSM5 PASCAL confocal laser scanning microscope with a ×40 objective (488 nm excitation and 518 nm emission). The DNA was stained with propidium iodide, while damage was co-localized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Monoclonal Antibody to HOCl-modified DNA—Several lines of evidence suggest the possibility that leukocyte-derived oxidant hypohalous acids (HOCl and HOBr) can covalently modify the nucleobases in vivo. To examine the modifications of DNA bases by hypohalous acid in vivo, we prepared a monoclonal antibody to the hypohalous acid-modified DNA. The immunizing antigen was prepared by electrostatically coupling HOCl-treated calf thymus DNA with methylated BSA. We finally obtained a clone (clone no. 2D3), named mAb2D3, that showed the most distinctive recognition of the HOCl-modified DNA over unmodified DNA. The specificity of the obtained antibody was then characterized by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1A, mAb2D3 could recognize the DNA treated with the MPO/H2O2/Cl- system. The formation of immunoreactive materials required MPO, H2O2, and Cl and was blocked by catalase, a scavenger of H2O2 (data not shown). Heme enzyme inhibitor, sodium azide, also blocked the formation of epitopes. In addition, the formation of immunoreactive materials was also inhibited by methionine, which is a scavenger for HOCl, suggesting that MPO-catalyzed generation of HOCl may be implicated in the increase of immunoreactivity. Indeed the immunoreactivity of mAb2D3 with reagent HOCl-treated DNA was confirmed, and the formation of immunoreactivity was inhibited in the presence of HOCl scavengers, such as thiol compounds or taurine (Fig. 1B). It has been reported that Br-, NO2−, and tyrosine are also potent substrates of MPO and generate reactive species with DNA (47Podrez E.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The MPO/H2O2-catalyzed oxidation of DNA in the presence of plasma levels of NO2− or tyrosine did not generate the antigenic structures (Fig. 1C). In the presence of Br-, a weak immunoreactivity was observed, suggesting that HOBr may also be a potential oxidant that generates the antigenic materials. Indeed reagent HOBr-modified DNA was significantly recognized by mAb2D3 (Fig. 1D). It has been shown that the reaction of hypohalous acid with superoxide generates hydroxyl radical (·OH), a reactive oxidant species that generates 8-oxo-dG (a typical marker for m=.OH-mediated DNA damage) (27Shen Z. Wu W. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5474-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, the mAb2D3 could not recognize Fe2+/H2O2-treated DNA in which elevated levels of 8-oxo-dG were observed (Fig. 1D). In addition, peroxynitrite, another inflammatory oxidant, also failed to generate the epitope of this antibody in DNA (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the epitope of the antibody may be hypohalous acid-specific DNA lesions, but not ·OH-mediated oxidation products, such as 8-oxo-dG. Furthermore mAb2D3 recognized neither HOCl-modi"
https://openalex.org/W2086313318,"The dynamin superfamily of large GTPases has been implicated in a variety of distinct intracellular membrane remodeling events. One of these family members, DLP1/Drp1, is similar to conventional dynamins as it contains an N-terminal GTPase domain followed by a middle region (MID), an unconserved region (UC), and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. DLP1 has been shown to function in membrane-based processes distinct from conventional dynamin, most notably mitochondrial fission. In this study, we tested whether the functional specificities of DLP1 and dynamin stems from differences in the individual domains of these proteins by generating dynamin/DLP1 chimeras in which correlate domains had been interchanged. Here we report that three consecutive C-terminal domains of DLP1 (MID-UC-CC) contain information necessary for DLP1-specific function and removing any one of these domains results in a loss of DLP1 function. Importantly, the coiled-coil (CC) domain of DLP1 alone targets specifically and exclusively to mitochondria, implicating its involvement in localizing DLP1 to this organelle in vivo. The mitochondrial targeting information within the DLP1 CC domain is not sufficient to retarget dynamin to mitochondria but is still able to adequately function as an assembly domain in a dynamin background. These data suggest that whereas the GTPase domain of DLP1 provides an enzymatic function, other domains contain information for intermolecular assembly and mitochondrial targeting.

The similarity in biological activity of these two related but distinct proteins is reflected in the similarity of their domain structures.

We refer to the correlate region in DLP1 as the unconserved (UC) domain, as it shows little homology (18%) to the dynamin PH domain. Currently, the function of the UC domain is undefined. The PH/UC domains are followed by a region predicted to form a coiled-coil (CC). The CC domain of dynamin is often referred to as the assembly domain, as it is required for dynamin oligomerization and binds both the GTPase and MID domains (15Smirnova E. Shurland D.L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), this domain is also referred to as the GED (GTPase effector domain). The CC domain of DLP1 has been shown to bind the DLP1 MID domain (24Shin H.W. Takatsu H. Mukai H. Munekata E. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2780-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating that dynamin and DLP1 share common self-assembly mechanisms. Whereas it is unclear whether self-assembly of DLP1 stimulates its GTPase activity, a mutation in the CC domain of Dnm1p was shown to enhance mitochondrial fission by potentially favoring the GTP-bound state of Dnm1p (25Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggests that the DLP1 CC domain may function in a similar way to that of dynamin, mainly, GTPase regulation. A major distinguishing feature between DLP1 and conventional dynamins is the presence of a C-terminal tail of ∼100 proline-rich amino acids in dynamin termed the PRD. This domain has been implicated in targeting dynamin to target membranes via an interaction with a variety of SH3 domain-containing proteins (26Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G.

As mentioned above, the PH and PRD regions of dynamin are critical for protein function and targeting, yet DLP1 is missing these domains. Thus, how DLP1 is targeted to, and functions at, mitochondria is undefined. To this end, we exploited the similarities between DLP1 and dynamin domain structures and generated chimeric proteins in which domain(s) of DLP1 were substituted with those of dynamin. We then tested which of these chimeras displayed DLP1-specific mitochondrial function and targeting. Similar chimeric systems have been extensively and successfully used to assess the contributions of individual domains to the structure and function of other motor proteins (38Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M.

Through transient expression of these chimeras in cultured mammalian cells, combined with fluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation, we report that the mitochondrial specificity for DLP1 resides in three consecutive MID, UC, and CC domains. Ablation of any one of these domains resulted in an altered cellular distribution of DLP1 and failed to confer mitochondrial specific function. We also found that the CC domain of DLP1 alone targets exclusively to mitochondria, suggesting a mechanism by which DLP1 is localized to this organelle in vivo. Interestingly, the mitochondrial targeting information within the DLP1 CC domain is suppressed when placed in a dynamin background, although its ability to function as an assembly domain is not compromised. These data suggest that whereas the GTPase domain of DLP1 provides an enzymatic function, the other three domains contain information for organelle targeting and intermolecular interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Constructs—Chimeric constructs were generated by standard PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche). A battery of restriction site-containing primers was synthesized with specificity to either DLP1 (44Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or Dyn2ab (45Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), such that any domain or series of domains could be amplified by PCR using the proper DLP1 or Dyn2ab template. PCR products were purified (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), digested with the proper restriction enzyme, and ligated into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The validity of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. In some cases, the resulting construct was used as a second or third generation vector for subsequent cloning events leading to a full-length chimera.Cell Culture and Transfection—Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12K medium for Clone 9 (ATCC CRL-1439) and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for BHK-21 (ATCC CCL-10) and COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651) cells, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen).For cell transfection, DNA constructs were purified using plasmid purification columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells were plated 16–24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed by using LipofectAMINE® (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 16 to 24 h before processing for immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation.Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed as described elsewhere (11Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 2.5% formaldehyde and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation in a blocking buffer containing 5% goat serum, cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Following a wash with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with distilled water, followed by mounting in ProLong® antifade reagent (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). A mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen) was used to visualize mitochondria and a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) was used to visualize Myc-tagged proteins. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used for all experiments. Cells were viewed with a Plan-Appo ×63 lens on an Axiovert epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NJ). Fluorescence images were acquired with an OrcaII cooled charge-coupled device (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) driven by IPLab imaging software (Scanalytics, Inc.).Immunoprecipitations—BHK-21 cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with individual chimera or truncation constructs. At 16 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus 1.0% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor (Complete tablet, Roche). Clear cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating with anti-GFP antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 2 h followed by Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Beads were washed 5 times with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitates were eluted by SDS sample buffer.Transferrin Uptake Assay—Cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). The cells were then labeled with 5 μg/ml Alexa 594-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C. To block further transferrin uptake, the cells were immediately shifted to ice for 3 min. Residual surface-bound transferrin was removed by acid washing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 3.5, followed by extensive rinsing in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were allowed to recover for 5 min at 37 °C in normal medium and then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and mounted for fluorescence microscopy. Cells were viewed with a Plan-Appo ×63 lens on an Axiovert epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) and transferrin uptake was qualitatively assessed. Representative images selected from three independent experiments for each construct are shown.RESULTSChimera Construction—Both DLP1 and dynamin oligomerize on the membrane surface and, upon GTP hydrolysis, sever membranes of different cellular organelles. Despite the significant similarity in domain structures and physiological properties, DLP1 and dynamin assemble separately to function in distinct cellular processes. The multimeric nature of DLP1 and dynamin has been useful for the study of these molecules as overexpressed GTPase-defective mutants can co-assemble with normal endogenous proteins to confer a dominant-negative effect. The lysine to alanine mutation in the first GTP binding element in both DLP1 (K38A) and dynamin (Dyn2K44A) results in a loss of GTPase activity and greatly reduced binding to GTP (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 4Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J.

Overexpression of this mutant DLP1 protein induces a fission-defective mitochondrial phenotype with cells displaying elongated and entangled mitochondria (Fig. 1A) (11Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We tested whether this mutant protein, when expressed in cells, co-assembles with normal endogenous DLP1 protein by co-immunoprecipitation. Cells were transfected with a GFP-tagged DLP1-K38A (GFP-DLP1-K38A) construct, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-GFP antibodies. Endogenous DLP1 was detected in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the dominant-negative effect of GFP-DLP1-K38A was because of the formation of nonfunctional oligomers of DLP1. Taking advantage of this dominant-negative mechanism, we tested whether there were domains in DLP1 that rendered a DLP1-specific function using DLP1/dynamin chimeras bearing the GTPase-defective mutation (K38A for DLP1 and K44A for dynamin; Fig. 1C). The dominant-negative effect of K38A or K44A provides a functional assay for determining DLP1- or dynamin-specific function of a given chimeric construct. For example, if cells overexpressing a chimera exhibit the fission-defective mitochondrial phenotype, this chimera is considered to contain elements for DLP1-specific function. To facilitate testing the ability of mutant chimeric or truncated proteins to co-assemble with endogenous protein, all constructs were tagged with GFP (Fig. 1C), and immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-GFP antibodies.C-terminal Domains Are Necessary for Mutant DLP1-induced Mitochondrial Phenotype—To identify domain(s) that provide DLP1-specific function, we initially made two chimeric proteins in which either the N-terminal half (i.e. the GTPase-MID segment) or C-terminal half (i.e. the UC-CC segment) of DLP1 was replaced with the corresponding domains of dynamin (Fig. 1C, chimeras 1 and 2). Cells expressing either chimera exhibited normal mitochondrial morphology when compared with mitochondria in adjacent cells not expressing any transgene (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that neither the GTPase-MID nor UC-CC segments of DLP1 in a dynamin background were capable of invoking a mitochondrial phenotype. As no dominant-negative effects were observed with these chimeras, we predicted that they were unable to integrate with and disrupt endogenous DLP1 function. We transfected cells with each chimeric construct and performed immunoprecipitations using anti-GFP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, the chimeric proteins failed to co-precipitate endogenous DLP1, indicating that these chimeras do not co-assemble with DLP1.Fig. 2Cells expressing DLP1 chimeras containing either GTPase-MID or UC-CC segments exhibit normal mitochondrial morphology. Mixed populations of transfected (T) and untransfected (U) cells were stained with anti-cytochrome c antibodies for mitochondria. Cells expressing GFP-tagged chimera 1 containing the GTPase-MID segment of DLP1 fused with the PH-CC-PRD segment of Dyn2 (A) or chimera 2 containing the GTPase-MID segment of dynamin fused with the UC-CC segment of DLP1 (B) show no fission-defective mitochondrial phenotype compared with neighboring untransfected cells. Neither chimeras are able to co-assemble with native DLP1, as evidenced by lack of coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous DLP1 with either chimera. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because chimeras containing either the GTPase-MID or UC-CC segments of DLP1 were unable to confer a mutant phenotype on host cells, we hypothesized that DLP1-specific information might be shared across additional domains. To test this hypothesis we generated two chimeric proteins containing either the GTPase-MID-UC or MID-UC-CC segments of DLP1 exchanged with the corresponding domains of Dyn2 (Fig. 1C, chimeras 3 and 4). Whereas chimera 3 had neither an effect on mitochondrial morphology nor the ability to co-assemble with endogenous DLP1 (Fig. 3A), chimera 4 containing the MID-UC-CC segment of DLP1 behaved as a dominant-negative mutant, conferring a fission-defective mitochondrial phenotype on cells harboring the transgene (Fig. 3B). Immunoprecipitation of this chimera from cell lysates using anti-GFP antibodies coprecipitated native DLP1 (Fig. 3B), indicating that this chimera co-assembles with endogenous DLP1.Fig. 3Cells expressing the DLP1 MID-UC-CC segment exhibit mutant mitochondrial morphology.A, cells expressing GFP-tagged chimera 3 containing the DLP1 mutant GTPase-MID-UC segment fused to the CC domain of dynamin show no mitochondrial phenotype. As expected, chimera 3 is unable to co-immunoprecipitate (IP) native DLP1. B, cells expressing GFP-tagged chimera 4 containing a mutant Dyn2 GTPase fused with the MID-UC-CC segment of DLP1 exhibit collapsed and tubulated mitochondria. Chimera 4 is able to co-immunoprecipitate native DLP1, indicating that chimera 4 produces the mitochondrial phenotype by binding to endogenous DLP1. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Coiled-coil Domain of DLP1 Is Required to Induce a Mutant DLP1-induced Mitochondrial Phenotype—From the above data, it is possible that either the entire MID-UC-CC segment of DLP1 or some region within this segment is necessary for DLP1 function at mitochondria. To test these possibilities, a series of GFP-tagged, mutant DLP1 truncation constructs was generated (Fig. 1C, truncations 1–3). Expression of an N-terminal segment containing the DLP1 mutant GTPase and MID domains (truncation 1) had no effect on mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the MID domain alone was not sufficient to serve as a DLP1 determinant. As expected, this truncated protein failed to co-assemble with endogenous DLP1 in immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4A). Also, expression of the DLP1 mutant GTPase, MID, and UC domains (truncation 2) failed to confer a mitochondrial phenotype on cells harboring the transgene, nor did this truncated protein co-assemble with endogenous DLP1 (Fig. 4B). The absence of the mitochondrial phenotype and co-assembly in cells expressing these truncated DLP1 was not because of the reduced stability of the truncated proteins because similar levels of the truncated forms of DLP1 were detected in cell homogenates and immunoprecipitated materials as shown in Fig. 4. These data suggest that any information intrinsic to the MID and UC domains is insufficient to affect DLP1 function at the mitochondria. Furthermore, these data suggest that the CC domain is required to elicit the mitochondrial phenotype associated with expression of mutant DLP1. To confirm these hypotheses, we deleted the GTPase domain of DLP1 (truncation 3) and tested for co-assembly and a dominant-negative phenotype. As shown in Fig. 4C, expression of the MID-UC-CC segment alone was able to disrupt normal mitochondrial morphology. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that this segment co-assembled with endogenous DLP1 within cells. These data indicate that first, the truncated forms of DLP1 were expressed at similar levels and were intact over the course of the experiments, and second, the MID-UC-CC region contains all the necessary information for intermolecular interaction of DLP1, whereas the GTPase domain provides enzymatic function to the molecule. Also, the CC domain of DLP1 appears to have crucial information for DLP1-specific function, as simple removal (Fig. 4, A and B) or exchange (Fig. 3A) of this domain abolished the dominant-negative effect.Fig. 4The DLP1 MID-UC-CC segment alters mitochondrial morphology. Cells expressing GFP-tagged truncation 1 lacking the UC-CC segment (A) or truncation 2 lacking the CC domain (B) exhibit normal mitochondrial morphology. Consequently, these truncated proteins do not co-immunoprecipitate (IP) native DLP1. C, truncation 3 lacking the GTPase domain of DLP1 acts as a dominant-negative DLP1 when expressed in cells, showing a collapsed and entangled mitochondrial mass around the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that this mutant protein co-assembles with endogenous DLP1. Similar levels of truncated proteins in homogenates and immunoprecipitates indicate they are stable over the course of the experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2065425492,"In the sensitization phase of contact hypersensitivity in mice, dermal macrophages (MOs) expressing MO galactose-type C-type lectin1 (MGL1) are known to migrate from the dermis to lymph nodes (LNs) where they accumulate in the subcapsular sinus, interfollicular regions, and areas surrounding high endothelial venules. We hypothesize that the interactions between MGL1 and its ligands determine the localizations of MGL1-positive cells within the LNs. In the present study, our major aim was to isolate MGL1 counter-receptor(s) from lysates of LNs using affinity chromatography with immobilized recombinant MGL1. Fractions bound and eluted with EDTA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. One of the predominant components was sialoadhesin (Sn, Siglec-1). Sn from lysates of LNs was immobilized on microtiter plates precoated with anti-Sn monoclonal antibody, and binding of recombinant MGL1 and adhesion of cells expressing MGL1 were tested. The binding of recombinant MGL1 to Sn was shown to be dependent on Ca2+ and N-glycans on Sn. MGL1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells adhered to the Sn-coated plates, whereas mock transfectants did not. Immunohistochemical localization of anti-Sn monoclonal antibody in LN coincided with the subcapsular sinus area to which recombinant MGL1 was bound. Furthermore, the distribution of MGL1+ cells after sensitization with FITC was demonstrated to overlap with that of Sn within the subcapsular sinus of draining LNs. These results suggest that Sn acts as an endogenous counter-receptor for MGL1."
https://openalex.org/W2018221796,"Deficiency of the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) is associated with increased myeloid cell proliferation in response to hematopoietic cytokines. However, previously identified ICSBP target genes do not indicate a mechanism for this “cytokine hypersen-sitivity.” In these studies, we identify the gene encoding neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) as an ICSBP target gene, by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Additionally, we find decreased Nf1 expression in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells from ICSBP–/– mice. Since Nf1 deficiency is also associated with cytokine hypersensitivity, our results suggested that NF1 is a functionally significant ICSBP target gene. Consistent with this, we find that the hyper-sensitivity of ICSBP–/– myeloid cells to granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is reversed by expression of the Nf1 GAP-related domain. We also find that treatment of ICSBP-deficient myeloid cells with monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) results in sustained Ras activation, ERK phosphorylation, and proliferation associated with impaired Nf1 expression. These M-CSF effects are reversed by ICSBP expression in ICSBP–/– cells. Consistent with this, we find that ICSBP activates the NF1 promoter in myeloid cell line transfectants and identify an ICSBP-binding NF1 cis element. Therefore, the absence of ICSBP leads to Nf1 deficiency, impairing down-regulation of Ras activation by GM-CSF or M-CSF. These results suggest that one mechanism of increased myeloid proliferation, in ICSBP-deficient cells, is decreased NF1 gene transcription. This novel ICSBP function provides insight into regulation of myelopoiesis under normal conditions and in myeloproliferative disorders. Deficiency of the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) is associated with increased myeloid cell proliferation in response to hematopoietic cytokines. However, previously identified ICSBP target genes do not indicate a mechanism for this “cytokine hypersen-sitivity.” In these studies, we identify the gene encoding neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) as an ICSBP target gene, by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Additionally, we find decreased Nf1 expression in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells from ICSBP–/– mice. Since Nf1 deficiency is also associated with cytokine hypersensitivity, our results suggested that NF1 is a functionally significant ICSBP target gene. Consistent with this, we find that the hyper-sensitivity of ICSBP–/– myeloid cells to granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is reversed by expression of the Nf1 GAP-related domain. We also find that treatment of ICSBP-deficient myeloid cells with monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) results in sustained Ras activation, ERK phosphorylation, and proliferation associated with impaired Nf1 expression. These M-CSF effects are reversed by ICSBP expression in ICSBP–/– cells. Consistent with this, we find that ICSBP activates the NF1 promoter in myeloid cell line transfectants and identify an ICSBP-binding NF1 cis element. Therefore, the absence of ICSBP leads to Nf1 deficiency, impairing down-regulation of Ras activation by GM-CSF or M-CSF. These results suggest that one mechanism of increased myeloid proliferation, in ICSBP-deficient cells, is decreased NF1 gene transcription. This novel ICSBP function provides insight into regulation of myelopoiesis under normal conditions and in myeloproliferative disorders. The interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP 1The abbreviations used are: ICSBP, interferon consensus sequence-binding protein; Nf1, neurofibromin 1; GM-CSF, granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor; M-CSF, monocyte colony-stimulating factor; IFNγ, interferon γ; GRD, GAP-related domain; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IL, interleukin; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RBD, Ras binding domain; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; p-ERK, phosphorylated ERK; GAP, GTPase-activated protein.1The abbreviations used are: ICSBP, interferon consensus sequence-binding protein; Nf1, neurofibromin 1; GM-CSF, granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor; M-CSF, monocyte colony-stimulating factor; IFNγ, interferon γ; GRD, GAP-related domain; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IL, interleukin; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RBD, Ras binding domain; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; p-ERK, phosphorylated ERK; GAP, GTPase-activated protein.; also referred to as IRF8) is a member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors (1Driggers P.U. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Maki W.H. Marks M.S. Levi B.Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). ICSBP is expressed exclusively in myeloid and B-cells (1Driggers P.U. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Maki W.H. Marks M.S. Levi B.Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and activates genes involved in the inflammatory response. For example, in phagocytic cells, ICSBP activates genes encoding the respiratory burst oxidase proteins gp91PHOX (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and p67PHOX (3Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Toll-like receptor 4 (4Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and the IL-12 receptor (5Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trichieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To activate transcription of these genes, ICSBP participates in a multiprotein complex, which includes PU.1 and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recruitment of ICSBP to these target genes requires binding of PU.1 to a composite Ets/IRF sequence in the proximal promoter (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interaction of ICSBP with PU.1 is increased by ICSBP-tyrosine phosphorylation, which occurs during myeloid differentiation (6Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICSBP also activates gene transcription by interaction with PRDI-consensus sequences, present in some promoters. Activation of an artificial promoter construct with the PRDI consensus sequence involves interaction between ICSBP and IRF1, which requires ICSBP tyrosine phosphorylation (7Sharf R. Meraro D. Azreil A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper R. Hauser H. Levi B-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, cytokine-dependant post-translational modification of ICSBP restricts transcription of some target genes to mature phagocytes (7Sharf R. Meraro D. Azreil A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper R. Hauser H. Levi B-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional activation, ICSBP also has transcriptional repression activity. Non-tyrosine-phosphorylated ICSBP impacts transcription via direct, IRF1-independent interaction with PRDI consensus sequences (7Sharf R. Meraro D. Azreil A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper R. Hauser H. Levi B-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Only non-tyrosine-phosphorylated ICSBP binds directly to DNA (7Sharf R. Meraro D. Azreil A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper R. Hauser H. Levi B-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that post-translational modification also regulates ICSBP repression activity. The only known genuine ICSBP repression target is the gene encoding the antiapoptotic protein, BclXL (8Gabriele L. Phung J. Fukumoto J. Segal D. Wang I.M. Giannakakou P. Giese N.A. Ozato K. Morse H.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). BclXL is expressed in mature myeloid cells in response to inflammatory mediators, such as lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ (9Chatterjee D. Han Z. Mendoza J. Goodglick L. Hendrickson E.A. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1083-1089PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, BclXL expression increases survival of activated phagocytes (9Chatterjee D. Han Z. Mendoza J. Goodglick L. Hendrickson E.A. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1083-1089PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon these identified target genes, one would anticipate ICSBP deficiency to be characterized by terminal differentiation block and immune dysfunction. Indeed, this is the phenotype of the IRF1-deficient mouse (10Fehr T. Schoedon G. Odermatt B. Holtschke T. Schneemann M. Bachmann M.F. Mak T.W. Horak I. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Instead, 100% of mice with the ICSBP gene disruption develop a myeloproliferative disorder, resembling human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (11Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno J. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K-P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bauchman M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse H.C. Ozato K. Horak I. Cell. 1996; 87: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Similar to CML, the majority of ICSBP–/– mice develop blast crisis, fatal in 35% of the mice at 4 months (11Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno J. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K-P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bauchman M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse H.C. Ozato K. Horak I. Cell. 1996; 87: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, ICSBP expression is decreased in human CML blast crisis (12Schmidt M. Nagel S. Proba J. Thiede C. Ritter M. Waring J.F. Rosenbauer F. Huhn D. Wittig B. Horak I. Neubauer A. Blood. 1998; 91: 22-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and forced overexpression of ICSBP delays blast crisis in a Bcr/Abl-expressing murine model (13Hao S.X. Ren R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that ICSBP is a leukemia anti-oncogene but do not indicate the mechanisms for this function. Bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells from ICSBP–/– mice exhibit greater than normal colony formation, in response to low doses of GM-CSF or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (referred to as “hypersensitivity”) (14Scheller M. Foerster J. Heyworth C.M. Waring J.F. Lohler J. Gilmore G.L. Shadduck R.K. Dexter T.M. Horak I. Blood. 1999; 94: 3764-3771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar hypersensitivity to cytokines (including GM-CSF, IL-3, and stem cell factor) is also seen in bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells from mice with NF1 gene disruption (15Zhang Y.Y. Vik T.A. Ryder J.W. Srour E.F. Jacks T. Shannon K. Clapp D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). NF1 encodes the Ras-GAP neurofibromin 1 (Nf1), which inactivates Ras in hematopoietic cells (16Boguski M. McCorkick F. Nature. 1990; 366: 643-653Crossref Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Mutations that inactivate Nf1 or activate Ras have been described in the myeloproliferative disorder, juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (17Bollag G. Clapp D.W. Shih S. Adler F. Zhang Y. Thompson P. Lange B.J. Freedman M.H. McCormick F. Jacks T. Shannon K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This disorder is also characterized by GM-CSF and stem cell factor hypersensitivity (18Ingram D.A. Wenning M.J. Shannon K. Clapp D.W. Blood. 2003; 101: 1984-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In Nf1-deficient hematopoietic cells, increased Ras activity increases ERK and Akt activation, increasing proliferation (19Birnbaum R.A. O'Marcaigh A. Wardak Z. Zhang Y.Y. Dranoff G. Jacks T. Clapp D.W. Shannon K.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and decreasing apoptosis (20Donovan S. See W. Bonifas J. Stokoe D. Shannon K.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 507-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, ICSBP and Nf1 deficiency states are both characterized by a myeloproliferative disorder, which includes an increased response to hematopoietic cytokines. These results suggest the possibility of a functional association between ICSBP and Nf1. Consistent with this, our current investigations identify the NF1 gene as an ICSBP activation target. Therefore, our results suggest that one mechanism of myeloproliferation in ICSBP-deficiency is impaired regulation of cytokine-induced Ras activity. Plasmids—The cDNA for human ICSBP was obtained from Dr. BenZion Levi (Technion, Haifa, Israel), and the full-length cDNA was generated by PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNAamp for U937 transfection experiments. The cDNA was also subcloned into the pMSCVpuro vector for retroviral production (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Constructs with the cDNA for the Nf1 GAP-related domain (GRD; amino acids 1204–1535) and a GAP-activity mutant Nf1-GRD (R1276K) in the pMSCVpuro vector were a kind gift of Dr. D. Wade Clapp (Indiana University, Indianapolis). The proximal 973 bp of the human NF1 5′-flank was a kind gift of Dr. Meena Upadhyaya (Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff, UK). The promoter fragment was subcloned into the pCATE reporter vector (Stratagene). A 230-bp NF1 promoter truncation mutant was generated by taking advantage of a SmaI site in the 5′-flank. Truncation mutants were also generated by PCR and subcloned into the pCATE vector. Mutants were generated including the proximal 337 and 315 bp of the human NF1 promoter. All PCR products were sequenced to ensure no unintentional mutations had been introduced. Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by MWG Biotech (Piedmont, NC). Oligonucleotides that were used for analysis of co-immunoprecipitated chromatin were used to amplify the human promoter regions of the following genes: CYBB (F, 5′-tcagttgaccaatgattattagccatt-3′; R, 5′-ctatgcttcttcttccaatgaccaaat-3′) (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); NCF2 (F, 5′-gcagaagcattttggggaactgatcct-3′; R, 5′-aaaatccacaggaaatgtcccaccttt-3′) (3Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); TOLL-like receptor 4 (F, 5′-gatgactaattgggataaaagccaact-3′; R, 5′-tggagaggaagtgaaagcggcaacctta-3′) (4Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); and NF1 (F, 5′-cagaggaaaagctgggcttaaat-3′; R, 5′-agatctgtcctccccgcggccgggg-3′) (21Cooper O.M. Upadhyaya M. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were also designed to amplify a conserved region of the proximal murine NF1 promoter, including the putative ICSBP-binding site, homologous to the PRDI-IRF-binding consensus (mNF1; F, 5′-ggatcccacttccggtggggtgtcatggcggcc-3′; R, 5′-gtcctcccggcgacccgggg-3′) (22Hajra A. Martin-Gallardo A. Tarle S.A. Freedman M. Wilson-Gunn S. Bernards A. Collins F.S. Genomics. 1994; 21: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were designed with BamHI half-sites on the ends to facilitate subcloning into plasmid vectors for sequence verification of the PCR products. Oligonucleotides used to generate truncation mutants of the human NF1 promoter were designed as follows: NF1-337 F (5′-ggatcccacttccggtggggtgtcatggc-3′); NF1-315 F (5′-catggcggcgtctcggactgtgatggctgt-3′); NF1-3′ R(5′-gtcctccccgcggccgggg-3′) (22Hajra A. Martin-Gallardo A. Tarle S.A. Freedman M. Wilson-Gunn S. Bernards A. Collins F.S. Genomics. 1994; 21: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These primers were designed with BglII half-sites to facilitate subcloning into plasmid vectors. Oligonucleotides used in quantitative real time PCR were designed to amplify the following messages: gp91PHOX (F, 5′-gagagccagatgcaggaaag-3′; R, 5′-ggtgcacagcaaagtgattg-3′); actin (F, 5′-gatgagattggcatggcttt-3′; R, 5′-caccttcaccgttccagttt-3′); Nf1 (F, 5′-agccaccacctagaatcgaa-3′; R, 5′-ggccgcatatgttcttcttt-3′); and 18 S rRNA (F, 5′-accgcggttctattttgttg-3′; R, 5′-cggtccaagaatttcacctc-3′). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were used in EMSA. Oligonucleotides were designed to the NF1 promoter sequence with homology to the IRF-binding, PRDI consensus (NF1-337 5′-ggatcccacttccggtggggtgtcatggc-3′) for use as a DNA-labeled probe in EMSA. Double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were the PRDI consensus (5′-tcactttcactttcactt-3′) (7Sharf R. Meraro D. Azreil A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper R. Hauser H. Levi B-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the CCAAT box from the α-globin gene as an irrelevant competitor (5′-ggcggcgcttcattggctggcgcggagcccg-3′) (6Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PRDI-like sequence and the PRDI-consensus in these oligonucleotides are underlined. These oligonucleotides were all designed with BamHI half-sites on the ends to facilitate subcloning into plasmid vectors. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (23Larrick J.W. Fischer D.G. Anderson S.J. Koren H.A. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft (University of Colorado, Denver). Cells were maintained and differentiated as described (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For differentiation experiments, U937 cells were treated for 48 h with 400 units/ml human recombinant IFNγ (Roche Applied Science) (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Cloning—U937 cells were cultured with or without IFNγ for 48 h, as described (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells for chromatin immunoprecipitation were incubated with formaldehyde prior to lysis, and lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments with an average size of 2.0 kb, as described (24Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Lysates underwent two rounds of immunoprecipitation with either antiserum to ICSBP (a kind gift of Dr. Stephanie Vogel) or preimmune serum, as described (24Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Some immunoprecipitated chromatin was treated with Klenow fragment to create blunt ends and ligated into a plasmid vector. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli, and transformants with inserts were identified and sequenced according to standard techniques. The sequences of chromatin inserts were analyzed by searching GenBank™ and the National Center for Biological Information (NCBI) Human Genome Data base. The remainder of the U937 immunoprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR for ICSBP antibody-specific co-precipitation of the CYBB, NCF2, TLR4, and NF1 genes. For these experiments, input chromatin was a positive control, and chromatin precipitated by preimmune serum was a negative control. PCR products were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identity of the PCR product was verified by subcloning into a plasmid vector, followed by dideoxysequencing. In similar experiments, chromatin was co-immunoprecipitated with ICSBP antibody or irrelevant (glutathione S-transferase (GST)) control antibody from murine bone marrow mononuclear cells, cultured for 24 h in GM-CSF, followed by 72-h differentiation in M-CSF. For these experiments, wild type murine bone marrow was compared with ICSBP–/– bone marrow, which was a negative control in these experiments. Input (nonprecipitated chromatin) was a positive control, as above. PCRs were performed with primers to amplify the proximal NF1 promoter (see above). ICSBP Knock-out Mice—Mice with homologous disruption of the ICSBP gene were a generous gift of Dr. Keiko Ozato (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Generation of these mice has been previously described (11Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno J. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K-P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bauchman M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse H.C. Ozato K. Horak I. Cell. 1996; 87: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Homozygous ICSBP–/– mice and wild type litter mates were sacrificed at 8 weeks of age, when ICSBP–/– mice are in proliferative phase (11Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno J. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K-P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bauchman M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse H.C. Ozato K. Horak I. Cell. 1996; 87: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and bone marrow was harvested from the femurs according to standard methods. Culture of ICSBP–/– Myeloid Cells—Bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained from the femurs of ICSBP–/– and wild type litter mates. ScaI+ cells were separated using the Miltenyi magnetic bead system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotechnology, Auburn, CA). These cells were cultured (at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml) for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml murine GM-CSF (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and 5 ng/ml murine recombinant IL-3 (R&D Systems). Then cells were either maintained in GM-CSF + IL-3 (myeloid progenitor cells) or switched to DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml murine recombinant M-CSF (R&D Systems) for 72 h (monocyte differentiation), with or without 200 units/ml recombinant murine IFNγ (Roche Applied Science) for the last 24 h. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were used in Western blot experiments, as described below. Some ICSBP–/– bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured long term in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/ml murine GM-CSF (R&D Systems), and 5 ng/ml murine recombinant IL-3 (R&D Systems), as described (25Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). After 3 months of passage, these cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and found to be negative for the B-cell marker CD19 and the T-cell marker CD3, dimly positive for myeloid marker CD14, and dimly positive to negative for Mac1α (CD11b) and Gr1. Retroviral Transduction of ICSBP–/– Murine Bone Marrow Myeloid Cells—High titer murine stem cell retroviral supernatants were produced using the pMSCV vector and PT67 cell line, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Filtered retroviral supernatants were used immediately or stored at –80 °C. Transductions of long term cultured murine bone marrow myeloid cells from ICSBP–/– mice were performed as previously described (26Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kamps M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, and 4.0 × 106 cells were plated in 3 ml of DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 5 ng/ml IL-3. An equal volume of retroviral supernatant was added to each dish, and Polybrene was added to a final concentration of 6 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and then diluted 3-fold with media, supplemented as above. Cells were incubated overnight, and the procedure was repeated the next day. The day after transduction, puromycin was added to 1.2 ng/ml. Cells were selected in antibiotics for 96 h and then treated with cytokines as indicated. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Expression of transduced proteins was independently verified by Western blots for each experiment. Western Blots, Immunoprecipitation, and Ras Activity Assays—For Western blots of wild type and ICSBP–/– murine bone marrow myeloid cells, cell pellets were lysed by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer (without Coomassie Blue). Protein assays were performed by standard methods, and equivalent amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Similar experiments were performed with long term cultured ICSBP–/– cells, transduced with murine stem cell retroviral vectors for protein expression, as indicated. In these experiments, the total amount of protein was either 30 μg (Fig. 2C) or 50 μg (Fig. 2D). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blots were probed with antibodies to neurofibromin 1, phospho-ERK, and ERK1/2 (obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. In other experiments, wild type murine bone marrow myeloid cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, as previously described (3Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates (1,000 μg) were immunoprecipitated with ICSBP antiserum (see above) or control preimmune serum. Immunoprecipitates were collected with Staph protein A-Sepharose and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blots were sequentially probed with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate, Waltham, MA) and ICSBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Ras activity assays, murine bone marrow myeloid cells or long term cultured ICSBP–/– myeloid cells were lysed in MLB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates (150 μg) were precleared with recombinant GST conjugated to glutathione-agarose. Lysates were next incubated with glutathione-agarose conjugated to a GST fusion protein of the Ras binding domain (RBD) from Raf-1 (Upstate), or control GST-glutathione-agarose, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were extensively washed in MLB buffer, and precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by probing Western blots with an anti-Ras antibody (pan-Ras; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total cell lysates (20 μg) were also separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed with pan-Ras antibody to determine the abundance of total Ras protein. Cell Proliferation Assays—Long term cultured, transduced ICSBP–/– cells were selected for 96 h in puromycin prior to proliferation assays. Cells were harvested and plated at 105 cells/200 μl in a 96-well dish in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and serial dilutions of GM-CSF or M-CSF (10-fold from 10 to 0.01 ng/ml or no cytokine). Cells were incubated for either 24 h (GM-CSF or M-CSF) or 72 h (M-CSF) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, with [3H]thymidine for the last 8 h. Cells were harvested, and TCA-precipitated DNA was counted by scintillation counting, according to standard techniques. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated, as previously described (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the ImPromII reverse transcriptase kit, according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using the ABI 7900 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and results were analyzed using SDS version 2.1 software (Austin Biodiversity Web site gallery). Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—U937 cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cells (32 × 106 cells/sample) were transfected with a vector to express ICSBP (ICSBP/pcDNAamp) or empty vector control; the pCATE reporter vector with the proximal 973 bp of the human NF1 promoter (973NF1), 337 bp (337NF1), 315 bp (315NF1), 230 bp (230NF1), or empty pCATE vector control and p-CMVβgal (as a control for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were harvested 48 h after transfection, with and without incubation with recombinant human IFNγ (400 units/ml). Lysates were analyzed for CAT and β-galactosidase activity, as described (2Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 139"
https://openalex.org/W2157033357,"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a hematopoietic specific mammalian Ste20-like protein kinase and has been implicated in many cellular signaling pathways including T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. However, little is known about the in vivo regulation of HPK1. We present evidence that HPK1 is positively regulated by protein phosphatase 4 (PP4; also called PPX and PPP4), a serine/threonine phosphatase. We found that PP4 interacted with HPK1 and that the proline-rich region of HPK1 was necessary and sufficient for this interaction. We also found that PP4 had phosphatase activity toward HPK1 in vivo and that co-transfection of PP4 with HPK1 resulted in specific kinase activation of HPK1. Moreover, we found that the PP4-induced HPK1 kinase activation was accompanied by an increase in protein expression of HPK1. Pulse-chase analysis showed that PP4 increased the half-life of HPK1. Further studies showed that HPK1 was subject to regulation by ubiquitination and ubiquitin-targeted degradation and that PP4 inhibited HPK1 ubiquitination. In addition, we found that TCR stimulation enhanced the PP4-HPK1 interaction and that wild-type PP4 enhanced, whereas a phosphatase-dead PP4 mutant inhibited, TCR-induced activation of HPK1 in Jurkat T cells. Combined with the observation that PP4 enhanced HPK1-induced JNK activation, our studies identify PP4 as a positive regulator for HPK1 and the HPK1-JNK signaling pathway.

In our effort to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the positive regulation of the JNK pathway by PP4, we found that PP4 interacted with and stabilized HPK1, leading to increased kinase activation of HPK1. In addition, PP4 enhanced the HPK1-induced JNK activation. We also observed that TCR stimulation enhanced the PP4-HPK1 interaction and that PP4 was involved in the kinase activation of HPK1 by TCR stimulation. These observations suggest that PP4 is a positive regulator for HPK1 and the HPK1-JNK signaling pathway.

Cells and Transfection—Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin. HEK293T cells were plated at a density of either 1.5 × 105 cells/35-mm well or 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected the next day using the modified calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media, Inc., Lavallette, NJ). Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding β-galactosidase (0.15 μg) in combination with an empty vector or various amounts of plasmids encoding phosphatases, phosphatase mutants, kinases, or kinase mutants as indicated in the figure legends to monitor the transfection efficiency. For those multiple transfections with identical component(s) (e.g. FLAG-HPK1 or FLAG-HPK1 plus PP4 in Fig. 6 and FLAG-HPK1 in Fig. 7A), we controlled transfection efficiency by performing FLAG-HPK1 transfection in 100-mm dishes and pooling the cells and aliquoting them into 6-well plates the next day after changing the medium. Jurkat cells (2 × 107/0.5 ml) were transiently transfected by electroporation (263 V, two pulses, and 10 ms) using a BTX Electro Square Porter T 820 (San Diego, CA). After electroporation, the cells were pooled (4 × 106/ml) and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed and resuspended in plain RPMI 1640 at a cell density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. 100 μl of the cell suspension (1 × 107) was aliquoted to tubes and incubated with 1 μl of anti-CD3 (OKT3) ascites for 10 min on ice. Goat anti-mouse antibody was added to cross-link the anti-CD3 (OKT3) ascites for 10 min with gentle rocking at 4 °C. Cell stimulations were performed at 37 °C for various time periods as indicated in the figure legend.Fig. 7HPK1 is subject to ubiquitin-targeted degradation. A, LLnL stabilizes HPK1. HEK293T cells (1.5 × 105 cells in 35-mm wells) were transfected with 0.5 μg of FLAG-HPK1. After 24 h, the cells were treated with various concentrations of LLnL as indicated for 16 h. The cell lysate was prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (top). The blot was then reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody (bottom). B, HPK1 is ubiquitinated. HEK293T cells (1.5 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes) were transfected with vector alone, HA-ubiquitin (0.2 μg) alone, FLAG-HPK1 (5 μg) alone, or FLAG-HPK1 (5 μg) plus HA-ubiquitin (0.2 μg) with or without treatment of LLnL (20 μm) for 16 h. The cells were collected 40 h post-transfection. FLAG-HPK1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting (WB) using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (upper panel). The expression of FLAG-HPK1 was monitored by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (lower panel). C, PP4 inhibits HPK1 ubiquitination. HEK293T cells (1.5 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes) were co-transfected with FLAG-HPK1 (5 μg) plus PP4 (10 μg) or PP4-RL (10 μg) in the presence of HA-ubiquitin (0.2 μg). The cells were collected 40 h post-transfection. FLAG-HPK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (upper panel).

Western blot analysis was performed using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling HPK1 in Vivo—HEK293T cells (1.5 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes) were transfected with vector, FLAG-HPK1 (10 μg) alone, FLAG-HPK1 (10 μg) plus PP4 (10 μg), or FLAG-HPK1 (10 μg) plus PP4-RL (10 μg). Empty vector was used to normalize the amount of transfected DNA. 40 h post-transfection, the cells were maintained in the serum-free, phosphate-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then labeled in the phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum and 100 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS twice to remove free [32P]orthophosphate. FLAG-HPK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and autoradiographed. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Pulse-chase experiments were performed using the [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture to monitor changes in the half-life of HPK1 in the presence or the absence of PP4. Briefly, 1.5 × 105 HEK293T cells/35-mm well were transfected with FLAG-HPK1 (0.2 μg) alone or with FLAG-HPK1 (0.2 μg) plus PP4 (2 μg). 36 h after transfection, the cells were starved in DMEM without methionine and cysteine for 1 h and then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 4 h. HEK293T cells were then chased in nonradioactive medium for the time periods as indicated. Cells were lysed, and the cell samples containing equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2). Immunocomplexes were collected with immobilized protein G-Sepharose beads and resolved on SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. HPK1 Interacts with PP4 through Its Proline-rich Region—We have previously found that PP4 acts as a positive regulator for the JNK pathway during TNF-α signaling and that PP4 probably exerts its effect on JNK in an indirect manner, since no direct PP4-JNK interaction was detected (46Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. VanHooser A. Hu M. C.-T. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6391-6398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

In our effort to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the positive regulation of the JNK pathway by PP4, we sought to identify the target(s) of PP4 within the JNK pathway. We co-transfected PP4 into HEK293T cells with an individual upstream activating kinase of the JNK pathway, including MAPK kinases, MAPK kinase kinases, and MAPK kinase kinase kinases, followed by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting. We found that HPK1 is one of the upstream activating kinases that interacted with PP4. As shown in Fig. 1, FLAG-HPK1 was co-immunoprecipitated with PP4 when a specific anti-PP4 antibody (46Zhou G."
https://openalex.org/W2030879799,"Two dissimilar seryl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (SerRSs) exist in <i>Methanosarcina barkeri</i>, one of bacterial type and the other resembling SerRSs present only in some methanogenic archaea. To investigate the requirements of these enzymes for tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> recognition, serylation of variant transcripts of <i>M. barkeri</i> tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> was kinetically analyzed <i>in vitro</i> with pure enzyme preparations. Characteristically for the serine system, the length of the variable arm was shown to be crucial for both enzymes, as was the identity of the discriminator base (G73). Moreover, a novel determinant for the specific tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> recognition was identified as the anticodon stem base pair G30:C40; its contribution to the efficiency of serylation was remarkable for both SerRSs. However, despite these similarities, the two SerRSs do not possess a uniform mode of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> recognition, and additional determinants are necessary for serylation specificity by the methanogenic enzyme. In particular, the methanogenic SerRS relies on G1:C72 identity and on the number of unpaired nucleotides at the base of the variable stem for tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> recognition, unlike its bacterial type counterpart. We propose that such a distinction between the two enzymes in tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> identity determinants reflects their evolutionary pathways, hence attesting to their diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1994228885,"Biochemical, luminescence and mass spectroscopy approaches indicate that Trp-151 (helix V) plays an important role in hydrophobic stacking with the galactopyranosyl ring of substrate and that Glu-269 (helix VIII) is essential for substrate affinity and specificity. The x-ray structure of the lactose permease (LacY) with bound substrate is consistent with these conclusions and suggests that a possible H-bond between Glu-269 and Trp-151 may play a critical role in the architecture of the binding site. We have now probed this relationship by exploiting the intrinsic luminescence of a single Trp-151 LacY with various replacements for Glu-269. Mutations at position 269 dramatically alter the environment of Trp-151 in a manner that correlates with binding affinity of LacY substrates. Furthermore, chemical modification of Trp-151 with N-bromosuccinimide indicates that Glu-269 forms an H-bond with the indole N. It is concluded that 1) an H-bond between the indole N and Glu-269 optimizes the formation of the substrate binding site in the inward facing conformation of LacY, and 2) the disposition of the residues implicated in sugar binding in different conformers suggests that sugar binding by LacY involves induced fit."

This modulation accelerates spiking and increases [Ca2+]i. Using patch clamp, calcium imaging, and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the signaling pathway of NHD-induced current modulation. The membrane depolarization produced by NHD was related to the increase in membrane conductance for Ca2+, Ba2+, or Sr2+. This increase was abolished by LOE 908, an inhibitor of noncapacitive Ca2+ entry (NCCE), and it was strongly attenuated by the phospholipase C inhibitor U37122 and the diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor RHC80267. Arachidonic acid and ETYA mimicked the NHD effect on background current. This was abolished by l-NAME and ODQ, inhibitors of NO synthase and NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase, respectively, but mimicked by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside and 8-bromo-cGMP. Immunocytochemistry using cGMP antibodies indicated that NHD and ETYA increase cGMP. Inhibition of protein kinase G with KT5823 and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS had no effect, whereas zaprinast, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5,6,9 inhibitor, mimicked the NHD effect. Furthermore, inhibition of the cGMP-activated phosphodiesterase 2 by EHNA and trequinsin abolished the effect of NHD. We conclude that the final step of the NHD signal transduction is the phosphodiesterase 2-induced down-regulation of the cAMP level. This removes a depression of NCCE directly attributed to cAMP because inhibition of protein kinase A with KT5720, Rp-cAMPS, and PKI14-22 amide did not mimic the NHD effect.

In neurons, calcium influx is mainly accomplished by voltage-gated calcium channels or by receptor-operated calcium channels, e.g. N-methyl-d-asparatic acid receptors (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). In addition, calcium release from intracellular stores can be either induced, for example, by mobilizing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or by enhancing calcium influx through voltage-gated or receptor-operated calcium channels (i.e. calcium-induced calcium release). Furthermore, depletion of intracellular calcium stores can activate a capacitative calcium entry (CCE) through store-operated calcium channels that serve as the main calcium entry route in various non-excitable cells. This capacitative pathway is not the only pathway through which calcium can enter into the cells in response to receptor activation. Many cells can also express additional pathways such as non-capacitative calcium entry (NCCE), which are, for some of them, modulated by production of arachidonic acid (AA) (2Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J.

Up to date the physiological role of such NCCE together with the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the modulation of this calcium entry mechanism still remains unknown, particularly in pacemaker neurosecretory cells. Because the regulation of ionic conductance is a central key in tuning cellular activity according to physiological demands, the present study has been focused on the mechanism by which a neuronal voltage-independent calcium background current, suspected to be related to NCCE, is modulated. Investigations have been performed on identified insect neurosecretory neurons, namely efferent dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons (5Burrows M. The Neurobiology of an Insect Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996Crossref Google Scholar). These cells that contain the biogenic amine octopamine display a pacemaker activity that involves, for example, a variety of voltage-gated calcium currents (6Grolleau F. Lapied B. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Wicher D. Penzlin H. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as a voltage-independent calcium background current (8Wicher D. Walther C. Penzlin H. J. Comp. Physiol. Sect. A. 1994; 174: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The latter can be blocked by cadmium (8Wicher D. Walther C. Penzlin H. J. Comp. Physiol. Sect. A. 1994; 174: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), NPPB, and mefenamic acid (9Heine M. Wicher D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3309-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This current seems to be physiologically important for: 1) adjusting the free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (9Heine M. Wicher D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3309-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and 2) filling intracellular calcium stores (10Messutat S. Heine M. Wicher D. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is particularly modulated by the adipokinetic hormone neurohormone D (NHD; pQVNF-SPNWNH2) known to accelerate spiking by enhancing calcium influx via the activation of this calcium background current (8Wicher D. Walther C. Penzlin H. J. Comp. Physiol. Sect. A. 1994; 174: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Heine M. Wicher D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3309-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further demonstrate that calcium entry via this background current is linked to a NCCE mechanism. Using electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and immunocytochemistry, we have identified, for the first time in pacemaker neurons, a complex intracellular signaling pathway involving AA and the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC)/cGMP cascade that indirectly modulate this NCCE. We also report that NCCE, mediating an increase in intracellular calcium evoked by physiological concentration of NHD, is an important regulator of neurosecretory cell firing properties. Materials—AA, 8-Br-cAMP, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), trequinsin, and tetrodotoxin were obtained from Sigma; 8-Br-cGMP, Rp-cAMPS, and PKI from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany); EHNA, l-NAME, ODQ, and zaprinast from Tocris (Ellisville, MO), ETYA and OAG from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany); KT5823, rolipram, and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS from VWR (Fontenay Sous Bois, France), NHD from Peninsula (Belmont, CA), RHC80267 from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and U73122 from RBI (Natick, MA). Finally, LOE 908 was kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany). Cell Isolation—Isolation of adult DUM neuron cell bodies was performed under sterile conditions using enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation of the median parts of both fifth and terminal abdominal ganglia of adult male cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), as described previously (8Wicher D. Walther C. Penzlin H. J. Comp. Physiol. Sect. A. 1994; 174: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Lapied B. Malecot C.O. Pelhate M. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 144: 535-550Google Scholar). Briefly, ganglia were excised, desheathed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in bath solution (BS1) containing (in mm): 190 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (type II, Sigma) and 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (type I, Sigma). After thoroughly washing off the enzyme the ganglia were stored in BS1 for at least 1 h. Subsequently isolated DUM neuron cell bodies were immediately used or maintained at 29 °C for 24 h before experiments were carried out. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological experiments on isolated DUM cell bodies were performed at room temperature using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Pipettes having resistances of 1-2 mΩ were pulled with a P-87 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) from borosilicate capillary tubes (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany). Current/voltage measurements and data acquisition were performed using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier controlled by PULSE software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Membrane resting potential and spiking of DUM neurons were recorded under current-clamp conditions without current injection (except when otherwise stated). Neurons were bathed in bath solution BS1 (cf. “Cell Isolation”). Patch pipettes (resistance >1.5 mΩ) were filled with pipette solution (PS1) composed of 190 mm K-gluconate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.25). Between recordings (duration 1 s) the cells were held under voltage clamp at a holding potential of –70 mV. Background currents were measured under voltage-clamp with holding potential of –50 mV. Currents were measured at the end of 40-ms lasting pulses ranging from –120 to –50 mV and taken for analysis without leakage correction. The pipette solution (PS2) contained (in mm): 100 choline methyl sulfate (CMS), 60 CsOH, 8 CsCl, 30 tetraethylammonium-Br, 2 MgATP, 1 CaCl2, 3 EGTA, 10 HEPES. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated to amount to 63 nm (WEBMAXC (12Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)). The bath solution BS2 contained (in mm): 190 choline methyl sulfate, 5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin. When using Ba2+ or Sr2+ as charge carrier the 5 mm Ca2+ were substituted with 5 mm Ba2+ or Sr2+, or 3 mm Sr2+. The pH value was adjusted to 7.4 and 7.25 for bath and pipette solutions, respectively. Liquid junction potential between pipette and bath solution was taken into account before establishing the seal. This combination of bath and pipette solutions allowed measurements of isolated Ca2+ currents ∼2 min after breaking into the cell. Application or washout of blocking agents was performed with the bath perfusion system BPS4 (ALA, New York). Fluorescence Optic Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in BS1 (cf. “Cell Isolation”) containing 2 μm fura-2/acetomethylester for 20 min.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Light exciting fura-2 at 340 and 380 nm, provided by Polychrome II (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany), was coupled via an epifluorescence condenser into an Axioskop FS (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a water immersion objective (LUMPFL 40xW/IR/0.8; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Emitted light was separated by a 400-nm dichroic mirror and filtered with a 420-nm long-pass filter. The free [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+]i = Keff(R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R). The Keff, Rmin, and Rmax were determined using DUM neurons permeabilized with 2 μm ionomycin and three solutions with different calcium concentrations (Ca2+ free, 5 mm Ca2+, and 500 nm Ca2+). The 500 nm calcium concentration solution was calculated with WEBMAXC (12Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and measured with calcium-sensitive electrodes (KWIK tips; WPI, Berlin, Germany). The values of Keff, Rmin, and Rmax were 3.72, 0.38, and 5.9 μm, respectively. Photomultiplier-based Fluorescence Detection and Fluorescence Imaging—The fluorescence detection area of interest (∼200 μm2) amounting to about 10% of the cross-section of a DUM neuron was adjusted with a “view finder” system (T.I.L.L. Photonics). Fluorescence was monitored using a photomultiplier-based Fluorescence Detection Unit (T.I.L.L. Photonics). Data were acquired with the PULSE + XCHART software (HEKA Elektronik). For recordings lasting up to 700 s, fluorescence signals upon 340 and 380 nm excitation were subsequently registered at 80-ms intervals for both wavelengths with intervening intervals of 0.5 s length without illumination. Off-line data processing was performed with IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Fluorescence images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Imago, T.I.L.L. Photonics) controlled by TILLVision 4.0 (T.I.L.L. Photonics). Image pairs were obtained by excitation for 100 ms at 340 and 380 nm, with a 10-s intervening interval. Regions of interest were off-line defined and analyzed. Immunocytochemistry—For light microscope immunocytochemistry, isolated DUM neuron cell bodies were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% (w/v) sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After fixation, cells were washed 3 times for 5 min each in PBS and 5 min in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). To block nonspecific binding of the primary antibody, cell bodies were preincubated with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T for 1 h. Primary antiserum (sheep anti-formaldehyde fixed cGMP, generous gift of Dr. J. De Vente), diluted 1/2000 in PBS-T was applied overnight at 4 °C. After repeated washing in PBS-T, the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Euromedex, France), diluted 1/150 in PBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin was applied for 3 h at 20 °C in the dark. Isolated DUM neuron cell bodies were then washed in 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS and mounted on glass slides in glycerol/PBS. The fluorescence detection was captured using an Axiocam HRC camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Images were digitized with Axiovision and stored as TIF format files for later analysis. Data Analysis—Results were given as mean ± S.D. or S.E., n = number of cells. The evaluation of statistical significance of differences was performed with Student's t test. For data analysis including fitting procedures, the software IGOR (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) or Prism 4 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA) was used. Peptidergic Regulation of Background Current—Bath application of the adipokinetic hormone, NHD (10 nm), depolarized the resting membrane potential of DUM neurons from -60.1 ± 1.8 mV (n = 9) to -45.7 ± 2.4 mV (n = 12; Fig. 1A). Under experimental conditions that suppressed Na+ and K+ currents in DUM neurons and only allowed Ca2+ currents, NHD generated a voltage-independent current in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Linear approximation of the reversal potential of the NHD-induced current gave figures around 0 mV. Alternatively, the currents could be reasonably well fitted by a conductance showing Goldman rectification because of the Ca2+ gradient across the membrane (Fig. 1B). Whereas CCE channels show higher Ca2+ selectivity, NCCE channels conduct Ca2+,Ba2+, and Sr2+ equally well (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the NHD effect when Ca2+ was substituted with Ba2+ or Sr2+. The size of those currents recorded with Ba2+ or Sr2+ as charge carrier did not significantly differ from that of Ca2+ currents (Fig. 1C). It was previously shown that NHD up-regulated a constitutively active background current rather than a receptor-activated or store-operated current (9Heine M. Wicher D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3309-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Messutat S. Heine M. Wicher D. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The latter was confirmed with experiments using thapsigargin. As indicated in Fig. 1C, the size of the Sr2+ current generated by 10 nm NHD was not significantly changed by prior store depletion with thapsigargin (1 μm). Furthermore, LOE 908, a blocker of NCCE (4Moneer Z. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), reduced a voltage-independent Sr2+ current. This LOE908-sensitive current (LOE – control) is shown in Fig. 1D and represents a current that is constitutively active. In the presence of LOE 908 (40 μm), NHD failed to increase the Sr2+ current in the voltage range between –60 and –120 mV (shown for –90 mV in Fig. 1E). In the same way, as illustrated in Fig. 1F, the depolarization of membrane potential induced by NHD was strongly reduced by LOE 908. Because NCCE is evoked by activation of phospholipase C (PLC) in many preparations (e.g. Ref. 3Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we tested whether inhibition of this enzyme would impair the NHD effect. Pretreatment of DUM neurons with U37122 (3 μm), an inhibitor of PLC, caused a dramatic reduction of the response to 10 nm NHD (Fig. 2A). PLC activation leads to the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), which both could potentially mediate the NHD effect on background current. An earlier study (9Heine M. Wicher D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3309-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) has shown that inhibition of the IP3 receptor with heparin had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ signals evoked by the NHD-induced increase of Ca2+ background current. In addition, and as indicated above, depletion of Ca2+ stores by pretreatment of cells with 1 μm thapsigargin (an event expected as a result of IP3 production) did not affect the NHD-induced potentiation of background current (10Messutat S. Heine M. Wicher D. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus IP3 does not seem to play a significant role in controlling the Ca2+ background current. Therefore we tried to mimic the effect of NHD with the DAG analog OAG. As shown in Fig. 2B,1 μm OAG induced a voltage-independent Sr2+ current within 2 min after application. Subsequent application of NHD (even at 20 nm) did not lead to a remarkable further current increase (Fig. 2B). This supports the conclusion that indeed DAG mediates, either directly or indirectly, the peptide effect on background current. DAG, for example, activates certain members of the TRP channel family (14Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) and it is not excluded that a Trp channel might be responsible for the background current. On the other hand, DAG is known to be metabolized by DAG lipase to AA, which also activates NCCE (15Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether DAG modulates the background channel in DUM neurons directly or via generation of AA (or other AA derivatives) we blocked DAG lipase with RHC80267 (3Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the presence of RHC80267 (50 μm), there was no significant response to 10 nm NHD (Fig. 2A). Thus DAG itself is not capable of acting on the background channel but it has to be metabolized to AA to up-regulate the background current. If this was true, AA should mimic the DAG effect. Indeed, AA (10 μm) evoked a Sr2+ background current very similar in size to that of evoked by 1 μm OAG (Fig. 2C). To exclude the possibility that AA metabolites were involved in up-regulating the background current, ETYA (10 μm), an acetylenic AA analog that blocks all AA-metabolizing enzymes by acting as a false substrate and mimics the response to AA, was tested. As shown in Fig. 2C, the ETYA-induced increase Sr2+ background current was very similar to that produced by AA (Fig. 2C). Role of NO-cGMP Pathway in the Regulation of the Background Calcium Current—The results described above do not necessarily imply that AA would directly act on the background channel and it remains open whether AA might affect further intracellular signaling pathways. Among possible candidates, NO and cGMP are involved in the regulation of various Ca2+ entry pathways. For example, in vascular smooth muscle cells AA stimulates NCCE via the NO system (16Moneer Z. Dyer J.L. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested the putative involvement of NO and cGMP in the intracellular regulation of NCCE by NHD in DUM neurons. As previously indicated and illustrated in Fig. 1A, a control experiment showed that NHD (10 nm) produced membrane depolarization of DUM neurons. An involvement of the NO-GC/cGMP cascade in the NHD-induced signal transduction process was studied by comparing the amplitude of the NHD-induced depolarization (normalized to the maximum effect of 10 nm NHD) before and after application of ODQ (10 μm), a selective inhibitor of NO-GC. As shown in Fig. 3A, ODQ strongly reduced the membrane depolarization produced by 10 nm NHD (by 81.9 ± 3.8%, n = 5). In line with this, ODQ abolished the NHD-induced rise in Sr2+ background current (Fig. 3B). This suggests that NHD-induced depolarization is mediated by activation of NO-GC, which in turn raises the intracellular cGMP level. According to this, enhancement of the cGMP level is expected to produce the NHD effect on background current. Indeed, application of the membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP (10 μm) caused an increase in Sr2+ background current density (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, production of NO should stimulate the NO-GC in the absence of NHD. We thus tested the effect of the NO donor SNP. In this case, SNP (1 μm) produced an increase in Sr2+ background current (Fig. 3C). Conversely, inhibition of the NO synthase with l-NAME (10 μm) abolished the effect of 10 nm NHD on this current (Fig. 3D). Also the response to 10 μm ETYA is strongly reduced (compare Figs. 2C with 3D). Finally, although l-NAME itself caused a slight current reduction that may reflect a constitutive NO synthase activity (Fig. 3D), the effect of 8-Br-cGMP remained unaffected by l-NAME (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that NHD triggers the activation of NO-GC, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP. This was further confirmed more directly by studying the effect of NHD before and after application of ODQ (10 μm) on the cGMP level using antibody raised against formaldehyde-fixed cGMP (17De Vente J. Hopkins D.A. Markerink-Van Ittersum M. Emson P.C. Schmidt H.H. Steinbusch H.W. Neuroscience. 1998; 87: 207-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Compared with control experiments (Fig. 4, A1) pretreatment with NHD (10 nm) increased cGMP immunoreactivity in DUM neurons (Fig. 4, A2). By contrast, the presence of 10 μm ODQ during incubation of DUM neurons dramatically reduced the intensity of fluorescent cGMP immunostaining observed with NHD (Fig. 4, A3). As also expected, application of 10 μm ETYA under the same experimental conditions also increased cGMP immunoreactivity (Fig. 4, B2), an effect that was reduced by ODQ (10 μm) (Fig. 4, B3). These results confirmed electrophysiological data presented above and indicated that ETYA, the analog of AA, was able to directly activate the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase.Fig. 4cGMP immunoreactivity in cultured DUM neuron cell bodies.A1 and B1, control preparation. A2 and B2, cells were treated with 10 nm NHD for 20 min (A2) and with 10 μm ETYA for 35 min (B2). In both cases, DUM neuron cell bodies exhibited an increase in cGMP immunostaining intensity. After preincubation of cells with 10 μm ODQ for 40 min, cGMP immunostaining induced by NHD (10 nm, A3) and ETYA (10 μm, B3) was completely abolished. The bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The resulting accumulation of cGMP is known to regulate complex signaling cascades through immediate downstream effectors including cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and/or cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (PDE). To study whether PKG was involved in such an effect we applied KT5823, an inhibitor of PKG. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, 1 μm KT5823, and also Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (10 μm), did not significantly affect NHD-induced depolarization, indicating that PKG does not play a role in the NHD signal transduction process. We next focused on a possible effect of cGMP in the regulation of PDEs. Among different mechanisms reported in the literature (18Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar), cGMP may regulate PDEs by increasing the activity of PDE isozymes (e.g. PDE5), known to convert cGMP to 5′-nucleoside phosphate or by altering the rate of hydrolysis of cAMP through competition at the catalytic site (e.g. PDE2). In this way, zaprinast, which inhibits cGMP-specific PDE, like PDE5, was first tested. As indicated in Fig. 5B, zaprinast (20 μm) alone was able to produce membrane depolarization of the DUM neuron very similar in amplitude to that induced by NHD. This indicates that elevation in the intracellular cGMP level resulting from zaprinast-induced inhibition of PDE mimics the effect of NHD. In addition, no significant change of membrane potential was observed when 10 nm NHD was applied in the presence of zaprinast. It should be noted that it is unlikely that NHD acted through activation of cAMP-dependent PDE because 20 μm rolipram (an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent PDE) did not significantly affect the NHD effect (Fig. 5C). To examine whether NHD-induced depolarization was modulated by a cGMP-stimulated PDE with cAMP hydrolytic activity we inhibited PDE2 with EHNA. Fig. 5D indicates that 20 μm EHNA alone produced a slight hyperpolarization of DUM cells. When NHD (10 nm) was applied in the presence of EHNA, the usually observed depolarization did not appear. Instead of this we observed a hyperpolarization similar to that obtained with EHNA alone (Fig. 5D, p > 0.05; n = 7). Trequinsin, also known to inhibit PDE2, strongly attenuated the effect of NHD on membrane potential (Fig. 5E). These results were confirmed under voltage-clamp conditions. In this case, both PDE2 inhibitors completely abolished the NHD-induced rise in the Sr2+ background current (Fig. 5F). Moreover, trequinsin also abolished the stimulating effect of 8-Br-cGMP on background current and it largely reduced the current induced by SNP (Fig. 5G). Taken together, the above results support the view that AA stimulates a NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase that in turn increases the cGMP level. This activates a cGMP-specific PDE with cAMP hydrolytic activity. Finally, the resulting decrease in cAMP level potentiates the background current. When the drop in cAMP level would cause a reduced level of background channel phosphorylation by PKA, application of PKA inhibitors"

TbetaR-V was recently found to be identical to LRP-1. Here we find that insulin and (Q3A4Y15L16) IGF-I (an IGF-I analog that has a low affinity for IGFBP-3) antagonize growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) stimulated by serum. In these cells, IGFBP-3 induces serine-specific dephosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. The IGFBP-3-induced dephosphorylation of IRS-2 is prevented by cotreatment of cells with insulin, (Q3A4Y15L16) IGF-I, or TbetaR-V/LRP-1 antagonists. The magnitude of the IRS-2 dephosphorylation induced by IGFBP-3 positively correlates with the degree of growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 in Mv1Lu cells and mutant cells derived from Mv1Lu cells. Stable transfection of murine 32D myeloid cells (which lack endogenous IRS proteins and are insensitive to growth inhibition by IGFBP-3) with IRS-1 or IRS-2 cDNA confers sensitivity to growth inhibition by IGFBP-3; this IRS-mediated growth inhibition can be completely reversed by insulin in 32D cells stably expressing IRS-2 and the insulin receptor. These results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are key molecules for the TbetaR-V/LRP-1-mediated growth inhibitory signaling cascade."

This led to the suggestion that the complex is formed by three active subunits (MCM4, MCM6, and MCM7) and three subunits with a regulatory role (MCM2, MCM3, and MCM5). However, site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that physical association between specific proteins of the two groups is required for efficient ATPase activity (12Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol.

Despite a number of studies suggesting that in eukaryotic organisms the MCM complex could act as the replicative DNA helicase, some concern was caused by the limited processivity of its DNA unwinding activity in vitro. The most direct piece of evidence that the MCM complex possesses DNA helicase activity comes from studies of the homolog proteins of Archaea. Whereas eukaryotes possess six paralogs, most archaeal species examined contain a single MCM homologue (14Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4888-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were both shown to behave as homo-hexamers in solutions. Electron microscopy analyses of MthMCM revealed ring-shaped hexameric (24Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or heptameric (25Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) assemblies. A toroidal hexameric structure was also observed for the MCM4/6/7 (10Sato M. Gotow T. You Z. Komamura-Kohno Y. Uchiyama Y. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Ishimi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and MCM2/4/6/7 (26Yabuta N. Kajimura N. Mayanagi K. Sato M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Ishimi Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) complexes purified from HeLa cells. On the other hand, the crystallographic structure of the MthMCM N-terminal portion (residues 2–286) revealed a dodecameric architecture, with two hexameric rings juxtaposed in a head-to-head configuration (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of this structure is the presence of a long central channel whose surface has a considerably high positive charge. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the full-sized MthMCM structure by electron microscopy suggests that this central channel runs throughout the entire MthMCM molecule (24Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The diameter of the positively charged channel (ranging from 23 to 47 Å) is large enough to accommodate DNA molecules in either single- or double-stranded form (24Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The present study was aimed at identifying amino acid residues of the SsoMCM protein responsible for binding/remodeling DNA. Structure-aided alignment of the MthMCM and SsoMCM sequences revealed four positively charged amino acids (Lys-129, Lys-134, His-146, and Lys-194) of the SsoMCM protein potentially pointing to the center of the putative DNA binding channel. These residues were mutated to alanine, and the site-specific mutants of SsoMCM were purified and characterized. We found that all of the above SsoMCM amino acids participate in DNA binding. Interestingly, the substitution of lysine 134 to alanine was found to affect only binding to duplex molecules, whereas single-stranded DNA binding and helicase activity were not impaired. The results of our analysis have important implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the MCM DNA helicase. Sequence Alignment—The sequence data base was searched for archaeal homologs of SsoMCM using the BLAST-PSI program (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68313) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were generated with the ClustalW program (29Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4867-4882Crossref Scopus (35064) Google Scholar) and manually modified to account for the positioning of the secondary structure elements in the MthMCM N-terminal domain structure (PDB accession code 1LTL). The sequences comprise MCM proteins from S. solfataricus (gene identifier 6015702), M. thermoautotrophicum (gene identifier 7428563), Aeropyrum pernix (gene identifier 5103579), Pyrobaculum aerophilum (gene identifier 18159702), A. fulgidus (gene identifier 32485665), Methanosarcina barkeri (gene identifier 48840405), Methanosarcina mazei (gene identifier 20906360), Methanosarcina acetivorans (gene identifier 19917905), Ferroplasma acidarmanus (gene identifier 48851904), Thermoplasma acidophilum (gene identifier 10640077), Thermoplasma volcanium (gene identifier 13541863), and Picrophilus torridus (gene identifier 48430937). The following groups of amino acid residues have been considered similar: Ile/Val/Leu/Met, Phe/Tyr/Trp, Asp/Glu, Ser/Thr, Arg/Lys, and Gly/Ala. Materials—All chemicals were of reagent grade. Restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo (Paris, France). Plasmids—The E. coli expression vector pET19b-SsoMCM was described previously (22Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SsoMCM was mutated at lysines 129, 134, and 194 and at histidine 146 to alanine by PCR-based mutagenesis of the corresponding gene (30Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6770) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides used to create the site-directed mutant proteins are available on request. The amplification products were subcloned back into the SsoMCM-pET19b vector and sequenced to check if the desired mutation was present and to rule out that additional mutations were introduced during PCR. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL cells (Novagen) transformed with the plasmid expressing the wild type or mutant SsoMCM proteins were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.8 OD, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.2 mm. The bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -20 °C until use. The pellet was thawed and re-suspended in 10 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The subsequent steps of the purification procedure were as described previously for the wild type SsoMCM (22Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Samples of the purified wild type and mutant SsoMCM proteins (100 μg in 250 μl) were subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The column was run at 0.3 ml/min at room temperature. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (22Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The column was calibrated by running a set of gel filtration markers that included thyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). ATPase Assay—ATPase assay reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5–1 μCi), and the indicated amounts of protein. Incubations were performed for 30 min at 60 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped in ice. A 1-μl aliquot of each mixture was spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Merck), pre-run with 1 m formic acid, and developed in 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. The amounts of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolyzed to [32P]orthophosphate were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of spontaneously hydrolyzed ATP was determined using blank reactions without enzyme and subtracted from the reaction rate values calculated as described above. DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. To prepare the double-stranded substrates, the labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to a 3-fold molar excess of a cold complementary strand. Substrates containing a bubble made from duplex molecules surrounding poly(dT) (designated Bub-20T) had the sequences 5′-TCTACCTGGACGACCGGG(T)20GGGCCAGCAGGTCCATCA-3′ (Bub-20T, top) and 5′-TGATGGACCTGCTGGCCC(T)20CCCGGTCGTCCAGGTAGA-3′ (Bub-20T, bottom). Blunt duplex DNA molecules were constructed by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-GCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGA-3′ (NoTail-1) and 5′-TCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGC-3′ (NoTail-2). The oligonucleotide Bub-20T-Top was used as the single-stranded DNA substrate. An 85-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-TTGAACCACCCCCTTGTTAAATCACTTCTACTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG-3′) was used for the preparation of the DNA helicase substrate. This oligonucleotide is complementary to the M13mp18(+) strand with the exception of a 30-nucleotide 5′-tail (the tail is underlined in the above sequence). The oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and, after the labeling reaction, it was purified using Quantum Prep PCR Kleen Spin columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare partial duplex DNA molecules, mixtures containing equal molar amounts of each oligonucleotide and the M13mp18(+) strand were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then slowly cooled at room temperature. DNA Band Shift Assays—For each substrate, 10-μl mixtures were prepared that contained 200 fmol of [32P]-labeled DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the indicated amounts of protein. Following incubation for 10–15 min at room temperature, complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide/bis gels (37.5:1) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were dried down and analyzed by a Storm PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Helicase Assay—Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm ATP, and 50 fmol of 32P-labeled substrate (∼1 × 103 cpm/fmol). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 70 °C in a heated top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5× stop solution (0.5% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and then run on a 8% polyacrylamide-bis gel (29:1) in Tris borate-EDTA containing 0.1% SDS at constant voltage of 150 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by means of a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction products were quantified, and any free oligonucleotide in the absence of enzyme was subtracted. Four Positive Amino Acid Residues May Be Involved in DNA binding in SsoMCM—The structure of the N-terminal domain of the M. thermoautotrophicum MCM (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) provides a useful framework to investigate the structure and function of the MCM homologs. We therefore relied on the MthMCM model to design mutants involved in binding and remodeling DNA in the S. solfataricus protein. Twelve sequences of archaeal MCM proteins were automatically aligned using ClustalW (29Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4867-4882Crossref Scopus (35064) Google Scholar), and the alignment was manually modified to take into account the secondary structure information derived from the structure of the MthMCM N-terminal domain. An alignment between the sequences of MthMCM and SsoMCM was extrapolated from the multiple alignment, and the section corresponding to the N-terminal domain is shown in Fig. 1. A very simple homology model was built by threading the sequence of the SsoMCM onto the three-dimensional structure of the MthMCM. No attempt was made to model the insertions or deletions or to energy-minimize the atomic model of the Sulfolobus ortholog. The surface of the putative DNA binding channel has been analyzed to look for positively charged residues pointing toward the center and displaying a reasonable level of conservation between archaeal proteins and/or eukaryotic homologs. Four residues have been identified in the SsoMCM sequence that fulfilled these criteria. The position of the residues with respect to the DNA binding channel is shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Structural location of the residues affecting DNA binding in SsoMCM. Presented are ribbon representations of an hexamer of the MthMCM N-terminal domain showing the position of the amino acid residues that are the subject of the present study. A, the molecule is viewed along the molecular 6-fold axis with one monomer highlighted in green. Residues Lys-117, Arg-122, Gly-134, and Thr-176 of the MthMCM structure have been mutated to the corresponding residues in the SsoMCM sequence and are labeled as Lys-129, Lys-134, His-146, and Lys-194 (shown in red). The position of the same residues in the other subunits of the hexamer is shown in light blue. B, the same molecule has been rotated by 90° along a horizontal axis so as to show the 6-fold axis vertical; for the sake of clarity, two monomers have been removed from the front of the molecule to show the inside of the DNA binding channel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lysine 129 (equivalent to Lys-117 in the crystal structure of MthMCM; Fig. 1) is conserved in all the archaeal sequences, with ten sequences possessing a lysine residue and two sequences having an arginine residue. A positively charged residue at this position is also found in the sequences of the eukaryotic MCM3, MCM4, MCM6, and MCM7. Histidine 146 is located in the turn between strands β4 and β5 at the tip of the zinc finger motif; based on the alignment shown in Fig. 1, it is equivalent to Gly-134 in the structure of MthMCM, but an adjacent two-residue insertion in the SsoMCM sequence will probably make this region assume a slightly different conformation with respect to the existing model. A positively charged residue is present in five of twelve archaeal sequences and in the eukaryotic MCM2 (and some of the MCM3) sequences. Moreover a positive charge pointing toward the channel is also present in the same loop in the MthMCM structure (Arg-133) and has been suggested to be involved in DNA binding (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); this arginine is also found in the MCM5 sequences. Lysine 194 (equivalent to Thr-176 in the MthMCM structure) is a lysine in all of the archaeal sequences with the sole exception of MthMCM. It is a lysine or an arginine in MCM3, MCM4, MCM6, and MCM7. The β-hairpin between strands β9 and β10 points directly toward the DNA binding channel in the MthMCM crystal structure. The equivalent loop is longer in Sulfolobus and includes four positively charged amino acid residues (Lys-240, Lys-246, Arg-247, and Arg-250). However, we chose not to tackle these residues, because the role of this hairpin in binding DNA has been already established by Fletcher et al. in the MthMCM system (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The SsoMCM Mutants Exhibit Chromatographic Behavior and ATPase Activity Similar to That of the Wild Type Protein— The SsoMCM gene was mutated at specific sites by a PCR-based method using the pET19b-SsoMCM plasmid (22Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as template. The K129A, K134A, H146A, and K194A mutants were overexpressed in E. coli cells in soluble form and purified using the same procedure described for the recombinant wild type SsoMCM (Fig. 3A). Analytical gel filtration experiments revealed that all of the purified SsoMCM mutants have a hexameric structure with an elution profile similar to the one observed for the wild type protein (Fig. 3B). Because all of the substituted amino acids are located in the N-terminal portion of the SsoMCM polypeptide chain whereas the AAA+ module responsible for the ATP hydrolysis is located in the C-terminal half of the protein, the mutants were expected to retain full ATPase activity. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4, the H146A mutant and the wild type SsoMCM possessed an almost superimposable profile of ATPase activity, whereas the ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the K129A, K134A, and K194A mutants was found to be even slightly higher than that of the wild type protein. Because the chromatographic behavior, ATPase activity, and oligomeric structure of the SsoMCM mutants appeared to be unchanged with respect to the wild type protein, we argue that the introduced amino acid substitutions have not produced significant perturbations of the overall three-dimensional structure. DNA Binding Properties of the SsoMCM Mutants—SsoMCM binds DNA with structural specificity displaying a higher affinity for synthetic bubble-containing DNA molecules with respect to blunt duplexes (31De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43008-43012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We analyzed the DNA binding ability of the SsoMCM mutants and compared it with that of the wild type protein. DNA band shift assays were carried out with amounts of protein ranging from 160 to 1600 fmol on various DNA ligands, namely molecules containing a bubble of 20 T residues called Bub-20T molecules, blunt duplexes, and single-stranded oligonucleotides as indicated in Fig. 5A. Wild type SsoMCM was found to bind the Bub-20T and the single-stranded ligands with higher affinity in regard to the blunt duplexes. However, the bubble-containing DNA molecules were preferred by SsoMCM over the single-stranded oligonucleotides. Analysis of the binding properties of the site-specific mutants revealed that the substitution of Lys-129, Lys-194, or His-146 with alanine completely abolished the DNA binding ability on all of the tested ligands (see Fig. 5, B–D). In contrast, the K134A mutant was able to bind single-stranded DNA with an affinity comparable with that of the wild type SsoMCM (see Fig. 5, A and B), and its ability to bind the Bub-20T ligand was only slightly reduced (see Fig. 5, A–D), whereas it was almost completely unable to bind blunt duplex molecules (see Fig. 5, A–C). These results indicated that the SsoMCM residues Lys-129, Lys-134, and Lys-194 are critical for binding DNA in either single- or double-stranded form, whereas Lys-134 seems to be mainly involved in the interaction with the double-stranded DNA molecules. The SsoMCM K134A Mutant Retains Full DNA Helicase Activity— Next, we tested the strand-displacement capability of the SsoMCM site-directed mutants alongside that of the wild type protein. As reported previously, SsoMCM displayed a low level of helicase activity on substrates made of oligonucleotides fully annealed to single-stranded M13 DNA, whereas the presence of a 9- or a 30-nucleotide tail on the 5′-end of the oligomer was found to markedly stimulate the unwinding activity of the enzyme (22Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used DNA duplexes that contained a 30-nucleotide 5′-tail as the substrate for the DNA helicase assays. As expected, the K129A, H146A, and K194A mutants were found to be completely unable to unwind this DNA substrate even when ∼2 pmol of hexameric protein were present in the assay mixture. On the other hand, the DNA helicase activity of the K134A mutant was not impaired with respect to the wild type protein, as shown in Fig. 6, A and B. Because the amino acid Lys-134 was found to be critical for the interaction with DNA molecules in the double- but not in the single-stranded form, the finding that its substitution does not affect the DNA helicase activity suggests that the ability of the enzyme to bind single- but not double-stranded DNA is required for the unwinding function. The three-dimensional structure of the MthMCM protein revealed a dodecameric assembly made of two ring-like hexamers with a long central channel highly positively charged. The shape and electrostatic character of the channel strongly suggests that its role is to bind DNA; however its size is much wider than the channels seen in other helicases whose structures are known and is therefore large enough to bind both single- or double-stranded DNA (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The channel is constricted in the middle by six β-hairpin “fingers” pointing toward the center and closely linked with the ATPase domain. These fingers are formed by the strands β9 and β10 and contain several arginine/lysine residues that are likely to participate in the interaction with the nucleic acids. Mutation of two positively charged residues located on the tip of the hairpins in MthMCM (Arg-226 and Arg-228) abolishes binding to both single- and double-stranded DNA. Thus, it was proposed that the ATP hydrolysis-driven shifting of the six fingers may supply a mechanism by which DNA is remodeled and translocated through the central channel during the helicase function (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Structure-guided multiple sequence alignments suggest that the fold of the MthMCM protein N-terminal portion is conserved among the archaeal and eukaryal MCM homologs despite the lower degree of conservation of their primary structures. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a number of basic charged residues located on the channel surface of the MthMCM are conserved in the MCM proteins (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the functional role of some of these conserved amino acids by site-specific mutagenesis of the SsoMCM protein. We decided to exclude from our analysis the conserved arginine/lysine residues located in the β-hairpin fingers, because their involvement in DNA binding has been already established for the MthMCM (27Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As targets for our site-directed mutagenesis studies, we selected amino acids of the SsoMCM N-terminal portion that are positively charged, conserved among archaeal and eukaryal MCM proteins, exposed on the surface of the putative DNA binding channel, and not involved in intra- or inter-molecular contacts as suggested by multiple sequence alignments and inspection of the MthMCM crystallographic structure. The four identified residues (Lys-129, Lys-134, His-146, and Lys-194) were shown to be truly involved in the interaction with DNA because their substitution with alanine residues impaired the ability of SsoMCM to bind nucleic acids. The present study provides the first experimental evidence that the above residues play a direct role in the DNA binding/remodeling function in an MCM complex. Our results provide additional support to the hypothesis that the MthMCM central channel encircles DNA and plays a critical role in the unwinding function. The molecular mechanism of the MCM helicase action has not yet been clarified, and three models have been proposed to date. In one model, during helicase action the MCM complex encircles only one strand of the duplex (corresponding to the leading strand of a replication fork) and pulls it in the 3′ to 5′ direction, whereas interaction with the other strand is not required (32Kaplan D.L. Davey M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49171-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Unwinding of the DNA helix is therefore caused by the steric exclusion of the other strand. This mechanism is similar to the one proposed for the bacterial and phage replicative helicases, although these enzymes unwind DNA with 5′ to 3′ polarity, binding the lagging strand of the replication fork (33Hacker K.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two other models both predict that during the unwinding reaction the MCM complex encircles DNA in double-stranded form. In the “rotary pump” mechanism, multiple MCM rings actively translocate along duplex DNA, twist it, and produce a physical separation of the two strands at a distance (36Laskey R.A. Madine M.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This model is reminiscent of the one proposed for RuvB, an AAA+ protein that is involved in Holliday junction remodeling (37Putnam C.D. Clancy S.B. Tsuruta H. Gonzalez S. Wetmur J.G. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The third mechanism is based on an analysis of the crystallographic structure of the large T antigen helicase of the simian virus SV40 (38Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyl G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This hexameric ring-shaped molecule possesses a large positively charged central “chamber” with “holes” on the side walls. In the proposed mechanism, two hexamers arranged in a head-to-head configuration bind the viral replication origin sequence and pump double-stranded DNA into the central chamber, whereas the melted strands are extruded through the lateral holes. Because both the central DNA-binding channel and the lateral holes seem to be present also in the MthMCM, it was hypothesized that these two ring-like helicases possess a similar mechanism of action (24Pape T.

It is worth trying to analyze the behavior of the SsoMCM K134A mutant described in this study in the contest of the three proposed models. We found that the substitution of lysine 134 with alanine in SsoMCM affects only binding to double-stranded DNA, whereas the single-stranded DNA binding function and the DNA helicase activity are not impaired. Therefore, the ability of SsoMCM to bind duplex molecules does not seem to be required for the DNA unwinding. This result is consistent with the DnaB-like mechanism of DNA helicase action predicting that the ring-like complex encircles only one strand. This model is also supported by our finding that the SsoMCM helicase activity is greatly enhanced on forked DNA molecules, whereas it is almost completely inactive on duplexes without a 5′-tail (22Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A similar behavior was also observed for the MCM4/6/7 complex of S. pombe (9Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae (32Kaplan D.L. Davey M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6148-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, in the present study we found that SsoMCM binds single-stranded and fork-containing DNA molecules with higher affinity than blunt duplexes, as detected by band shift assays. It was recently demonstrated that MthMCM and the MCM4/6/7 complex of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae are able to encircle duplex DNA molecules and actively translocate along them (20Shin J.-H. Jiang Y.

This capability might enable the MCM complex to accomplish additional tasks in vivo such as driving DNA branch migration during DNA repair/recombination reactions. Additional studies are required to unravel the mechanisms of hexameric DNA helicase action. Our biochemical analysis indicates that investigating the molecular determinants of the SsoMCM helicase function may provide useful hints for understanding how the more complex eukaryotic MCM proteins bind and remodel DNA."

To gain insights into the function of Stau2, the subcellular localization of Stau2 isoforms fused to the green fluorescence protein was examined. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that Stau2 functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. The nuclear export of the 62-kDa isoform of Stau2 (Stau262) is mediated by the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 3 (RBD3) because a mutation to RBD3 led to nuclear accumulation.

In dendrites, Stau2 associates with RNA granules that contain other RNA-binding proteins, ribosomal subunits, translation factors, and motor proteins (10Ohashi S. Koike K. Omori A. Ichinose S.

Therefore, RNA granules are thought to play an important role in the targeting of RNA in neurons, functioning as cellular trafficking machinery (13Knowles R.B. Sabry J.H. Martone M.E. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Bassell G.J. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7812-7820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the formation process by which this macromolecular complex is formed is currently unknown. In addition, it is known that Stau2 has at least three splicing variants with molecular masses of 62, 59, and 52 kDa (7Duchaine T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295PubMed Google Scholar). However, the issue of whether these isoforms are functionally different has not been resolved. Because of this, the questions arise as to why such Stau2 isoforms are present in cells and whether each isoform functions divergently. To answer these questions, we investigated the intracellular dynamic behavior of two isoforms of Stau2. In this report, we show that Stau2 functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. In addition, we demonstrate that these two isoforms are distinctly exported from the nucleus, suggesting that each isoform may carry different sets of RNAs out of the nucleus.

Cell Cultures and Transfection—HeLa cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Expression vectors were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) using the protocol recommended by the supplier. Leptomycin B was added to medium to a final concentration of 10 nm. Primary Culture of Neurons and Transfection—The hippocampus was dissected from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats and digested with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' buffered salt solution. Neurons were suspended in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mm l-glutamine and then plated at 3.0 × 105/35-mm plate on polyethylenimine-coated tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. On day 10 after plating, neurons were transfected with expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h after transfection, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The neurons were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature followed by the same solution containing mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the neurons were incubated with Alexa 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) in the blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The neurons were then washed five times with PBS and counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. RNA Interference—Short interfering RNA for depletion of CRM1 (siCRM1) was prepared as described previously (see also Ref. 17Lund E. Guttinger S. Calado A. Dahlberg J.E. Kutay U. Science. 2004; 303: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Sense, UGUGGUGAAUUGCUUAUACd(TT), and antisense, GUAUAAGCAAUUCACCACAd(TT), were obtained from Takara. Transfection of HeLa cells with siCRM1 or mock (transfection reagents only) was performed in 60-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection and lysed. Then Western blot analysis was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-CRM1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (Ambion). Fluorescence Microscopy—All living and fixed cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss). Stau2 Shuttles between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm—To better understand the dynamic behavior of Stau2 in cells, we initially investigated the subcellular localization of full-length Stau262 by transiently expressing a GFP fusion construct. As shown in Fig. 1, the full-length Stau262 was located primarily in the cytoplasm. However, when a variety of Stau262 deletion mutant constructs, fused to GFP, were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, we found that some mutants such as Stau262-(243–317) and Stau262-(273–373) were clearly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1), indicating the possibility that Stau262 has the capability of entering the nucleus. Furthermore, the nuclear accumulation of both the Stau262-(243–317) and Stau262-(273–373) mutants suggests that the overlapping domain between RBD3 and RBD4 may mediate nuclear localization. In addition, the localization of Stau262-(318–571), Stau262-(318–412), and Stau262-(413–571) suggests that the domain just following RBD4 may also be involved in nuclear localization. To exclude the possibility that these mutants might have passively diffused into the nucleus followed by the retention, they were fused to MBP (maltose-binding protein)-MBP-GFP (2×MBP-GFP). As shown in Fig. 2, 2×MBP-GFP-Stau262-(243–317) was localized predominantly in the nucleus, indicating that Stau262-(243–317) contains a nuclear localization signal. In contrast, 2×MBP-GFP-Stau262-(318–412) remained in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the domain between RBD3 and RBD4 mediates the nuclear import of Stau2 but not the downstream domain of the RBD4. On the other hand, the mutant Stau262-(208–272), which is equivalent to the RBD3, was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that the RBD3 domain mediates the nuclear export of Stau262. These results indicate that Stau262 is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Mutation of RBD3 Prevents the Nuclear Export of Stau262— To confirm that the RBD3 actually mediates the nuclear export of Stau262, we introduced a specific point mutation into the RBD3 that results in a reduction in its RNA binding activity. Based on previous findings on the structure of the double-stranded RNA-binding domain (14Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), an RBD3 mutant of Stau262 (Stau262RBD3*) was created by replacing phenylalanine 239 with alanine, which has been reported to disrupt the precise folding of the domain (Fig. 3A). HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-Stau262RBD3*, and its subcellular localization was examined 20–24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 3B, the full-length Stau262 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. In contrast, Stau262RBD3* accumulated in the nucleus, indicating that Stau262 is exported from the nucleus via the RNA binding activity of the RBD3. To address whether this export is dependent on CRM1 (exportin 1), we treated HeLa cells transiently expressing GFP-Stau262 with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the CRM1-dependent protein export (16Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). No nuclear accumulation of Stau262 was observed (Fig. 3C), indicating that CRM1 is not involved in the RBD3-mediated nuclear export of Stau262. Stau259 Is Exported from the Nucleus by Two Distinct Pathways—To determine whether Stau259, the shorter isoform of Stau2, behaves like Stau262, we examined its subcellular localization by transiently expressing the GFP-fused Stau259 in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, like the full-length Stau262, Stau259 was also localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. Therefore, to test whether the nuclear export of Stau259 is mediated by RBD3, we created the RBD3-mutated Stau259 (Stau259RBD3*). Since the secondary structures of Stau262 and Stau259 RBD3 are identical, the mutation was introduced in the same way as that for Stau262. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-Stau259RBD3*, and its localization was observed (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly, in contrast to Stau262RBD3*, Stau259RBD3* showed no nuclear accumulation. From these findings, we speculate that Stau259 is exported via an alternate export pathway, for example, a CRM1-dependent one. Therefore, HeLa cells transfected with GFP-Stau259RBD3* were treated with LMB. As shown in Fig. 4B, LMB treatment resulted in the nuclear accumulation of Stau259RBD3*. In contrast, wild type full-length Stau259 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, indicating that the RBD3-mediated nuclear export pathway, which is not sensitive to LMB, is also functional for Stau259. Thus, Stau259 appears to be exported from the nucleus by two distinct pathways; one is mediated by the RBD3, which is CRM1-independent, and the other is CRM1-dependent. To confirm this, we performed RNA interference targeting CRM1. A short interfering RNA duplex targeted to residues 90–108 of the human CRM1 open reading frame (siCRM1) was prepared according to the previous report (17Lund E. Guttinger S. Calado A. Dahlberg J.E. Kutay U. Science. 2004; 303: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and transfected to HeLa cells. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and the expression level of endogenous CRM1 was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4C, this treatment specifically reduced the expression level of CRM1. To test the effect of the down-regulation of CRM1 on the cellular localization of Stau259, HeLa cells were transfected with siCRM1 together with GFP-Stau259 or GFP-Stau259RBD3*. As shown in Fig. 4D, whereas the down-regulation of CRM1 resulted in the predominant nuclear localization of GFP-Stau259RBD3*, GFP-Stau259 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm, which was consistent with the results obtained by using LMB. Identification of a CRM1-dependent Nuclear Export Signal of Stau259 at the N-terminal Domain—Since the primary structure of Stau259 is different from that of Stau262 only in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 5A), we hypothesized that the N-terminal domain of Stau259 mediates the CRM1-dependent nuclear export. For this, the deletion mutant Stau259-(1–105) was constructed as a GFP fusion protein and transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, GFP-Stau259-(1–105) was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. In addition, LMB treatment promoted the nuclear localization of GFP-Stau259-(1–105). On the other hand, the localization of GFP-Stau262-(1–137) was similar to that of GFP alone and was not affected by LMB treatment. These results indicate that the N-terminal domain of Stau259 mediates the CRM1-dependent nuclear export. It is well known that nuclear export signals (NESs) that are recognized by CRM1 are frequently composed of a stretch of characteristically spaced hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and isoleucine, as was first reported for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev (18Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar) and protein kinase inhibitor (19Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) proteins. To test whether the hydrophobic amino acid-rich sequence INQMFSVQLSL in the N-terminal of Stau259 functions as the NES that is recognized by CRM1, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-INQMFSVQLSL, and its localization was examined (Fig. 6A). GFP-INQMFSVQLSL was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, and LMB treatment led to its nuclear localization, indicating that the sequence INQMFSVQLSL is recognized by CRM1. To confirm that INQMFSVQLSL functions as the CRM1-dependent NES of Stau259, two point mutants of Stau259RBD3* were first constructed by replacing isoleucine 4 and leucine 12 with alanine, respectively, because Stau259RBD3* is convenient for assessing the CRM1-dependent pathway. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-Stau259RBD3*/I4A, GFP-Stau259RBD3*/L12A, or GFP-Stau259RBD3*/L2A as a control (Fig. 6B). Mutations I4A and L12A abolished the CRM1-dependent nuclear export activity of GFP-Stau259RBD3*, although L2A mutation did not. To test whether these point mutations influence the localization of Stau259, which is also exported by the RBD3-dependent export pathway, GFP-Stau259I4A and GFP-Stau259L12A were transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 6C). As in the case in which HeLa cells transiently expressing GFP-Stau259 were treated with LMB, GFP-Stau259I4A and GFP-Stau259L12A were localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, which confirms that Stau259 is also exported via a CRM1-independent pathway. Stau2 Export Mutants Show the Same Localization in Hippocampal Neurons as in HeLa Cells—It is known that Stau2 is mainly expressed in the brain and is involved in the dendritic transport of mRNA in neurons (7Duchaine T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the same nuclear export pathways for Stau2 exist in neurons as in HeLa cells, rat hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP-fused constructs of Stau2 export mutants (Fig. 7). Although GFP-Stau262 was localized predominantly in the somatodendritic domain, GFP-Stau262RBD3* accumulated in the nucleus, indicating that Stau262 is, in fact, exported from the nucleus only in an RBD3-mediated manner in neurons. Furthermore, Stau259 export mutants showed a subcellular localization in neurons that was similar to that in HeLa cells. That is, GFP-Stau259RBD3* and GFP-Stau259I4A were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in a similar fashion as GFP-Stau259, whereas GFP-Stau262RBD3*/I4A accumulated in the nucleus. In addition, LMB treatment of neurons resulted in the nuclear accumulation of GFP-Stau259RBD3* (data not shown). These results indicate that Stau259 is exported from the nucleus via two distinct pathways, an RBD3-mediated one and a CRM1-dependent one in neurons, as in HeLa cells. Using Stau2 deletion mutant constructs, we report here that Stau2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. In addition, the findings show that the region between RBD3 and RBD4 functions as the nuclear localization signal of Stau2, consistent with the recent report by Macchi et al. (20Macchi P. Brownawell A.M. Grunewald B. DesGroseillers L. Macara I.G. Kiebler M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31440-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although the import factor that recognizes the nuclear localization signal remains to be determined. We next analyzed the nuclear export of Stau2 in more detail. First, we showed that the nuclear export of Stau262 is mediated by RBD3. This is consistent with a recent report by Macchi et al. (20Macchi P. Brownawell A.M. Grunewald B. DesGroseillers L. Macara I.G. Kiebler M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31440-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the RBD3 of Stau262 interacts with exportin 5 in an RNA-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, they showed that the down-regulation of exportin 5 by RNA interference resulted in the nuclear accumulation of Stau262, indicating that exportin 5 is the nuclear export factor of Stau262. Furthermore, Brownawell and Macara (21Brownawell A.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that the RBD of ILF3, Spnr, Staufen1, and protein kinase R bind to exportin 5, suggesting that exportin 5 participates in the nuclear export of dsRNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, we report, for the first time, that a functional difference exists among the Stau2 isoforms. That is, Stau262 is exported from the nucleus only in a RBD3-mediated manner, whereas Stau259 is exported by two distinct pathways, a RBD-mediated one and a CRM1-dependent one. In addition, we identified the NES sequence at the N-terminal end of Stau259, indicating that alternative splicing creates a new functional domain for nuclear export. It is reasonable to speculate that another Stau2 isoform, Stau252, is exported by the same two pathways because Stau252 contains the same RBD3 and the same NES sequence recognized by CRM1 as Stau259. The question arises as to the nature of the biological significance of the export of Stau259 from the nucleus in a CRM1-dependent manner. Exportin 5 preferentially recognizes RNAs containing a minihelix motif, a structure that comprises a double-stranded stem of over 14 nucleotides with a base-paired 5′ end and a 3–8-nucleotide protruding 3′ end (22Gwizdek C.

The RBD3 of Stau2 is a major dsRNA binding determinant (7Duchaine T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, when Stau262 is exported from the nucleus by exportin 5, Stau262 appears to bind to and, therefore, to carry restricted minihelix-RNAs from the nucleus. On the other hand, it is likely that Stau259 as well as Stau252, which are exported by CRM1, are able to transport other sets of dsRNAs that are unable to bind to exportin 5 or bind to the RBD3 in the absence of exportin 5. Considering this, along with the data that the expression of Stau259 is more abundant than Stau262 in the brain of adult rodents (7Duchaine T.F. Hemraj I. Furic L. Deitinghoff A. Kiebler M.A. DesGroseillers L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3285-3295PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mallardo M. Deitinghoff A. Muller J. Goetze B. Macchi P. Peters C. Kiebler M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2100-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we propose the possibility that the CRM1-dependent nuclear export of Stau259 plays an important role in transporting various RNAs out of the nucleus. However, the possibility that Stau2 may be exported from the nucleus without binding any RNA cannot be excluded. Kress et al. (24Kress T.L. Yoon Y.J. Mowry K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the vegetal RNA localization pathway in xenopus oocytes in which xenopus Staufen is recruited into the core ribonucleoprotein complex in the cytoplasm that has been assembled in the nucleus. Further study will be required to determine whether Stau2 must be imported into the nucleus once to enter RNA granules."

IKs was elicited by depolarizing voltage steps given from a holding potential of –50 mV, and the effect of various test reagents on IKs was assessed by measuring the amplitude of tail current elicited upon return to the holding potential following a 2-s depolarization to +30 mV. Intracellular application of 50 μm wortmannin through a recording pipette evoked a progressive increase in IKs over a 10–15-min period to 208.5 ± 14.6% (n = 9) of initial magnitude obtained shortly after rupture of the patch membrane. Intracellular application of anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibody also increased the amplitude of IKs to 198.4 ± 19.9% (n = 5). In contrast, intracellular loading with exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 at 10 and 100 μm produced a marked decrease in the amplitude of IKs to 54.3 ± 3.8% (n = 5) and 44.8 ± 8.2% (n = 5), respectively. Intracellular application of neomycin (50 μm) or aluminum (50 μm) evoked an increase in the amplitude of IKs to 161.0 ± 13.5% (n = 4) and 150.0 ± 8.2% (n = 4), respectively. These results strongly suggest that IKs channel is inhibited by endogenous membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 through the electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged head group on PtdIns(4,5)P2. Potentiation of IKs by P2Y receptor stimulation with 50 μm ATP was almost totally abolished when PtdIns(4,5)P2 was included in the pipette solution, suggesting that depletion of membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 is involved in the potentiation of IKs by P2Y receptor stimulation. Thus, membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 may act as an important physiological regulator of IKs in guinea pig atrial myocytes.

Two kinetically and pharmacologically distinct components of IK, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), have been identified in cardiac myocytes from various mammalian species (1Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 2Liu D.-W. Antzelevitch C. Circ.

The KCNQ1 gene encodes the pore-forming α subunit, KVLQT1, that assembles with an accessory β subunit minK (IsK) protein (encoded by KCNE1 gene) to produce the IKs channel (4Barhanin J. Lesage F.

Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar), whereas the HERG (human ether-á-go-go-related gene) product forms the pore-forming subunit of the IKr channel (6Sanguinetti M.C.

Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of these genes have been linked to long QT syndrome, an inherited cardiac arrhythmia characterized by abnormal ventricular repolarization and a high risk for sudden cardiac death (8Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar).Previous studies have demonstrated that both IKs and IKr represent relevant targets for the actions of autonomic neurotransmitters, hormones, intracellular messengers, and exogenous drugs. IKs is modulated by protein kinase A, protein kinase C (PKC), and intracellular free Ca2+ (9Tohse N. Kameyama M. Irisawa H. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H1321-H1324PubMed Google Scholar, 10Walsh K.B.

Physiol. 1990; 258: H1200-H1207PubMed Google Scholar), whereas IKr is sensitive to inhibition not only by methanesulfonanilide drugs but also by a wide range of other medications including some anti-arrhythmic, anti-histamic, antibiotic, and psychoactive agents (8Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). These modulations of IKr and IKs profoundly affect the repolarization process of the cardiac action potential and thereby mediate the regulation of cardiac function by these intracellular signaling molecules or exogenous pharmacological compounds.Stimulation of many Gq-coupled receptors activates phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to form inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol. These two second messengers, respectively, activate InsP3 receptors on intracellular Ca2+ stores and PKC and thereby play a pivotal role in transmitting the extracellular signals to the cellular responses. In addition to serving as a precursor for the production of second messengers, membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to directly interact with many ion channels and transporters. Hilgemann and Ball (12Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) revealed for the first time that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and ATP-sensitive K+ channels are positively regulated by endogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 in guinea pig cardiac cell membranes. Recent studies have demonstrated that PtdIns(4,5)P2 modulates the function of a number of ion channels, including many inwardly rectifying K+ channels (13Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 419: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that, in guinea pig cardiac myocytes, the stimulation of P2Y receptor (G protein-coupled ATP receptor) by extracellular ATP markedly enhances IKs through a mechanism that appears to be independent of either the activation of PKC or the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (18Matsuura H. Tsuruhara Y. Sakaguchi M. Ehara T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 490: 647-658Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Matsuura H. Ehara T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 45-54Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently demonstrated in guinea pig ventricular myocytes that the stimulation of P2Y receptor evokes a pronounced reduction in the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels through a PLC-induced depletion of membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 (20Oketani N. Kakei M. Ichinari K. Okamura M. Miyamura A. Nakazaki M. Ito S. Tei C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H757-H765PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this study was designed to explore the possible role for membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the regulation of IKs in native mammalian cardiac myocytes. Our results provide the first detailed evidence to suggest that endogenous membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 has a potent inhibitory action on IKs channels in guinea pig cardiac myocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Atrial Myocytes—All of the experiments conformed with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication number 85–23, revised 1996) and were approved by the institution's Animal Care and Use Committee. Single atrial myocytes were obtained from the heart of adult Hartley guinea pigs using an enzymatic dissociation procedure as described previously (21Powell T. Terrar D.A. Twist V.W. J. Physiol.

The hearts were retrogradely perfused with nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution containing 0.4 mg ml–1 collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 7–10 min through the coronary artery. After the enzyme treatment, single myocytes were dissociated and stored in a high K+, low Cl– Kraftbrühe solution (22Isenberg G. Klöckner U. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 395: 6-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar).Solutions and Chemicals—Normal Tyrode solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 5.5 glucose, and 5.0 Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The extracellular solution used for measuring whole-cell IKs was normal Tyrode solution supplemented with 0.4 μm nisoldipine (a generous gift from Bayer) and 5 μm E-4031 (N-(4-((1-(2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)ethyl)-4-piperidinyl)carbonyl)phenyl)methanesulfonamide, dihydrochloride dihydrate) (Wako). In some experiments, chromanol 293B (trans-6-cyano-4-(N-ethylsulphonyl-N-methylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chromane) (a generous gift from Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) was added to the extracellular solution to selectively block IKs (23Busch A.E.

The control pipette solution contained (mm): 70 potassium aspartate, 50 KCl, 10 KH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 3 Na2ATP (Sigma), 0.1 Li2-GTP (Roche Diagnostics), 5 EGTA, and 5 Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). The concentration of free Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the pipette solution was calculated to be ∼1.5 × 10–10m (pCa = 9.8) and 3.7 × 10–5m, respectively (25Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol.

When used, wortmannin (Wako), LY-294002 (Sigma), ML-7 (Sigma), monoclonal anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 antibody (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Calbiochem), U-73122 (Wako), d-myo-InsP3 (Sigma), myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5, Sigma), d-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6, Calbiochem), neomycin (sulfate salt, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), or AlCl3 (Nacalai Tesque) was added to the pipette solution and was present throughout the recording period. Chromanol 293B, wortmannin, LY-294002, ML-7, or U-73122 was prepared as 5–100 mm stock solution in Me2SO. InsP3, InsP6, neomycin, or AlCl3 was stored as 10–100 mm stock solution in distilled water. InsP5 was directly added to the control pipette solution prior to use. PtdIns(4,5)P2 was directly dissolved in the control pipette solution at a concentration of 10 or 100 μm with 30-min sonication on ice. Monoclonal anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 antibody was used at a 1:40 dilution. Control mouse IgG was used at the same protein concentration as the antibody.Whole-Cell Patch Clamp Technique and Data Analysis—Isolated atrial myocytes were current- and voltage-clamped using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar) with EPC-8 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch electrodes were made from glass capillaries (outer diameter, 1.5 mm; inner diameter, 0.9 mm) using a Sutter P-97 microelectrode puller (Novato, CA), and the tips were then heat-polished with a microforge. These electrodes had a resistance of 1.5–2.5 megohms when filled with pipette solutions and allowed a relatively rapid diffusion of test reagents in pipette solution into the cell interior after rupture of the patch membrane. In all of the experiments, atrial myocytes were exposed to the extracellular solution for measuring IKs prior to rupture of the patch membrane and the measurement of IKs was initiated immediately after establishment of the whole-cell mode to study the time course of changes in the amplitude of IKs during internal dialysis with various test reagents. All experiments were performed at 34–36 °C.Current and voltage signals were filtered with a low pass 3-kHz filter (48 db/octave) and digitized at a sampling rate of 0.2–1.0 kHz using a 100-kHz analog-to-digital board installed in a personal computer (PC98RL, NEC, Tokyo, Japan). The inset in the figures represents membrane currents or potentials recorded at time points indicated by numerals on the graph, and the zero-current level is indicated to the left of current traces by a horizontal line and the zero-potential level is denoted by the dashed line.All of the averaged data are presented as the mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments given within parentheses. Statistical comparisons were made using either Student's paired or unpaired t test as appropriate, and differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSEnhancement of IKs by Intracellular Dialysis with Wortmannin—It has been demonstrated that, when applied in micromolar concentrations, wortmannin inhibits the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PtdIns 4-kinase) as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase), resulting in a substantial reduction in the cellular levels of both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (28Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 29Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

To elucidate the action of endogenous membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 on IKs, we first examined the effect of 50 μm wortmannin on IKs in guinea pig atrial myocytes. Fig. 1A demonstrates a representative result showing the time course of changes in the amplitude of IKs recorded from an atrial myocyte dialyzed with a pipette solution containing 50 μm wortmannin. Immediately after gaining access to the cell interior (rupture of the patch membrane), the membrane potential was held at –50 mV and was then repetitively (every 20 s) depolarized to a test potential of +30 mV for 2 s to evoke IKs. The amplitude of the IKs tail current elicited upon repolarization to a holding potential of –50 mV, which reflects the degree of IKs activation during the preceding depolarizing step to +30 mV, was progressively increased as wortmannin was dialyzing into the cell and typically reached a maximum response ∼10–15 min after rupture of the patch membrane (Fig. 1A). The effect of internal application of wortmannin on IKs was quantitatively assessed by normalizing the amplitude of IKs tail current measured ∼10–15 min after establishing whole-cell mode with reference to that obtained shortly (≤∼30 s) after whole-cell mode. In a total of nine myocytes, the addition of 50 μm wortmannin to the pipette solution increased the amplitude of IKs tail current to 208.5 ± 14.6% within a period of 10–15 min (see also Fig. 3).Fig. 3Summary of IKs response to internal dialysis with various test reagents. IKs was repetitively activated by 2-s depolarization to +30 mV from a holding potential of –50 mV immediately after patch rupture with a control pipette solution or the pipette solution containing various test reagents as indicated. The amplitude of tail current elicited upon return to the holding potential at a steady-state response was normalized with reference to that obtained briefly after patch rupture.

Furthermore, the time course of changes in IKs tail current was not appreciably affected by internal dialysis with the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 (31Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 10 μm (decrease to 89.4 ± 2.5% of initial values, n = 5, Fig. 3) or wortmannin at 50 nm (decrease to 87.1 ± 2.6% of initial values; n = 7, Fig. 3), a concentration that was demonstrated to fully inhibit PtdIns 3-kinase with a relatively small effect on PtdIns 4-kinase (28Nakanishi S.

Similarly, the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7 (5 μm) also did not mimic the stimulatory action of 50 μm wortmannin on IKs over the same time period (decrease to 88.2 ± 2.1% of initial values, n = 5, Fig. 3). Taken together, it seems most reasonable to assume that a progressive increase in IKs observed during internal dialysis with 50 μm wortmannin arises primarily from the inhibition of PtdIns 4-kinase, but not from the inhibition of the PtdIns 3-kinase or myosin light chain kinase, by this compound.Fig. 5Effects of extracellular ATP on IKs in atrial myocytes dialyzed with control pipette solution (A) and pipette solution containing wortmannin (B) or PtdIns(4,5)P2 (C). Time course of IKs response to extracellular ATP in atrial myocytes dialyzed with a control pipette solution (A) and the pipette solution containing 100 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2 (B) or 50 μm wortmannin (C). IKs was activated every 20 s by 2-s depolarization to +30 mV, and amplitude of tail current was plotted against the time after establishment of whole-cell mode. D, summary of IKs response to extracellular ATP (50 μm) in myocytes dialyzed with a control pipette solution, the pipette solution containing 100 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2, or 50 μm wortmannin. The amplitude of IKs tail current obtained after bath application of ATP was normalized with reference to that before its application. **, p < 0.01 compared with control group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate whether the voltage dependence of IKs activation is affected by internally applied wortmannin, depolarizing voltage steps to various test potentials between –40 and +50 mV were applied from a holding potential of –50 mV shortly (within ∼1 min) and approximately 15 min after a rupture of the patch membrane with pipette solution containing 50 μm wortmannin (Fig. 1B). IKs recorded within ∼1 min of patch rupture (Fig. 1B, left panel) was expected to be little, if any, affected by internally applied wortmannin and was therefore regarded as representing control traces. In this example, IKs, which was recorded ∼15 min after patch rupture (Fig. 1B, right panel), exhibited a steady-state response to wortmannin, which was confirmed by monitoring the changes in the amplitude of IKs in response to repetitive depolarizing voltage steps to +30 mV (data not shown).Fig. 1C shows I-V relationships for IKs tail current recorded under these two conditions (open circles, within ∼1 min after patch rupture; filled circles, ∼15 min after patch rupture). The amplitude of IKs tail current was increased with internal dialysis of 50 μm wortmannin by a factor of more than two at each test potential. The smooth curves through the data points (Fig. 1C) represent the least-squares fit to a Boltzmann equation shown in Equation 1, IK,tail=IK,tail,max/(1+exp((V1/2−Vm)/k)) (Eq. 1) where IK,tail,max is the fitted maximal tail current amplitude, V1½ is the half-maximal voltage, Vm is the test potential, and k is the slope factor. The V½ and k values were 5.5 ± 2.4 and 11.5 ± 1.4 mV, respectively, for the data obtained within ∼1 min after patch rupture and 3.3 ± 1.0 and 11.6 ± 1.8 mV for the data recorded ∼15 min after patch rupture (n = 4), thus showing that the voltage dependence of IKs activation was not significantly affected during internal dialysis with 50 μm wortmannin.Effects of Anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 Monoclonal Antibody, PtdIns-(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 plus Wortmannin on IKs—To assess whether a possible reduction in the level of membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 associated with an addition of wortmannin (50 μm) resulted in a marked increase in IKs (Fig. 1), we examined the effects of the addition of anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibody (32Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 on IKs in guinea pig atrial myocytes (Fig. 2). Previous patch clamp experiments have clearly demonstrated that anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibody added to cytoplasmic solutions in either inside-out or whole-cell mode can prevent the PtdIns(4,5)P2 interaction with several types of ion channel proteins by specifically binding to endogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 (14Huang C.L.

Fig. 2A demonstrates a representative example of the IKs response to internal application of the 40-fold diluted anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibody. The amplitude of IKs tail current elicited upon repolarization to –50 mV following 2-s depolarization to +30 mV was progressively increased to 198.4 ± 19.9% (n = 5, Fig. 3) of its initial magnitude over a period of 10–15 min after patch rupture. In contrast, the addition of control mouse IgG to the pipette solution did not appreciably affect the time course of changes in the amplitude of IKs tail current (decrease to 87.9 ± 2.6% of initial values after 15 min of whole-cell mode, n = 5, Fig. 3). These results indicate that blocking the action of endogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 leads to a marked potentiation of IKs.Fig. 2Effects of anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibody, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(4,5)P2 plus wortmannin on IKs. Atrial myocytes loaded with the 40-fold diluted anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 monoclonal antibody (A), 100 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2 (B), or 50 μm wortmannin plus 100 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2 (C) through a recording pipette were depolarized every 20 s from a holding potential of –50 to +30 mV for 2 s. The amplitude of the tail current elicited upon return to the holding potential was plotted as a function of time after gaining access to the cell interior.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then tested the effects of exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 at concentrations of 10 and 100 μm on IKs. The amplitude of IKs tail current in myocytes loaded intracellularly with 10 and 100 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2 was monotonically declined to 54.2 ± 3.8% (n = 5) and 44.8 ± 8.2% of initial magnitude (n = 5; Figs. 2B and 3), respectively. Thus, IKs was found to be significantly decreased by exogenously applied PtdIns(4,5)P2, consistent with the view that IKs is highly sensitive to inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2.To confirm that a marked potentiation of IKs induced by 50 μm wortmannin (Fig. 1) was indeed evoked by substantial depletion of membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2, we examined the effect on IKs of wortmannin applied together with exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 (100 μm) to the cell (Fig. 2C). Under such a condition, the amplitude of IKs tail current was found to be monotonically reduced to 38.9 ± 8.4% of initial magnitude (n = 6), which is very similar to the degree of reduction observed in the presence of exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 (100 μm) alone (Fig. 3), thus showing that the concomitant presence of exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 almost totally disrupts the ability of wortmannin to potentiate IKs. Therefore, it seems conceivable that a marked potentiation of IKs in the presence of wortmannin (50 μm) was mediated primarily through substantial decrease of membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2. These results provide functional evidence to support the view that endogenous membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 produces a tonic and potent inhibitory action on IKs in guinea pig atrial myocytes.We also examined the effect of the PLC inhibitor U-73122 on IKs in guinea pig atrial myocytes. The addition of 10 μm U-73122 to the pipette solution did not discernibly affect the time course of changes in IKs over a 10–15 min after establishment of whole-cell mode (decrease to 85.1 ± 4.6% of initial values, n = 5; Fig. 3), thus suggesting that the inhibition of the basal activity of PLC does not lead to a potentiation of IKs in guinea pig atrial myocytes. This result appears to be consistent with a previous study demonstrating that basal PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels are not appreciably affected by PLC inhibition with 20 μm U-73122 in guinea pig atria (33Nasuhoglu C.

Physiol. 2002; 283: C223-C234Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).To test whether the effectors downstream of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are involved in regulation of IKs, the effect of inositol polyphosphates InsP3, InsP5, and InsP6 was examined by directly adding to the pipette solution. None of these inositol polyphosphates at a concentration of 50 μm was found to affect the time course of changes in IKs after establishment of whole-cell mode (decrease to 94.2 ± 6.3, 90.2 ± 9.9, and 83.4 ± 11.7% of initial values by InsP3, InsP5 and InsP"

In addition, localization of integral membrane proteins to the TGN requires continual cycles of vesicular transport between the TGN and endosomal compartments. Genetic and biochemical analyses in yeast have identified a variety of proteins required for TGN-to-PVC transport. However, the precise mechanisms of vesicle formation, transport, and fusion have not been fully elucidated. To study the steps of TGN-to-PVC transport in mechanistic detail, we have developed a cell-free assay to monitor delivery of the processing protease Kex2p from the TGN to PVC compartments containing a Kex2p substrate. Transport is time-, temperature-, and ATP-dependent and requires the t-SNARE Pep12p. Moreover, cell-free delivery of Kex2p to the PVC results in the co-integration of Kex2p into PVC membranes containing the Kex2p substrate as determined by co-immunoisolation of Kex2p and the substrate using antibody against the Kex2p cytosolic tail.

Anterograde protein cargo arriving at the TGN from earlier Golgi compartments and retrograde cargo proteins arriving from endocytic compartments must be sorted and packaged into distinct vesicles destined for one of at least four possible target compartments: the vacuole (yeast lysosome), the plasma membrane, the late endosome/prevacuolar compartment (PVC), or the early endosome. At the same time, the TGN must maintain the localization of resident transmembrane proteins such as Kex2p and Ste13p, proteases whose enzymatic activities define the TGN as a proprotein processing organelle (1Nothwehr S.F.

Retrieval of TGN transmembrane proteins from the PVC to the TGN, thought to be mediated by a distinct class of vesicles having a “retromer” coat, is signaled by aromatic residue-containing sequences in the cytosolic tails of the proteins (11Nothwehr S.F.

In mammalian cells, the AP1 clathrin adaptor protein has also been implicated in this step (16Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which these proteins mediate vesicle formation at the TGN, transport, and fusion at the PVC remain elusive. In part, this is because of the difficulty of resolving rapid multistep processes by in vivo analysis. Detailed biochemical analysis of interorganellar protein transfer has been facilitated by in vitro reconstitution of individual transport steps such as endoplasmic reticulum-to-early Golgi (17Baker D.

The system involves combining membrane compartments harboring the TGN-localized Kex2 protease with membrane compartments containing an engineered PVC-localized Kex2p substrate in the presence of cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system. Delivery of Kex2p to the PVC is indicated by processing of the PVC-localized Kex2p substrate and has biochemical features consistent with authentic vesicular transport between the TGN and PVC including dependence on the PVC t-SNARE Pep12p. Antibodies and Reagents—Purified rabbit anti-Tlg2p IgG was as described (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Pep12p antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody 12CA5 was from Roche, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG and affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG/Fc fragment-specific were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Other reagents were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Strains and Plasmids—Strain JBY209 (MATα ade2–1 can1–100 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 kex2::hisG dap2::kanr pep4::HIS3 ste13::LEU2) and plasmids pCWKX10 and pSTE13αHA were as described (25Brickner J.H.

Strain BLY3 (JBY209 vps27–123ts) was generated by transforming JBY209 with Bcl1-digested, URA3-marked, vps27–123ts integrating plasmid, pRCP20 (26Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To remove the wild-type copy of the VPS27 allele, URA3+ transformants were selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), and a 5-FOAR isolate that demonstrated temperature-sensitive secretion of carboxypeptidase Y by colony immunoblotting was selected as BLY3. The diploid strain generated by crossing CBY9 (MATα leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9 pep12–60tsf) (27Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was sporulated, and tetrads were scored to isolate BLY05 (JBY209 pep12–60tsf). Strain MAY21 (JBY209 pep12Δ::bleR) (pJB10) was generated by transforming JBY209 (pJB10) with a DNA fragment containing the phleomycin resistance gene from pUG66 (28Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) amplified using PCR primers having homology upstream and downstream of PEP12. Colony PCR and immunoblotting confirmed the deletion of PEP12. To create the Kex2p substrate, PSHA, overlap extension PCR was used to fuse the entire PEP12 open reading frame to sequences encoding the Ste13αHA fusion protein (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) just beyond the Ste13p transmembrane domain (at nucleotide 448 of the STE13 sequence). The PSHA fusion gene was inserted into plasmid p416TEF (29Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar) creating pJB10. Details of the construction are available on request. Plasmid pJB10-ts, encoding fusion protein PSHAtsf, was constructed in the same way as pJB10 except that the PEP12 portion was amplified from genomic DNA of yeast strain CBY9 (27Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cell-free Transport—Medium speed supernatant containing TGN and endosomal membranes plus cytosol was prepared from semi-intact yeast cells as described (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Baker D. Hicke L. Rexach M. Schleyer M. Schekman R. Cell. 1988; 54: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Medium-speed supernatant membranes from Kex2p-expressing and either PSHA-, PSHAtsf-, or Ste13αHA-expressing strains were added (10 μl each) to 10 μl of 3× reaction mix (0.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES pH 7, 75 mm KOAc, 4 mm MgOAc, 0.25 mm EGTA, 140 mm phosphocreatine, 0.375 mg ml–1 creatine kinase) on ice. Reactions were started by shifting to 30 °C and, unless indicated otherwise, were incubated for 20 min. 10 μl were removed and added to tubes containing either immunoprecipitation (IP) mix (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μl Pansorbin, 1 μl 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody, 1 μl rabbit anti-mouse IgG) or mock IP mix (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μl Pansorbin, 2 μl water). IPs were incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation for 30 min. Pansorbin was pelleted, and 30 μl of each supernatant fraction were assayed for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAP) activity using substrate Ala-Pro-4-methyl-coumarin-7-amide as described (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fraction of PSHA processed was calculated as the ratio of DPAP activity in the supernatant fraction of the 12CA5-containing IP to that of the supernatant fraction of the mock IP. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean of at least two reactions. Immunoisolation of Kex2p Membranes—Isolation of Kex2p-containing membranes using affinity-purified antibody to the cytosolic tail of Kex2p was carried out as described (31Sipos G. Fuller R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Preparation of Fab Fragments—Fab fragments of monoclonal anti-Pep12p IgG were prepared by digestion with papain as described (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 628-629Google Scholar). Papain digestion was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Generation of a Prevacuolar Compartment-localized Kex2p Substrate—Kex2p and Ste13p are both transmembrane-processing proteases localized at steady state to the yeast TGN where they mediate the proteolytic maturation of secretory proproteins such as pro-α-factor (33Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Kex2p is a serine protease that specifically cleaves following paired basic amino acid motifs, whereas Step13p is a type IV dipeptidyl aminopeptidase with specificity for cleavage following X-Pro amino-terminal dipeptides. We described previously an assay for cell-free homotypic TGN fusion that measured the fusion of membranes containing Kex2p with membranes containing a Ste13p fusion protein, Ste13αHA, which functions as a reporter for Kex2-dependent cleavage (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To develop an assay specific for TGN- to-PVC transport, a PVC-localized reporter (termed PSHA) was generated by fusing the luminal domain of Ste13αHA to the cytosolic and transmembrane domains of the PVC-localized t-SNARE, Pep12p (Fig. 1A) (13Black M.W. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 34Reggiori F. Black M.W. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Pep12p is required at the PVC to mediate the fusion of incoming vesicular traffic; therefore, a loss of Pep12p function results in the accumulation of transport vesicles en route to the PVC (35Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Gerrard S.R. Levi B.P. Stevens T.H. Traffic. 2000; 1: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Such a defect in delivery to the PVC causes the precursor of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y to build up in the TGN and ultimately to be diverted into secretory vesicles (35Becherer K.A.

To determine whether PSHA was properly localized, the ability of PSHA expression to complement loss of PEP12 function was examined. Strains carrying the temperature-sensitive PEP12 allele, pep12tsf, and transformed with either a plasmid expressing PSHA or a vector control were assayed for CPY secretion at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1B). The pep12–60tsf strains CBY9 (27Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and BLY05 (this study), lacking PSHA, secreted significant levels of carboxypeptidase Y at the nonpermissive temperature (35 °C) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the pep12–60tsf strain BLY05, expressing PSHA, secreted no more CPY than the wild-type PEP12 strain (CRY1), indicating a wild-type efficiency of CPY sorting (Fig. 1B). Loss of PEP12 function was lethal in the genetic background of JBY209 (data not shown), with the result that BLY05 failed to grow at 37 °C (Fig. 1C). PSHA expression in BLY05 restored growth at 37 °C (Fig. 1C). The complementation of loss of PEP12 function by PSHA demonstrates that PSHA is localized and functioning properly to mediate efficient delivery of CPY to the PVC. Cleavage of PSHA by Kex2p in Vivo and in a Cell-free Reaction—The ability to measure transport between TGN membranes containing Kex2p and PVC membranes harboring PSHA depends on the ability of Kex2p to access and cleave the Kex2p-specific cleavage site separating Pep12-Ste13 (PS) from the HA tag (HA) of the PSHA chimera following co-integration of the two molecules into the same membrane compartment (Fig. 2A). Subsequent to transport and cleavage, the remaining intact PSHA can be immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody in the presence of nonionic detergent. The fraction of Ste13p dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity remaining in the supernatant of the immunoprecipitation represents the fraction of PSHA cleaved by Kex2p and therefore the extent of transport. To determine the accessibility of PSHA to Kex2p cleavage in vivo, PSHA was co-expressed with Kex2p in JBY209. Membranes isolated from this strain were subjected to anti-HA immunoprecipitation in the presence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to determine the level of in vivo PSHA cleavage. As shown in Fig. 2B, ∼40% of the PSHA was cleaved in vivo, and this cleavage was Kex2-dependent, demonstrating that a large fraction of the PSHA is accessible to Kex2 cleavage during normal cycling of Kex2p through the PVC. To measure Kex2-dependent cleavage of PSHA in vitro, membranes prepared from a Kex2p-expressing strain lacking DPAP activity (ste13Δ dap2Δ) were combined with membranes prepared from a strain expressing PSHA but lacking Kex2p and all other sources of DPAP activity (kex2Δste13Δdap2Δ). Following a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, ∼10% of the PSHA was cleaved in a Kex2p-dependent fashion, as evidenced by the fraction of soluble DPAP activity measured (Fig. 2C). This level of cleavage represents the reconstitution of ∼25% of the level of Kex2-dependent cleavage of PSHA observed in vivo under conditions of continual cycling of Kex2p (40%; Fig. 2B). Cell-free Processing of PSHA by Kex2p is Temperature-, Time- and Energy-dependent—Cell-free membrane transport and fusion reactions typically require physiological temperatures and are ATP-dependent. Furthermore, reactions involving transport vesicle formation and fusion exhibit a pronounced lag. Cell-free processing of PSHA was maximal at 25–30 °C, consistent with optimal yeast growth temperatures (Fig. 3A), and proceeded with biphasic kinetics (Fig. 3B). An initial rapid phase (30% of total cleavage) was complete within 2.5 min. A second phase (70% of total) commenced after a 10-min lag and was complete after 20 min of incubation (Fig. 3B). Kex2p-dependent cleavage was largely dependent on the presence of an ATP regeneration system. Cleavage was nearly equivalent to background (kex2Δ) levels when phosphocreatine and creatine kinase were omitted from the reaction (Fig. 3C). Kex2p and PSHA DPAP Activity Are Co-localized in a Kex2p-immunoreactive Compartment following Transport—Vesicular transport of Kex2p to PVC membranes would be expected to result in co-integration of Kex2p and PSHA in the same lipid bilayer. To determine whether incubation of membranes under reaction conditions resulted in incorporation of the two proteins into the same membrane compartment, product membranes were immunoisolated using affinity-purified antibodies directed against the Kex2p cytosolic tail (33Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) by a method that results in quantitative isolation of membranes containing Kex2p (31Sipos G. Fuller R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In reactions with Kex2p-containing membranes and the ATP regenerating system, ∼12% of the PSHA was cleaved, whereas in reactions carried out using kex2Δ membranes or Kex2p-containing membranes in the absence of the ATP regenerating system, ≤4% of PSHA was cleaved (Fig. 4A). A portion of each reaction was subjected to immunoisolation on magnetic beads coated with anti-Kex2p cytosolic tail antibodies as described (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Following immunoisolation, beads were assayed for Kex2p and DPAP activity. For both reactions having Kex2p-containing membranes, >90% of Kex2p activity was associated with the beads after immunoisolation (data not shown). Membranes immunoisolated from reactions having Kex2-containing membranes and the ATP regenerating system contained roughly 3% of the total DPAP activity (Fig. 4B). Membranes from reactions using kex2Δ membranes or lacking the ATP regenerating system contained only ∼1% of the total DPAP (Fig. 4B). The percentage of DPAP activity recovered in each case was about 4-fold lower than the percentage of PSHA cleaved as determined by anti-HA immunoisolation. This is likely because of a partial loss of membrane integrity during the lengthy multiple high salt wash anti-Kex2p immunoisolation procedure versus the 30-min wash-free anti-HA immunoprecipitation carried out to determine the percentage of PSHA processed. Despite the loss in total signal for each reaction, the ratio of the amount of DPAP activity recovered from the standard reaction relative to that recovered from the control reactions corresponds well to the signal-to-noise ratio of the levels of PSHA processed between those same reactions (3 to 1). Thus, incubation of Kex2p and PSHA membranes results in ATP-dependent co-integration of Kex2p and PSHA in the same membrane. Transport between Kex2p and PSHA Organelles Is Not Dependent on Vesicular Transport Out of the Late Endosome/Prevacuolar Compartment—As mentioned in the introduction, Kex2p maintains steady-state localization to the TGN by cycles of transport between the TGN and the PVC. As a result, Kex2p is actively transported both from the TGN to the PVC and from the PVC back to the TGN in living cells. It is therefore possible that cell-free, Kex2p-dependent cleavage of PSHA in this transport assay is the result of vesicular transport of Kex2p back to the TGN where it may encounter low levels of PSHA en route to the PVC as part of the biosynthetic pathway. One way to address the question of whether retrograde transport from the PVC to the TGN is contributing to Kex2p cleavage of PSHA is to examine the reaction using a class E VPS mutant. VPS27 encodes a member of the class E vacuolar-sorting proteins; their activity is required not only for multivesicular body formation at the PVC but also for transport out of the PVC both to the TGN and to the vacuole (26Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37Katzmann D.J. Stefan C.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). If PSHA cleavage depended on retrograde transport from the PVC to the TGN, a defect in the processing of PSHA would be observed in reactions utilizing membranes from vps27ts cells. As shown in Fig. 5, neither Kex2p membranes nor PSHA membranes prepared from vps27ts strains incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (35 °C) for 30 min prior to lysis exhibited significant defects in PSHA cleavage in the cell-free transport reaction. There was a slight decrease in the level of PSHA cleavage by vps27ts Kex2p membranes (∼20%); however, this may have been due to slightly lower levels of Kex2p activity in the TGN following preincubation of vps27ts cells at the nonpermissive temperature because Kex2p activity accumulates in the PVC over time in class E VPS mutants (26Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 38Cereghino J.L. Marcusson E.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Transport between Kex2p and PSHA Organelles Requires Pep12p—We reported previously the cell-free reconstitution of homotypic TGN fusion. TGN fusion was found to require a t-SNARE complex consisting of Tlg2p, Tlg1p, and Vti1p (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, cell-free delivery of Kex2p from the TGN to the PVC would be expected to require the t-SNARE Pep12p, which mediates the fusion of all incoming vesicular traffic at the PVC. To examine the function of Pep12p in TGN-to-PVC transport, two approaches were taken. First, F(ab) fragments of a monoclonal anti-Pep12p antibody were tested for inhibition of transport. Fig. 6A illustrates that the addition of anti-Pep12p F(ab) reduced transport by 90%. Second, the temperature-sensitive PEP12 allele, pep12–60tsf (27Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the PSHA substrate construct replacing the wild-type PEP12 gene and generating PSHAtsf, a PVC-localized Kex2p substrate that was temperature-sensitive for Pep12p function as measured by temperature-sensitive CPY secretion (data not shown). The PSHAtsf-expressing construct was transformed into strain BLY05, isogenic with the strain used for fusion assays but containing genomic pep12–60tsf in place of wild-type PEP12. The resulting strain was grown at the permissive temperature to prevent perturbation of PVC trafficking in vivo. Membranes were prepared and preincubated at either 25 °C (permissive temperature) or 35 °C (nonpermissive temperature) for 10 min. Following preincubation at 25 °C, transport reactions containing PSHAtsf membranes exhibited reduced PSHA cleavage compared with reactions containing PSHA membranes (Fig. 6B). Preincubation at 35 °C resulted in a further reduction of transport in reactions containing PSHAtsf membranes but did not have a significant effect on reactions containing PSHA membranes (Fig. 6B). This is consistent with impaired function of the mutant pep12 allele in vitro that is exacerbated at the nonpermissive temperature. We conclude from these data that Pep12p function is required for the cell-free delivery of Kex2p into PSHA-containing compartments. Transport between Kex2p and PSHA Organelles Does Not Require the TGN t-SNARE Tlg2p—As shown above, cell-free TGN-to-PVC transport required Pep12p function, unlike TGN homotypic fusion, which was found to be Pep12p-independent (25Brickner J.H. Blanchette J.M. Sipos G. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The TGN-to-PVC transport reaction could be distinguished from homotypic TGN fusion by two additional criteria. Unlike TGN fusion, PSHA processing was completely resistant to IgG directed against the cytosolic domain of the TGN t-SNARE, Tlg2p (Fig. 7A). TGN homotypic fusion was recently found to be sensitive to inhibition by latrunculin B (data not shown). Whereas 0.5 mm latrunculin B inhibited TGN fusion by >60%, PSHA cleavage was entirely resistant to the drug (Fig. 7B). These experiments verify that cell-free TGN-to-PVC transport is biochemically distinct from homotypic TGN fusion. In addition to providing evidence that PSHA processing represents a new and distinct cell-free transport assay, these data also demonstrate that this transport event does not require either Tlg2p or actin. Protein sorting at the TGN is a complex process involving the formation of multiple distinct vesicular transport intermediates, each containing specific cargo proteins and each destined for delivery to a specific target compartment. In addition to the sorting of cargo passing transiently through the TGN, the cell must also maintain the TGN localization of transmembrane proteins such as Kex2p, Ste13p, and Vps10p. These proteins all achieve steady-state TGN localization by cycles of transport between the TGN and endosomes. Therefore, Kex2p, Ste13p, and Vps10p are also cargo molecules in the essential vacuolar/lysosomal biogenesis transport step between the TGN and the late endosome/prevacuolar compartment (3Brickner J.H. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have set out to characterize more thoroughly the mechanisms of transport between the TGN and endosomes by isolating distinct steps in transport of Kex2p between the TGN and endosomal membranes in cell-free systems. In this study, we have reconstituted Kex2p transport specifically from the TGN to the PVC. Delivery of Kex2p to the PVC was rapid and resulted in the Kex2p-dependent cleavage of the PVC-localized Kex2p substrate, PSHA. Cell-free PSHA cleavage exhibited a biphasic time course. The two phases of this reaction may represent the initial fusion of preformed Kex2p-containing transport vesicles with the PVC followed by a second round of fusion resulting from the generation of additional Kex2p-containing transport vesicles during the reaction. Such preexisting transport vesicles may correspond to the clathrin-coated vesicles containing Kex2p that have recently been isolated from yeast lysates (9Deloche O. Yeung B.G. Payne G.S. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lag time for formation and delivery of transport vesicles in other cell-free transport systems (∼10 min) corresponds well to the time of initiation of the second phase of the reaction (Fig. 3B) (21Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 24Vida T. Gerhardt B. J.

One concern of protease-substrate-mixing assays such as the one described here is that proteolytic cleavage of the substrate could occur independently of vesicle-mediated transport, for example, through a loss of organelle integrity that allows access between luminal contents of distinct organelle populations. The biochemical characteristics of this reaction strongly suggest that it represents an active process of vesicle-mediated transport. The reaction requires an ATP regenerating system. Although the source of the ATP requirement remains to be determined, likely candidates include the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (39Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 40Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and Hsc70p (41Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 42Rothman J.E. Schmid S.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 5-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 43Ungewickell E.

However, PSHA cleavage was insensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (data not shown). Co-immunoisolation of DPAP activity provided independent confirmation that fusion between Kex2p- and PSHA-containing membranes occurs during the cell-free reaction. Several transport steps other than TGN-to-PVC transport could hypothetically result in the processing of the PVC-localized substrate, PSHA, in the cell-free system. One possibility is that PSHA processing occurs by retrograde transport of PVC-localized Kex2p back to TGN compartments containing biosynthetic PSHA in transit through the Golgi. Strong evidence against a role for PVC-to-TGN transport in cell-free PSHA processing comes from analysis of vps27ts mutant membranes. As VPS27 function is required for vesicular transport out of the PVC (26Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37Katzmann D.J. Stefan C.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the ability of vps27ts membranes to support Kex2p-dependent PSHA cleavage in the cell-free transport assay indicates that retrograde transport from the PVC to the TGN is not required. A second hypothetical possibility, that the reaction described here simply represents TGN homotypic fusion, was ruled out by the fact that the cell-free TGN-to-PVC transport reaction required Pep12p function and was insensitive to latrunculin B and to anti-Tlg2p antibody. A third possibility is that PSHA processing results from delivery of Kex2p from early to late endosomes. In addition to the cycles of transport between the TGN and the PVC, Kex2p has also been shown to be delivered to early endosomes (44Lewis M.J. Nichols B.J. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Riezman H. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and to undergo transport from early endosomes to the PVC (45Sipos G. Brickner J.H. Brace E.J. Chen L. Rambourg A. Kepes F. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3196-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A role for transport between early and late endosomes in PSHA cleavage is more difficult to exclude, in part because of the lack of definitive characterization of this transport step. In addition, distinguishing between the TGN and the early endosome as Kex2p donor compartment is challenging because of the similar biochemical characteristics and protein components of these two organelles. However, the conclusion that PSHA processing results from TGN-derived Kex2p vesicle fusion at the PVC is supported by the steady-state, and therefore predominant, localization of Kex2p at the TGN. In addition, we have found that replacing the Kex2p cytosolic tail with that of the CPY sorting receptor, Vps10p, results in cell-free PSHA processing equivalent to that achieved by wild-type Kex2p. 2M. E. Abazeed, J. M. Blanchette, and R. S. Fuller, submitted for publication. Vps10p, unlike Kex2p, does not appear to traffic through early endosomes (14Ha S.A. Torabinejad J. DeWald D.B. Wenk M.R.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the first cell-free assay in any system that reconstitutes transport from the TGN to the prevacuolar compartment/late endosome. We have used this assay to demonstrate directly a requirement for ATP and the syntaxin homolog Pep12p in delivery of a TGN resident protein Kex2p to the late endosome/PVC. This assay provides the means to pursue the mechanistic dissection of this critical sorting step in vacuolar/lysosomal biogenesis and, more specifically, to elucidate the sequence of events that lead to transport vesicle formation and cargo recruitment at the TGN followed by targeted delivery and vesicle fusion at the PVC. We are grateful to Scott D. Emr and Hugh R. B. Pelham for generously providing strains and plasmids and to members of the Fuller laboratory for helpful comments on the manuscript."

The N terminus of La is well conserved from yeast to humans, whereas the human La protein gained an additional C-terminal domain absent in the yeast Lhp1p (2Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev.

Recent structural data revealed that the N-terminal La motif does not adopt an RRM structure but folds into a winged helix motif, whereas the central and C-terminal RRMs (RRMs 1 and 2, respectively) resemble RNA recognition motifs (25Jacks A.

Others reveal that the La motif is supposed to reconcile the recognition of UUUOH and specificity of binding (2Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev.

The involvement of this particular domain may be determined by the RNA substrate, because it is involved in pre-tRNA recognition (2Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev.

In addition, human La autoantigen (hLa) also contains a putative Walker A motif and a dimerization domain as well as a conserved basic region, nuclear retention elements, and a nuclear localization signal and nucleolar localization signal for nuclear and nucleolar targeting, respectively (2Wolin S.L.

Several studies have described the subcellular localization of hLa by immunofluorescence as largely confined to the nucleus (Ref. 2Wolin S.L. Cedervall T. Annu. Rev.

In contrast to earlier studies (36Long K.S. Cedervall T. Walch-Solimena C. Noe D.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Wolin S.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1589-1602PubMed Google Scholar, 37Broekhuis C.H.

In addition, we have recently shown that the nucleolar localization signal, together with the RRM1 motif, are involved in nuclear trafficking of hLa (29Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we compared the involvement and dynamics of the La motif and RRMs 1 and 2 of hLa in pre-tRNA recognition by analyzing different internal deletion mutants. For this purpose, we used gel shift analysis, UV cross-links, and co-immunoprecipitations as equilibrium systems. Furthermore, real-time determination of dynamic binding parameters was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. In all assays, RRM1 is indispensable for pol III RNA binding, both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the La motif is not essential for high affinity pre-tRNA binding in vitro but appears to mediate specificity and/or protection of associated RNAs in vivo. Moreover, RRM2 contributes to overall affinity and is also involved in pre-tRNA binding in vivo. Additionally, we used GFP fusion proteins to show that specific mutations of RRMs 1 and 2 (but not of the La motif) lead to partial nucleolar accumulation of La. Particularly, the accrual is restricted to functions of the RNP2 consensus sequences of RRMs 1 and 2. These results showed the different involvement and dynamics of these domains in RNA binding, suggesting a model of sequential association with pre-tRNA and revealing their diverse contribution to subnuclear localization. Recombinant Proteins, Gel Shift Analysis, UV Cross-links, Co-immunoprecipitation, GFP Fusions, and Immunofluorescence—Previous publications by our group (28Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and UV cross-links contained 50 nm protein. GFP fusion proteins were produced using the strategy described previously (29Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy of living cells, 7 × 104 HeLa cells were plated in Lab-Tek double chamber systems (Nunc) and transfected on the next day with 1 μg of respective GFP-hLa plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 12–16 h post-transfection, DraQ5 (Alexis Biochemicals) was added to the cells, and confocal microscopy was performed with a LCM501 device (Leica). For co-immunoprecipitations, 293T cells were transfected and prepared as described previously (29Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency of the 293T cells with calcium phosphate was much higher than that of HeLa cells with FuGENE 6 (not shown). Note, independent of the transfected GFP-hLa construct, mean numbers as well as overall shapes of nucleoli were not changed in transfected cells (data not shown). In Vitro Transcription and Purification of RNA—Plasmids, DNA templates, and protocols used for in vitro transcription of (pre-)tRNAVal were described previously (29Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional primers for the generation of mature tRNAVal were: 5′-CCA TCG ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGT TTC CGT AGT GTA GTG GTT ATC ACG-3′ (T7 promoter sequence underlined) and 5′-TGG TGT TTC CGC CCG GTT TCG AAC-3′. Where unlabelled RNAs were synthesized, the samples were suspended in 2 volumes of sample buffer, heated (95 °C, 10min), and separated on a prerun (1 h) denaturating 7 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide gel with 600 V for 3 h. Elution of RNAs by UV shadowing was performed according to standard protocols, and RNAs were resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Quantification of RNAs occurred by multiple spectro-photometric determinations; integrity of RNA after preparation was analyzed by radioactive end labeling followed by analytical, denaturating gel electrophoresis (not shown). Analysis of RNA-Protein Interactions with SPR Technology—Real-time affinity determination of recombinant human La protein with different RNAs was achieved using a BIAcore-2000 device to produce the “sensorgram.” All experiments were performed at 25 °C with a nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip (BIAcore) and the histidine-tagged recombinant hLa proteins. The chip contains four flow cells that were treated and detected simultaneously. All four flow cells were loaded with 25 μl of loading buffer (500 μm NiSO4 in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20)) at 10 μl/min-1, which resulted in a stabile average increase of 100–250 response units (RU). After washing the flow cells for 150 s at 10 μl/min-1 with running buffer, proteins were injected into flow cells 1–3 from 0.2 μm solutions, with 5 μl/min-1, allowing flow cell 4 to serve as a negative control. Protein attachment to the chip surface was manually restricted to yield a mean difference of 1000–1300 RU, where 1000 RU corresponds to ∼1.0 ng/mm2 (40Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Afterward, RNA was injected into all four flow cells, thereby obtaining triple values (flow cells 1–3) each with one negative control (flow cell 4) reflecting potential unspecific binding of RNA to the nickel-coated chip surface. Application of RNAs resulted in RU differences of 30–500, depending on the amount loaded. Gel-purified, in vitro transcribed RNAs mentioned below were injected in at least five different concentrations. To eliminate the possibility that any RNA potentially still bound to the fixed protein would interfere with subsequent analysis, the chip surface was regenerated after measurement by applying 30 μl of regeneration buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) at 10 μl/min-1 before the chip was loaded and prepared for successive measurements. Signals from a flow cell without protein were used as a reference. Data were evaluated with the BIAevaluation 3.0.2 software (BIAcore), and the obtained sets of sensorgrams were fitted into Langmuir's model ratio of 1:1 binding. Calculated χ2 values were always below 0.8, indicating a reliable representation of experimental data by the chosen binding model. Rmax values were in the expected ranges, and residuals had a mean deviation from fitted graphs of generally <1.0 (not shown). Estimated half-life of a given RNA·protein complex was calculated as t½ = -ln(0,5)/kd. Note, we included a complete regeneration step between every single measurement to exclude the possibility that still-associated RNA could interfere with subsequent experiments. This was included in all experiments to ensure standardized and comparable results. RNA Preparation, Northern Blot, and Radioactive Detection of RNAs—RNAs were prepared using TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then resuspended in 2 volumes of RNA running buffer, denatured (10 min, 95 °C) and separated on a prerun (1 h) 7 m urea, 12% polyacrylamide gel. Afterward, the RNAs were blotted to Hybond-N+ transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for1hat330mA using a trans-blot semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) followed by mutual cross-linking of the membrane with each 120 mJ in a Stratalinker-1800 (Stratagene). For preincubation (1–2 h) of the membrane as well as for detection purposes (2–16 h, both at 42 °C) we used ULTRAhyb™-oligo-hybridization buffer by Ambion. The following oligonucleotides (25 pmol) were radioactively end-labeled according to standard methods and used for the detection of blotted RNAs: pre-tRNATyr, 5′-GGA TGT CTC CTG CTG AGG AAG TAG CTA C-3′; mature tRNATyr, 5′-GGA TGT CTC CTG CTG AGG AAG TAG CTA C-3′; hY1-RNA, 5′-CTA GTC AAG TGC AGT AGT GAG AAG GGG GGA-3′. After washing the membrane (twice for 30 min at 42 °C with 0,5% SDS plus 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.4)), radioactive signals were detected with a Fuji X-BAS-2000 phosphorimaging device and evaluated using Tina 2.0d software (Ray-test). For multiple hybridizations, radioactive signals were removed by incubation of the membrane with preheated 0.5% SDS for 15–20 min at 95 °C. Efficient removal of radioactivity was controlled (not shown), and the membranes were again preincubated before the next probe was applied. We never observed any loss in quality of the blotted RNAs during these processes. The La Motif and RRMs 1 and 2 of Human La Contribute Differently to Pre-tRNA Binding in Vitro—To understand the interaction of hLa with pre-tRNA, it is crucial to know how the different RNA binding surfaces contribute to the binding. Recently, we have shown that RRM1 is essential for interaction with different RNAs (28Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), revealing that this motif is of general importance for RNA binding both in vitro and in vivo. In this report, we extended this analysis to a comparison of all known RNA binding motifs of hLa. As outlined in Fig. 1A, internal deletion mutants of recombinant hLa were constructed to either lack the La motif completely (hLa-Δ1) or the RNP2 or -1 consensus sequences of RRM1 (hLa-Δ2, hLa-Δ3) or RRM2 (hLa-Δ4, hLa-Δ5). His-tagged, recombinant hLa was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1B) and Western blotting (not shown) to verify usage of equal amounts of recombinant hLa protein. Proteins were analyzed for the binding of in vitro transcribed radioactively labeled pre-tRNAVal in multiple assays. First, we established EMSAs with stringent conditions and verified that hLa interacted specifically with pre-tRNAVal, whereas mature tRNAVal was barely bound (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–5 and 7–10, respectively).Fig. 2Different studies show individual contributions of the La motif and RRMs 1 and 2 of hLa to pre-tRNAVal binding in vitro. Specificity of EMSAs is shown in A, as mature tRNAVal was hardly bound when compared with pre-tRNAVal (as indicated under “Experimental Procedures”). 100 ng of recombinant hLa-WT were incubated with labeled pre-tRNAVal and with increasing amounts (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 μg, respectively) of poly(C); reaction without hLa on lanes 1 and 6. B, 100 ng of each of the proteins outlined in Fig. 1A were incubated with labeled pre-tRNAVal (plus 2 μg poly(C)) and electrophoretically separated; reaction without hLa on lane 1. C shows binding analysis of the different hLa mutants with pre-tRNAVal in UV cross-linking experiments with the same conditions. Increasing amounts (25, 50, 100, 150 ng, respectively) of proteins were incubated with labeled pre-tRNAVal, UV cross-linked, and separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. All gels were simultaneously exposed for the same time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) With these conditions, we subsequently analyzed the interaction of hLa mutants with pre-tRNAValin vitro. Unexpectedly, deletion of the La motif (hLa-Δ1) (Fig. 2A, lane 3) did not impair binding of pre-tRNAVal, which was tested with multiple protein preparations and is validated by other methods (see below). For yet unexplained reasons, the smeary appearance of hLa-Δ1/pre-tRNAVal RNPs was always observed, independent of the hLa-Δ1 protein preparation used. One explanation might be that the overall structural heterogeneity was increased after deleting amino acids 11–99. We calculated some of the theoretical biophysical parameters using the ExPASy server and noticed that some parameters were changed. The pI of hLa-Δ1 was more acidic (pI 6.68) than the pI of hLa-WT (pI 7.0), the protein was more hydrophilic (grand average of hydropathicity: hLa-Δ1 = -1.131, hLa-WT = -0.973), and the thermostability as indicated by the aliphatic index was lowered when the La motif was deleted (aliphatic index: hLa-Δ1 = 63.08; hLa-WT = 70.32). We do not know whether these changes account for the smeary appearance of the hLa-Δ1·pre-tRNA complex or whether it might depend on the RNA substrate bound. This possibility should be considered, because we did not observe a smeary appearance for the hLa-Δ1·hepatitis B virus RNA complexes (28Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Deletion of either one of the RNP consensus sequences in RRM1 abolished any RNA binding activity of hLa-Δ2 and hLa-Δ3 proteins (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5), respectively. These results unveil that both RNP signatures in this domain are essential for in vitro binding of pre-tRNAVal. Mutations in RRM2 had diverse effects, as deletion of RNP2 (hLa-Δ4) abolished the interaction with pre-tRNAVal, although complex formation after deletion of RNP1 (hLa-Δ5) was weakly affected (Fig., 2B, compare lanes 6 and 7). These data imply that RRMs 1 and 2 are required for binding, whereas the La motif seems to be of minor importance. Next we performed similar studies with UV cross-links, which may be more suited to detecting short-lived interactions and estimating the ability of hLa to protect bound RNAs against RNase treatment. As expected, hLa-WT bound pre-tRNAVal in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, panel 1). Again, deletion of the La motif (hLa-Δ1) did not abolish binding of pre-tRNAVal but caused a reduction in signal intensities when compared with hLa-WT (Fig. 2C, compare panels 1 and 2). It should be noted that, in contrast to EMSAs, signal intensities in UV cross-linking assays are sensitive to RNase A applied in the experiment. The signal intensity of hLa·pre-tRNA complexes depends on the number of covalently bound radiolabeled UTPs and the accessibility of the bound RNA molecule to the degradation by RNase A added in the experiment. Therefore, it is important to note that the α-helical part of the wing helix motif formed by the La motif is in close proximity to the RRM1 and may be required to protect RNAs bound via the RRM1 (26Alfano C. Sanfelice D. Babon J. Kelly G. Jacks A. Curry S. Conte M.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 7: 1-7Google Scholar, 27Dong G. Chakshusmathi G. Wolin S.L. Reinisch K.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The combination of both the EMSA and the UV cross-linking experiments suggests that the La motif is not essential for binding of pre-tRNAValin vitro but rather is of importance for the protection of bound pre-tRNAs associated with the hLa protein. Mutations of either RNP2 or -1 in RRM1 abolished any RNA binding activity (hLa-Δ2, hLa-Δ3, respectively) (Fig. 2C, panels 3 and 4), confirming the data presented above (Fig. 2B) and previously (29Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Weak signals were detectable with hLa-Δ4 (ΔRNP2 in RRM2), potentially indicative of a short-lived interaction, because this was not observed in EMSAs (compare Fig. 2C, panel 5, with Fig. 2B, lane 6). Deletion of RNP1 in RRM2 strongly reduced the ability of hLa-Δ5 to form stable RNPs (Fig. 2C, panel 6). Deviation in signal intensities with hLa-Δ5 in EMSAs and UV cross-links (Fig. 2B, lane 7 and 2C, panel 6) also imply that RNP1 is not essential for pre-tRNA binding per se and that associated RNAs are less protected against RNases in the absence of functional RRM2. In summary, the combination of two independent methods reveal distinct contributions of the RNA binding surfaces of hLa to binding and/or protection of pre-tRNAValin vitro. Real-time Determination of Binding Parameters—To determine the dynamics of complex formation of hLa with pre-tRNA, we performed BIAcore SPR analysis. In these assays, we focused on hLa-Δ1, hLa-Δ2, and hLa-Δ4, as these mutations affect the individual RNA binding motifs. We used the same hLa proteins mentioned previously (Figs. 1 and 2) together with in vitro transcribed, unlabeled and gel-purified pre- and mature tRNAVal. First, His-tagged hLa was captured onto a nickel-coated nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip surface, generating a stable association and only rarely a drifting base line. Afterward, pre- or mature tRNAVal was injected in several different concentrations, and the kinetics of association and dissociation were monitored. Oriented capturing of recombinant hLa via the N-terminal His tag generated an active and specific surface. Pre-tRNAVal injected at different concentrations gave a concentration-dependent response (Fig. 3A). BIAcore data were corrected for noise artifacts and fitted to a model ratio of 1:1 interaction of hLa and pre-tRNA. The calculated difference between experimental data and fit (χ2 < 0.8) indicates that the 1:1 ratio interaction model is indeed adequate to describe the binding situation.

https://openalex.org/W2061125793,"LEC12 and LEC29 are two gain-of-function Chinese hamster ovary glycosylation mutants that express the Fut9 gene encoding α(1,3)fucosyltransferase IX (α(1,3) Fuc-TIX). Both mutants express the Lewis X (LeX) determinant Galβ(1,4)[Fucα(1,3)]GlcNAc, and LEC12, but not LEC29 cells, also express the VIM-2 antigen SAα(2,3)-Galβ(1,4)GlcNAcβ(1,3)Galβ(1,4)[Fucα(1,3)]GlcNAc. Here we show that LEC29 cells transfected with a Fut9 cDNA express VIM-2, and thus LEC29 cells synthesize appropriate acceptors to generate the VIM-2 epitope. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that LEC12 has 10- to 20-fold less Fut9 gene transcripts than LEC29. However, Western analysis revealed that LEC12 has ∼20 times more Fut9 protein than LEC29. The latter finding was consistent with our previous observation that LEC12 has ∼40 times more in vitro α(1,3)Fuc-T activity than LEC29. The basis for the difference in Fut9 protein levels was found to lie in sequence differences in the 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) of LEC12 and LEC29 Fut9 gene transcripts. Whereas reporter assays with the respective 5′-UTR regions linked to luciferase did not indicate a reduced translation efficiency caused by the LEC29 5′-UTR, transfected full-length LEC29 Fut9 cDNA or in vitro-synthesized full-length LEC29 Fut9 RNA gave less Fut9 protein than similar constructs with a LEC12 5′-UTR. This difference appears to be largely responsible for the reduced α(1,3)Fuc-TIX activity and lack of VIM-2 expression of LEC29 cells. This could be of physiological relevance, because LEC29 and parent Chinese hamster ovary cells transiently expressing a Fut9 cDNA were able to bind mouse E-selectin, although they did not express sialyl-LeX.

There are several established biological functions for mammalian α(1,3)fucosyltransferases (α(1,3)Fuc-Ts) 1The abbreviations used are: α(1,3)Fuc-T, α(1,3)fucosyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; LeX, Lewis X; sLeX, sialyl Lewis X; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; UTR, untranslated region; FITC, fluorescence isothiocyanate; PNGase F, peptide N-glycanase F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CMV, cytomegalovirus; nt, nucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: α(1,3)Fuc-T, α(1,3)fucosyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; LeX, Lewis X; sLeX, sialyl Lewis X; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; UTR, untranslated region; FITC, fluorescence isothiocyanate; PNGase F, peptide N-glycanase F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CMV, cytomegalovirus; nt, nucleotide(s).

Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and it is apparent that regulation of α(1,3)Fuc-T activities at the transcriptional level may occur (2Cameron H.S.

One approach to identify factors that control α(1,3)Fuc-T expression at a transcriptional, translational, or activity level is to determine the molecular basis of gain-of-function glycosylation mutants that express an α(1,3)Fuc-T activity de novo (7Stanley P. Raju T.S. Bhaumik M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, three CHO mutants, termed LEC11, LEC11A, and LEC11B, express α(1,3)Fuc-TVI from either the Fut6A or Fut6B gene (8Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These mutants express sialylated Lewis X (sLeX; SAα(2,3)Galβ(1,4)[Fucα-(1,3)]GlcNAc), VIM-2 (CD65s; SAα(2,3)Galβ(1,4)GlcNAcβ(1,3)-Galβ(1,4)[Fucα(1,3)]GlcNAc), and Lewis X (LeX; Galβ(1,4)-[Fucα(1,3)]GlcNAc) determinants on cellular glycoproteins, and all bind E-selectin (8Zhang A.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Analyses of gene organization and expression of the CHO Fut6A and Fut6B genes in the LEC11 mutants provided insight into the mechanism of α(1,3)Fuc-T gene activation in each mutant, including evidence for a negative regulatory factor that represses the Fut6B gene in CHO cells (8Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression cloning has recently identified three suppressors of α(1,3)Fuc-T activity in LEC11B cells. 2W. Chen, J. Tang, and P. Stanley, submitted for publication.2W. Chen, J. Tang, and P. Stanley, submitted for publication.Four α(1,3)Fuc-T-encoding genes have been characterized in different CHO gain-of-function mutants. The Fut6A and Fut6B genes appear to be orthologous to the Fut3-Fut5-Fut6 cluster in humans (10Oulmouden A. Wierinckx A. Petit J.M. Costache M. Palcic M.M. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Julien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8764-8773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and are active in the LEC11 (Fut6B), LEC11A (Fut6A), and LEC11B (Fut6B) mutants (8Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Chinese hamster Fut4 ortholog is expressed in the LEC30 CHO mutant and the Fut9 ortholog is active in the LEC12, LEC29, and LEC30 CHO mutants (11Patnaik S.K. Zhang A. Shi S. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Neither of the latter mutants express the Fut4 gene (11Patnaik S.K. Zhang A. Shi S. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LEC12 and LEC29 do not bind anti-sLeX antibody, and their cell extracts do not fucosylate α(2,3)sialylated N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) in vitro (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that they do not express the Fut6A, Fut6B, or Fut7 genes. Furthermore, Fut6 gene expression was not detected in LEC12 by RNase protection (8Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) nor in LEC12 or LEC29 by Northern analysis. 3S. K. Patnaik, B. Potvin, and P. Stanley, unpublished observations.3S. K. Patnaik, B. Potvin, and P. Stanley, unpublished observations. Thus, Fut9 appears to be the only α(1,3)Fuc-T-encoding gene expressed in these two mutants. It was therefore surprising to find that LEC12 and LEC29 have very different fucosylation patterns (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whereas LEC12 cells express the VIM-2 and LeX epitopes at similar levels, LEC29 cells do not express VIM-2 above background in a binding assay with iodinated antibody (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). LEC29 cells are ∼50-fold more sensitive to the toxicity of wheat germ agglutinin than LEC12 cells. They are also 3-fold less resistant than LEC12 to the leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris termed L-PHA. In addition, LEC12 extracts have α(1,3)Fuc-T activity of 85.9 pmol/mg of protein/min compared with 2.4 pmol/mg of protein/min activity in LEC29 extracts (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).CHO transfectants expressing a CHO Fut9 cDNA behave like LEC12 cells, and bind both anti-LeX and anti-VIM-2 antibodies suggesting that LEC29 cells express a compromised Fut9 (11Patnaik S.K. Zhang A. Shi S. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in vitro mixing experiments provided no evidence for a Fut9-degrading or -inhibiting activity in LEC29 cell extracts (11Patnaik S.K. Zhang A. Shi S. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify 5′-untranslated region (UTR) sequence differences in Fut9 cDNAs from LEC12 and LEC29 and provide evidence that they are largely responsible for the differences in Fut9 levels and fucosylated antigen expression in LEC12 and LEC29. We also show that regulation of Fut9 levels may have physiological significance in terms of E-selectin binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies, Chemicals, and Molecular Biology Reagents—Mouse IgM anti-SSEA-1 (anti-LeX) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (12Solter D.

Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and gain-of-function CHO glycosylation mutants LEC11 (18Campbell C. Stanley P. Cell. 1983; 35: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), LEC12 (19Stanley P. Somatic Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), LEC29 (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and LEC30 (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) CHO cells were isolated previously. Cells were maintained in suspension culture at 37 °C in complete α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were sometimes added. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen and Gemini. Adherent cells were transfected with DNA using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as per protocols suggested by the manufacturers.Somatic Cell Hybridization—LEC12 and LEC29 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 carrying either a neomycin or zeomycin resistance gene (Invitrogen). Stably transfected independent colonies, LEC12-neo, LEC12-zeo, LEC29-neo, and LEC29-zeo, were isolated after selection with neomycin (1.5 mg/ml active weight) or zeomycin (75 μg/ml). LEC12-neo cells were fused with LEC29-zeo cells, and LEC12-zeo cells were fused with LEC29-neo cells as previously described (8Zhang A. Potvin B. Zaiman A. Chen W. Kumar R. Phillips L. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10439-10450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After 8–10 days, hybrid colonies were picked and expanded in culture.Semi-quantitation of Fut9 Transcripts by RT-PCR—RNA was prepared using 1 ml of TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) per 107 cells. 10 μgof total RNA from LEC12 or LEC29 was reverse-transcribed at 48 °C using 1 μg of oligo(dT) and 100 ng of random hexamers with a mixture of Superscript II™ and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptases in 40 μl. cDNA products were treated with RNase H (Invitrogen), and 1 μl of cDNA was subjected to PCR for 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, or 45 cycles. Products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. NIH Image software was used to quantitate by densitometry. Fut9 gene-specific primers were: PS394 (5′-TGA CAA CAC AGT GAA GTG GTT CT) and PS229 (5′-CCA CAT GAA TGA ATG AAT CAG CTG G). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genespecific primers were PS270 (5′-TGA ATT CAT TGA CCT CAA CTA CAT) and PS271 (5′-AGA ATT CTT ACT CCT TGG AGG CCA).Isolation of Microsomes from Cells—Cells were grown in suspension to a density of 4–5 × 105/ml and pelleted by centrifugation at ∼500 g for 10 min at 4 °C. After three washes with isotonic saline, cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 6 × 107 cells/ml with 250 mm sucrose and placed on ice for 25 min before being homogenized by seven passages through a Balch ball-bearing homogenizer at 4 °C. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the non-microsomal membrane fraction. Microsomes from the supernatant were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Both microsomal and non-microsomal membrane pellets were resuspended (3 × 105 cell equivalents/μl) in 1.5% Triton X-100 containing Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and stored at –80 °C in 20% glycerol.Western Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined for membrane fractions and cell lysates by the Bio-Rad Dc assay. Digestion of 100–200 μg of protein with 500 units of PNGase F was performed at 37 °C overnight. Digests were diluted in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) containing β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration, 0.1 m), boiled 5 min, and electrophoresed under reducing conditions on denaturing Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels (7.5% or 10%) were either cast using Mini-Protean (Bio-Rad) or Sturdier (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) apparatus or were purchased from Bio-Rad. Benchmark, MagicMark, or Mark12 protein molecular weight markers (Invitrogen) were loaded in separate lanes. Staining of proteins was with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye or Gelcode Blue stain (Pierce Biotechnology). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrotransferred overnight to a Polyscreen polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Tris-glycine buffer containing 8–12% methanol. To assess transfer and protein loading, membranes were sometimes stained with Ponceau S. Subsequent incubations were for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (Nestle) in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10–20 mm Tris, pH 7.3–7.5) with 0.05% Tween 20 or Nonidet P-40 detergent before addition of antibodies. KM8621 and C-17 anti-Fut9 antibodies were used at 1:1,000–2,000 and 1:200–400 dilutions, respectively. Anti-tubulin antibody was used undiluted and antibody KM2681 was diluted 1:1. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:5,000–10,000 dilutions. Chemiluminescent detection was by Renaissance™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or SuperWest Pico™ (Pierce Biotechnology) reagents and exposure to Biomax™ MR x-ray films (Kodak).Anti-VIM-2, Anti-sLeX, and Anti-LeX Binding to Cells by Flow Cytometry—Approximately 2 × 105 cells washed twice with PBS (pH 7.2, calcium- and magnesium-free) or Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.06 g/liter K2HPO4, 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.048 g/liter Na2HPO4, 1 g/liter D-glucose) were preincubated in 200–400 μl of PBS or HBSS containing 2% BSA at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed once with 3 ml of PBS or HBSS with BSA and resuspended in 200–400 μlof PBS or HBSS with BSA with 1–2 μg of CSLEX-1, anti-SSEA-1, or anti-VIM-2 monoclonal antibody. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cells were washed once and incubated with 1–2 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgM conjugated to FITC. After 30 min at 4 °C, cells were washed once and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS/BSA for analysis using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was added at 1–2 μg/ml just prior to cytometry. All fluorescence data were collected using logarithmic amplification on 10,000–15,000 events (cell counts). Events considered for analysis were gated for either light scatter or low propidium iodide binding, or both. For double staining, an allophycocyanin-conjugated, goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (0.3–1 μg) was used instead of the FITC secondary antibody. Cells were washed with HBSS and incubated with 2 μg of FITC-conjugated anti-LeX antibody in a volume of 400 μl for 1 h at 4 °C. Fluorescence cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur™ cytometer (BD Biosciences) after a final wash with HBSS.α(1,3)Fucosyltransferase Assay—α(1,3)Fuc-T activity was measured with LacNAc as acceptor as described previously (9Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 2.5 mmol of 2-morpholinophenylsulfonate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mmol of NaCl, 0.25 mmol of MnCl2, 2–4 nmol of GDP-[14C]fucose (∼5000 cpm/nmol), 0.1 mmol of LacNAc (Dextra Labs), and 10 μl of cell extract (∼50–100 μg of protein) prepared in buffer containing 1.5% Triton X-100 in 50 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold water, and reaction products were separated on a small AG-1X4 (Bio-Rad) column as described previously (21Potvin B. Kumar R. Howard D.R. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1615-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eluates were mixed with Ecolume (ICN Biochemicals) and counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Specific activities were calculated after subtracting the counts per minute incorporated into endogenous acceptors.Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—The GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) was used for 5′-RACE of LEC12 and LEC29 Fut9 transcripts. Reverse transcription of LEC12 and LEC29 mRNA was performed using a mixture of Superscript II™ and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptases at 48 °C. RNase H-treated cDNA was amplified with Platinum™ Pfx polymerase using Fut9 gene-specific primer PS432 (5′-TAG TGA GAT GGC ACC CTT GG) and GeneRacer™ 5′-primer specific for the ligated oligonucleotide (5′-CGA CTG GAG CAC GAG GAC ACT GA). The PCR products were subjected to nested PCR using Fut9-specific primer PS537 (5′-TGT TGG TGG GCT TGA TGT AA) and GeneRacer 5′-nested primer (5′-GGA CAC TGA CAT GGA CTG AAG GAG TA). PCR products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1 vector, and the inserts of at least three clones were sequenced using vector-specific M13R and T7 primers.Generation of LEC12 and LEC29 Full-length Fut9 cDNA Constructs—Full-length Fut9 cDNA, containing the 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, and coding regions, was amplified from LEC12 cDNA using Platinum Pfx polymerase with primers PS616 (5′-CAC TCG AAG TTT CTG CCA GCC TGC CCT CTG CTC TCC TAA TGG A) and PS519 (5′-TTT TAA TGA AAG AAT AGA CAT TTC AAG). Taq polymerase was used to add 3′-A overhangs to the purified product, which was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing confirmed that the 5′-UTR was intact. The plasmid with a Fut9 cDNA insert of 2251 bp was designated pCMV-Full12F9. Similarly, a cDNA containing the 5′-UTR and coding regions of LEC29 Fut9 was obtained using primers PS617 (5′-TCT GCT TCT AGG ACA GCG CCG CCA CCG CCG AAA GC) and PS343 (5′-TTA ATT CCA AAA CCA TTT CTC TAA ATT ACC CAC AG). This cDNA and pCMV-Full12F9 were digested with KpnI and BspEI restriction enzymes. KpnI cuts pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO once, just upstream of the cloning site, whereas BspEI cuts both LEC12 and LEC29 Fut9 cDNA once, at positions 793 and 792, respectively. The KpnI/BspEI-released fragment from the LEC29 clone was cloned into KpnI/BspEI-digested pCMV-Full12F9 to generate the LEC29 full-length construct pCMV-Full29F9 with an insert size of 2250 bp. The LEC12 and LEC29 constructs were identical to each other, except for the first exon in their respective 5′-UTRs.Generation of Myc-tagged Fut9 and Fut11 Constructs—The Fut9 gene ORF was amplified from pCMV-Full12F9 with Platinum Pfx polymerase using primers PS665 (5′-CCA CCA TGG AAC AAA AAC TCA TCT CAG AAG AGG ATC TGA CAT CAA CAT CCA AAG GCA TTC TTC GTC C) and PS343 (5′-TTA ATT CCA AAA CCA TTT CTC TAA ATT ACC CAC AG). The former also encodes the c-Myc peptide sequence EQKLISEEDL. AmpliTaq polymerase was used to add 3′-A overhangs to the purified product, which was then TA-cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). An N-terminal Myc-tagged mouse Fut11 expression construct was similarly generated by amplification from mouse placenta cDNA using primers PS686 (5′-CCA CCA TGG AAC AAA AAC TCA TCT CAG AAG AGG ATC TGG CTG CTC GCT GTA CCG AGG CGG TGC TGG CCG) and PS553 (5′-ATC CTC GAG GAT TTT TAT TCC GTT TCA TGA AGA TCT).Generation of Humanized Renilla Luciferase Reporter Constructs— The CMV promoter region of pSecTag2C-hygro vector (Invitrogen) was amplified with Platinum Pfx polymerase using primers PS650 (5′-ATG CAT CTC GAG CGA TGT ACG GGC CAG ATA TAC GCG, with an XhoI restriction site) and PS651 (5′-ATG CAT GGC GCC GTT AGC CAG AGA GCT CTG CTT ATA TAG, with an NarI restriction site). XhoI/NarI-digested PCR products were cloned into phRL-null vector (Promega) between the XhoI and NarI sites to obtain phRL-CMV. The phRL-null vector has a T7 promoter upstream of humanized Renilla luciferase coding region such that the putative transcription start site is 12-nt upstream of the ATG start codon. For phRL-CMV, the CMV promoter-driven transcriptional start site is 260 nt upstream. Complete 5′-UTRs of LEC12 and LEC29 Fut9 were amplified from pCMV-Full12F9 and pCMV-Full29F9 cDNAs, respectively. The forward primers, bearing the T7 promoter region and a NarI restriction site were for LEC12: PS647 (5′-ATG CAT GGC GCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GCA CTC GAA GTT TCT GCC AGC CTG CC); and for LEC29, PS649 (5′-ATG CAT GGC GCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GTC TGC TTC TAG GAC AGC GCC GCC ACC G). The reverse primer PS639 (5′-GCA TGC TAG CAA TTT TTT ACT GTA GAG AAC AGC ATG G) had an NheI restriction site. NarI/NheI-digested PCR products were cloned between the NarI and NheI sites of phRL-null to generate phRL-T7U12 and phRL-T7U29, T7 promoter-driven luciferase constructs fused with LEC12 and LEC29 Fut9 5′-UTRs, respectively. In both of them, the transcription start site is 2 nt upstream of the first base of the 5′-UTR whose end lies 11 nt upstream of the luciferase ATG start codon. To generate the CMV promoter-driven luciferase constructs, phRL-CMVU12 and phRL-CMVU29, which have the luciferase coding region fused with the 5′-UTRs of Fut9, a similar strategy was used, except that the forward primers lacked the T7 promoter region: LEC12, PS646 (5′-ATG CAT GGC GCC GAG CAC TCG AAG TTT CTG CCA GCC TGC C); LEC29, PS648 (5′-ATG CAT GGC GCC TCT GCT TCT AGG ACA GCG CCG CCA CCG). In both these constructs, the transcription start site is 5 nt upstream of the first base of the 5′-UTR whose end lies 11 nt upstream of the luciferase ATG start codon.In Vitro Transcription—Capped RNA was produced from linearized plasmid DNA using Ribo m7G cap analog (Promega) with the T7 RNA polymerase-based RiboMAX in vitro transcription kit (Promega). Plasmids were linearized with XhoI for pCMV-Full12F9 and pCMV-Full29F9, and XbaI for phRL-null, phRL-T7U12, and phRL-T7U29. The quality and quantity of purified RNA was assessed by spectrophotometry at 260 nm and electrophoresis on agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining.Preparation of Translational Extracts from CHO, LEC12, and LEC29 Cells—The method of Favre and Trepo (22Favre D. Trepo C. J. Virol. Methods. 2001; 92: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) that incorporates sucrose and dimeric creatine kinase in lysis buffer was followed. Cells were grown to 90% confluence on a 15-cm plate. After washing once with 12 ml of cold wash buffer (150 mm sucrose, 33 mm NH4Cl, 7 mm KCl, 45 mm Mg[CH3COO]2, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), 4.5 ml of cold wash buffer containing 100 μg/ml 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lysophosphocholine) was added evenly over the plate at room temperature. It was aspirated after 90 s and 0.45 ml of cold extraction buffer (100 mm sucrose, 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 120 mm KCH3COO, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm Mg[CH3COO]2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 0.1 mmS-adenosylmethionine, 1 mm spermidine, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 40 μm each amino acid mix) was spread over the cells. After 90 s at 4 °C, cells and buffer were scraped off and passed twice through a 26-gauge needle. After centrifugation at 100 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Dc assay with BSA as standard.In Vitro Translation—The rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based TnT-coupled transcription-translation kit (Promega) was used as per the manufacturer's protocol with both RNA and DNA templates. Translation reactions using 15 μl of CHO cell extracts were performed in 20 μl containing in vitro transcribed RNA and 1 μl (50 μg) of creatine phosphokinase. When required, [35S]methionine or EasyTag Express™ 35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to label-translated products. Translation reactions were directly used in luciferase assays or electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were either used for immunoblotting or dried and exposed to BioMax™ MR x-ray films (Kodak).Luciferase Assays—Cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with Renilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase reporter constructs using Fugene6 DNA transfection reagent.

While studying the cross-talk between α-thrombin and interleukin 6, we observed that the phospho-specific (tyrosine) anti-Stat3 antibody specifically cross-reacted with a 74–78-kDa protein(s) in α-thrombin-treated cells. In this study, we demonstrate that in α-thrombin-treated CCL39 cells, the 74–78-kDa protein(s) rapidly undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. The phosphorylation by α-thrombin was detected as early as 5 min and reached a maximum at 15 min; however, low levels were present at 2 h. α-Thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SFLLRN) induced its tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that α-thrombin mediates the effects via protease-activated receptor type 1. Anti-Stat3 antibodies specific to different regions of Stat3 failed to recognize the 74–78-kDa protein(s), suggesting that it is unrelated to Stat3. Cell fractionation experiments showed that it is localized to the cytoplasm. Mass spectrometric analysis of the immunoprecipitated protein showed that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) is related to glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP-75), a member of the heat shock/stress-response protein family. Consistent with these data, we observed tyrosine phosphorylation of GRP-75 in α-thrombin-treated cells. Exposure of cells to pervanadate, a stress-inducing agent, stimulated its tyrosine phosphorylation; however, cytokines and growth factors were ineffective. This is the first report of tyrosine phosphorylation of GRP-75-related stress protein(s) by α-thrombin and suggests that this pathway may contribute to the ability of α-thrombin to prevent apoptosis in cells exposed to stress or in the injured tissue.

It also induces the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Thus, α-thrombin is an important mediator of not only hemostatic but also inflammatory and proliferative/reparative responses to tissue injury. A family of G-protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs) mediates cellular actions of α-thrombin (8Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R.

Although α-thrombin can activate three of the four PAR family members, PAR-1 represents the primary thrombin-responsive receptor in human cells. α-Thrombin binding to its receptor activates heterotrimeric G-proteins and stimulates many signals including activation of phospholipase C with generation of inositol triphosphate and an increase in intracellular calcium (2Grand R.J.A. Turnell A.S. Graham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Other signaling intermediates activated by α-thrombin include the following: tyrosine kinases such as Src kinases, focal adhesion kinase, and JAK kinases and serine-threonine kinases such as protein kinase C, p42/44 kinases, and p38 kinases (7Rao G.N.

These intermediates either individually or collectively modulate the activity of different substrates, including transcription factors that cause distinct cellular responses.In a previous study (20Bhat G.J. Hunt R.A. Baker K.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that exposure of cells to α-thrombin inhibits IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in CCL39 and MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. The α-thrombin-mediated inhibition required activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (20Bhat G.J. Hunt R.A. Baker K.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This inhibitory pathway was also observed between angiotensin II and IL-6 (21Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M.

Stat3 protein is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors, and its activation by tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical step in IL-6-induced signaling (23Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). While studying the inhibitory effect of α-thrombin on IL-6 signaling, by serendipity, we observed that, in addition to tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3, the phospho-specific Stat3 antibody cross-reacted with a 74–78-kDa protein(s) in α-thrombin-treated cells. Enhanced cross-reactivity of the phospho-specific Stat3 antibody with the 74–78-kDa protein(s) in multiple experiments suggested that α-thrombin may regulate its phosphorylation. Therefore, we initiated studies to establish the identity of the 74–78-kDa protein and its relation to Stat3. We were also interested to determine whether it has a role in α-thrombin-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation.In this study, we demonstrate that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) rapidly undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to α-thrombin. It was localized to cytoplasm in both unstimulated and α-thrombin-stimulated cells. The interaction of the phosphospecific antibody with the 74–78-kDa protein(s) was specific; however, it was unrelated to the Stat3 transcription factor. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the 74–78-kDa protein is related to GRP-75, a member of heat shock protein (HSP)/stress-response protein family. Pervanadate, a stress-inducing agent, also induced its tyrosine phosphorylation. Stat3 failed to co-precipitate with the 74–78-kDa protein(s), suggesting this protein(s) is unlikely to be involved in the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 signaling by α-thrombin. Our results demonstrate that α-thrombin regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of GRP-75-related stress-response protein(s) in lung fibroblasts. This novel pathway may contribute to α-thrombin-mediated proliferative/reparative responses observed following tissue injury.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. IL-6, PDGF, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were obtained from R & D Systems; nitrocellulose membrane was from Amersham Biosciences; phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody was from BIOSOURCE; anti-Stat3 antibody and anti-E2F-1 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-GRP antibody was from Oxford Biomedical Research; goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were from Bio-Rad; all other chemicals were either from Sigma or Fisher.Cell Culture—CCL-39 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown for 12–24 h and serum-starved for 12 h in McCoy's medium before the addition of α-thrombin or cytokines.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Cells were treated with various agents for the indicated times and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody/anti-GRP-75 antibody and protein A/G-agarose. Immunocomplexes were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (lysis buffer), and proteins were resolved by 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with their respective primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence Western blotting system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Fractionation—All cell fractionations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by scraping into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.8 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) per cell pellet derived from two 100-mm cultures. Using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, cells were gently broken to fractionate into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described earlier (24Sehgal P.B. Guo G.G. Shah M. Kumar V. Patel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12067-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Nuclei were removed from the cell homogenate by low speed centrifugation (1000 rpm for 4 min) in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The crude post-nuclear cytoplasm fraction was further subjected to 15,000 × g in an Eppendorf tube for 15 min. The pellet represented the membrane fraction (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane). The supernatant represented the cytoplasmic fraction.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The immunoprecipitated protein was separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The stained gel bands were rinsed in water, cut into ∼1-mm pieces, dehydrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile for 30 min, and dried in a Speed-Vac. The gel pieces were then rehydrated in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 containing 0.5–1 μg of modified trypsin (Promega) and digested for 20 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed to a clean microcentrifuge tube, and the gel fragments were extracted with aqueous 50% methanol, 1% formic acid for 30 min and combined with the initial extract. This was evaporated to ∼20 μl and desalted on a C18ZipTip (Millipore) as recommended by the vendor. Peptides were eluted from the ZipTip with a 2–5-μl aqueous solution of 50% methanol and 1% formic acid. One μl was mixed with matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and spotted on a MALDI target plate for analysis by Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Peptide masses detected were sent to PROWL (Rockefeller University) or Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco) for protein data base searches for possible matches. The search was done for all species (in the NCBI data base) for a molecular mass range of 5–250 kDa (wide open search).Sequence Analysis—Sequence comparison was performed using the BLAST search program, and the search was done with NCBInr data base.RESULTSPhospho-specific (Tyrosine) Anti-Stat3 Antibody Cross-reacts with the 92-kDa Stat3 Protein in IL-6-treated Cells; However, It Detects a 74–78-kDa Protein(s) in α-Thrombin-treated Cells—In a previous study, we demonstrated that pretreatment of CCL39 and MRC-5 lung fibroblasts with α-thrombin inhibited IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation (20Bhat G.J. Hunt R.A. Baker K.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We initiated the present study to further understand the molecular mechanism of this inhibition. Since the commercially obtained phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody (specific for tyrosinephosphorylated Stat3) represented a new batch, we first sought to reproduce the inhibitory cross-talk between α-thrombin and IL-6 by using this antibody. This antibody was raised against a phosphopeptide of Stat3 (SAAPY*LKTKF, where Y* indicates phosphotyrosine) corresponding to amino acids 701–710. Total cell extracts were prepared from untreated cells or cells treated with α-thrombin alone or IL-6 alone or with α-thrombin and IL-6. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoblotted with the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 1A demonstrates that this antibody cross-reacted with the 92-kDa Stat3 protein only in IL-6-stimulated cells (lane 3), and a corresponding protein was absent in unstimulated control cells (lane 1). This result shows that the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 in IL-6 treated cells. Consistent with our earlier findings (20Bhat G.J. Hunt R.A. Baker K.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), α-thrombin treatment alone failed to induce Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lane 2), and pretreatment of cells with α-thrombin completely inhibited IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lane 4).However, to our surprise, we observed in Fig. 1A that the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody also cross-reacted with a 74–78-kDa protein(s), particularly in α-thrombin (lane 2), and α-thrombin + IL-6 (lane 4)-stimulated cells. This protein(s) was weakly detected in control (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and IL-6 (Fig. 1A, lane 3)-treated cells. The increased intensity of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) in α-thrombin (Fig. 1A, lane 2)-treated compared with unstimulated cells (lane 1) suggested that α-thrombin regulates this protein(s) via phosphorylation.To determine whether the 74–78-kDa protein(s) is related to Stat3, we stripped the blot in Fig. 1A and reprobed with an anti-Stat3 antibody specific to the NH2-terminal region of Stat3. This antibody is expected to detect total Stat3 protein, including both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Fig. 1B demonstrates that the NH2-terminal specific anti-Stat3 antibody cross-reacted with a 92-kDa protein in all lanes, which co-migrated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated 92-kDa protein observed in Fig. 1A, lane 3. This shows that all lanes in Fig. 1A contained similar amounts of Stat3 protein. However, the NH2-terminal specific anti-Stat3 antibody failed to detect the 74–78-kDa protein(s) in all lanes (Fig. 1B). In additional experiments, we reprobed the blot with anti-Stat3 antibodies raised against the COOH terminus and an internal region of the Stat3 protein. Once again, these anti-Stat3 antibodies detected the 92-kDa Stat3 protein but failed to detect the 74–78-kDa protein(s) (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the 74–78-kDa proteins recognized by the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody in Fig. 1A are distinct and unrelated to Stat3. Collectively, these findings suggest that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) contains an antigenic epitope that is selectively recognized by the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody.To determine the specificity of interaction of the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody with the 74–78-kDa protein(s), we tested if preincubation of the antibody with phosphorylated Stat3 peptide (immunogen) would abolish its ability to cross-react with 74–78-kDa protein(s) in immunoblots. As a control, we also preincubated the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody with the corresponding unphosphorylated Stat3 peptide. Fig. 1C demonstrates that preincubation of phosphospecific anti-Stat3 antibody with the Stat3 phosphopeptide abrogated its ability to cross-react with the 74–78-kDa protein(s). However, when phosphospecific anti-Stat3 antibody was incubated with unphosphorylated Stat3 peptide, it still retained the cross-reactivity with the 74–78-kDa protein(s) (Fig. 1D). These results show that the interaction between phosphospecific anti-Stat3 antibody and the 74–78-kDa protein(s) is specific and that the antibody recognition motif in the 74–78-kDa protein(s) may contain a phosphotyrosine residue similar to Stat3.The 74–78-kDa Protein(s) Does Not Co-precipitate with Stat3—We considered the possibility that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) may interact/associate with Stat3 to cause inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation by α-thrombin in CCL39 cells (20Bhat G.J. Hunt R.A. Baker K.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we tested if Stat3 would co-precipitate with the 74–78-kDa protein(s). Lysates were prepared from unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with α-thrombin, IL-6, or α-thrombin + IL-6. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 1E demonstrates that Stat3 does not co-precipitate with the 74–78-kDa protein(s). As a control for the immunoprecipitations, we reprobed the blot of Fig. 1E with phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 1F shows that the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody immunoprecipitates the 74–78-kDa protein(s) particularly in α-thrombin (lane 2) and α-thrombin + IL-6 treated cells (lane 4). Phosphospecific anti-Stat3 antibody immunoblots of immunoprecipitated Stat3 also failed to show co-precipitation of Stat3 with the 74–78-kDa protein(s) (data not shown). Lack of a direct interaction between these two proteins suggest that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) may not be involved in α-thrombin-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation.It is also important to note that the number of protein bands in the 74–78-kDa range detected by the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody slightly varied between experiments. For example, in Fig. 1A, the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody detected two bands; however, in Fig. 1, D and F, it cross-reacted with three bands. The variation in the number of protein bands detected may be due to difference in the expression level of proteins/isoforms at the time of harvesting cells.The 74–78-kDa Protein(s) Is Phosphorylated at Tyrosine in α-Thrombin-treated Cells—Specific recognition of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) by the phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody in α-thrombin-treated cells suggested that it is likely to be phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue(s) by tyrosine kinases. To establish the role of tyrosine kinases, we tested the ability α-thrombin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) in the presence and absence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Fig. 2A demonstrates that pretreatment of cells with genistein significantly inhibited the α-thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. When the blot in Fig. 2A was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody, equal amounts of protein were observed in all lanes (Fig. 2B). To confirm further the 74–78-kDa protein is phosphorylated at tyrosine, proteins from control and α-thrombin-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and immunocomplexes were run on a gel and immunoblotted with phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 2C demonstrates that phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody recognized the 74–78-kDa protein(s) in the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates with enhanced cross-reactivity in α-thrombin-treated cells. These results clearly establish that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) is phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue(s) in α-thrombin-treated cells.Fig. 2The 74–78-kDa protein is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. A, effect of genistein on the ability of α-thrombin to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s). Serum-starved cells were left untreated (lane 1) or were treated with α-thrombin alone (0.4 units/ml) for 15 min (lane 2), or first pretreated with genistein (20 μm) for 45 min, and then with α-thrombin (0.4 units/ml) for 15 min (lane 3). Cell lysates were prepared, run on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody. B, the blot in A was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody. C shows that the 74–78-kDa protein(s) is phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue. The lysates from control and α-thrombin (0.4 units/ml 15 min)-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and immunocomplexes were run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with phosphospecific anti-Stat3 antibody. The position of the 74–78-kDa protein is shown in brackets. These blots are representative of three independent experiments. IgG H, immunoglobulin heavy chain. CR, cross-reactive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)α-Thrombin-mediated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of 74–78-kDa Protein Occurs via Protease-activated Receptor Type 1 (PAR1)—To determine further the specificity of α-thrombin action, we tested the ability of the thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRP) (SFLLRN; represents agonist peptide for protease activated receptor 1 or PAR1) (25Vassallo R.R. Kieber-Emmons T. Cichowski K. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6081-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s). Fig. 3A proves that exposure of cells to both α-thrombin (lane 2) or TRP (lane 3) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s). The level of induction by TRP was similar to that elicited by α-thrombin, indicating that activation of the α-thrombin receptor was sufficient to induce a full stimulatory effect. Hirudin, an inhibitor of the action α-thrombin, prevented the ability of α-thrombin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Reprobing the blot showed a similar amount of Stat3 in all lanes (Fig. 3B). These results show that α-thrombin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) via PAR1 receptor.Fig. 3α-Thrombin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) occurs via PAR1 receptor (A). α-Thrombin rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein (C). A, serum-starved cells were left untreated (lane 1) or treated with α-thrombin (0.4 units/ml) for 15 min (lane 2), TRP (100 μm) for 15 min (lane 3), or first pretreated with hirudin (1.2 units/ml) for 30 min and then with α-thrombin (0.4 units/ml) for 15 or 45 min (lane 4). Cell lysates were prepared and run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with the phosphospecific anti-Stat3 antibody. B, the blot in figure. A was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody. C shows the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) by α-thrombin. Serum-starved cells were left untreated or treated with α-thrombin (0.4 units/ml) for different times, and total extracts were prepared, run on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody. D, the blot in C was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody. These blots are representative of three independent experiments. CR, cross-reactive; TRP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)α-Thrombin Rapidly Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa Protein(s)—To determine the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s), we prepared total lysates from untreated or cells treated with α-thrombin for different times, and the samples were immunoblotted with phospho-specific anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 3C demonstrates that α-thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s) was detected as early as 5 min and reached a maximum at 15 min; however, low levels were also present at 2 h. To confirm equal loading in all lanes of Fig. 3C, we stripped the blot and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 3D shows that all lanes contained similar amounts of Stat3 protein. The effect of α-thrombin was also observed at a very low concentration (0.02 unit/ml; data not shown). These results show that α-thrombin rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the 74–78-kDa protein(s).The 74–78-kDa Protein Is Localized to the Cytoplasm in Both Unstimulated and α-Thrombin-stimulated Cells—We next sought to determine the cellular localization of the 74–78-kDa protein(s). We isolated total membrane (endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and mitochondria), cytoplasm, and nuclear fractions from unstimulated and α-th"
