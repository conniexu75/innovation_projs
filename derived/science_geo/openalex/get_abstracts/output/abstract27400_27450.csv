https://openalex.org/W2014418134,"TGF-beta 1 is demonstrated to inhibit skin keratinocyte proliferation when added during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Human foreskin keratinocytes transformed with either HPV-16 or -18 or SV40, however, were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. Since TGF-beta 1 appears to inhibit keratinocyte growth through down-regulation of c-myc, it was hypothesized that these DNA tumor viruses might be modulating the response to TGF-beta 1 via this pathway. Transient expression of proteins HPV-16 E7, adenovirus type 5 E1A, and SV40 large T antigen is demonstrated to block TGF-beta 1 suppression of c-myc transcription. This effect was not observed with DNA tumor virus transforming proteins mutated in their pRB binding domain. These observations indicate that pRB or another protein that interacts with this binding domain mediates TGF-beta 1 regulation of c-myc gene expression and growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2094807913,"The adenovirus E1a protein stimulates transcription of viral early genes. Recent experiments indicate that E1a contains a transcriptional activating region, which functions when directed to a promoter. Because E1a is not a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, how it targets to viral promoters has been a question. Several of the viral early promoters contain one or more binding sites for ATFs, a family of cellular transcription factors. Here we show that E1a can function through a specific ATF protein, designated ATF-2. We provide evidence that E1a interacts with a discrete region of promoter-bound ATF-2, thereby positioning the E1a activating region at a viral promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1854798937,"Growth factor activation of serine/threonine protein kinases was studied by treating quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and examining cytosolic extracts for protein kinase activity under conditions inhibitory to calcium- and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases. Cytosolic extracts of cells stimulated for 5 min were fractionated by Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography. Eight peaks of kinase activity were resolved, of which five were stimulated by EGF treatment of cells. These peaks were revealed using the synthetic peptide Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala (S6 peptide), 40 S ribosomal S6 protein, glycogen synthase, microtubule-associated protein 2, and myelin basic protein as substrates. The peaks varied in the kinetics of their activation by EGF and in their response to insulin. Selected peaks were resolved further by sizing gel chromatography. The results together indicate that at least seven distinct fractions of cytosolic kinase activities are stimulated in Swiss 3T3 cells by EGF. One of these, which phosphorylates both S6 protein and S6 peptide, is similar to the S6 kinase characterized previously in this cell line by others. Four additional activities that also phosphorylate the S6 protein and S6 peptide appear unrelated to this enzyme. Finally, two kinase activities that phosphorylate both myelin basic protein and microtubule associated protein 2 are EGF stimulated. One is similar to an insulin-stimulated microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase described in other cell lines whereas the other seems to represent a novel activity. Several of these EGF-stimulated activities were inactivated by protein phosphatases, suggesting that they might be regulated by phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2144929331,"The mitochondrial MURF4 gene of T. brucei has pronounced G versus C strand bias and heterogeneously sized transcripts, characteristic of genes encoding extensively edited transcripts. We find that MURF4 transcripts of T. brucei are extensively edited throughout by the addition and deletion of numerous uridines, creating potential initiation and termination codons and a continuous open reading frame. A potential guide RNA sequence occurs in a minicircle between inverted repeats. The 5â€² region of L. tarentolae MURF4 transcripts is also extensively edited, with a created initiation codon. The predicted MURF4 amino acid sequences have homology to those of mitochondrial ATPase subunit 6 genes from a variety of organisms. In addition, their hydropathic profiles are quite similar to those of other species. We therefore conclude that MURF4 encodes ATPase subunit 6 genes."
https://openalex.org/W2132737280,"We identified and sequenced a cDNA clone encoding a kinesin-like protein from Drosophila. The predicted product of this cDNA has a carboxy-terminal domain that is substantially similar to the motor domain of kinesin heavy chain. The amino-terminal domain is unlike that found in previously identified kinesins or kinesin-like proteins. Analyses of this new sequence suggest that the maximal motor unit in the kinesin superfamily may be as little as 350 amino acids, and that the existence of both kinesin and kinesin-like molecules must be an evolutionarily ancient feature of eukaryotes. We also tested some of the biochemical properties of the protein encoded by this cDNA and found them to be similar to those of kinesin. Finally, the clone we isolated appears to correspond to the non-claret disjunctional (ncd) gene, which when mutant causes defects in meiotic and early embryonic mitotic chromosome segregation, and whose recently determined sequence predicts a kinesin-like domain."
https://openalex.org/W2069622944,"The release of serotonin (5-HT) from the terminals of serotonergic (raphe) neurons is under inhibitory feed-back control. 5-HT, acting on raphe cell body autoreceptors, also mediates inhibitory postsynaptic potentials as a result of release from collaterals from neighboring raphe neurons. This may involve a ligand (5-HT)-gated increase in the membrane potassium conductance, leading to a decrease in action potential frequency, which could indirectly reduce calcium influx into nerve terminals. In this report we demonstrate that 5-HT can also directly reduce calcium influx at potentials including and bracketing the peak of calcium current activation. Using acutely isolated, patch-clamped dorsal raphe neurons, we found that low concentrations of 5-HT and the 5-HT1A-selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT reversibly decrease whole-cell calcium current. This effect is antagonized by the putative 5-HT1A-selective antagonist NAN 190. Hence, the inhibition of calcium current may serve a physiological role in these cells and elsewhere in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1569375289,"Glycoproteins from the human T leukemia cells Jurkat were found to bind to the GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr-specific lectin from Salvia sclarea seeds. The analysis of the O-linked saccharides of immunopurified leukosialin, the major [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycoprotein in Jurkat cell lysate, revealed the presence of mainly GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr with only minor amounts (approximately 17%) of more complex O-glycans. A comparison between Jurkat and K562 cell glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of O-linked carbohydrates showed that a markedly lower activity of UDP-Gal:GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr beta 1----3galactosyltransferase is apparently responsible for the presence of truncated O-glycans in the Jurkat cell line. The O-glycosylation defect makes Jurkat cells an ideal model to study the initiation of O-linked saccharides. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S] methionine showed that the addition of GalNAc to leukosialin is responsible for the decreased mobility of the mature glycoprotein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, no biosynthetic intermediates between the O-glycan-free precursor and the fully O-glycosylated form could be detected either with an anti-leukosialin antiserum or with the GalNAc-specific lectin. Lowering the chase temperature to 15 degrees C completely inhibited the transfer of GalNAc to the peptide core indicating that O-glycan initiation takes place in the first Golgi elements and not in transitional vesicles between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. In addition, treatment of the cells with monensin did not inhibit GalNAc transfer to leukosialin apoprotein. These results indicate that the initiation of O-glycosylation in Jurkat cells starts in the cis-Golgi stacks."
https://openalex.org/W1545930970,"The extracellular matrix of cultured human lung fibroblasts contains one major heparan sulfate proteoglycan. This proteoglycan contains a 400-kDa core protein and is structurally and immunochemically identical or closely related to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans that occur in basement membranes. Because heparitinase does not release the core protein from the matrix of cultured cells, we investigated the binding interactions of this heparan sulfate proteoglycan with other components of the fibroblast extracellular matrix. Both the intact proteoglycan and the heparitinase-resistant core protein were found to bind to fibronectin. The binding of 125I-labeled core protein to immobilized fibronectin was inhibited by soluble fibronectin and by soluble cold core protein but not by albumin or gelatin. A Scatchard plot indicates a Kd of about 2 x 10(-9) M. Binding of the core protein was also inhibited by high concentrations of heparin, heparan sulfate, or chrondroitin sulfate and was sensitive to high salt concentrations. Thermolysin fragmentation of the 125I-labeled proteoglycan yielded glycosamino-glycan-free core protein fragments of approximately 110 and 62 kDa which bound to both fibronectin and heparin columns. The core protein-binding capacity of fibronectin was very sensitive to proteolysis. Analysis of thermolytic and alpha-chymotryptic fragments of fibronectin showed binding of the intact proteoglycan and of its isolated core protein to a protease-sensitive fragment of 56 kDa which carried the gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin and to a protease-sensitive heparin-binding fragment of 140 kDa. Based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analyses of the 56- and 140-kDa fragments, the core protein-binding domain in fibronectin was tentatively mapped in the area of overlap of the two fragments, carboxyl-terminally from the gelatin-binding domain, possibly in the second type III repeat of fibronectin. These data document a specific and high affinity interaction between fibronectin and the core protein of the matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan which may anchor the proteoglycan in the matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2024666493,"Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that purified MPF from Xenopus eggs contains cyclin B2 complexed with cdc2 kinase. The activation of MPF during oocyte maturation is known to require expression of the c-mos(xe) proto-oncogene. We show here that immunoprecipitates of either v-mos from Moloney murine sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3 cells or c-mos from Xenopus eggs phosphorylate cyclin B2 in vitro. Phosphopeptide analysis reveals a pattern similar to that observed with cdc2 kinase. Moreover, ablation of c-mos(xe) from oocytes by antisense oligonucleotide injection reduces the rate of cyclin B2 phosphorylation in oocyte extracts by 40%. These results suggest that the mechanism of activation of MPF by c-mos(xe) involves phosphorylation of the cyclin component."
https://openalex.org/W1889313248,"A yeast nuclear gene (ATP10) is reported whose product is essential for the assembly of a functional mitochondrial ATPase complex. Mutations in ATP10 induce a loss of rutamycin sensitivity in the mitochondrial ATPase but do not affect respiratory enzymes. This phenotype has been correlated with a defect in the F0 sector of the ATPase. The wild type ATP10 gene has been cloned by transformation of an atp 10 mutant with a yeast genomic library. The gene codes for a protein of Mr = 30,293. The primary structure of the ATP10 product is not related to any known subunit of the yeast or mammalian mitochondrial ATPase complexes. To further clarify the role of this new protein in the assembly of the ATPase, an antibody was prepared against a hybrid protein expressed from a trpE/ATP 10 fusion gene. The antibody recognizes a 30-kDa protein present in wild type mitochondria. The protein is associated with the mitochondrial membrane but does not co-fractionate either with F1 or with the rutamycin-sensitive F1-F0 complex. These data suggest that the ATP10 product is not a subunit of the ATPase complex but rather is required for the assembly of the F0 sector of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1580396120,"This report describes initial characterization of the binding sites of ankyrin for spectrin and the anion exchanger using defined subfragments isolated from purified ankyrin domains. The spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin is comprised of two subdomains: an acidic, proline-rich region (pI = 4) involving the amino-terminal 80 residues from 828 to 908 and a basic region (pI = 8.8) that extends from 898 to 1386. The amino-terminal 70 amino acids of the spectrin-binding domain are critical for association with spectrin, since a subfragment missing this region is only 5% as active as the intact domain in displacing binding of spectrin to inside-out membrane vesicles, while deletion of the first 38 residues of the acidic domain results in a 10-fold reduction in activity. The anion exchanger-binding site is confined to an 89-kDa domain that was isolated and characterized as a globular molecule with approximately 30% alpha-helical configuration. A subfragment of the 89-kDa domain extending from residues 403 to 779 (or possibly 740) retains ability to associate with the anion exchanger. The 89-kDa domain is comprised of a series of tandem repeats of 33 amino acids that extend from residues 35 to 778 (Lux, S., John, K., and Bennett, V. (1990) Nature 344, 36-42). The activity of residues 403-779 demonstrates that the 33-amino acid repeats of the 89-kDa domain are responsible for association between ankyrin and the anion exchanger. The 33-amino acid repeating sequence of ankyrin represents an ancient motif also found in proteins of Drosophila, yeast, and Caenor habditis elegans. The finding that the 33-amino acid repeating sequence is involved in interaction with the anion exchanger implies that this motif may perform a role in molecular recognition in diverse proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1599780410,The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and the processing enhancing protein (PEP) cooperate in the proteolytic cleavage of matrix targeting sequences from nuclear-encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins. We have determined the cDNA sequence of Neurospora MPP after expression cloning. MPP appears to contain two domains of approximately equal size which are separated by a loop-like sequence. Considerable structural similarity exists to the recently sequenced yeast MPP as well as to Neurospora and yeast PEP. Four cysteine residues are conserved in Neurospora and yeast MPP. Inactivation of MPP can be achieved by using sulfhydryl reagents. MPP (but not PEP) depends on the presence of divalent metal ions for activity. Both MPP and PEP are synthesized as precursors containing matrix targeting signals which are processed during import into mitochondria by the mature forms of MPP and PEP.
https://openalex.org/W1541800741,"Postnatal development of rat liver mitochondrial functions, i.e. differentiation of pre-existing mitochondria, is a key regulatory process that is accomplished during the first postnatal hour (Valcarce, C., Navarrete, R. M., Encabo, P., Loeches, E., Satrustegui, J., and Cuezva, J. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7767-7775). The general mechanism that appears to control this process is the rapid (2-fold) increase in inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, as a result of a rapid increase in the rates of protein synthesis for mitochondrial proteins. Fetal hypothyroidism induced by administration of methimazole to pregnant rats resulted in half the ATPase activity and amount of beta-F1-ATPase protein in liver homogenates compared with normal fetuses. Furthermore, hypothyroid neonates showed no postnatal increase in the amount of mitochondrial beta subunit of the F1-ATPase complex. Administration of thyroid hormones to hypothyroid neonates at birth promoted a 2-fold increase in liver ATPase activity and in the amount of beta-F1-ATPase protein both in liver homogenates and in isolated mitochondria. The rapid increase in beta-F1-ATPase protein observed in thyroid hormone-treated hypothyroid neonates was paralleled by a 2-fold increase in the relative rates of beta-F1-ATPase synthesis and by a 2-fold increase in the relative amount of hepatic beta-F1-ATPase mRNA. The results show that the basal expression of the beta-F1-ATPase gene is regulated by thyroid hormones at either a transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level. Thus, these results show the requirement of thyroid hormones for proliferation and differentiation of mitochondria in the fetal and neonatal liver, respectively. On the other hand, the fact that liver mRNA level of beta-F1-ATPase protein does not change between 0 and 1 postnatal h in the normal neonatal liver indicates that postnatal mitochondrial differentiation is regulated at a translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1544979925,"We have characterized genomic and cDNA clones for arg-2, the gene encoding the small subunit of the Neurospora crassa arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS-A), and examined its transcriptional regulation. The polypeptide's predicted amino acid sequence (453 residues) is 56% and 36% identical with the sequences of the homologous polypeptides of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, respectively. The ARG2 polypeptide has an additional amino-terminal domain with the hallmark features of a mitochondrial signal sequence. The arg-2 mRNA also encodes a 24-residue peptide in the segment upstream of the coding region for the ARG2 polypeptide. This upstream open reading frame (uORF) strongly resembles the uORF in the homologous S. cerevisiae transcript. Northern analyses indicate that arg-2 mRNA levels are reduced by arginine supplementation and increased by amino acid limitation. The large increase in arg-2 mRNA levels that occurs in response to amino acid limitation is not observed in a strain containing the cpc-1 mutation, indicating that the cross-pathway control system participates in arg-2 regulation. Four copies of the sequence TGACTC, the binding site for the CPC1 regulatory protein, are found in the arg-2 genetic region. Two copies are located upstream of the mRNA start sites, and two are present within introns in the arg-2 uORF."
https://openalex.org/W1526438718,"The annexins are a family of homologous Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-binding proteins that until now have only been found in vertebrates. cDNA clones encoding two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster were isolated and characterized. RNA blots indicate that the messages for the two Drosophila proteins are differentially expressed in development, with one message being expressed throughout development, while the other is only found in early embryos and adult flies. In situ hybridizations localize the two Drosophila genes to 93B and 19A-4,7. A similarly high degree of homology relates Drosophila annexins to different vertebrate annexins, indicating that the Drosophila annexins are not the invertebrate homologues of particular mammalian annexins but that they constitute novel members of the annexin gene family. In continuation with a recently established terminology, the Drosophila annexins will be named annexins IX and X. The biochemical properties of Drosophila annexin X were investigated using recombinant protein. Similar to vertebrate annexins, annexin X bound to liver membranes and liposomes containing phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner but not to liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine. In addition, annexin X partitioned into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 as a function of calcium. The conservation of the annexin family of Ca2(+)-binding proteins in invertebrates suggests that they have a basic function in cells which is not peculiar to vertebrate biology, and the availability of the Drosophila sequences will open avenues for mutational studies of these functions."
https://openalex.org/W1501564680,"The hepatotoxicity of CCl4 is mediated through its initial reduction by cytochrome P-450 to the CCl3.radical. This radical then damages important metabolic systems such as the ATP-dependent microsomal Ca2+ pump. Previous studies from our laboratory on isolated microsomes have shown that NADPH in the absence of toxic agents inhibits this pump. We have now found in in vitro incubations that CCl4 (0.5-2.5 mM) enhanced the NADPH-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ uptake from 28% without CCl4 to a maximum of 68%. These concentrations are in the range found in the livers and blood of lethally intoxicated animals (Dambrauskas, T., and Cornish, H. H. (1970) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 17, 83-97; Long, R.M., and Moore, L. (1988) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 92, 295-306) and are toxic to cultured hepatocytes (Long, R. M., and Moore, L. (1988) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 92, 295-306). The inhibition of Ca2+ uptake was due both to a decrease in the Ca2(+)-dependent ATPase and to an enhanced release of Ca2+ from the microsomes. The NADPH-dependent CCl4 inhibition was greater under N2 and was totally prevented by CO. GSH (1-10 mM) added during the incubation with CCl4 prevented the inhibition. This protection was also seen when the incubations were performed under nitrogen. When samples were preincubated with CCl4, the CCl4 metabolism was stopped, and then the Ca2+ uptake was determined; GSH reversed the CCl4 inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. This reversal showed saturation kinetics for GSH with two Km values of 0.315 and 93 microM when both the preincubation and the Ca2+ uptake were performed under air, and 0.512 and 31 microM when both were performed under nitrogen. Cysteine did not prevent the NADPH-dependent CCl4 inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. CCl4 increased lipid peroxidation in air, but no lipid peroxidation was seen under nitrogen. Lipid peroxidation was only modestly reversed by GSH. GSH did not remove 14C bound to samples preincubated with the 14CCl4. Although EDTA (100 microM) decreased the CCl4 inhibition, the metal-complexing agents deferoxamine (100 microM) and diethyldithiocarbamate (100 microM) had no effect on the inhibition of the pump. Similarly, the reactive oxygen scavengers catalase (65 micrograms/ml), superoxide dismutase (15 micrograms/ml), mannitol (10 mM), and dimethyl sulfoxide (50 mM) also had no effect. Our results suggest that the initial toxicity of CCl4 for the Ca2+ pump results from the metabolism of CCl4 to the CCl3. radical. This radical then directly oxidizes the Ca2+ pump, leading to decreased Ca2+ uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2123871062,"Juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis is a rare neurodegenerative disorder closely related to Tay-Sachs disease but of later onset and more protracted course. The biochemical defect lies in the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase. Cultured fibroblasts derived from patient A synthesized an alpha-subunit which could acquire mannose 6-phosphate and be secreted, but which failed to associate with the beta-subunit to form the enzymatically active heterodimer. By contrast, fibroblasts from patient B synthesized an alpha-subunit that was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. To identify the molecular basis of the disorder, RNA from fibroblasts of these two patients was reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in four overlapping fragments. The PCR fragments were subcloned and shown by sequence analysis to contain a G to A transition corresponding to substitution of histidine for arginine at position 504 in the case of patient A and at position 499 in the case of patient B. The mutations were confirmed by hybridization of allele-specific oligonucleotides to PCR-amplified fragments of DNA corresponding to exon 13 of the alpha-subunit gene. The Arg504----His mutation was found on both alleles of patient A as well as of another unrelated patient; the homozygosity of this mutant allele is attributable to consanguinity in the two families. The Arg499----His mutation was found in patient B in compound heterozygosity with a common infantile Tay-Sachs allele. There is additional heterogeneity in juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, as neither mutation was found in the DNA of a fourth patient. The Arg----His mutations at positions 499 and 504 are located at CpG dinucleotides, which are known to be mutagenic hot spots."
https://openalex.org/W1537134667,"The genetic defect in muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency (type VII glycogenosis, Tarui disease) was investigated. Six cDNAs for muscle phosphofructokinase, including a full-length clone, were isolated from a non-amplified library of muscle from a patient. By sequence analysis of these clones, a 75-base in-frame deletion was identified. The rest of the sequence was identical to that of the normal cDNA, except for a silent base transition at position 516 (ACT (Thr) to ACC (Thr]. The deletion was located in the 3'-terminal region of exon 13 (numbered with reference to the rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase gene (Lee, C.-P., Kao, M.-C., French, B.A., Putney, S.D., and Chang, S.H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4195-4199]. Genomic DNA of the patient was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the amplified DNA revealed a point mutation from G to T at the 5'-end of intron 13. This mutation changed the normal 5'-splice site of CAG:GTATGG to CAG:TTATGG. A cryptic splice site of ACT:GTGAGG located 75 bases upstream from the normal splice site was recognized and spliced in the patient."
https://openalex.org/W1522060763,"Bovine corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan was found to contain three major protein components. Two proteins (37 and 25 kDa) were released from the proteoglycan by endo-beta-galactosidase, N-glycanase, or chemical deglycosylation. A smaller protein (20 kDa), not covalently linked to keratan sulfate, co-purified with the proteoglycan by conventional and high performance ion exchange chromatography, by ethanol precipitation, and by affinity purification on columns of monoclonal antibody to keratan sulfate, but could be separated from the proteoglycan by gel filtration chromatography in dissociative agents. The three proteins produced different fragmentation patterns on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after digestion with V8 protease, and each had unique two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the core proteins differed. In addition, the proteoglycans containing these proteins differed in molecular size, suggesting different levels of glycosylation of the two core proteins. Similarity of the core proteins was suggested by similar amino acid composition, similarities in tryptic maps, and antigenic cross-reactivity. Corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan, therefore, seems to occur in two different, but related, forms whose core proteins may represent members of a homologous family."

https://openalex.org/W1556121347,"The ATP synthases of eubacteria and eukaryotes possess a conserved tyrosine (beta 331) that is labeled by ATP analogs and is believed to be at the catalytic site. In this report, this tyrosine was replaced by Phe, Ser, Cys, Gly, and Ala in an attempt to determine its role in catalysis. Each of the beta 331 mutant strains assembled an ATP synthase. Membranes from the beta 331-Ser, -Cys, -Ala, or -Gly strains showed strongly attenuated ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven proton-pumping activities. The beta 331-Phe membranes showed nearly normal ATPase and functional proton pumping. A new purification procedure yielding highly active unc+ F1 (ATPase rates greater than 1000 s-1) allowed rapid isolation of soluble F1-ATPases. Kinetic analyses of purified enzymes confirmed that the structural and functional properties of beta 331-Tyr can be substituted by Phe but not effectively by Ser, Cys, Ala, or Gly. Since all of the beta 331 mutant enzymes catalyzed measurable ATP hydrolysis, it is clear that beta 331-Tyr is not directly involved in the bond making-breaking steps of catalysis. The ability of the beta 331-Phe enzyme to rapidly bind and hydrolyze ATP, and the results with other beta 331 mutant enzymes, suggests that a residue with an aromatic character is required at this position."
https://openalex.org/W1610315700,"Messenger RNA maturation in trypanosomes involves an RNA trans-splicing reaction in which a 39 nucleotide 5'-spliced leader (SL), derived from an independently transcribed 139 nucleotide SL RNA, is joined to pre-mRNAs. Trans-splicing intermediates are structurally consistent with a mechanism of SL addition which is similar to that of cis-splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs; homologous components (e.g. the U small nuclear RNAs) exist in both cis- and trans-splicing systems, suggesting that these also participate in the two types of splicing reactions. In this study, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing the trypanosome SL and U2 RNAs were purified and characterized. Although present at low levels in cellular extracts, the SL and U2 RNPs are the two most abundant of the several non-ribosomal small RNP complexes in these cells. The purification scheme utilizes ion-exchange chromatography, equilibrium density centrifugation, and gel filtration chromatography and reveals that the SL RNP shares biophysical properties with U RNPs of trypanosomes and other eukaryotes; its sedimentation coefficient in sucrose gradients is approximately 10 S, and it is resistant to dissociation during Cs2SO4 equilibrium density centrifugation. Complete separation of the SL and U2 RNPs was achieved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins purifying with the SL and U2 RNPs were identified by 125I-labeling of tyrosine residues. Four SL RNP proteins with approximate molecular masses of 36, 32, 30, and 27 kDa and one U2 RNP protein of 31 kDa were identified, suggesting that different polypeptides are associated with these two RNAs. These particles are not immunoprecipitated by anti-Sm sera which recognizes U snRNP proteins of other eukaryotes including humans plants and yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1536132480,"WiDR colorectal carcinoma cells are highly sensitive to the synergistic cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma). In the present study, we have investigated the effects of recombinant human (rh) TNF and IFN-gamma on the binding of both ligands in this cell line. WiDR cells exhibited high affinity binding sites for both 125I-rhTNF (Kd = 1.66 x 10(-10) M, 920 sites/cell) and 125I-rhIFN-gamma (Kd = 4.15 x 10(-10) M, 18,960 sites/cell). Preincubation of the cells with rhTNF (24 h) increased cell-associated 125I-rhIFN-gamma radioactivity by 129% when binding was carried out at 37 degrees C, as a result of an increase in both surface bound and internalized 125I-rhIFN-gamma. However, rhTNF did not alter the degradation profile of released 125I-rhIFN-gamma radioactivity. Scatchard analysis of 125I-rhIFN-gamama binding data (4 degrees C) revealed that rhTNF induced a 245% increase in 125I-rhIFN-gamma binding sites. Conversely, rhIFN-gamma caused a 68% increase in 125I-rhTNF binding sites and a 58% increase in receptor affinity. rhIFN-gamma also increased the subsequent binding of 125I-rhIFN-gamma, whereas rhTNF increased the subsequent binding of 125I-rhTNF. Furthermore, preincubation of the cells with both rhTNF and rhIFN-gamma also resulted in an increase in the binding of both ligands. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide blocked all the effects of rhTNF and rhIFN-gamma on ligand binding. However, the basal level of 125I-rhIFN-gamma binding was insensitive to either inhibitor, whereas the basal level of 125I-rhTNF binding was decreased by both inhibitors. These data indicate that in some cell types TNF and IFN-gamma may induce an increase in their own receptors (homologous up-regulation) and concomitantly increase each other's receptors (heterologous up-regulation) and that these actions are due, in part, to enhanced receptor synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1501171534,"Isometric force developed by skinned gizzard muscle fiber bundles and levels of phosphorylation and thiophosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain were determined. These data showed a highly non-linear relationship between isometric force and myosin light-chain phosphorylation. Maximum force was developed at approximately 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of light chain as reported previously (Hoar, P. E., Kerrick, W. G. L., and Cassidy, P. S. (1979) Science 204, 503-506). In contrast, the relationship between isometric force and myosin light-chain thiophosphorylation was linear, with maximum force occurring at 1.0 mol of thiophosphate/mol of myosin light chain. These observations are consistent with the latch-bridge hypothesis for conditions of varying myosin light-chain phosphatase/myosin light-chain kinase activity ratios as discussed by Hai and Murphy [1988) Am. J. Physiol. 254, C99-C106). To further test the latch-bridge hypothesis, ATPase activity was also measured during isometric force development in these fiber bundles. The relationship between isometric force and ATPase activity was linear whether the myosin light chains were phosphorylated or thiophosphorylated. Thus the number of cycling myosin cross-bridges, as measured by ATPase activity, was directly proportional to the force the muscle developed, not to the level of myosin light-chain phosphorylation. This finding that high levels of tension generated at low levels of light-chain phosphorylation are associated with high levels of ATPase activity is inconsistent with the latch-bridge model (Hai and Murphy, 1988)."
https://openalex.org/W1539346908,"To elucidate the mechanism by which C4b-binding protein inhibits the cofactor activity of protein S for anticoagulant-activated protein C, the interactions between protein S, activated protein C, and C4b-binding protein were studied using solid-phase enzyme immunoassays. Both activated protein C and C4b-binding protein bound to protein S fixed to microplate wells. C4b-binding protein did not inhibit the binding of activated protein C to protein S, nor did activated protein C inhibit the binding of C4b-binding protein to protein S. Activated protein C bound to a protein S-C4b-binding protein complex which was cross-linked with a chemical reagent as well as it bound to free protein S. Protein S-C4b-binding protein complex competitively inhibited activated protein C-binding to free protein S and also the cofactor activity of free protein S. Immunoblotting analysis showed ternary complex formation with protein S, C4b-binding protein, and activated protein C in the liquid phase by treatment with the cross-linking reagent. These findings suggest that the protein S-C4b-binding protein complex inhibits the cofactor activity of free protein S probably by inhibition of functionally active protein S-activated protein C complex formation by the apparent competitive formation of an inactive ternary complex with protein S, C4b-binding protein, and activated protein C."
https://openalex.org/W1512355798,"Homologous pairing between gapped circular and partially homologous form I DNA, catalyzed by Escherichia coli RecA protein, leads to the formation of nascent synaptic joints between regions of duplex DNA. These duplex-duplex interactions result in underwinding of the form I DNA, as detected by a topoisomerase assay. Underwound DNA species have been studied with regard to their formation, stability, and topological requirements. The synaptic joints are short-lived and of low frequency compared with those formed between single-stranded and duplex DNA. Measurement of the degree of underwinding indicates joints 300-400 base pairs in length, in which the two DNA molecules are presumed to be interwound within the RecA-nucleoprotein filament. Underwound DNA was not detected in reactions between gapped DNA and partially homologous nicked circular or relaxed covalently closed DNA. We have also investigated the requirements for the initiation of strand exchange. Previous results have shown that strand exchange requires a homologous 3'-terminus complementary to the gapped region. We now show that the minimum length of overlap required for efficient initiation of strand exchange is one to two turns of DNA within the RecA-DNA nucleoprotein filament."
https://openalex.org/W1671991021,"Thrombospondin (TSP), an adhesive glycoprotein found in platelets and extracellular matrix, has been shown previously to interact with plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, resulting in efficient plasmin generation. We now demonstrate specific complex formation of TSP with both the single-chain and two-chain forms of urokinase (scuPA and uPA). Binding of uPA and scuPA to immobilized TSP was detected and quantified using colorimetric immunoassays and a functional amidolytic assay. Binding was time and concentration dependent with apparent affinity constants of 40-50 nM. Binding was not affected by serine protease inhibitors, EDTA, or epsilon-aminocaproic acid. scUPA and uPA bound to TSP retained functional activity. Using a sensitive amidolytic assay we found that TSP. scuPA complexes were efficiently converted to TSP. uPA by catalytic plasmin concentrations. Additionally, TSP.uPA complexes were found to have plasminogen-activating activity equivalent to fluid-phase uPA and to be protected from inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, the major plasma and matrix plasminogen activator inhibitor. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we also demonstrated co-distribution of TSP and uPA in normal and malignant breast tissue. Complex formation of TSP with uPA may serve to localize, concentrate, and protect these enzymes on cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix, thereby providing a reservoir of plasminogen activator activity."
https://openalex.org/W1532114873,"The ultrastructure and biochemical characteristics of HMW-2, the Sertoli cell cytoplasmic dynein isolated from rat testes, were analyzed. Electron microscopic studies revealed a two-headed two-stem structure with dimensions very similar to other dyneins. We found that, like other cytoplasmic dyneins, both heads have an approximately spherical shape with a central cavity. Heavy chain analysis suggested the presence of only one type of heavy chain, a finding that was supported by the simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics displayed by the HMW-2-associated ATPase activity. In addition, dissociation of the HMW-2 complex resulted in a single type of dynein subunit sedimenting at 11.8 S. This fraction contained all the polypeptides present in the undissociated HMW-2. Ultrastructurally the HMW-2 subunits were composed of one globular domain with a tail. The simplest interpretation is that HMW-2 is a dimer of nearly identical subunits, each containing one heavy chain, one 90-kDa intermediate chain, and two light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1563440540,"IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta although distantly related at the primary sequence level, bind to the same Mr 80,000 IL-1 receptor on various cell types. Several lines of evidence indicate, however, that the IL-1 receptor on B cells and T cells differ. By binding experiments with 125I-IL-1, marked heterogeneity in IL-1 receptor binding was observed in 13 of 24 B cell lines studied. This was classified into three categories: (I) in nine cell lines, 125I-IL-1 alpha binding revealed high (kD = 10(-10) M) and low affinity (kD = 10(-8) M) IL-1 alpha receptors, whereas 125I-IL-1 beta binding showed one class only with intermediate affinity (kD = 10(-9) M); (II) in three cell lines selective binding with 125I-IL-1 beta was observed; (III) in one cell line only, 125IL-1 alpha and 125I-IL-1 beta bind to a single class of IL-1 receptors as has been described for most cell types. Cross-linking with 125I-IL-1 alpha or 125I-IL-1 beta demonstrated their specific binding to Mr 80,000 and to Mr 68,000 in cell lines in categories I and III, whereas for those in category II, binding to the IL-1 receptor was confined to 125I-IL-1 beta. The expression of two subsets of IL-1 alpha receptors but only one class of IL-1 beta receptors was further confirmed in kinetic studies. Internalization at 37 degrees C demonstrated that only 19% of IL-1 beta was internalized and that binding with IL-1 alpha was entirely cell surface. Flow cytometry studies showed that IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta do not influence B cell surface antigen expression, suggesting that the ability of IL-1 to influence B cell proliferation is not mediated via direct binding to the IL-1 receptor only."
https://openalex.org/W1581973776,"We have recently shown that nanomolar concentrations of glucagon-(19-29), which can derive from native glucagon by proteolytic cleavage of the dibasic doublet Arg17-Arg18, inhibit the Ca2+ pump in liver plasma membrane vesicles independently of adenylyl cyclase activation (Mallat, A., Pavoine, C., Dufour, M., Lotersztajn, S., Bataille, D., and Pecker, F. (1987) Nature 325, 620-622). We report here that the regulation of the Ca2+ pump by glucagon-(19-29) is dependent on guanine nucleotides. In the presence of 10 microM guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S) or 75 microM GTP, glucagon-(19-29) caused a biphasic regulation of the Ca2+ pump. ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was inhibited in the presence of 10 pM to 1 nM glucagon-(19-29), while higher concentrations of the peptide (1-100 nM) reversed the inhibition caused by lower ones. GTP gamma S alone, at high concentrations (100 microM), reproduced the inhibitory effect of glucagon-(19-29) and induced a 40% inhibition of the basal activity of the Ca2+ pump which was reversed by low concentrations of glucagon-(19-29) (10 pM to 1 nM). Treatment of rats with cholera toxin resulted in a 70% increase in the basal activity of the Ca2+ pump, a loss of sensitivity to GTP gamma S and to the biphasic regulation by glucagon-(19-29). Treatment with pertussis toxin did not affect the response of the Ca2+ pump to GTP gamma S and glucagon-(19-29). We conclude that glucagon-(19-29) can exert a biphasic effect on the Ca2+ pump which is mediated by G protein(s) sensitive to cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1532941949,"A Ca2(+)-dependent ATP-hydrolytic activity was detected in the crude membrane ghost of the promastigote or vector form of the protozoal parasite Leishmania donovani, the pathogen responsible for kala azar. The Ca2(+)-ATPase was purified to apparent homogeneity after solubilization with deoxycholate. The enzyme consists of two subunits of Mr = 51,000 and 57,000 and has an apparent molecular weight of 215,000 +/- 12,000. The enzyme activity is exclusively dependent on Ca2+, and the pure enzyme can hydrolyze 1.6 mumol of ATP/min/mg of protein. The apparent Km for Ca2+ is 35 nM, which is further reduced to 12 nM in the presence of heterologous calmodulin. The enzyme is sensitive to vanadate, but is insensitive to oligomycin and ouabain. The enzyme is strongly associated with the plasma membrane and has its catalytic site oriented toward the cytoplasmic face. The enzyme spans across the plasma membrane as surface labeling with radioiodine shows considerable radioactivity in the completely purified enzyme. The localization and orientation of this high affinity, calmodulin-sensitive Ca2(+)-ATPase suggest some role of this enzyme in Ca2+ movement in the life cycle of this protozoal parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1509297261,"The tissue contents of previously known allosteric effectors of brain phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) (PFK) and the kinetic behavior of isolated PFK were investigated during the initiation of rapid glycolytic flux in freeze-blown rat brain. Comparing 0- with 5-s brains revealed that there was a 4-fold drop in total tissue content of Fru-6-P and a 5.6-fold increase in Fru-1,6-P2 consistent with activation of PFK. Additionally, analysis of brain content showed a 15-fold increase in AMP, a 3-fold decrease in ATP, a 3-fold decrease in Pi, and a 1.6-fold increase in NH4+. There was no change in Fru-2,6-P2, H+, citrate, or Glc-1,6-P2 or the kinetic profiles of isolated PFK for ATP inhibition or Fru-2,6-P2 activation. We concluded that the observed change in PFK activity could be accounted for only partially by changes in the concentrations of adenine nucleotides and other known effectors. High performance liquid chromatography fractions of extracts obtained from 5-s brains showed the activator with a mobility identical to ribose 1,5-P2 and gave 2 nmol/g (wet weight) at 0 s, 10 nmol/g at 5 s, and 2 nmol/g at 20 s. Assay of PFK in the presence of effectors determined to be in tissue at 5 s showed that addition of 10 nmol/ml ribose 1,5-P2 gave a 4-fold activation of PFK. Based on the rapidity of its formation, its potency of activation, and its similarity in chemical properties to authentic ribose 1,5-P2, we conclude that ribose 1,5-P2 served as the initial activator of PFK in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1570999163,"The T cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum where it associates with the TCR alpha-chain and the members of the CD3 complex to form the complete receptor. When the other chains of the complex are not available, the beta-chain is rapidly degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum. When incomplete TCR.CD3 complexes are formed, they are transported through the Golgi apparatus and degraded in lysosomes. In this study, a truncated form of the TCR beta-chain has been made by removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments. Unlike the normal beta-chain, the truncated molecule is stable and is transported through the Golgi apparatus and secreted. This process occurs at a similar rate in both T and B cells, indicating that it is not affected by the presence or absence of CD3 components. These data suggest that an element in the transmembrane or cytoplasmic region of the beta-chain confers sensitivity to the degradative control mechanisms that regulate TCR expression."
https://openalex.org/W1482241288,"The T-cell antigen receptor mediates recognition of foreign antigens physically associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. The tertiary structure of the T-cell receptor is thought to resemble that of immunoglobulin Fab fragments and to possess corresponding complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that contact antigen-MHC. To test such a model for the T-cell receptor, we have generated T-cell hybridomas that express a wild-type or mutant form of the T-cell receptor present on the p-azobenzenearsonate-specific T-cell clone D5. Mutation of 2 amino acids (Tyr26 to serine, Gly28 to valine) in the predicted CDR1 of the D5 T-cell receptor alpha chain caused a markedly diminished response to antigen without affecting the response to anti-CD3 and anti-T-cell receptor antibodies. These results constitute the first test of the prediction that CDR1 in the T-cell receptor alpha chain is important for antigen-MHC recognition, thus providing strong evidence for the structural model of the T-cell antigen receptor based upon immunoglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1571767806,"At pH 7.0 and 5 degrees C, in the absence of potassium and magnesium, the Ca-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum slowly hydrolyzes the Ca.ATP at a rate of 0.05 s-1. During turnover 4 nmol of phosphoenzyme per mg of total protein accumulate with a Km value of 10(-8) M. Combining rapid filtration and rapid acid quenching, we took advantage of the above properties to study the early steps of phosphorylation. (formula; see text) Direct measurements by rapid filtration of the rate constant of Ca.ATP binding (k1 = 3.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) and dissociation (k-1 = 2.5 s-1) enable us to estimate Ca.ATP affinity (Kd = 7 x 10(-7) M). Rapid acid quenching shows that covalent phosphoenzyme forms slowly with a rate constant of 0.6 s-1 (k2), and parallel filtration experiments indicate that phosphorylation and ADP release occur simultaneously. If the reaction is reversed (toward ATP synthesis) 70% of the phosphoenzyme is ADP-sensitive and ADP-induced dephosphorylation is fast (k-2 = 15 s-1), whereas the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme slowly hydrolyzes in the forward direction of the ATPase cycle at a rate of 0.05 s-1. Combination of rapid filtration and rapid acid quenching and the use of a mixture of [14C]ATP and [32P]ATP allow us to study the kinetics of several transient species. These data are used to develop a molecular mechanism for Ca-ATPase phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1589222013,"The genomic DNA encoding human muscle phosphofructokinase (HPFK-M) exons VII to X has been cloned and the coding regions have been sequenced. The intron/exon boundaries are located at the same positions as those identified for the rabbit phosphofructokinase-M gene (Lee, C. -P., Kao, M. -C., French, B. A., Putney, S. D., and Chang, S. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4195-4199). A HPFK-M cDNA clone lacking the sequences corresponding to exon IX was isolated from a human fibroblast (IMR-90) library, suggesting that the HPFK-M transcript may be alternatively spliced. Exon IX is 93 nucleotides in length, and the absence of this sequence from the HPFK-M transcript would generate an RNA coding for a HPFK-M-related polypeptide lacking 31 amino acids compared with the HPFK-M polypeptide. HPFK-M transcripts approximately 3.0 kilobases in length are expressed in a tissue-specific manner with high levels in cell lines and skeltal muscle tissue and very low levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and liver tissue. Characterization of the structure of these HPFK-M transcripts by nuclease S1 and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that all the cell lines and tissues examined expressed the alternatively spliced transcript in addition to the transcript coding for the enzymatically functional HPFK-M polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1561832951,"Eleven species of monoclonal antibodies directed against the trimeric P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase have been selected and characterized. Seven of these antibodies recognize the native tailspike, both isolated and assembled onto the virion, and prevent phage infection. Four antibodies react with denatured forms of the tailspike as well as with the plastic absorbed tailspike. Three of these latter prevent the tailspike from assembling onto the phage head. The antibodies have been tested against tailspike proteins carrying single amino acid substitutions at 15 different sites on the protein. Two of these mutations interfere with binding by a set of the monoclonals, indicating that they disrupt the epitopes for these antibodies. Since amino acid replacements corresponding to the temperature-sensitive folding mutations do not change the conformation of the native protein, these mutant proteins may be particularly useful for mapping epitopes. Amber fragments of the tailspike chain are recognized predominantly by the anti-denatured antibodies suggesting either that they are conformationally closer to folding intermediates than to the native tailspike or that the epitopes recognized by anti-native antibodies are carried by the C-terminal end of the native protein. Immunochemical detection by an anti-denatured antibody, after sucrose gradient sedimentation of a large 55-kDa amber fragment, indicates a monomeric rather than a trimeric state. This suggests that the missing C-terminal region is important for the trimerization reaction. Such N-terminal amber fragments may be useful models for studying with the monoclonal antibodies the nascent chain emerging from the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1560972599,"We characterize here a lysosomal cystine transporter in mouse L-929 fibroblasts. Granular fractions from cells preloaded with cystine demonstrated countertransport that showed no dependence on Na+ or K+. The Michaelis constant for infinite-trans influx was 0.27 +/- 0.06 mM (n = 3), and a nonsaturable component of cystine entry was observed with Kd = 0.8-1.8 nmol of cystine.min-1.unit of hexosaminidase-1.mM-1. We found no evidence that cystine was also carried on any of the other known lysosomal amino acid transporters. Over 50 analogs were tested for their ability to inhibit countertransport. The inhibition constants are reported for selenocystine, cystathionine, selenomethionine, and leucine. Significant requirements for recognition by the transporter were the presence of amino groups, L configuration, and a chain length not greater than eight atoms. A net positive or negative charge was not required. Some di- as well as tetrapolar amino acids were recognized. We have surmised that the binding site has polar and apolar domains, the latter being large enough to accommodate branching on C-3 and the substitution of selenium or carbon in place of sulfur."
https://openalex.org/W1496171605,"The bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (MF1) is inactivated by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylethenoadenosine (FSB epsilon A) with pseudo-first order kinetics. The dependence of the rate of inactivation on the concentration of FSB epsilon A revealed an apparent Kd of 0.25 mM. ATP and ADP, and to a lesser extent, ITP and IDP provide partial protection against inactivation by the reagent. Isolation and sequence analysis of major radioactive fragments in peptic or cyanogen bromide digests of MF1 inactivated with [3H]FSB epsilon A indicate that modification of Tyr-alpha 244 is associated with the loss of activity observed. Assessment of the amount of Tyr-alpha 244 derivatized with [3H]FSB epsilon A at specific points during inactivation of the ATPase indicates that maximal inactivation is achieved on modification of this residue in slightly greater than one copy of the alpha subunit. The following characteristics of inactivation of MF1 by FSB epsilon A have also been determined. (a) The rate of inactivation of ITPase activity by FSB epsilon A is 1.4 times greater than that observed for inactivation of ATPase activity under identical conditions. (b) After maximally inactivating the capacity of MF1 to hydrolyze saturating ATP with FSB epsilon A, the modified enzyme retained its capacity to hydrolyze substoichiometric ATP. (c) Inactivation of the ATPase by FSB epsilon A is accelerated by Pi. In each of the above characteristics, MF1 modified by FSB epsilon A resembles enzyme inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) more than it does enzyme inactivated with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoylinosine (FSBI). Furthermore, prior inactivation of MF1 with FSBA completely prevents labeling of Tyr-alpha 244 with [3H]FSB epsilon A, whereas prior inactivation of the enzyme with FSBI does not. Since a single catalytic site is modified when FSBI inactivates MF1 whereas three noncatalytic sites are modified when it is maximally inactivated with FSBA, it is concluded that FSB epsilon A also modifies noncatalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1480684318,"Myosin II from Acanthamoeba castellanii is a conventional myosin composed of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains. The amino-terminal approximately 90 kDa of each heavy chain form a globular head that contains the ATPase site and an ATP-sensitive actin-binding site. The carboxyl-terminal approximately 80 kDa of both heavy chains interact to form a coiled coil, helical rod (through which the molecules self-associate into bipolar filaments) ending in a short nonhelical tailpiece. Phosphorylation of 3 serine residues at the tip of the tail (at positions 11, 16, and 21 from the carboxyl terminus) inactivates the actin-activated Mg2(+)-ATPase activity of myosin II filaments. Previous work had indicated that the activity of each myosin II molecule in a filament reflects the global state of phosphorylation of the filament rather than the phosphorylation state of the molecule itself. We have now purified the approximately 28-kDa carboxyl-terminal region of the heavy chain lacking the last two phosphorylation sites, and we have shown that this peptide copolymerizes with and regulates the actin-activated Mg2(+)-ATPase activities of native dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin II. It can be concluded from these studies that the biologically relevant enzymatic activity of myosin II is regulated by a phosphorylation-dependent conformational change in the myosin filaments."

The D-1 receptors, solubilized from these membranes with 1% sodium cholate in the presence of phospholipids, bound with high efficiency (greater than 90%) to mercury-agarose columns. The bound receptors were eluted from the affinity column with a -SH reducing agent, beta-mercaptoethanol. Upon removal of beta-mercaptoethanol from the eluted fractions by inclusion chromatography, the receptor was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and assayed for ligand binding activity. The affinity purified receptor exhibited saturable and specific binding of the D-1-specific ligand 125I-SCH 23982, with a Kd of 1.6 nM comparable to that measured in intact membranes and solubilized extracts. The binding capacity of these receptors for 125I-SCH 23982 was 11,000 pmol/mg protein, representing greater than an 8000-fold purification over the starting membrane preparation. The purity of the affinity eluted receptors was estimated to be 78%. The purified receptors retained the pharmacological properties of membrane-bound receptors, including the ability to distinguish between active and inactive enantiomers of specific dopaminergic antagonists. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining revealed the presence of two major polypeptides of 74 and 54 kDa. These two polypeptides were absent in those affinity eluted fractions which did not display 125I-SCH 23982-binding activity and also were not detected in preparations obtained from membranes which were NEM-treated in the absence of D-1-specific agonist. The molecular weights of these polypeptides were similar to those of membrane-bound D-1 receptors, when labeled with a D-1-specific photo-affinity ligand, 125I-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-(4-azidphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-b enzazepine.

https://openalex.org/W607967094,"The effect of a carboxylic ionophore (lasalocid) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase was investigated. The purified enzyme was preincubated with lasalocid in the presence of Ca2+ and the absence of K+ at pH 7.0 and 0 degrees C for 2 h. The Ca2(+)-dependent ATPase activity was strongly inhibited by this preincubation, whereas the activity of the contaminant Mg2(+)-ATPase was unaffected. The steady-state level of the phosphoenzyme (EP) intermediate remained constant over the wide range of lasalocid concentrations. The Ca2(+)-induced enzyme activation was unaffected. The kinetics of phosphorylation of the Ca2(+)-activated enzyme by ATP as well as the rate of conversion of ADP-sensitive EP to ADP-insensitive EP were also unaffected. Accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP was greatly enhanced, and almost all of the EP accumulating at steady state was ADP-insensitive. Hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP was strongly inhibited. A similar strong inhibition of the Ca2(+)-dependent ATPase activity by lasalocid was found with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. To examine the effect of lasalocid on the conformational change in each reaction step, the Ca2(+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was labeled with a fluorescent probe (N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine) without a loss of catalytic activity and then preincubated with lasalocid as described above. The conformational changes involved in hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP and in the reversal of this hydrolysis were appreciably retarded by lasalocid. The conformational changes involved in other reaction steps were unaffected. These results demonstrate that hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP in the catalytic cycle of this enzyme is selectively inhibited by lasalocid."

This transition was supposed to be detectable as changes in the affinity of the protein for monoclonal IgGs. In this study, we introduced an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which enabled us to assay unbound IgG sensitively and quantitatively under the conditions for the RecA protein-mediated joint molecule formation. Through the use of this method, we studied the affinity of three anti-RecA protein monoclonal IgGs toward the RecA protein at the various stages of its activation during the formation of homologous joints. We found that the affinity of the RecA protein changed for each anti-RecA protein-IgG in a specific manner and the change in the cross-reactivity of the RecA protein correlated with its multiple activation stages. This result suggests that the RecA protein changes its higher order structure which is specific to each activation stage during the formation of homologous joint molecules."
