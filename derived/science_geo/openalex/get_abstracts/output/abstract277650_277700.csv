https://openalex.org/W2166607329,Exploration of the generality of the recently discovered reaction whereby certain organic molecules can be inserted between the metallic layers of the superconductors tantalum disulfide and niobium disulfide revealed that a large variety of organic and inorganic molecules can penetrate between the crystalline layers of a number of transition metal dichalcogenides and that the resulting complexes are superconducting if the layered chalcogenide from which they are formed is superconducting. The critical temperatures of the 50 new superconductors we report depend on the nature of the intercalate but are insensitive to a separation of the superconducting planes of up to 57 angstroms.

https://openalex.org/W2044156215,"Several layered, transition metal dichalcogenide intercalation complexes with unique superconducting properties have been examined by high-resolution electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Details of the crystalline lattice and of the lattice imperfections have been directly resolved. The results can be correlated with the available x-ray diffraction and chemical data, and they confirm and extend the postulated models."

It should be observed, however, that ordinary telegraphy and telephony and electrical transmission of large amounts of power is aerial transmission and faces some of the problems which confront us to-day in wireless transmission. But, of course, the problems of aerial transmission in their relation to wireless telegraphy and telephony present their most interesting aspect and I shall, therefore, devote most of my time this evening to this particular aspect, of the problem of aerial transmission. Permit me now to differentiate, briefly, wireless transmission from ordinary electrical transmission."
