https://openalex.org/W2110827218,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce chemokines responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of injury or infection. Here we show that the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channel TRPM2 controls ROS-induced chemokine production in monocytes. In human U937 monocytes, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) evokes Ca(2+) influx through TRPM2 to activate Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and amplify Erk signaling via Ras GTPase. This elicits nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB essential for the production of the chemokine interleukin-8 (CXCL8). In monocytes from Trpm2-deficient mice, H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) influx and production of the macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (CXCL2), the mouse CXCL8 functional homolog, were impaired. In the dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis inflammation model, CXCL2 expression, neutrophil infiltration and ulceration were attenuated by Trpm2 disruption. Thus, TRPM2 Ca(2+) influx controls the ROS-induced signaling cascade responsible for chemokine production, which aggravates inflammation. We propose functional inhibition of TRPM2 channels as a new therapeutic strategy for treating inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2069342665,"Rod/cone photoreceptors of the outer retina and the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) of the inner retina mediate non-image forming visual responses including entrainment of the circadian clock to the ambient light, the pupillary light reflex (PLR), and light modulation of activity. Targeted deletion of the melanopsin gene attenuates these adaptive responses with no apparent change in the development and morphology of the mRGCs. Comprehensive identification of mRGCs and knowledge of their specific roles in image-forming and non-image forming photoresponses are currently lacking. We used a Cre-dependent GFP expression strategy in mice to genetically label the mRGCs. This revealed that only a subset of mRGCs express enough immunocytochemically detectable levels of melanopsin. We also used a Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) expression approach to express the DTR in mRGCs. mRGCs develop normally, but can be acutely ablated upon diphtheria toxin administration. The mRGC-ablated mice exhibited normal outer retinal function. However, they completely lacked non-image forming visual responses such as circadian photoentrainment, light modulation of activity, and PLR. These results point to the mRGCs as the site of functional integration of the rod/cone and melanopsin phototransduction pathways and as the primary anatomical site for the divergence of image-forming and non-image forming photoresponses in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2015437876,"The high prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements (∼60%) in prostate cancer (CaP) leads to androgenic induction of the ETS-related gene (ERG) expression. However, the biological functions of ERG overexpression in CaP remain to be understood. ERG knockdown in TMPRSS2-ERG expressing CaP cells induced striking morphological changes and inhibited cell growth both in cell culture and SCID mice. Evaluation of the transcriptome and specific gene promoters in ERG siRNA-treated cells and investigation of gene expression signatures of human prostate tumors revealed ERG-mediated activation of C-MYC oncogene and the repression of prostate epithelial differentiation genes (PSA and SLC45A3/Prostein). Taken together, these data combining cell culture and animal models and human prostate tumors reveal that ERG overexpression in prostate tumor cells may contribute to the neoplastic process by activating C-MYC and by abrogating prostate epithelial differentiation as indicated by prostate epithelial specific markers."
https://openalex.org/W2062334174,"Noninvasively monitoring immune function by positron emission tomography could affect the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of immunological disorders. Progress, however, has been hampered by the lack of probes with distinct biodistribution patterns. Radu et al. exploit the fact that many immune cells utilize a salvage pathway for nucleotide generation during DNA synthesis to develop [18F]FAC (1-(2′-deoxy-2′[18F]fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine), a new probe with increased accumulation in proliferating T cells. Studies in mice show it has advantages over commonly used probes and may be clinically useful. Monitoring immune function with molecular imaging could have a considerable impact on the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of immunological disorders and therapeutic immune responses. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality with applications in cancer and other diseases. PET studies of immune function have been limited by a lack of specialized probes. We identified [18F]FAC (1-(2′-deoxy-2′-[18F]fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine) by differential screening as a new PET probe for the deoxyribonucleotide salvage pathway. [18F]FAC enabled visualization of lymphoid organs and was sensitive to localized immune activation in a mouse model of antitumor immunity. [18F]FAC microPET also detected early changes in lymphoid mass in systemic autoimmunity and allowed evaluation of immunosuppressive therapy. These data support the use of [18F]FAC PET for immune monitoring and suggest a wide range of clinical applications in immune disorders and in certain types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1993780555,"The mammalian cytosolic/nuclear thioredoxin system, comprising thioredoxin (Trx), selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH, is the major protein-disulfide reductase of the cell and has numerous functions. The active site of reduced Trx comprises Cys32-Gly-Pro-Cys35 thiols that catalyze target disulfide reduction, generating a disulfide. Human Trx1 has also three structural Cys residues in positions 62, 69, and 73 that upon diamide oxidation induce a second Cys62–Cys69 disulfide as well as dimers and multimers. We have discovered that after incubation with H2O2 only monomeric two-disulfide molecules are generated, and they are inactive but able to regain full activity in an autocatalytic process in the presence of NADPH and TrxR. There are conflicting results regarding the effects of S-nitrosylation on Trx antioxidant functions and which residues are involved. We found that S-nitrosoglutathione-mediated S-nitrosylation at physiological pH is critically dependent on the redox state of Trx. Starting from fully reduced human Trx, both Cys69 and Cys73 were nitrosylated, and the active site formed a disulfide; the nitrosylated Trx was not a substrate for TrxR but regained activity after a lag phase consistent with autoactivation. Treatment of a two-disulfide form of Trx1 with S-nitrosoglutathione resulted in nitrosylation of Cys73, which can act as a trans-nitrosylating agent as observed by others to control caspase 3 activity (Mitchell, D. A., and Marletta, M. A. (2005) Nat. Chem. Biol. 1, 154–158). The reversible inhibition of human Trx1 activity by H2O2 and NO donors is suggested to act in cell signaling via temporal control of reduction for the transmission of oxidative and/or nitrosative signals in thiol redox control.

The reduced or dithiol form Trx-(SH)2 utilizes its exposed nucleophilic CysN residue to attack a target protein disulfide and form a transient mixed disulfide, which is subsequently attacked by the CysC residue to generate oxidized Trx-S2 and the reduced protein (Reaction 1). Trx-S2 is a substrate for NADPH and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (Reaction 2). x0026;TRX-(SH)2+Protein-S2→Trx-S2+Protein-(SH)2x0026;Trx-S2+NADPH+H+→TrxRTrx-(SH)2+NADP+(Eq. 1) Escherichia coli Trx has only two Cys residues in the conserved active site (1Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but mammalian cytosolic thioredoxins (Trx1) have additional structural cysteines. For human Trx1, they are located in positions 62, 69, and 73 (see Fig. 1). Post-translational modifications of Trx1 via these cysteine residues, such as thiol oxidation, glutathionylation, and S-nitrosylation have been proposed to regulate function and are implicated in signal transduction pathways (3Casagrande S. Bonetto V. Fratelli M. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Massignan T. Salmona M. Chang G. Holmgren A. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 2153-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For instance, the loss of Trx activity and aggregation of the protein after oxidation was reported for the first time during purification (5Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was later shown to be due to the formation of a second disulfide motif (6Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O. Reed M.S. Powis G. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33408-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Watson et al. (6Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O.

These modifications are mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which are involved in numerous processes such as cell signaling (7Valko M. Leibfritz D.

Immunobiology. 1983; 165: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, excessive ROS and RNS are also involved in pathogenesis of several diseases under oxidative or nitrosative stress (9Dhalla N.S. Temsah R.M. Netticadan T. J.

The role of ROS in cell signaling, specially via the effect on mitogen-activated protein kinases and activation of nuclear transcription factors, is well known (13Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). For example, H2O2 is involved in signaling pathways (15Veal E.A. Day A.M. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 16Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar); however, it is not precisely understood how H2O2 functions as a signaling molecule in vertebrates (17Stone J.R. Yang S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 243-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Proteins containing thiol groups are one of the molecular targets of H2O2 causing selective thiol oxidation (18Baty J.W. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). NO is also a reactive radical gas that is implicated in numerous physiological states (19Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 20Lowenstein C.J. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Intern.

Jang S.I. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 35: 116-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as pathophysiologic conditions (23Vincent J.L. Zhang H. Szabo C. Preiser J.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Boje K.M. Front Biosci. 2004; 9: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). NO exerts its effects via cGMP formation as well as cGMP-independent mechanisms such as nitration and nitrosylation of proteins (25Thippeswamy T. McKay J.S. Quinn J.P. Morris R. Histol. Histopathol. 2006; 21: 445-458PubMed Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation is a post-translational modification, involved in the regulation of structure or activity of certain proteins (26Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 27Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Human Trx1 is such a protein, but the available data are controversial. In two studies, S-nitrosylation of hTrx1 at only one structural Cys residue was reported. Haendeler et al. (28Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) detected the S-nitrosylation of Cys69 under basal conditions, which was asserted to be essential for anti-apoptotic and redox regulatory function of the protein and to increase Trx catalytic activity. But, Mitchell and Marletta (29Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) showed the oxidation of active site cysteines to a disulfide as well as the extensive nitrosylation of only Cys73 after treating human Trx1 with 50 molar equivalents of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) followed by the biotin switch method and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mapping. They could not detect any significant S-nitrosylation of Cys62 and Cys69. S-Nitrosylation of Cys73 was implicated in the reversible and specific transfer of a nitrosothiol between Trx (Cys73) and caspase 3 (Cys163) in vitro (29Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This transnitrosation reaction was suggested to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. On the other hand, in three other studies, the S-NO content of hTrx was increased after incubation with GSNO in a concentration-dependent manner to a maximum of about 2 mol of S-NO/mol of hTrx (30Sumbayev V.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Tao L. Gao E. Bryan N.S. Qu Y. Liu H.-R. Hu A. Christopher T.A. Lopez B.L. Yodoi J. Koch W.J. Feelisch M.

Biophys. 2004; 428: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sumbayev (30Sumbayev V.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed that S-nitrosylation of Trx correlated directly with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 activation. In another study, comparable with the endogenous S-NO content in endothelial cells that had been utilized by Haendeler et al. (28Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), only 0.3 ± 0.09 mol of S-NO/mol of Trx was detected. However, under this condition, the cardio-protective effect of hTrx1 was markedly enhanced (31Tao L. Gao E. Bryan N.S. Qu Y. Liu H.-R. Hu A. Christopher T.A. Lopez B.L. Yodoi J. Koch W.J. Feelisch M. Ma X.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11471-11476Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a recent study regarding the crystal structure of human Trx1, only Cys62 of GSNO-treated sample became stably nitrosylated in the crystal at neutral pH; Cys69 could also be nitrosylated but required a more alkaline pH (33Weichsel A. Brailey J.L. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this paper we studied the reaction of human Trx1 with diamide and H2O2 as well as GSNO, which is a substrate for mammalian TrxR and was previously shown to inhibit the protein-disulfide reductase activity of the mammalian Trx system (34Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this effect could be due to the S-nitrosylation of Trx (28Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), inhibiting its activity rather than stimulating activity. Our results also suggest a mechanism for reversible inactivation of thioredoxin via H2O2 generated from NADPH oxidases in signaling. Chemicals and Enzyme—Bovine serum albumin, diamide, DTNB, DTT, NADPH, and insulin were purchased from Sigma. The NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. NuPAGE® Bis-Tris gels, NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (4×), and running buffer were from Invitrogen. GSNO was prepared as previously reported (35Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar) by the reaction of acidified sodium nitrite and reduced glutathione. The yield was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 920 m–1 cm–1 at 335 nm. E. coli Trx1 and TrxR (36Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), wild type (wt) hTrx1, and its mutants C62S, C32S/C35S, and C62S/C73S were prepared as described (37Bizzarri C. Holmgren A. Pekkari K. Chang G. Colotta F. Ghezzi P. Bertini R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). E. coli P34H Trx was also utilized (39Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat recombinant TrxR1 was kindly provided by Olle Rengby and Dr. Elias Arner from the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics of the Karolinska Institutet (40Arner E.S. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Reduction of Human Trx1 and Treatment with Oxidants—The protein (100 μm in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4)) was incubated with 100 molar equivalents of DTT for 15 min at 37 °C for reduction. Thereafter, DTT was removed by chromatography using a NAP-5 column equilibrated with TE buffer. After confirming the complete reduction of Trx1 by measuring the number of free thiol groups (as described below), it was incubated with different concentrations of either diamide for less than 2 min at room temperature or H2O2 for 15 min at 37 °C. For the latter, DTT-treated Trx1 was desalted on a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 with or without 1 mm EDTA. S-Nitrosylation Method—The fully reduced Trx1, prepared as described above, was incubated with 10 molar equivalents of GSNO at 37 °C for 60 min, which was followed by a desalting step on a column of NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with TE buffer. Spectrophotometric Analysis of GSNO-treated Thioredoxin—GSNO-treated Trx samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically to quantitate the number of nitrosothiols, using a molar extinction coefficient of 920 m–1 cm–1 at 335 nm. Localization of Nitrosothiols—Using wt and different mutants of hTrx1 including C32S/C35S, C62S/C73S, and C62S, the localization of nitrosothiols was investigated. E. coli Trx was also utilized to investigate whether active site cysteines can be nitrosylated. Determination of Total Thiol Groups—DTNB was used to determine the number of free thiols in reduced, oxidized, or nitrosylated thioredoxin samples (41Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20873) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μm of reduced, oxidized, or nitrosylated protein was incubated with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm DTNB in a final volume of 500 μl of 0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. A molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m–1 cm–1 at 412 nm was used to calculate the number of free thiols. For diamide-treated Trx1, because diamide had not been removed from the sample, the reaction between diamide and free thionitrobenzoate, which is the product of the reaction between thiols and DTNB, was also studied to rule out any bleaching effect of diamide and subsequent interference with the determination of free thiol content. Guanidine hydrochloride 6 m in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTNB were mixed with 25 μm DTT. DTT was excluded from the reference cuvette. After recording the initial absorbance at 412 nm, diamide with a final concentration of 100 μm was added to both the reference and sample cuvettes, and changes at 412 nm were recorded. The decrease of absorbance with a rate of 0.040 min–1 indicated the oxidation of thionitrobenzoate with diamide (data not shown); however, it did not interfere with the determination of free thiol content because of the slow rate of the reaction. Activity of Oxidized Thioredoxin as a Substrate for Thioredoxin Reductase—Oxidized or S-nitrosylated hTrx1 was tested as a substrate for TrxR by following the oxidation of NADPH (Reaction 2). The experiment was performed at 25 °C using 100 μm NADPH and either 20 μm oxidized or nitrosylated Trx1 in a final volume of 500 μl of TE buffer. Trx1 was excluded from the reference cuvette. The reaction was started by adding 10 nm rat TrxR, and the oxidation of NADPH was monitored by following A340 nm. Insulin Disulfide Bond Reduction Activity of Thioredoxin—Two assays were utilized to study the effects of oxidative post-translational modifications of Trx1 on the protein disulfide bond reductase activity of the Trx system. First, as described before (42Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), we mixed 200 μm NADPH and 160 μm insulin in a final volume of 500 μl of TE buffer. In 1-cm semi-micro quartz cuvettes, 2 μm of Trx sample was added to the mixture at 25 °C. Trx1 was excluded from the reference cuvette. After starting the reactions by the addition of 10 nm rat recombinant TrxR to all samples, A340 nm was recorded to calculate and compare the velocity of the reactions. Insulin precipitation assay was also utilized as described (43Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin disulfide bonds can be reduced by DTT leading to the precipitation of reduced insulin, and this reaction is catalyzed by Trx. This activity of Trx was compared between oxidized and nitrosylated molecules using 160 μm insulin, 2 μm of either oxidized or nitrosylated Trx, and 1 mm DTT in a final volume of 500 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 2 mm EDTA. Increase in turbidity was followed by recording A650 nm. TrxR Activity Assay—In a final volume of 500 μl of TE buffer, we mixed 5 mm DTNB, 0.2 mm NADPH, and varying concentrations of either H2O2 or GSNO. The reactions were started by adding 5 nm rat TrxR to all samples, and A412 nm was monitored for 10 min. TrxR was excluded from the reference cuvette. SDS-PAGE—NuPAGE® 12% Bis-Tris gels were utilized for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to study the redox state of reduced and oxidized human Trx1 samples. Fifteen μg of reduced Trx1 as well as samples treated with different concentrations of either diamide or H2O2 were loaded on the gel, and electrophoresis was performed with 200 V for 45 min. DTT was excluded from the sample buffer, and a nonreducing gel was utilized. Oxidation of Human Thioredoxin 1 by Diamide—Chemically reduced human Trx1, with five thiols, was incubated with different concentrations of diamide for 2 min at room temperature; thereafter, the number of free thiols was determined. A decrease in the number of free thiols was recorded by increasing the ratio between diamide and Trx1 (Fig. 1B). With 10 molar equivalents of diamide, all of the cysteine residues were oxidized, and essentially no free thiol was detected in the Trx1. When the structure and redox state of diamide-treated human Trx1 was investigated using nonreducing SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, it was seen that oxidation by diamide led to a complex mixture of monomer, mainly dimers, but also oligomers. The reduced protein was as expected at 12 kDa. The effect of diamide on C62S/C73S Trx1, which has only one structural cysteine (Cys69), showed a progressive dimerization (data not shown). The effect of diamide on the activity of human Trx1 was measured using insulin disulfides as a substrate and recycling of Trx-S2 by NADPH and TrxR (Reactions 1 and 2). With one and three molar equivalents of diamide, the initial activity of Trx1 was decreased to 57 and 6% of the control sample, respectively (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of Trx catalysis was transient, and activity was regained after a lag phase as seen from the progress curves. The duration of the lag phase was a function of diamide concentrations. For the Trx1 C62S/C73S mutant protein (Fig. 2B), the activity was not affected by diamide, indicating that the dimers generated by Cys69 oxidation were active. No further studies of this protein were made. The results are in agreement with those of Watson et al. (6Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O. Reed M.S. Powis G. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33408-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), who, using His-tagged Trx1 showed that diamide generated a second structural disulfide Cys62–Cys69 with a loss of activity. Obviously, diamide is a strong oxidant inducing profound changes in thioredoxin. In particular, the generation of multimers as observed in this study was not evident from the native gel electrophoresis by Watson et al. (6Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O. Reed M.S. Powis G. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33408-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Oxidation of Human Thioredoxin 1 by H2O2—The oxidation of human Trx1 by H2O2 was studied using the same method as described for diamide, except excluding EDTA from the buffer and changing the incubation time to 15 min and the temperature to 37 °C. Similar to the effect of diamide, a progressive decrease in the number of sulfhydryl groups was observed (Fig. 3). However, the number of free thiols did not reach zero. Even with a 100-fold molar excess of H2O2, one free thiol was left in the structure of human Trx1. The redox state of Trx1 after treatment with H2O2 was investigated using nonreducing SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as described. Remarkably, H2O2-treated Trx1 even after treatment with 100 molar equivalents of H2O2 was still in the monomeric form. The same result was obtained with and without EDTA present; EDTA presence decreased the oxidation rate. Thus, H2O2 gives rise to clean two-disulfide monomers. To study the effect of H2O2 on Trx activity, 100 μm human Trx1 was also incubated with 10, 50, or 100 molar excess of H2O2 for 15 min at 37 °C and then desalted on a NAP-5 column, and the activity was measured. A progressive inhibition of Trx1 activity was recorded by increasing the concentration of H2O2 (Fig. 4), which was reversible, and Trx1 regained its activity after a lag phase. The duration of lag phase was again a function of the H2O2 concentration. S-Nitrosylation of Human Thioredoxin 1 by GSNO—Reduced Trx1 was treated with 10 molar equivalents of GSNO for 60 min at 37 °C. After chromatography on a NAP-5 column to remove excess GSNO, the number of thiols and nitrosothiols were measured in both reduced and GSNO-treated samples (Table 1). The spectrum of GSNO-treated Trx1 showed an extra peak of absorbance at 335 nm, indicating the S-nitrosylation of the protein (Fig. 5). The number of nitrosothiols was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 920 m–1 cm–1 at 335 nm (Table 1). There was close to two nitrosothiols in nitrosylated hTrx1. To find the localization of these nitrosothiols, different mutants of hTrx1 as well as the wt protein were utilized (Table 1). Furthermore, E. coli Trx was treated by GSNO to investigate whether cysteines in the active site can be nitrosylated. As shown in Table 1, nitrosylated human C32S/C35S and C62S mutants as well as wt Trx displayed close to two nitrosothiols, whereas there was only one nitrosothiol in the structure of nitrosylated C62S/C73S Trx, and E. coli Trx was not nitrosylated but oxidized. Therefore, cysteines 69 and 73 became modified by GSNO, and cysteines 32 and 35 in the active site were oxidized to a disulfide.TABLE 1The characteristics of reduced and GSNO-treated Trx1Human thioredoxinNumber of free SH groups in fully reduced formNumber of free SH groups in GSNO-treated formNumber of NO groups in GSNO-treated formWild type5.18 ± 0.161.07 ± 0.202.08 ± 0.19C62S/C73S2.89 ± 0.290.23 ± 0.120.78 ± 0.04C32S/C35S3.25 ± 0.301.37 ± 0.341.97 ± 0.19C62S3.40 ± 0.560.02 ± 0.041.71 ± 0.15E. coli Trx1.97 ± 0.150.03 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.17 Open table in a new tab The Effect of Nitrosylation of Trx1 on Its Catalytic Activity—The effect of nitrosylation on the activity of Trx as a substrate for TrxR was studied. Oxidation of NADPH by 20 μm of either oxidized or nitrosylated Trx1 in the presence of 10 nm rat TrxR was recorded (Fig. 6). As expected the Trx-S2 was rapidly reduced, oxidizing a stoichiometric amount of NADPH (Reaction 1). The rate of NADPH oxidation with nitrosylated hTrx1 was very slow; but interestingly, the rate was increased after a lag phase reaching finally up to 60 μm NADPH oxidized. The interpretation of this is that active Trx-(SH)2 molecules can reduce the nitrosothiol groups of Trx1. Therefore, nitrosothiols may be regarded as reduced by an autocatalytic reaction in which fully active Trx-(SH)2 was the catalyst. The NADPH oxidation result showing two nitrosothiols in nitrosylated Trx1 corroborated our spectral data regarding the number of nitrosothiols (Table 1). In addition, reduction of insulin disulfide bonds (Reactions 1 and 2) was used to investigate the effect of nitrosylation. Fig. 7 shows that the fully nitrosylated Trx was almost inactive, although it started to regain activity after a lag phase. When the experiments were done using nitrosylated double mutant of human Trx (C62S/C73S) with a single nitrosothiol on Cys 69 (Table 1), the initial protein-disulfide reductase activity of hTrx1 was not increased (data not shown), in contrast to what has been reported (28Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Preincubation of reduced hTrx1 with varying concentrations of GSNO for 30 min at 37 °C was also used to study the effect of nitrosylation on the reductase activity. Fig. 8 shows a progressive inhibition of Trx activity with higher concentrations of GSNO and under no conditions an increase in activity. Also in assays of thioredoxin activity using DTT and insulin precipitation (43Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there was a lag phase consistent with the initial inhibition of activity. Protection of Active Site Cysteines from S-Nitrosylation by the Pro34 Residue—Protein-disulfide isomerase, a Trx fold protein, which has two active sites (-Trp-Cys-Gly-His-Cys-) with homology to the active site of Trx, is known to be nitrosylated on both thioredoxin domains (44Uehara T. Nakamura T. Yao D. Shi Z.-Q. Gu Z. Ma Y. Masliah E. Nomura Y. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The nitrosylation of the active site Cys residues in protein-disulfide isomerase inhibits catalytic activity (44Uehara T. Nakamura T. Yao D. Shi Z.-Q. Gu Z. Ma Y. Masliah E. Nomura Y. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the Pro34 of Trx has a protective effect against the S-nitrosylation of the Cys residues in the active site. To test this hypothesis, we used E. coli Trx1 P34H, a mutant with increased isomerase activity (39Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P34H Trx1 wa"
https://openalex.org/W2096986888,"Agonist-stimulated beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) ubiquitination is a major factor that governs both lysosomal trafficking and degradation of internalized receptors, but the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating this process was unknown. Among the various catalytically inactive E3 ubiquitin ligase mutants that we tested, a dominant negative Nedd4 specifically inhibited isoproterenol-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the beta(2)AR in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, siRNA that down-regulates Nedd4 expression inhibited beta(2)AR ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, whereas siRNA targeting the closely related E3 ligases Nedd4-2 or AIP4 did not. Interestingly, beta(2)AR as well as beta-arrestin2, the endocytic and signaling adaptor for the beta(2)AR, interact robustly with Nedd4 upon agonist stimulation. However, beta(2)AR-Nedd4 interaction is ablated when beta-arrestin2 expression is knocked down by siRNA transfection, implicating an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor role for beta-arrestin2 in mediating beta(2)AR ubiquitination. Notably, beta-arrestin2 interacts with two different E3 ubiquitin ligases, namely, Mdm2 and Nedd4 to regulate distinct steps in beta(2)AR trafficking. Collectively, our findings indicate that the degradative fate of the beta(2)AR in the lysosomal compartments is dependent upon beta-arrestin2-mediated recruitment of Nedd4 to the activated receptor and Nedd4-catalyzed ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2071628605,"Background Recent studies have shown that in the developing embryo, arterial and venous identity is established by genetic mechanisms before circulation begins. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and its downstream Notch pathway play critical roles in arterial cell fate determination. We have recently shown that Foxc1 and Foxc2, two closely related Fox transcription factors, are essential for arterial cell specification during development by directly inducing the transcription of Delta-like 4 (Dll4), a ligand for Notch receptors. However, the basic mechanisms whereby the VEGF and Notch signaling pathways control transcriptional regulation of arterial-specific genes have yet to be elucidated. Methodologies/Principal Findings In the current study, we examined whether and how Foxc transcription factors are involved in VEGF and Notch signaling in induction of Dll4 as well as the Notch target gene Hey2 in endothelial cells. We found that Foxc1 and Foxc2 directly activate the Hey2 promoter via Foxc binding elements. Significantly, Foxc2 physically and functionally interacts with a Notch transcriptional activation complex containing Su(H) and Notch intracellular domain to induce Hey2 promoter activity. Moreover, activation of the Dll4 and Hey2 promoters is induced by VEGF in conjunction with either Foxc1 or Foxc2 more than by either component alone. VEGF-activated PI3K and ERK intracellular pathways modulate the transcriptional activity of Foxc proteins in Dll4 and Hey2 induction. Conclusions/Significance Our new findings demonstrate that Foxc transcriptional factors interact with VEGF and Notch signaling to regulate arterial gene expression in multiple steps of the VEGF-Dll4-Notch-Hey2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2150806446,"The neurons of the mammalian brain are generated by progenitors dividing either at the apical surface of the ventricular zone (neuroepithelial and radial glial cells, collectively referred to as apical progenitors) or at its basal side (basal progenitors, also called intermediate progenitors). For apical progenitors, the orientation of the cleavage plane relative to their apical-basal axis is thought to be of critical importance for the fate of the daughter cells. For basal progenitors, the relationship between cell polarity, cleavage plane orientation and the fate of daughter cells is unknown. Here, we have investigated these issues at the very onset of cortical neurogenesis. To directly observe the generation of neurons from apical and basal progenitors, we established a novel transgenic mouse line in which membrane GFP is expressed from the beta-III-tubulin promoter, an early pan-neuronal marker, and crossed this line with a previously described knock-in line in which nuclear GFP is expressed from the Tis21 promoter, a pan-neurogenic progenitor marker. Mitotic Tis21-positive basal progenitors nearly always divided symmetrically, generating two neurons, but, in contrast to symmetrically dividing apical progenitors, lacked apical-basal polarity and showed a nearly randomized cleavage plane orientation. Moreover, the appearance of beta-III-tubulin-driven GFP fluorescence in basal progenitor-derived neurons, in contrast to that in apical progenitor-derived neurons, was so rapid that it suggested the initiation of the neuronal phenotype already in the progenitor. Our observations imply that (i) the loss of apical-basal polarity restricts neuronal progenitors to the symmetric mode of cell division, and that (ii) basal progenitors initiate the expression of neuronal phenotype already before mitosis, in contrast to apical progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W1981891646,"Eukaryotic microorganisms have been undersampled in biodiversity studies in freshwater environments. We present an original 18S rDNA survey of freshwater picoeukaryotes sampled during spring/summer 2005, complementing an earlier study conducted in autumn 2004 in Lake Pavin (France). These studies were designed to detect the small unidentified heterotrophic flagellates (HF, 0.6–5 µm) which are considered the main bacterivores in aquatic systems. Alveolates, Fungi and Stramenopiles represented 65% of the total diversity and differed from the dominant groups known from microscopic studies. Fungi and Telonemia taxa were restricted to the oxic zone which displayed two fold more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than the oxycline. Temporal forcing also appeared as a driving force in the diversification within targeted organisms. Several sequences were not similar to those in databases and were considered as new or unsampled taxa, some of which may be typical of freshwater environments. Two taxa known from marine systems, the genera Telonema and Amoebophrya, were retrieved for the first time in our freshwater study. The analysis of potential trophic strategies displayed among the targeted HF highlighted the dominance of parasites and saprotrophs, and provided indications that these organisms have probably been wrongfully regarded as bacterivores in previous studies. A theoretical exercise based on a new ‘parasite/saprotroph-dominated HF hypothesis’ demonstrates that the inclusion of parasites and saprotrophs may increase the functional role of the microbial loop as a link for carbon flows in pelagic ecosystems. New interesting perspectives in aquatic microbial ecology are thus opened."
https://openalex.org/W2032756863,"Human genes coding for pLG72 and d-amino acid oxidase have recently been linked to the onset of schizophrenia. pLG72 was proposed as an activator of the human FAD-containing flavoprotein d-amino acid oxidase (hDAAO). In the brain this oxidizes d-serine, a potent activator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. We have investigated the mechanistic regulation of hDAAO by pLG72. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that hDAAO and pLG72 are both expressed in astrocytes of the human cortex, where they most likely interact, considering their partial overlapping subcellular distribution and their coimmunoprecipitation. We demonstrated that the specific in vitro interaction of the two proteins yields a complex composed of 2 hDAAO homodimers and 2 pLG72 molecules. Binding of pLG72 did not affect the kinetic properties and FAD binding ability of hDAAO; instead, a time-dependent loss of hDAAO activity in the presence of an excess of pLG72 was found. The binding affects the tertiary structure of hDAAO, altering the amount of the active form. We finally demonstrated that overexpression of hDAAO in glioblastoma cells decreases the levels of d-serine, an effect that is null when pLG72 is coexpressed. These data indicate that pLG72 acts as a negative effector of hDAAO. Therefore, a decrease in the synaptic concentration of d-serine as the result of an anomalous increase in hDAAO activity related to hypoexpression of pLG72 may represent a molecular mechanism by which hDAAO and pLG72 are involved in schizophrenia susceptibility.

Schizophrenia is one of the most widely spread psychiatric disorders; it is a complex disease or, more likely, a group of related illnesses to which an individual has a strong genetic predisposition (1Sawa A. Snyder S.H. Science. 2002; 296: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Among the identified schizophrenia susceptibility genes (2Owen M.J. Williams N.M. O'Donoval M.C. Mol. Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the gene G72 encodes for several splicing isoforms; pLG72 represents the longest open reading frame (153 amino acids), which is mainly expressed in brain (3Chumakov M.

The association between alterations in d-serine metabolism and schizophrenia is further supported by studies demonstrating decreased d-serine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of schizophrenia patients. It is noteworthy that clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit of adding d-serine to the antipsychotic regimen for treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (17Tsai G. Yang P. Chung L.C.

To provide biochemical evidence supporting the involvement of the identified genes in this pathologic process, we recently reported on the overexpression of pLG72 and human DAAO (hDAAO) in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized hDAAO (18Molla G.

Kinetic and Spectral Analysis—The apparent kinetic parameters of hDAAO on d-serine (in the absence or in the presence of pLG72) were determined by measuring the oxygen consumption by means of a Hansatech oxygen electrode in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) with or without 0.06% NLS and 40 μm FAD at 25 °C and air saturation. One DAAO unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of d-amino acid per min at 25 °C (20Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The amount of catalytically active hDAAO after the binding of pLG72 was evaluated on the basis of the amount of FAD cofactor that can be reduced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions. This value was determined from the change in absorbance at 455 nm after the anaerobic addition of 1 mm d-serine to hDAAO solutions (15 μm) containing different amounts of pLG72 and free FAD. A similar assay was used to assess the effect of different amounts of pLG72·FAD complex on the rate of flavin binding to the apoprotein form of hDAAO (8 nmol); the binding was followed by means of the substrate-induced reduction of the flavin at 455 nm under anaerobic conditions. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded with a J-815 Jasco spectropolarimeter at 15 °C and were further analyzed with the Jasco software; samples contained 0.4 mg/ml (10 μm) of protein in buffer A plus 0.06% NLS. The binding constants for FAD and chlorpromazine (CPZ) were determined by titrating the apoprotein form of hDAAO (1 μm) or pLG72 (4 μm) with increasing amounts of ligands and by monitoring the reconstitution by following the quenching of protein fluorescence at 342 nm. 8-Anilino-naphthalene-1-sulfonate binding experiments were carried out at 15 °C and at 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration by measuring emission spectra in the 450-600-nm range with excitation at 370 nm. Binding of this probe to solvent-accessible clusters of nonpolar side chains in proteins results in a marked increase in its fluorescence, and the emission fluorescence maximum shows a blue shift. Determination of the hDAAO·pLG72 Complex Oligomeric State—The oligomeric state of free and complexed hDAAO was determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) using buffer A to which 40 μm FAD and 0.06% NLS was added as the elution buffer. The detergent was required because the solubility and the oligomeric state of pLG72 strongly depends on the presence of NLS; the recovery of refolded pLG72 protein in the absence of detergent in the elution buffer was low (<20%), and the protein largely eluted with the void volume, whereas at a NLS concentration ≥0.06% pLG72 is quantitatively recovered in a single peak with an elution volume of ∼15 ml. Concerning hDAAO, we previously demonstrated that the holoenzyme and apoprotein (apohDAAO) forms are present as a 80-kDa homodimer (19Molla G. Sacchi S. Bernasconi M. Pilone M.S. Fukui K. Pollegioni L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2358-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The addition of up to 0.06% NLS to hDAAO does not affect its elution volume, and more than 70% of the initial enzymatic activity is recovered after chromatographic separation; this amount of NLS was, thus, used in all the experiments. The area of each peak was estimated by nonlinear curve-fitting of the elution profile using PeakFit software (Systat Software) (Fig. 1B); the error was <10% as estimated using known amounts of DAAO as standard protein (5-100 nmol/run). The amount of pLG72 and hDAAO present in the peak corresponding to the complex was estimated by means of the intensity of their bands after SDS-PAGE, as obtained using the program Quantity One (Bio-Rad) and a known amount of purified hDAAO and pLG72 as standard (in the 0.2-20 μg/lane range). Western Blot Experiments—For Far Western blot experiments, 2-10 μg of pLG72 separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with a 2-20-fold molar excess of hDAAO in binding buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% BSA) for 60 min at room temperature, with gentle stirring. Alternatively, purified pLG72 was adsorbed on a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with binding buffer, and then overlaid with DAAO from different sources (dot Far Western blot). In both cases and after the unbound protein was removed, the membrane was incubated with anti-DAAO antibodies and followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, as detailed in Molla et al. (20Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For quantitative pulldown experiments, 8 μg of commercial affinity-purified polyclonal goat antibodies raised against a peptide mapping at the N terminus end of pLG72 ((G72(N-15); Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were covalently cross-linked to 50 μl of Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) and used to immunoprecipitate protein samples containing 0.1 nmol of recombinant pLG72 (1.8 μg) and increasing amounts of recombinant hDAAO (from 0 to 0.8 nmol, corresponding to 32 μg). Proteins were diluted in cell homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.06% NLS, 10 μm FAD) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature before precipitation. The amount of hDAAO precipitated by Dynabeads-bound pLG72 was revealed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-hDAAO antibodies (affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against the recombinant hDAAO; Davids Biotechnologie) and quantified by densitometric analysis. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—For the surface plasmon resonance analysis, a BIAcore X system was used as described in Ruzzene et al. (21Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Sarno S. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). hDAAO was covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (carboxymethylated dextran surface) by amine-coupling chemistry to a final density of 700 resonance units; a flow cell with no immobilized protein was used as a control. The pLG72 solutions were injected under the conditions specified in the figure legend by using HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20 (GE Healthcare)) or 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.06% NLS, and 40 μm FAD; each sensorgram (time course of the surface plasmon resonance signal) was corrected for the response obtained in the control flow cell and normalized to base line. Experiments were also carried out using immobilized pLG72 and circulating hDAAO. After each injection the surface was regenerated by injecting 100 mm NaOH for 1 min; this treatment restored the base line to the initial resonance unit value. The kinetic data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 surface plasmon resonance kinetic software (BIAcore). Human Tissues and Cell Cultures—Frozen human cortex tissues and primary astrocyte cultures derived from human fetal thalamus were a kind gift of Vincent Prevot (INSERM, Lille, France). Frozen human cortex was kept at -80 °C until use. Primary astrocyte cultures and U87 human glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were grown to near confluence in flasks at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 6 g/liter glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin, and Fungizone. Immunoblot and Coimmunoprecipitation Analyses—Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold cell homogenization buffer (see above), sonicated (twice for 10 s with 30 s incubation in ice), clarified by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and stored at -80 °C. Protein extracts were subjected to 8-15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE analysis (200 μg protein/lane) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were incubated for 2 h in blocking solution containing 4% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) and 0.1% Tween (TTBS) and then incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with anti-DAAO (diluted 1/3000; Davids Biotechnologie) or anti-pLG72 antibodies (G72(N15), diluted 1/1500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were washed extensively in TTBS containing 2% dried milk and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-goat immunoglobulins (1/15000; Jackson ImmunoResearch); immunoreactivity was then determined by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Protein content was measured by the Lowry method using the Bradford reagent (Sigma). Controls included incubation with antibodies preabsorbed with hDAAO or pLG72. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig immunoprecipitation beads (a suspension of activated agarose beads coupled with goat anti-rabbit IgG; eBioscience) were used; 500 μl of human cortex crude extract (20 mg protein/ml) were subjected to preclearing by the addition of 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads. Then 5 μg of primary antibodies (affinity-purified rabbit anti-hDAAO or anti-pLG72 antibodies raised against the C-terminal end of the protein; Davids Biotechnologie) were added to the precleared crude extract and incubated overnight at 4 °C; the antigen-antibody complex was then precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. The beads were washed 3 times with 500 μl of homogenization buffer and subsequently resuspended in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 6% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were heat-denatured and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 3 min; then 40 μl of the supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was developed as detailed in the TrueBlot protocol using goat anti-pLG72 G72(N15) antibodies and, after stripping, using anti-hDAAO antibodies (dilution as above). The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% dried milk in TrueBlot buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% dried milk in TrueBlot buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit IgG TrueBlot (1:1000 dilution in 5% dried milk in TrueBlot buffer); finally, a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-goat or anti-rabbit IgG immunoblotting reagent that preferentially detects the nonreduced rabbit IgG form (thereby minimizing interference by the heavy and the light chain of the immunoprecipitating antibodies) was used to visualize the complex. Immunoreactivity was determined by enhanced chemiluminescence. Controls included incubation without primary antibodies as well as without crude extracts. Immunostaining on Slices from Human Cortex—Sections from human cortex were cut serially to a 50-μm thickness using a cryostat and then mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides. The brain sections were then used for immunofluorescence analysis as previously described (22Puyal J. Martineau M. Mothet J.P. Nicolas M.T. Raymond J. J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 497: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, after extensive washing and quenching of autofluorescence, nonspecific binding sites were blocked, and tissues were permeabilized by incubation with 4% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For immunofluorescence staining, slides were incubated for 24-48 h at 4 °C with the following antibodies diluted in PBS plus 4% NGS and 0.1% Triton X-100: rabbit polyclonal anti-DAAO (diluted 1/200; Davids Biotechnologie), rabbit polyclonal anti-pLG72 (diluted 1/50; Davids Biotechnologie), rabbit polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; diluted 1/500; Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-glutamine synthase (GS; diluted 1/200; Chemicon) or anti-S100β (diluted 1/1000; Sigma) antibodies. After washing in PBS plus 1% NGS, the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 546-conjugated antibodies and/or donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. When paired rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used in double immunofluorescent staining, the Zenon Rabbit IgG Labeling kit (Molecular Probes) was employed according to the company's protocol using the Alexa 594- and 488-labeled Fab fragments complexed with the primary antibody. Finally, the sections were washed 3 times in PBS supplemented with 1% NGS and three times with PBS alone before being mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Immunostaining on Secondary Human Astrocyte Cultures—Primary human astrocytes grown in flasks were detached with trypsin and were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass cover-slips at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells/ml. After 1 week, secondary astrocyte cultures were ready for staining. Cells were extensively washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence on cells was performed as previously described for brain sections and according to Mothet et al. (23Mothet J.P. Pollegioni L. Ouanounou G. Martineau M. Fossier P. Baux G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) with the only exception that horse serum was used instead of NGS. Immunostaining was performed by incubating the coverslips with paired antibodies for 24 h at 4 °C; both the rabbit anti-DAAO (diluted 1/50) and the goat anti-pLG72 (diluted 1/20) antibodies were simultaneously analyzed with commercial antibodies against specific markers of subcellular compartments, such as PMP70 for peroxisomes (rabbit polyclonal antibody, diluted 1/400; Sigma), 58K Golgi protein and GM130 for Golgi apparatus, and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 for lysosomes (mouse monoclonal antibodies, diluted 1/500, 1/200, and 1/100, respectively; Abcam). Immunoreactivity was demonstrated with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647-, chicken anti-goat Alexa 488-, donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488-, and donkey anti-goat Alexa 647-conjugated antibodies (diluted 1/1000; Molecular Probes). The specific stain of mitochondria was obtained by using MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes), a green fluorescent dye that localizes to this compartment regardless of the mitochondrial membrane potential; after incubation with the secondary antibody, the coverslips were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 30 nm MitoTracker Green FM and extensively washed with PBS. The double immunostaining experiments were performed using the rabbit anti-PMP70 and anti-hDAAO antibodies (1 μg) labeled with Alexa 594- and 488-tagged Fab fragments, respectively (Zenon Rabbit IgG Labeling kit; Invitrogen). After extensive washes the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence from brain sections and astrocyte cultures was visualized using an upright or inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with a 63.0×/1.25 NA plan apochromate oil immersion objective. The confocal images were acquired using the Leica TCS software with a sequential mode (if necessary) to avoid interference between each channel and without saturating any pixel. Controls included omission of primary antibodies and incubation in immune serum preadsorbed on the antigen. These control sections did not display any staining. Quantitative colocalization was determined using the colocalization plug-in of ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Measured colocalization was corrected for random colocalization by superimposing a mirror image of the second channel onto the image of the first channel (24Lang C. Ohser J. Hilfer R.J. J. Microsc. 2001; 203: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection Experiments—The cDNA fragments coding for hDAAO and pLG72 were inserted into the pEGFP-C3 (Clontech Laboratories) vector between the HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites in-frame with the gene coding for EGFP. The HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites were inserted at the ends of hDAAO and pLG72 cDNA by mutagenic PCR using the pET11-hDAAO (19Molla G. Sacchi S. Bernasconi M. Pilone M.S. Fukui K. Pollegioni L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2358-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and pET11-G72 (18Molla G. Bernasconi M. Sacchi S. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 46: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), respectively, as templates. The U87 human glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were transfected by using the ExGen 500 Transfection reagent (Fermentas"
https://openalex.org/W2050739474,"Genetic disruption of Nrf2 greatly enhances susceptibility to prooxidant- and carcinogen-induced experimental models of various human disorders; but the mechanisms by which this transcription factor confers protection are unclear. Using Nrf2-proficient (Nrf2(+/+)) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2(-/-)) primary epithelial cultures as a model, we now show that Nrf2 deficiency leads to oxidative stress and DNA lesions, accompanied by impairment of cell-cycle progression, mainly G(2)/M-phase arrest. Both N-acetylcysteine and glutathione (GSH) supplementation ablated the DNA lesions and DNA damage-response pathways in Nrf2(-/-) cells; however only GSH could rescue the impaired colocalization of mitosis-promoting factors and the growth arrest. Akt activation was deregulated in Nrf2(-/-) cells, but GSH supplementation restored it. Inhibition of Akt signaling greatly diminished the GSH-induced Nrf2(-/-) cell proliferation and wild-type cell proliferation. GSH depletion impaired Akt signaling and mitosis-promoting factor colocalization in Nrf2(+/+) cells. Collectively, our findings uncover novel functions for Nrf2 in regulating oxidative stress-induced cell-cycle arrest, especially G(2)/M-checkpoint arrest, and proliferation, and GSH-regulated redox signaling and Akt are required for this process."
https://openalex.org/W2098029171,"Prediction of transmembrane helices (TMH) in alpha helical membrane proteins provides valuable information about the protein topology when the high resolution structures are not available. Many predictors have been developed based on either amino acid hydrophobicity scale or pure statistical approaches. While these predictors perform reasonably well in identifying the number of TMHs in a protein, they are generally inaccurate in predicting the ends of TMHs, or TMHs of unusual length. To improve the accuracy of TMH detection, we developed a machine-learning based predictor, MemBrain, which integrates a number of modern bioinformatics approaches including sequence representation by multiple sequence alignment matrix, the optimized evidence-theoretic K-nearest neighbor prediction algorithm, fusion of multiple prediction window sizes, and classification by dynamic threshold. MemBrain demonstrates an overall improvement of about 20% in prediction accuracy, particularly, in predicting the ends of TMHs and TMHs that are shorter than 15 residues. It also has the capability to detect N-terminal signal peptides. The MemBrain predictor is a useful sequence-based analysis tool for functional and structural characterization of helical membrane proteins; it is freely available at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/MemBrain/."
https://openalex.org/W2134067815,"We discovered previously that the small Escherichia coli proteins Hha (hemolysin expression modulating protein) and the adjacent, poorly-characterized YbaJ are important for biofilm formation; however, their roles have been nebulous. Biofilms are intricate communities in which cell signaling often converts single cells into primitive tissues. Here we show that Hha decreases biofilm formation dramatically by repressing the transcription of rare codon tRNAs which serves to inhibit fimbriae production and by repressing to some extent transcription of fimbrial genes fimA and ihfA. In vivo binding studies show Hha binds to the rare codon tRNAs argU, ileX, ileY, and proL and to two prophage clusters D1P12 and CP4-57. Real-time PCR corroborated that Hha represses argU and proL, and Hha type I fimbriae repression is abolished by the addition of extra copies of argU, ileY, and proL. The repression of transcription of rare codon tRNAs by Hha also leads to cell lysis and biofilm dispersal due to activation of prophage lytic genes rzpD, yfjZ, appY, and alpA and due to induction of ClpP/ClpX proteases which activate toxins by degrading antitoxins. YbaJ serves to mediate the toxicity of Hha. Hence, we have identified that a single protein (Hha) can control biofilm formation by limiting fimbriae production as well as by controlling cell death. The mechanism used by Hha is the control of translation via the availability of rare codon tRNAs which reduces fimbriae production and activates prophage lytic genes. Therefore, Hha acts as a toxin in conjunction with co-transcribed YbaJ (TomB) that attenuates Hha toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2120141651,"Background Plants respond to many unfavorable environmental conditions via signaling mediated by altered levels of various reactive oxygen species (ROS). To gain additional insight into oxidative signaling responses, Arabidopsis mutants that exhibited tolerance to oxidative stress were isolated. We describe herein the isolation and characterization of one such mutant, oxt6. Methodology/Principal Findings The oxt6 mutation is due to the disruption of a complex gene (At1g30460) that encodes the Arabidopsis ortholog of the 30-kD subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) as well as a larger, related 65-kD protein. Expression of mRNAs encoding Arabidopsis CPSF30 alone was able to restore wild-type growth and stress susceptibility to the oxt6 mutant. Transcriptional profiling and single gene expression studies show elevated constitutive expression of a subset of genes that encode proteins containing thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin- related domains in the oxt6 mutant, suggesting that stress can be ameliorated by these gene classes. Bulk poly(A) tail length was not seemingly affected in the oxt6 mutant, but poly(A) site selection was different, indicating a subtle effect on polyadenylation in the mutant. Conclusions/Significance These results implicate the Arabidopsis CPSF30 protein in the posttranscriptional control of the responses of plants to stress, and in particular to the expression of a set of genes that suffices to confer tolerance to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2020753655,"Aurora B kinase is a key component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which regulates chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. An ortholog of Aurora B was characterized in Trypanosoma brucei (TbAUK1), but other conserved components of the complex have not been found. Here we identified four novel TbAUK1 associated proteins by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Among these four proteins, TbKIN-A and TbKIN-B are novel kinesin homologs, whereas TbCPC1 and TbCPC2 are hypothetical proteins without any sequence similarity to those known CPC components from yeasts and metazoans. RNAi-mediated silencing of each of the four genes led to loss of spindle assembly, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. TbKIN-A localizes to the mitotic spindle and TbKIN-B to the spindle midzone during mitosis, whereas TbCPC1, TbCPC2 and TbAUK1 display the dynamic localization pattern of a CPC. After mitosis, the CPC disappears from the central spindle and re-localizes at a dorsal mid-point of the mother cell, where the anterior tip of the daughter cell is tethered, to start cell division toward the posterior end, indicating a most unusual CPC-initiated cytokinesis in a eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1981317342,"Dysregulation of protein synthesis has been implicated in oncogenesis through a mechanism whereby ""weak"" mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell proliferation are strongly translated when the protein synthesis apparatus is activated. Previous work has determined that many cancer cells contain high levels of eIF3h, a protein subunit of translation initiation factor eIF3, and overexpression of eIF3h malignantly transforms immortal NIH-3T3 cells. This is a general feature of eIF3h, as high levels also affect translation, proliferation, and a number of malignant phenotypes of CHO-K1 and HeLa cells and, most significantly, of a primary prostate cell line. Furthermore, overexpressed eIF3h inhibits Myc-dependent induction of apoptosis of primary prostate cells. eIF3h appears to function through translation, as the initial appearance of overexpressed eIF3h in rapidly induced NIH-3T3 cells correlates tightly with the stimulation of protein synthesis and the generation of malignant phenotypes. This oncogenic potential of eIF3h is enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser(183). Finally, reduction of eIF3h levels in breast and prostate cancer cell lines by short interfering RNA methods reduces their rates of proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. The results provide compelling evidence that high eIF3h levels directly stimulate protein synthesis, resulting in the establishment and maintenance of the malignant state in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973190617,"To investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of mammary carcinogenesis and discover novel therapeutic targets, we previously analysed gene expression profiles of breast cancers. We here report characterization of a significant role of DTL/RAMP (denticleless/RA-regulated nuclear matrix associated protein) in mammary carcinogenesis. Semiquantitative RT–PCR and northern blot analyses confirmed upregulation of DTL/RAMP in the majority of breast cancer cases and all of breast cancer cell lines examined. Immunocytochemical and western blot analyses using anti-DTL/RAMP polyclonal antibody revealed cell-cycle-dependent localization of endogenous DTL/RAMP protein in breast cancer cells; nuclear localization was observed in cells at interphase and the protein was concentrated at the contractile ring in cytokinesis process. The expression level of DTL/RAMP protein became highest at G1/S phases, whereas its phosphorylation level was enhanced during mitotic phase. Treatment of breast cancer cells, T47D and HBC4, with small-interfering RNAs against DTL/RAMP effectively suppressed its expression and caused accumulation of G2/M cells, resulting in growth inhibition of cancer cells. We further demonstrate the in vitro phosphorylation of DTL/RAMP through an interaction with the mitotic kinase, Aurora kinase-B (AURKB). Interestingly, depletion of AURKB expression with siRNA in breast cancer cells reduced the phosphorylation of DTL/RAMP and decreased the stability of DTL/RAMP protein. These findings imply important roles of DTL/RAMP in growth of breast cancer cells and suggest that DTL/RAMP might be a promising molecular target for treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2164998748,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has undergone a long history of optimization to become one of the most popular proteins in all of cell biology. It is thermally and chemically robust and produces a pronounced fluorescent phenotype when expressed in cells of all types. Recently, a superfolder GFP was engineered with increased resistance to denaturation and improved folding kinetics. Here we report that unlike other well-folded variants of GFP (e.g., GFPmut2), superfolder GFP was spared from elimination when targeted for secretion via the SecYEG translocase. This prompted us to hypothesize that the folding quality control inherent to this secretory pathway could be used as a platform for engineering similar ‘superfolded’ proteins. To test this, we targeted a combinatorial library of GFPmut2 variants to the SecYEG translocase and isolated several superfolded variants that accumulated in the cytoplasm due to their enhanced folding properties. Each of these GFP variants exhibited much faster folding kinetics than the parental GFPmut2 protein and one of these, designated superfast GFP, folded at a rate that even exceeded superfolder GFP. Remarkably, these GFP variants exhibited little to no loss in specific fluorescence activity relative to GFPmut2, suggesting that the process of superfolding can be accomplished without altering the proteins' normal function. Overall, we demonstrate that laboratory evolution combined with secretory pathway quality control enables sampling of largely unexplored amino-acid sequences for the discovery of artificial, high-performance proteins with properties that are unparalleled in their naturally occurring analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1978802569,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is frequently observed in human cancer and contributes to the growth, survival and therapeutic resistance of tumors. EGFRvIII is an oncogenic EGFR mutant resulting from the deletion of exons 2–7 and is the most common EGFR mutant observed in glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain tumor. EGFRvIII is constitutively active but poorly ubiquitinated, leading to inefficient receptor trafficking to lysosomes and unattenuated oncogenic signaling. The mechanism by which EGFRvIII evades downregulation is not fully understood although recent studies suggest that its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl may be compromised. In this study, we examine the regulation of EGFRvIII by the recently identified negative regulator, LRIG1, which targets EGFR through recognition of its extracellular domain. Here, we determine whether the extracellular domain deletion in EGFRvIII renders it refractory to LRIG1 regulation. We find that EGFRvIII retains interaction with LRIG1 and is in fact more sensitive to LRIG1 action than wild-type receptor. We demonstrate that LRIG1 regulation of EGFRvIII is distinct from the only other known mechanism of EGFR regulation, Cbl-mediated degradation. Ectopic expression of LRIG1 in EGFRvIII(+) glioblastoma cells opposes EGFRvIII-driven tumor cell proliferation, survival, motility and invasion. Finally, RNAi-mediated silencing of LRIG1 alters EGFRvIII intracellular trafficking and leads to enhanced EGFRvIII expression, suggesting that loss of LRIG1 in tumors may contribute to a permissive environment for EGFRvIII overexpression, contributing to EGFRvIII oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056022574,"We showed earlier that p300/CBP plays an important role in G1 progression by negatively regulating c-Myc and thereby preventing premature G1 exit. Here, we have studied the mechanism by which p300 represses c-Myc and show that in quiescent cells p300 cooperates with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to repress transcription. p300 and HDAC3 are recruited to the upstream YY1-binding site of the c-Myc promoter resulting in chromatin deacetylation and repression of c-Myc transcription. Consistent with this, ablation of p300, YY1 or HDAC3 expression results in chromatin acetylation and induction of c-Myc. These three proteins exist as a complex in vivo and form a multiprotein complex with the YY1-binding site in vitro. The C-terminal region of p300 is both necessary and sufficient for the repression of c-Myc. These and other results suggest that in quiescent cells the C-terminal region of p300 provides corepressor function and facilitates the recruitment of p300 and HDAC3 to the YY1-binding site and represses the c-Myc promoter.

We have shown that synthetic CDR-related peptides and many decapeptides spanning the variable region of a recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antiidiotypic Ab are candidacidal in vitro. An alanine-substituted decapeptide from the variable region of this Ab displayed increased cytotoxicity in vitro and/or therapeutic effects in vivo against various bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. The possibility that isolated CDRs, represented by short synthetic peptides, may display antimicrobial, antiviral and antitumor activities irrespective of Ab specificity for a given antigen is addressed here.CDR-based synthetic peptides of murine and human monoclonal Abs directed to: a) a protein epitope of Candida albicans cell wall stress mannoprotein; b) a synthetic peptide containing well-characterized B-cell and T-cell epitopes; c) a carbohydrate blood group A substance, showed differential inhibitory activities in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo against C. albicans, HIV-1 and B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells, conceivably involving different mechanisms of action. Antitumor activities involved peptide-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Engineered peptides, obtained by alanine substitution of Ig CDR sequences, and used as surrogates of natural point mutations, showed further differential increased/unaltered/decreased antimicrobial, antiviral and/or antitumor activities. The inhibitory effects observed were largely independent of the specificity of the native Ab and involved chiefly germline encoded CDR1 and CDR2 of light and heavy chains.The high frequency of bioactive peptides based on CDRs suggests that Ig molecules are sources of an unlimited number of sequences potentially active against infectious agents and tumor cells. The easy production and low cost of small sized synthetic peptides representing Ig CDRs and the possibility of peptide engineering and chemical optimization associated to new delivery mechanisms are expected to give rise to a new generation of therapeutic agents."

While many studies on tennis have focused on anticipatory skills or decision making, fewer have investigated the underlying visual perception abilities. In this study, we used a battery of seven visual tests that allowed us to assess which kind of visual information processing is performed better by tennis players than other athletes (triathletes) and non-athletes. We found that certain time-related skills, such as speed discrimination, are superior in tennis players compared to non-athletes and triathletes. Such tasks might be used to improve tennis performance in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2132816045,"Mitochondria are major cellular sources of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), the production of which is modulated by oxygen availability and the mitochondrial energy state. An increase of steady-state cell H(2)O(2) concentration is able to control the transition from proliferating to quiescent phenotypes and to signal the end of proliferation; in tumor cells thereby, low H(2)O(2) due to defective mitochondrial metabolism can contribute to sustain proliferation. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) orchestrate signal transduction and recent data indicate that are present in mitochondria and regulated by the redox state. On these bases, we investigated the mechanistic connection of tumor mitochondrial dysfunction, H(2)O(2) yield, and activation of MAPKs in LP07 murine tumor cells with confocal microscopy, in vivo imaging and directed mutagenesis. Two redox conditions were examined: low 1 microM H(2)O(2) increased cell proliferation in ERK1/2-dependent manner whereas high 50 microM H(2)O(2) arrested cell cycle by p38 and JNK1/2 activation. Regarding the experimental conditions as a three-compartment model (mitochondria, cytosol, and nuclei), the different responses depended on MAPKs preferential traffic to mitochondria, where a selective activation of either ERK1/2 or p38-JNK1/2 by co-localized upstream kinases (MAPKKs) facilitated their further passage to nuclei. As assessed by mass spectra, MAPKs activation and efficient binding to cognate MAPKKs resulted from oxidation of conserved ERK1/2 or p38-JNK1/2 cysteine domains to sulfinic and sulfonic acids at a definite H(2)O(2) level. Like this, high H(2)O(2) or directed mutation of redox-sensitive ERK2 Cys(214) impeded binding to MEK1/2, caused ERK2 retention in mitochondria and restricted shuttle to nuclei. It is surmised that selective cysteine oxidations adjust the electrostatic forces that participate in a particular MAPK-MAPKK interaction. Considering that tumor mitochondria are dysfunctional, their inability to increase H(2)O(2) yield should disrupt synchronized MAPK oxidations and the regulation of cell cycle leading cells to remain in a proliferating phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1977287641,"Id1 is frequently overexpressed in many cancer cells, but the functional significance of these findings is not known. To determine if Id1 could contribute to the development of hematopoietic malignancy, we reconstituted mice with hematopoietic cells overexpressing Id1. We showed for the first time that deregulated expression of Id1 leads to a myeloproliferative disease in mice, and immortalizes myeloid progenitors in vitro. In human cells, we demonstrate that Id genes are expressed in human acute myelogenous leukemia cells, and that knock down of Id1 expression inhibits leukemic cell line growth, suggesting that Id1 is required for leukemic cell proliferation. These findings established a causal relationship between Id1 overexpression and hematologic malignancy. Thus, deregulated expression of Id1 may contribute to the initiation of myeloid malignancy, and Id1 may represent a potential therapeutic target for early stage intervention in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2078850445,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1, p55) and 2 (TNFR2, p75) are characterized by several cysteine-rich modules in the extracellular domain, raising the possibility that redox-induced modifications of these cysteine residues might alter TNFR function. To test this possibility, we examined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in 293T cells transfected with CFP- and YFP-tagged TNFRs exposed to the thiol oxidant diamide. Treatment with high concentrations of diamide (1 mm) resulted in an increase in the FRET signal that was sensitive to inhibition with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting that oxidative stress resulted in TNFR self-association. Treatment of cells with low concentrations of diamide (1 μm) that was not sufficient to provoke TNFR self-association resulted in increased TNF-induced FRET signals relative to the untreated cells, suggesting that oxidative stress enhanced ligand-dependent TNFR signaling. Similar findings were obtained when the TNFR1- and TNFR2-transfected cells were pretreated with a cell-impermeable oxidase, DsbA, that catalyzes disulfide bond formation between thiol groups on cysteine residues. The changes in TNFR self-association were functionally significant, because pretreating the HeLa cells and 293T cells resulted in increased TNF-induced NF-κB activation and TNF-induced expression of IκB and syndecan-4 mRNA levels. Although pretreatment with DsbA did not result in an increase in TNF binding to TNFRs, it resulted in increased TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, consistent with an allosteric modification of the TNFRs. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative stress promotes TNFR receptor self-interaction and ligand-independent and enhanced ligand-dependent TNF signaling.

TNF exerts its biological activities by binding to the extracellular domains of two distinct cell surface receptors termed tumor necrosis factor 1 (TNFR1 or p55) and tumor necrosis factor 2 (TNFR2 or p75, Ref. 1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). Both TNFRs are type 1 membrane proteins that belong to the nerve growth factor receptor family, which includes CD27, CD40, FAS, and RANK. There are four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) within the extracellular domains of TNFR1 and TNFR2, each of which contains six cysteine residues (2Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The first three CRDs are characteristic of the TNFR superfamily, whereas the 4th CRD, which is membrane proximal, is less well conserved (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). The first CRD of the TNFRs is essential for the formation of homotypic, ligand-independent receptor complexes through the pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD) (3Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding pocket for TNF is formed mainly by CRD2 and CRD3 of the TNFRs (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). The current model of TNF signaling suggests that TNF binding leads to signal transduction by allowing the cytoplasmic tails of the intracellular domains to assemble together in the correct steric orientation to initiate cell signaling (1Locksley R.M.

Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) produce deleterious effects on cell activity because of their ability to damage cell structures, such as membrane lipids and proteins, it is also well recognized that ROS-induced post-translational modification of proteins may also play an important role in cell signaling (6Dominici S.

Germane to the present discussion, cysteine residues in receptor proteins have been shown to be the target of such redox modulation, resulting in changes of their ligand binding affinity and activation status (9Schmid E. El Benna J. Galter D. Klein G. Droge W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Peus D. Vasa R.A. Beyerle A. Meves A. Krautmacher C. Pittelkow M.R. J. Investig.

Med. 2000; 28: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The observation that TNFR1 and TNFR2 have numerous cysteine residues in the extracellular domain, together with the prior observation that prooxidant conditions are sufficient to modify the number of reduced thiol groups of the extracellular cysteines of TNFR1 (12Dominici S. Pieri L. Paolicchi A. De T.V. Zunino F. Pompella A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), raised the intriguing possibility that oxidative stress might influence TNFR signaling. Accordingly, in the present study we sought to determine whether prooxidant conditions were sufficient to modulate oligomerization between TNF receptors, as well as influence TNF signaling. Here, we report that oxidative stress is sufficient to promote self-interaction of the TNF receptors, as well as enhance TNF signaling. To determine whether oxidative stress promoted self-interaction between type 1 TNF receptors (p55, TNFR1) and/or type 2 TNF receptors (p75, TNFR2) in living cells, we used flow cytometry to analyzed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between TNFR subunits that had been fused at their C termini to a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The TNFR chimeric fusion proteins used herein were a generous gift from Dr. Francis K. Chan. The 293T cells used for these studies were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection with chimeric TNFR1 and chimeric TNFR2 CFP and YFP fusion proteins was performed with polyethylenimine (PEI) as described (13Gautam A. Densmore C.L. Golunski E. Xu B. Waldrep J.C. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 551-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), by adding 2 μg of DNA encoding the CFP and YFP fusion proteins to each well. The DNA-PEI mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and the cells were analyzed for FRET or Western blotting 36-48 h after transfection, as described below. Measurement of FRET—Transfected 293T and HeLa cells were treated as described below and analyzed using a FACSAriaJ sell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose CA) equipped with 3 lasers (488-nm Argon Blue laser, 633-nm red, and 407-nm violet lasers). Briefly, cells expressing only CFP- or only YFP-tagged proteins were used to set compensation values for spectral overlap on the flow cytometer so that cells expressing only CFP- or YFP-tagged receptors produced no signal in the FRET channel. The excitation and emission peaks of CFP (donor) are 434 and 476 nm, respectively, whereas the excitation and emission peaks for YFP (acceptor) are 514 and 527 nm, respectively. Data were analyzed using Becton Dickinson FACSDiva software. Fluorescence data were collected using the following filter sets: CFP emission was detected with a 510-nm (DF21) filter using 405-nm excitation, and non-FRET YFP emission with a 530/30 bandpass filter at 488-nm excitation. The FRET signal was detected using a 550-nm (DF30) filter. Effect of Diamide on TNF Receptor Self-interaction—Transfected 293T cells were treated with diluent (PBS) or diamide (1 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C, in the presence and absence of 100 μm DTT. As a positive control, transfected 293T cell cultures were treated with TNF (200 units/ml) for 60 min at 4 °C. In separate experiments we examined the effects of TNF-induced TNFR oligomerization following treatment with a concentration of diamide (1 μm) that had no discernable effect of TNFR self-interaction. Briefly, 293T cells were pretreated for 15 min either with 1 μm diamide or 1 μm diamide and 100 μm DTT; the cultures were then washed with PBS and treated with TNF (100 units/ml) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Group data were analyzed as the mean fluoresence intensity in the FRET channel. Effect of DsbA on TNF Receptor Self-interaction—Because diamide can penetrate cell membranes, and might therefore lead to oxidative modifications of the cytoplasmic tails of the TNF receptor CYP and YFP fusion constructs, we employed DsbA, a cell-impermeant oxidoreductase, that catalyzes thiol: disulfide exchange reactions between thiol groups on cysteine residues and oxidized gluthathione (GSSG) (14Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Transfected 293T cells were treated overnight in serum-free medium with DsbA (0.01 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of 500 μm glutathione disulfide (GSSG). In separate experiments, we examined the effects of TNF (100 units/ml for 1 h at 4 °C) on TNFR2 oligomerization in 293T cells that had been treated overnight with 0.01 μg/ml DsbA and 500 μm GSSG. For each set of experiments, the cells were studied using flow cytometry, and the data were analyzed as the mean fluoresence intensity measured in the FRET channel. Western Blotting—Cell cultures were treated with diamide (1 mm) for 15 min or DsbA (1 μg/ml) plus GSSG (500 μm) for 15 min, as described above, and Western blotting for TNFR1 and TNFR2 was performed (3Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The TNFR1 or TNFR2 complexes were detected using an anti-HA antibody (clone HA-7, Sigma Aldridge) diluted 1:10000, followed by goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 (Sigma Aldridge), and the protein complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Assessment of Free Sulhydryl Groups on TNFR1—To determine whether the concentrations of DsbA that led to TNFR self-association were sufficient to modify free thiol groups on the cysteine residues of TNFR1, we exposed transfected 293T cells to 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′ disulfonate (AMS). AMS is a membrane-impermeable maleimide that forms covalent bond with proteins containing free thiol groups. Given that AMS has a molecular mass of ∼500 Da, proteins that react with AMS have retarded mobility on electrophoretic gels. Briefly, 293T cells expressing the TNFR1 fusion protein were treated overnight in serum-free medium with DsbA (1 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of GSSG (500 μm). Following treatment with DsbA, the cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and the proteins precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed with acetone and dissolved in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris and 1% SDS, pH 7.4. The samples were then incubated with AMS (20 mm) for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction halted by adding reducing SDS buffer. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM, 20 mm), which blocks free thiol groups, was used as a mock control. Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-Tricine gel, followed by Western blotting with anti-HA primary antibody diluted 1:10,000 and a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000, followed by ECL. HeLa cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells, grown to 70-80% confluence, were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with diamide (1 μm) in the presence and absence of DTT (100 μm). The cells were then washed with PBS and challenged with TNF (100 units/ml) for an additional 15 min. For the experiments involving DsbA, HeLa cells were treated with DsbA (0.001-10 μm) to determine a concentration of DsbA that resulted in submaximal activation of NF-κB. Next, the cells were treated overnight in serum-free medium with 0.1 μg/ml DsbA, in the presence and absence of GSSG (500 μm). After treatment with DsbA, the cells were stimulated with TNF (100 units/ml) or diluent for 15 min at 37 °C, and then washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were collected, and nuclear extracts were prepared using reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions (15Knuefermann P. Chen P. Misra A. Shi S.P. Abdellatif M. Sivasubramanian N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23888-23897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (15 μg) were incubated with the labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide as described previously (15Knuefermann P. Chen P. Misra A. Shi S.P. Abdellatif M. Sivasubramanian N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23888-23897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complexes were separated electrophoretically on 4% polyacrylamide gels, and the radiographic images of the dried gels captured using a STORM 860 imager (Molecular Dynamics). HeLa cells were grown to 70-80% confluence in 100-mm plates and were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with diamide (1 μm) or diluent, washed with PBS, and then challenged with TNF (100 units/ml) for 1 h in serum-free medium. For the experiments involving DsbA, HeLa cells were treated overnight in serum-free medium with DsbA (0.1 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of GSSG (500 μm). Following treatment with DsbA, the cells were stimulated for 1 h (37 °C) with TNF (100 units/ml) in serum-free medium, and the cells washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We measured gene expression of two TNF-sensitive genes, IκB and sydecan-4, using an RNase protection assay, as previously described (16Baumgarten G. Knuefermann P. Nozaki N. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Vallejo J.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed, and the gel images were quantified using laser densitometry and ImageQuanT software (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics), and the resulting data normalized to levels of L32 mRNA, which was used as an internal control to normalize the degree of loading in each lane. To determine whether oxidative stress resulted in modifications of TNF binding to its cognate receptors, we performed TNF saturation/competition studies using a modification of the method of Ding et al. (17Ding A.H. Sanchez E. Srimal S. Nathan C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3924-3929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TNF saturation/competition studies assays were performed in 293T cells that had been transfected with the chimeric TNFR1 or TNFR2 constructs. The cultures of 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates, and the cells treated overnight with DsbA (0.1 μg/ml) or diluent, as described above. The cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA (PBSA), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, or 3 nm 125I-TNF in PBSA, in the presence and absence of 100 nm of unlabeled TNF. TNF binding was terminated by aspirating the labeling medium and rapidly washing the cells with ice-cold PBSA. The cells were then solubilized with 0.3 ml of 1 n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature, transferred to scintillation vials, and the γ-emissions determined by scintillation counting. To determine whether oxidative stress influenced TNF signaling, we measured NF-κB activation in TNF-stimulated cells that had been pretreated with DsbA. Briefly, HeLa cells were grown as described above and were treated overnight in serum-free medium with diluent or DsbA (0.01 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of GSSG (500 μm). After the DsbA treatment, cell cultures were washed with PBS and treated for 15 min at 37 °C with different concentrations of TNF (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 pm). Following this, the nuclear extracts were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility assays performed as described above. Autoradiography was performed and the gel images were quantified using laser densitometry and ImageQuanT software (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics). Values are presented as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for mean differences in the FRET mean fluorescence intensity or the optical density of the bands from RNase protection assays in the different treatment groups. Where appropriate, posthoc ANOVA testing (Tukey's test) was used to assess mean differences between groups. An unpaired Student's t test was used to test for mean differences between vehicle and DsbA-treated groups for the TNF dose response curves of NF-κB activation. Significant differences were said to exist at a value of p < 0.05. Effect of Diamide on TNF Receptor Self-association—Fig. 1, panels A-E and H-L show, respectively, representative FACS analyses of 293T cells transfected with the chimeric TNFR2 and TNFR1 fusion constructs (n = 3-6 experiments/group). Fig. 1, panels F and M depict the summary of group data for mean fluorescence intensity in the FRET channel (quadrant 2 (upper right hand panel) for TNFR2 and TNFR1, respectively). With respect to TNFR2, treatment with diamide (1 mm) provoked an increase in the mean fluoresence intensity in the FRET channel (Fig. 1, panels B and F) when compared with diluent-treated control cells (Fig. 1, panels A and F), consistent with a closer physical association of the cytoplasmic CFP and YFP moieties of the TNFR2 fusion protein. The observation that a small percentage of diluent-treated cells emit a FRET signal is consistent with the view that TNFRs pre-associate as oligomers on the cell surface (3Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The diamide-induced increase in the FRET signal was abolished by simultaneous treatment with DTT (Fig. 1, panel F), a thiol-reducing agent, whereas DTT alone had no effect on the baseline mean fluoresence intensity in the FRET channel (Fig. 1, panels E and F), suggesting that under the conditions used herein, the majority of the TNFR2 receptors exist in a reduced state. Treatment with TNF (200 units/ml), which was used as a positive control, resulted in a similar mean fluorescence in the FRET channel (Fig. 1, panels C and F) when compared with diamide-treated cells. The results with FRET were confirmed using Western blot analysis of 293T cells transfected with the TNFR2 fusion proteins. The left panel of Fig. 1G shows that diamide induced the formation of TNFR2 complexes with molecular masses that were 2-3× that of monomeric TNFR2, consistent with the self-association of TNFR2 into dimers and trimers. In contrast, the diamide-induced increase in TNFR2 oligomerization was not evident when the gels were run under reducing conditions using DTT. Fig. 1, panels H-M depicts the results of similar experiments in which TNFR1-transfected 293T cells were treated with diamide and then analyzed by FACS. As shown, the results were qualitatively similar to those described above for TNFR2. The mean fluoresence intensity of the FRET channel for the diamide and TNF-treated TNFR1-transfected cells was less than we observed with TNFR2-transfected cells, which may relate to transfection efficiency of the TNFR1 chimeric fusion proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative stress, in the absence of ligand, is sufficient to increase the self-interaction of both TNF receptors. To determine whether lower levels of oxidative stress were sufficient to augment TNF-induced TNFR association, we examined the FRET signal in TNFR2-transfected cells in the presence and absence of TNF, after pretreating the 293T cells with a concentration of diamide (1 μm) that had no discernable effect of the FRET signal (compare Fig. 2, panels A and B). Fig. 2, panel F, which summarizes the results of group data (n = 3-6 experiments/group), illustrates two important findings. First, low (1 μm) concentrations of diamide had no effect of the FRET signal when compared with diluent. Second, pretreatment with 1 μm diamide resulted in a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in the FRET signal in TNF-treated cells, when compared with TNF-stimulated cells that had been pretreated with diluent. Importantly, the diamide-induced increase in the FRET signal in TNF-treated cells was abolished by treatment with DTT (Fig. 2, panel E). Fig. 2, panels G-L summarizes the results of parallel experiments conducted in TNFR1-transfected 293T cells. As shown by the group data in Fig. 2, panel L (n = 6 experiments/group), the results were similar to those observed for TNFR2. That is, pretreatment with 1 μm diamide, which had no discernable effect on the FRET signal, resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of the FRET signal in TNF-stimulated cells when compared with TNF treatment alone. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative stress, at levels that do not promote self-association of either TNFR1 or TNFR2, is sufficient to augment TNF-induced oligomerization of TNF receptors.FIGURE 2Effect of diamide (1 μm) on TNF-induced TNF receptor oligomerization. A flow cytometric analysis (FACS) analysis of 293T cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged TNFR2 (panels A-F) or TNFR1 (panels G-L) was performed. FACS analysis of cells with CFP and FRET fluorescence channels are shown on the x and y axes, respectively. The mean fluoresence intensity (MFI) of cells emitting a FRET signal is depicted in the top right quadrant of each FACS analysis (quadrant 2); the respective treatments are presented on the top left of each analysis. Panels A and G, control; panels B and H, diamide (1 μm); panels C and I, TNF (100 units/ml); panels D and J, 100 units/ml TNF in diamide (1 μm)-pretreated cells; panels E and K, 100 units/ml TNF in cells pretreated with diamide (1 μm) and DTT (100 μm). The group data (mean ± S.E.) for MFI for each treatment is shown in panels F and L, respectively, for TNFR2 and TNFR1. These results are representative of a minimum of least three different experiments (n = 3-6 experiments/group).

The left panel of Fig. 3A shows that under nonreducing conditions, DsbA induced the formation of the TNFR2 complexes with molecular weights that were 2-3× the molecular weight of the TNFR2 monomers. As shown, the effect of DsbA was detectable as early as 4 h and was a maximum at 7-16 h. In contrast, TNFR2 receptor dimers and trimers were not detected in vehicle-treated samples (up to 16 h), whereas they were readily detected in diamide (positive control)-treated samples within 15 min. The right panel of Fig. 3A shows that DsbA-induced multimeric TNFR2 receptor complexes were not detected when the samples were electrophoretically separated under reducing conditions. FRET experiments were performed in 293T cells transfected with the chimeric TNFR1 and TNFR2 fusion constructs to determine whether oxidative stress-induced modifications of the extracellular domains of the TNFRs was sufficient to facilitate self-association. With respect to TNFR2, Fig. 3C shows that treatment with DsbA (0.1 μg/ml) for 16 h led to small increases in the FRET signal when compared with diluent-treated controls (Fig. 3B). However, the important finding was that pretreatment with DsbA (0.1 μg/ml) for 16 h enhanced the FRET signal in TNF (100 units/ml)-treated cells (Fig. 3, panel E), when compared with TNF (100 units/ml)-treated cells that had not been pretreated with DsbA (Fig. 3, panel D). Fig. 3, panel F, which summarizes the results of group data, shows that DsbA significant increased (p < 0.05) the FRET signal of the TNFR2-transfected cells in comparison to diluent, and that pretreatment with DsbA significantly increased (p < 0.05) the FRET signal in TNF-treated cells when compared with TNF stimulation in the absence of DsbA. Treatment with DsbA had similar qualitative effects on the FRET signal in 293T cells that had been transfected with TNFR1 fusion proteins, as depicted in Fig. 3, panels G-J. Thus, the findings in the DsbA-treated 203T cells are internally consistent with the results obtained with diamide, and suggest that the oxidative stress-induced self-association of TNFR1 and TNFR2 is secondary to modification of the extracellular domains of the TNF receptors. However, the results of these studies do not allow us to determine which cysteine residues were modified by diamide or DsbA. To determine whether DsbA modified the free sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues on the extracellular domains of TNFR1 under the experimental conditions used herein, we treated TNFR1-transfected 293T cells with DsbA, as described above, and then exposed the cells to AMS. As shown in Fig. 3K the Western blot for TNFR1 in the diluent-treated cells exposed to NEM showed a single band with a lower molecular mass, when compared with the multiple bands of higher molecular weight in the diluent-treated cells exposed to AMS, consistent with the presence of free sulfhydryl groups in the extracellular domain of the TNFR1. However, the important finding shown by Fig. 3, panel K is that treatment with DsbA resulted in a shift in the pattern of AMS binding to lower molecular proteins, suggesting that there were less free sulfhydryl groups available for AMS binding following DsbA-induced oxidation of the free sulfhydryl groups, consistent with a prior study that showed that TNFR1 contains"

Here we report that, despite the significant structural differences among many of these compounds, their biosynthetic routes contain an unexpected common intermediate, 2-hydroxyethyl-phosphonate, which is synthesized from phosphonoacetaldehyde by a distinct family of metal-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Although the sequence identity of the ADH family members is relatively low (34–37%), in vitro biochemical characterization of the homologs involved in biosynthesis of the antibiotics fosfomycin, phosphinothricin tripeptide, and dehydrophos (formerly A53868) unequivocally confirms their enzymatic activities. These unique ADHs have exquisite substrate specificity, unusual metal requirements, and an unprecedented monomeric quaternary structure. Further, sequence analysis shows that these ADHs form a monophyletic group along with additional family members encoded by putative phosphonate biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to hydroxyethyl-phosphonate may represent a common step in the biosynthesis of many phosphonate natural products, a finding that lends insight into the evolution of phosphonate biosynthetic pathways and the chemical structures of new C–P containing secondary metabolites.

Phosphonic acids are common natural products that are structurally similar to phosphate-esters but contain stable carbon-phosphorus (C–P) bonds in place of the more labile carbon-oxygen-phosphorus bond motif. In many organisms, phosphonates are found as a side group on exopolysaccharides and glycoproteins, whereas in others, they constitute the core of the polar head group of phosphonolipids (1Hilderbrand R.L. The Role of Phosphonates in Living Systems. CRC press, Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar). In the latter case, they may comprise up to 50% of the total phosphorus found in the organisms, suggesting that they fulfill the critical roles in the biology of the organisms in which they are found (2Quin L.D. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 324-330Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Many chemically diverse secondary metabolites produced by both fungi and bacteria also contain phosphonate functional groups, including compounds with antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and other useful therapeutic traits (3Fields S.C. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 12237-12272Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Notable examples include the antibiotic fosfomycin, which is clinically used in the treatment of cystitis (4Reeves D.S.

Numerous studies have addressed the biosynthesis of phosphonate natural products, but the complete biosynthetic pathway is known only for aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) (8Barry R.J. Bowman E.

Rep. 1999; 16: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these studies indicate that most if not all phosphonate biosynthetic pathways begin with the same two enzymatic steps, namely the rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by PEP phosphomutase (PPM) and the subsequent conversion of PnPy to phosphonoacetaldehyde (PnAA) and CO2 catalyzed by PnPy decarboxylase (PPD) (see Fig. 1b) (9Seto H.

Biol. 2006; 13: 1171-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and PTT (from Streptomyces viridochromogenes) (see Fig. 1c) (13Blodgett J.A.V. Zhang J.K. Metcalf W.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Blodgett J.A. Thomas P.M. Li G. Velasquez J.E. van der Donk W.A. Kelleher N.L. Metcalf W.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we noted that both pathways appear to require alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) (encoded by fomC and phpC, respectively) in addition to PPM and PPD. In the feeding experiments for fosfomycin biosynthesis, AEP fed to a mutant blocked at the FomC step did not complement fosfomycin production, whereas feeding hydroxyethylphosphonate (HEP) to this mutant complemented fosfomycin production (15Woodyer R.D. Li G.Y. Zhao H.M. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Commun. 2007; : 359-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that HEP feeds downstream of the FomC blockage. A similar phenomenon was observed with a ΔphpC mutant from the PTT biosynthetic pathway, in which AEP was found to accumulate (14Blodgett J.A. Thomas P.M. Li G. Velasquez J.E. van der Donk W.A. Kelleher N.L. Metcalf W.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). AEP has been used as a physiological equivalent of PnAA, and the conversion of carbonyl to amino group, as well as the reverse reaction, is thought to be carried out by endogenous aminotransferases (16Imai S. Seto H. Ogawa H. Satoh A. Otake N. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 873-874Google Scholar, 17Alijah R. Dorendorf J. Talay S. Puhler A. Wohlleben W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 34: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that FomC and PhpC likely catalyze the step following PPD in their corresponding pathways. Here we show that the dehydrophos biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces luridus contains another ADH (DhpG). In vitro biochemical characterization of purified FomC, PhpC, and DhpG demonstrates that each enzyme catalyzes the same interconversion between PnAA and HEP. Although the enzymes possess fairly divergent primary sequences (only 34–37% identity), they all belong to the group III iron-dependent ADH family and share common quaternary structure and substrate specificity. Interestingly, the three enzymes characterized here form a monophyletic group with several other group III ADHs. These genes are clustered with genes encoding putative PPM and PPD enzymes. Thus, it seems likely that HEP is a common intermediate in the biosynthesis of numerous C–P-containing natural products, an observation that may prove highly useful in the mining of microbial genomes for novel phosphonate antibiotics and for elucidating the biosynthetic mechanisms of those novel phosphonate antibiotics. Reagents, bacterial strains, plasmids, cell growth, and cloning of S. wedmorensis fomC and S. luridus dhpG are described in the supplemental data. Protein Expression and Purification—The purification of S. viridochromogenes PhpC was carried out as described elsewhere (14Blodgett J.A. Thomas P.M. Li G. Velasquez J.E. van der Donk W.A. Kelleher N.L. Metcalf W.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For purification of S. wedmorensis FomC and S. luridus DhpG, overnight cultures of BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the construct pET28-fomC or pET15-DhpG were diluted 1:100 into M medium (9.3 g/liter K2HPO4, 2 g/liter KH2PO4, 6.7 g/liter glucose, 1.3 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 1.3 g/liter MgSO4, 2.7 g/liter Tris, 5.3 ml glycerol, 13.3 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter LB). 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 100 μg/ml ampicillin was supplemented. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼1.0. Then 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the cultures to induce protein expression. The temperature was reduced to 20 °C, and the cell growth was continued for 14 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 6,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, and 15% glycerol, pH 7.5). Lysozyme was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml before freezing the suspension at -80 °C. The yield was 9–10 g of bacterial wet weight/liter of culture with the M medium. Cell lysate was prepared by thawing the frozen pellets on ice. The suspension was sonicated on ice with a Branson sonicator with a 5- and 10-s interval for 10 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 2 ml/min onto a column packed with 10 ml of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin (Talon, Clontech). Protein purification was performed by using a BioLogic LP fast-performance liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The column with the loaded sample was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer followed by 5 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 15% glycerol, pH 7.5). His6-tagged FomC or His6-tagged DhpG was eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 15% glycerol, pH 7.5. Due to the relatively low expression level, FomC was only ∼70% pure (DhpG was 90–95% pure and was subjected to dialysis against lysis buffer to remove imidazole). The partially purified FomC was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and loaded onto a Hiload™ 20/26 Superdex™ 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted with the same lysis buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with ∼90% purity. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Determination of Quaternary Structure—To determine the quaternary structure, size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system with a Bio-Sil SEC-250 column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) and a mobile phase of 0.1 m Na2HPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.01 m NaN3, pH 6.8. A protein mass standard (Bio-Rad catalog number 151-1901) was used to standardize the retention time of the column with respect to molecular mass. The flow rate was 1 ml/min with the detector set at 280 nm. Samples of 20 μl of the purified enzyme or the standard were injected manually, and data were collected for 15 min. A standard curve was created by plotting the retention time versus molecular mass (log scale), and the molecular weight of the target protein was obtained by fitting of the standard curve using Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Chemical Synthesis of Substrates—PnAA, HEP, and hydroxymethylphosphonate (HMP) were synthesized according to the methods reported elsewhere (14Blodgett J.A. Thomas P.M. Li G.

Chem. 1969; 34: 755Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 31P NMR Method—NMR analyses of samples were carried out in 20% D2O in the NMR laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a Varian Unity U500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm Nalorac Quad probe. Enzyme Kinetics—Initial rates were determined using a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) at 25 °C. ADH activity was measured by determining NAD(P)H-dependent PnAA reduction to HEP or NAD(P)+-dependent HEP oxidation to PnAA using a molar absorption coefficient of 6.22 × 103 m-1 cm-1 at 340 nm. The substrates were dissolved in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Kinetic determinations were performed for each condition with six different concentrations of one substrate at a fixed, saturating concentration of the other substrate. The Km and kcat were determined by non-linear regression using Origin 5.0. Parameters are expressed as the mean for at least three different measurements. For assays at different pH values, the reactions were performed in universal buffers. Universal buffer I (25 mm acetate/MES/HEPES/borate plus 200 mm NaCl) with pH 5.0–9.5 was used for determining the kinetic parameters for PnAA reduction. Universal buffer II (25 mm HEPES/glycine plus 100 mm NaCl) with pH 7.5–10.5 was used for determining the kinetic parameters for HEP oxidation. To construct the pH profiles, the kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/Km for PnAA and HEP were determined at each pH, and the pH dependence of Y (kcat/Km) was fitted to a bell-shaped curve described by Equation 1, where H is the proton concentration, K1 and K2 are the dissociation constants for the groups that ionize at low and high pH, respectively, and YH is the pH-independent plateau value of Y at intermediate pH. The pH profile for kcat was constructed by connecting data points with smooth lines.logY=log[YH/(1+H/K1+K2/H)](Eq. 1) Metal Identification—1,10-Phenanthroline was used to determine the iron content of a protein (20Agudelo M.I. Kustin K. Mcleod G.C. Robinson W.E. Wang R.T. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1983; 165: 100-109Crossref Google Scholar, 21Farh L. Hwang S.Y. Steinrauf L. Chiang H.J. Shiuan D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It forms an orange-colored complex (Fe(phen)3)2+ with Fe2+ and has a maximal absorbance at 510 nm. Each of the ADHs (3–5 μm final concentration) was mixed with 1,10-phenanthroline (1.5–2 mm final concentration) and incubated at 4 °C until the activity was completely abolished (usually 1–2 h). To set up a calibration curve, in parallel, different concentrations (from 0 to 50 μm) of standard Fe2+ solution were prepared and incubated with 1,10-phenanthroline simultaneously. Absorbance was measured at 510 nm, and the iron contents of ADHs were determined by comparison with the calibration curve. Because the iron content of the PhpC sample was determined to be less than 5%, PhpC was considered to contain a different metal. EDTA was used to remove the metal from its active site. Approximately 20–25 μm PhpC was incubated with 20–25 mm EDTA at 4 °C until the activity was completely abolished (usually 1–2 h). Then the mixture was loaded to a PD-10 desalting column obtained from GE Healthcare to remove the metal-EDTA complex and the free EDTA. The inactivated PhpC (10–20 μm) was then incubated with various divalent metals (Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+) prepared in the reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) at the concentration of 1 mm for 10 min, and the activity of PnAA reduction was measured (Fe2+ solution was prepared in the presence of 100 mm ascorbate). Among all the metals, only Zn2+ could reconstitute the PhpC activity. The methods to determine zinc content were reported elsewhere (22Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). 4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) forms a red-colored complex with zinc, and the complex has a maximal absorbance at 500 nm.6 m guanidine hydrochloride was used to denature PhpC for 10 min, and 10 mm PAR was prepared according to the literature (22Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Approximately 20–25 μm denatured PhpC was mixed with 0.5–1 mm PAR, and the absorbance was measured and compared with the calibration curve set up by the reactions with standard Zn2+ solutions. Due to the instability of PhpC, the His6 tag was not removed from the enzyme because the protease digestion step required ∼16–20 h at 4 °C, after which most of the enzyme was precipitated. Homology Modeling—Using the coordinates for Thermotoga maritima alcohol dehydrogenase (1O2D) and Escherichia coli lactaldehyde-propanediol oxidoreductase (2BL4) from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org), a structural model was created for FomC, PhpC, and DhpG, respectively, with the automated homology modeling function of Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). 10 intermediate models were created for each ADH with moderate refinements, and the best intermediate models were chosen for further analysis. Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada) was used to build NAD(P)+ and the iron from 1O2D into the model, and rotamer searches of the important metal ligands were performed. Finally, PnAA or HEP was built into the models and docked manually into the active sites. Hydrogen atoms were added, and the whole structures were subjected to energy minimization using the MMFF94s force field to relieve steric and torsional artifacts from the modeling and docking processes. The final models were inspected for amino acid Ramachandran outliers, van der Waals clashes, and any obvious defects. The substrate binding pockets of FomC, PhpC and DhpG were built by the MOLCAD module in Sybyl (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). DhpG Is a New Group III Iron-dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenase Required for Synthesis of the Antibiotic Dehydrophos—We recently cloned and sequenced the S. luridus gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of the antibiotic dehydrophos. 5A. C. Eliot and W. W. Metcalf, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 1c, the dehydrophos gene cluster includes genes predicted to encode PEP mutase (encoded by dhpE), PnPy decarboxylase (encoded by dhpF), and a group III iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by dhpG). The closest homologs of dhpG with known function are the phosphonate biosynthetic genes fomC and phpC. Interestingly, a transposon-induced dhpG mutant was unable to produce dehydrophos and instead accumulated AEP, similar to the phpC mutants described above (Fig. 2). Thus, DhpG, like PhpC and FomC, is likely to be an alcohol dehydrogenase that catalyzes the reduction of PnAA to HEP. Biochemical Analysis of FomC, PhpC, and DhpG—To test the hypothesis that FomC, PhpC, and DhpG are PnAA/HEP oxidoreductases, we heterologously expressed each as a fusion protein with a His6 tag. The resulting enzymes were purified and biochemically characterized in vitro. All three enzymes catalyze the reversible conversion of PnAA to HEP, which was verified by 31P NMR (data not shown). As shown in Table 1, FomC has a Km value of 31 μm for PnAA and a kcat value of 1.3 s-1, representing the lowest Km and highest kcat among the three enzymes. Because PhpC and DhpG have a larger Km (185 μm for PhpC and 414 μm for DhpG) and slightly lower kcat (0.41 s-1 for PhpC and 0.46 s-1 for DhpG), their catalytic efficiencies are 19- and 37-fold less than that of FomC. In addition, PhpC is an NADH-dependent enzyme, whereas FomC and DhpG are NADPH-dependent ADHs. No reaction was observed with HMP (one-carbon backbone) and 3-hydroxypropylphosphonate (three-carbon backbone). A possible explanation could be inferred from their structural models as discussed below.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for FomC, PhpC, and DhpGEnzymesKm, PnAAkcatkcat/Km, PnAAKm, NAD(P)Hμms–1m–1 s–1μmFomC31 ± 11.3 ± 0.1419.8 ± 1.7aKm toward NADPHPhpC185 ± 160.41 ± 0.022.219.3 ± 3.2bKm toward NADHDhpG414 ± 210.46 ± 0.031.10.185 ± 0.015aKm toward NADPHa Km toward NADPHb Km toward NADH Open table in a new tab The pH dependence of enzymatic activity was determined for FomC, PhpC, and DhpG. As illustrated for FomC (supplemental Fig. S1), PnAA reduction is more favorable under neutral conditions (optimal pH at 7.0), whereas HEP oxidation is favored under more basic conditions (optimal pH at 9.0). Due to the thermodynamics of the aldehyde reduction, PnAA reduction is strongly favored at the physiological condition (pH 7.0). The catalytic efficiency of PnAA reduction is 377-fold greater than that of the reverse reaction, and even at pH 9.0, the catalytic efficiency of the forward reaction is still 11-fold greater than that of the reverse reaction. The group III enzyme family commonly uses iron as a cofactor. Therefore, we measured the iron content for all three ADHs. The stoichiometry between iron and protein was determined to be ∼1 for both FomC and DhpG. However, the iron content of the PhpC sample was less than 5%. To determine its metal content, an enzymatic activity reconstitution experiment was performed. EDTA was used to remove the metal from PhpC, and after removing the excess free EDTA, different divalent metals (Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+) were mixed with the inactive PhpC. Only Zn2+ could reconstitute the original enzymatic activity (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that PhpC is a zinc-dependent ADH. The stoichiometry between zinc and PhpC was determined to be 0.82 using the PAR colorimetric assay (22Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In fact, PhpC is not the first zinc-dependent ADH from the family. Two family members, Bacillus stearothermophilus glycerol dehydrogenase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase IV, were reported to be zinc-dependent (23Drewke C. Ciriacy M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Ruzheinikov S.N. Burke J. Sedelnikova S. Baker P.J. Taylor R. Bullough P.A. Muir N.M. Gore M.G. Rice D.W. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the group III iron-dependent ADH family was suggested to be renamed to the group III metal-dependent ADH family. The quaternary structures of FomC, PhpC, and DhpG were determined by size exclusion HPLC. Both His6-tagged and non-His6-tagged FomC and DhpG were evaluated, whereas only His6-tagged PhpC was evaluated because it precipitated significantly after overnight protease digestion. Surprisingly, all three enzymes are monomeric (supplemental Fig. S3), which is unprecedented because other enzymes from the same family have oligomeric quaternary structures. For example, B. stearothermophilus glycerol dehydrogenase is an octamer (24Ruzheinikov S.N. Burke J. Sedelnikova S. Baker P.J. Taylor R. Bullough P.A. Muir N.M. Gore M.G. Rice D.W. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas both E. coli lactaldehyde-propanediol oxidoreductase and S. cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase IV are dimers (23Drewke C. Ciriacy M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Montella C. Bellsolell L. Perez-Luque R. Badia J. Baldoma L. Coll M. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Genome Mining Using PPM, PPD, and ADH as Probes—In addition to S. wedmorensis, S. viridochromogenes, and S. luridus, searching genome and nucleotide databases on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) revealed an additional five organisms containing PPM, PPD, and ADH, including Bacteroides fragilis YCH46, Delta proteobacterium MLMS-1, Amycolatopsis orientalis, Azoarcus sp. BH72, and Frankia alni ACN14a (Fig. 3). Other neighboring genes are labeled by their individual locus tag or gene ID, and the corresponding putative proteins encoded by these open reading frames are listed in supplemental Table S1. Among them, the PPM-PPD-ADH region from A. orientalis is located upstream of the vancomycin group antibiotic biosynthetic cluster (26van Wageningen A.M.A. Kirkpatrick P.N. Williams D.H. Harris B.R. Kershaw J.K. Lennard N.J. Jones M. Jones S.J.M. Solenberg P.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 155-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The most interesting cluster is from F. alni ACN14a. In addition to PPM, PPD, and ADH, it contains three open reading frames encoding proteins that share a high sequence identity with those from the PTT biosynthetic cluster (13Blodgett J.A.V. Zhang J.K. Metcalf W.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Blodgett J.A. Thomas P.M. Li G. Velasquez J.E. van der Donk W.A. Kelleher N.L. Metcalf W.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), including FRAAL6372 (47% sequence identity with PhpJ), FRAAL6375 (51% sequence identity with PhpD), and FRAAL6376 (62% sequence identity with PhpE) (supplemental Table S1). Based on the biosynthetic mechanism of the PTT gene cluster, the cluster from F. alni ACN14a would also produce phosphonoformate as an intermediate (14Blodgett J.A. Thomas P.M. Li G. Velasquez J.E. van der Donk W.A. Kelleher N.L. Metcalf W.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the open reading frames that are homologous to many of the remaining PTT biosynthetic genes are absent; thus it seems likely that the operon from F. alni ACN14a encodes a novel phosphonate antibiotic biosynthetic pathway. FomC, PhpC, and DhpG Define a New Subfamily of Group III Metal-dependent ADHs Involved in Phosphonate Biosynthesis—To decipher the evolutionary origin of FomC, PhpC, and DhpG, phylogenetic analysis was performed on the group III metal-dependent ADHs from bacteria and archaea using the multiple sequence alignment tool CLUSTALW (Biology Workbench). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4, DhpG, FomC, PhpC and the ADHs from A. orientalis, Azoarcus sp. BH72, and F. alni ACN14a all cluster together. This indicates that they may have arisen from the same ancestor, from which phosphonate biosynthesis started to diversify. In this work, we biochemically characterized three distinct alcohol dehydrogenases involved in the biosynthesis of an unexpected common intermediate, 2-hydroxyethyl-phosphonate, from three different phosphonate biosynthetic pathways producing fosfomycin, phosphinothricin tripeptide, and dehydrophos. These enzymes are monomeric, require either iron or zinc for activity, and exhibit exquisite substrate specificity. According to Reid and Fewson (27Reid M.F. Fewson C.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 13-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), the oxidoreductases catalyzing the interconversion of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols can be classified into three major categories: (i) NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, (ii) NAD(P)-independent alcohol dehydrogenases that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, heme, or cofactor F420 as a cofactor, and (iii) oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols. The first category can, in turn, be divided into three groups. Group I consists of long-chain zinc-dependent dehydrogenases, group II comprises the short-chain zinc-independent dehydrogenases, and group III is made up of iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. Based on protein homology, FomC, PhpC, and DhpG all belong to the group III iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family. A few enzymes from this family have been characterized, such as E. coli lactaldehyde-propanediol oxidoreductase (25Montella C. Bellsolell L. Perez-Luque R. Badia J. Baldoma L. Coll M. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase IV (23Drewke C. Ciriacy M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), Zymomonas mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II (28Conway T. Ingram L.O. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3754-3759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and B. stearothermophilus glycerol dehydrogenase (24Ruzheinikov S.N. Burke J. Sedelnikova S. Baker P.J. Taylor R. Bullough P.A. Muir N.M. Gore M.G. Rice D.W. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The exquisite substrate specificity of FomC, PhpC, and DhpG may be explained by homology modeling. Structural models of these ADHs were built using T. maritima alcohol dehydrogenase and E. coli 1, 2-propanediol oxidoreductase (25Montella C. Bellsolell L. Perez-Luque R. Badia J. Baldoma L. Coll M. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which share 23–34% identity with the three target proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, Asp-189, Gln-193, His-257, and His-271 of FomC, Asp-199, Gln-203, His-268, and His-282 of PhpC, and Asp-189, His-193, His-257, and His-271 of DhpG are predicted to coordinate to their corresponding metals. The orientations of the substrates around the metals would help further polarize the carbonyls (i.e. increase electrophilicity) while placing them close to the nicotinamide rings of NAD(P)Hs, thus catalyzing the hydride transfer. Of note, the NAD(P)H recognition motif Gly-Gly-Gly was found in all three ADHs (supplemental Fig. S4). Gly-35 of FomC, Ser-41 of DhpG, and Gly-40 of PhpC are the corresponding NADPH (FomC and DhpG) or NADH (PhpC) preferring residues in the individual proteins. The reason why PhpC contains a glycine rather than an aspartate (a known NADH preferring residue) (25Montella C. Bellsolell L. Perez-Luque R. Badia J. Baldoma L. Coll M. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but still favors NADH is unknown. More importantly, the size of the substrate binding pocket in FomC, PhpC, or DhpG appears to be optimal for coordinating HEP or PnAA only. 3-Hydroxypropylphosphonate, a substrate with a longer backbone, will not fit into the substrate binding pocket, whereas HMP, a substrate with a shorter backbone, may not be held tightly by the substrate binding pocket. This may be because either the residues involved in forming hydrogen bonds with the substrate are too far to interact with HMP or possibly the distance from the leaving hydrogen on HMP to C4 of NAD(P)+ is too long. The latter is more likely because it was observed that the reaction rate of HEP oxidation catalyzed by FomC was reduced in the presence of an equal mole of HMP (data not shown). The residues that are involved in forming the substrate binding pocket for FomC are shown in Fig. 5d. Among them, Ser-157 and Tyr-261 form hydrogen bonds with the phosphonate group of the substrate. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DhpG, FomC, PhpC, and the ADHs from A. orientalis, Azoarcus sp. BH72, and F. alni ACN14a all cluster together, indicating that they might share the same ancestor. More interestingly, the Ser-157 and Tyr-261 of FomC that are believed to form hydrogen bonds with the phosphonate group of the substrate are conserved in all the clustered ADHs but not in the non-clustered ADHs, indicating that the Ser-157 and Tyr-261 may be responsible for the phosphonate substrate selectivity (Fig. 6). This unique sequence motif might therefore be useful as a bioinformatic tool to identify additional phosphonate biosynthetic clusters that utilize HEP as an intermediate. In conclusion, we identified three distinct alcohol dehydrogenases that are involved in the biosynthesis of an unexpected intermediate, 2-hydroxyethyl-phosphonate, common to multiple phosphonate biosynthetic pathways. These enzymes exhibit exquisite substrate specificity that is consistent with homology modeling analysis. Further phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are evolutionarily related, forming a monophyletic group with several other group III ADHs, and all these genes are clustered with genes encoding putative PPM and PPD enzymes. Thus, the reduction of phosphonoacetaldehyde to hydroxyethylphosphonate may represent a common step in the biosynthesis of many phosphonate natural products, an observation that may lend insight into the evolution of phosphonate biosynthetic pathways and may prove highly useful in the mining of microbial genomes for novel phosphonate antibiotics and for suggesting the potential chemical structures of the products of these gene clusters.

https://openalex.org/W2167840168,"Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and fibroblasts provide conveniently derived non-neuronal samples in which to investigate the aetiology of schizophrenia (SZ) using gene expression profiling. This assumes that heritable mechanisms associated with risk of SZ have systemic effects and result in changes to gene expression in all tissues. The broad aim of this and other similar studies is that comparison of the transcriptomes of non-neuronal tissues from SZ patients and healthy controls may identify gene/pathway dysregulation underpinning the neurobiological defects associated with SZ. Using microarrays consisting of 18,664 probes we compared gene expression profiles of LCLs from SZ cases and healthy controls. To identify robust associations with SZ that were not patient or tissue specific, we also examined fibroblasts from an independent series of SZ cases and controls using the same microarrays. In both tissue types ANOVA analysis returned approximately the number of differentially expressed genes expected by chance. No genes were significantly differentially expressed in either tissue when corrected for multiple testing. Even using relaxed parameters (p≤0.05, without multiple testing correction) there were still no differentially expressed genes that also displayed ≥2-fold change between the groups of SZ cases and controls common to both LCLs and fibroblasts. We conclude that despite encouraging data from previous microarray studies assessing non-neural tissues, the lack of a convergent set of differentially expressed genes associated with SZ using fibroblasts and LCLs indicates the utility of non-neuronal tissues for detection of gene expression differences and/or pathways associated with SZ remains to be demonstrated."

The nature of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects remains incompletely understood but may involve an increase in the expression of utrophin. Here, we show that treatment of myotubes with 6α−methylprednisolone-21 sodium succinate (PDN) results in enhanced expression of utrophin A without concomitant increases in mRNA levels thereby suggesting that translational regulation contributes to the increase. In agreement with this, we show that PDN treatment of cells transfected with monocistronic reporter constructs harbouring the utrophin A 5′UTR, causes an increase in reporter protein expression while leaving levels of reporter mRNAs unchanged. Using bicistronic reporter assays, we further demonstrate that PDN enhances activity of an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) located within the utrophin A 5′UTR. Analysis of polysomes demonstrate that PDN causes an overall reduction in polysome-associated mRNAs indicating that global translation rates are depressed under these conditions. Importantly, PDN causes an increase in the polysome association of endogenous utrophin A mRNAs and reporter mRNAs harbouring the utrophin A 5′UTR. Additional experiments identified a distinct region within the utrophin A 5′UTR that contains the inducible IRES activity. Together, these studies demonstrate that a translational regulatory mechanism involving increased IRES activation mediates, at least partially, the enhanced expression of utrophin A in muscle cells treated with glucocorticoids. Targeting the utrophin A IRES may thus offer an important and novel therapeutic avenue for developing drugs appropriate for DMD patients."

We hypothesized that the scope of metabolomics could be enhanced by associating it with mass isotopomer analysis, a powerful technique developed over the past 16 years (reviewed in Refs. 6Hellerstein M.K.

We used this association of techniques to expand our previous studies on the influence of metabolic zonation of the liver on the labeling patterns of metabolites and on metabolic rates calculated from these labeling patterns. Over the past 12 years, questions were raised on the potential influence of the metabolic zonation of the liver (9Jungermann K. Diabetes Metab.

In livers perfused with [2-14C]pyruvate and quinolinate, an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), they observed substantial differences in the labeling of PEP and 3-phosphoglycerate. We also hypothesized that the extra-mitochondrial metabolism of citric acid cycle (CAC) intermediates would affect their labeling pattern and result in differences in the labeling patterns of tissue and extracellular metabolites. We tested these hypotheses by combining metabolomics with the determination of MIDs of gluconeogenic and CAC intermediates. gluconeogenesis α-glycerophosphate aminooxyacetate dihydroxyacetone phosphate citric acid cycle mass isotopomer distribution mercaptopicolinate oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase trimethylsilyl gas chromatography-mass spectrometry liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry high pressure liquid chromatography. We perfused rat livers with 13C-substrates, the label of which is channeled to [1-13C]PEP before entering GNG.

[1,4-13C2]Succinic acid (99%) and NaB2H4 (99%) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. An internal standard of (RS)-3-hydroxy-[2H5]glutarate was prepared by isotopic exchange of acetone dicarboxylic diethyl ester in 2H2O and NaO2H, followed by reduction with NaB2H4, and extraction in acid. This procedure is similar to that previously used for the preparation of (RS)-3-hydroxy-[2H5]butyrate from acetoacetate (22Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Desrochers S. Garneau M. David F. Mamer O.A.

[6-13C]Citric acid was prepared by reacting acetone dicarboxylic diethyl ester with K13CN, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile. The purity of the synthesized compounds was assessed by GC-MS of trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Dimethyl [1,4-13C2]succinate was prepared by reacting the acid with excess diazomethane. The purified product did not contain any detectable monoester or free acid. Reference standards of [13C3]glycerophosphate, dihydroxy-[13C3]acetone phosphate, and [13C3]glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate were prepared from [13C3]glycerol using glycerol kinase, α-glycerophosphate (αGP) dehydrogenase, and triose-phosphate isomerase. The carboxymethoxamates of pyruvate, OAA, and α-ketoglutarate were prepared as described by Borek and Clarke (23Borek E. Clarke H.T. J. Am. Chem.

The mercaptopicolinate-pyruvate hemithioacetal was prepared by reacting mercaptopicolinate and sodium pyruvate at neutral pH in degassed water for 6 h. The adduct was extracted with diethyl ether, converted to its TMS derivative, and assayed by ammonia-positive chemical ionization GC-MS. The m/z = 460 of the M + 1 molecular ion was shifted to m/z = 463 when the synthesis was conducted with [13C3]pyruvate. However, attempts at isolating a pure product were unsuccessful because of the instability of the adduct, which decomposes readily to its constituents. Liver Perfusion Experiments—Sprague-Dawley male rats were kept for 8–12 days on Teklad F6 rodent chow ad libitum. Livers from 18-h fasted rats (180–220 g) were first perfused (24Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2656-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min with nonrecirculating bicarbonate buffer (40 ml/min) containing unlabeled substrate. Then they were perfused with buffer containing (i) 40% enriched NaH13CO3 and 5 mm lactate, or 2 mm pyruvate ± 0.3 mm MPA, or 0.5 mm AOA (protocol I), or (ii) dimethyl [1,4-13C2]succinate ± 0.3 mm MPA (protocol II). In orientation experiments, we found that the labeling of gluconeogenic and CAC intermediates, as well as glucose production, were two to four times greater with dimethyl [1,4-13C2]succinate than with [1,4-13C2]succinate (not shown). Similar ratios in glucose production from dimethylsuccinate and succinate were reported by Rognstad (25Rognstad R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted all the experiments of this group with 0.5 mm dimethyl [1,4-13C2]succinate ± 0.3 mm MPA. Because the mercaptopicolinate molecule contains a free SH group, we wanted to avoid the possibility of oxidation in the perfusate gassed with 95% O2 + 5% CO2. Therefore, MPA was infused into the liver perfusion line via a syringe pump. At 30 min (protocol I) or 20 min (protocol II), the livers were quick-frozen and kept in liquid N2 until analyzed. Sample Preparation—Powdered frozen tissue (1.5 g), spiked with internal standards (150 nmol of [13C6]citrate, 100 nmol of [13C4]succinate, and 50 nmol of (RS)-3-hydroxy-[2H5]glutarate), was extracted with 19 ml of chloroform/methanol, 2:1, pre-cooled at –25 °C, using a Polytron homogenizer. During the 5-min extraction, the tube was partially immersed in acetone kept at –25 °C by periodic addition of dry ice. Then 6 ml of ice-cold water was added to the tube, and the extraction (Folch wash (26Folch J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was continued for 5 min. The slurry was centrifuged at 670 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The upper methanol/water phase was collected and treated with 200 μmol of methoxylamine-HCl to protect ketoacids. The lower chloroform phase was vortexed for 5 min with 10 ml of methanol/water, 3:2, pre-cooled at –20 °C. After the 20-min centrifugation, the two upper methanol/water phases were combined, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH, and evaporated in a Savant vacuum centrifuge. The residue was reacted with 100 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 10% trimethylchlorosilane (Regisil) at 70 °C for 50 min to form the TMS and methoxamate-TMS derivatives of the analytes. GC-MS Assays—Analyses were carried out on an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer, linked to a model 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an autosampler, a Varian VF-5MS capillary column (60 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter), and an EZ guard column (10 m). The carrier gas was helium (1 ml/min) with a pulse pressure of 40 p.s.i. The injection was either 1 μl split 10:1 or 2 μl splitless. The injector temperature was set at 270 °C and the transfer line at 280 °C. The GC temperature program was as follows: start at 80 °C, hold for 1 min, increase by 10 °C/min to 320 °C, hold at 320 °C for 5 min. The ion source and the quadrupole were set at 150 °C. The ammonia pressure was adjusted to optimize peak areas. For each analyte, we monitored the signals at the nominal m/z (M0) and at all detectable naturally labeled mass isotopomers (M1, M2, M3). The MID of each analyte was compared with the theoretical distribution. The electron ionization fragmentation pattern of analytes was introduced in the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) software to help with the identification and to detect interferences. The relative concentrations and MIDs of compounds of interest, identified during electron ionization runs, were assayed under ammonia positive chemical ionization conditions. Retention times and m/z monitored are listed in Ref. 27Yang L. Kasumov T. Yu L. Jobbins K.A. David F. Previs S.F. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. Metabolomics. 2006; 2: 85-94Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar. LC-MS/MS Assays—Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry of AOA adducts were performed on a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) coupled to an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The ion source was maintained at 500 °C under nitrogen nebulization at a pressure of 70 p.s.i. The heater gas (nitrogen) was at a pressure of 70 p.s.i. The curtain gas pressure was 35 p.s.i., and the collision-activated dissociation gas pressure was held at high; turbo ion spray voltage was –4,500 V. Declustering potential was –25 V; entrance potential was –10 V; collision energy was –5 V for enhanced mass spectra scans; collision cell exit potential was –11 V; and channel electron multiplier was 2,400 V. The multiple reaction monitoring pairs monitored were m/z 159.9 → 75.1 for pyruvate-AOA (CE –13), m/z 86.9 → 59.0 for pyruvate (CE –12), m/z 217.9 → 75.1 for α-ketoglutarate-AOA (CE –13), m/z 145.0 → 100.9 for α-ketoglutarate (CE –13), m/z 204.0 → 75.1 for OAA-AOA (CE –15), m/z 130.9 → 86.9 for OAA (CE –12), and m/z 90.0 → 57.9 for AOA (CE –28), with a dwell time of 40 ms. Analyst software (version 1.4.1; Applied Biosystems) was used for data registration and calibration. The autosampler cooler was maintained at 6 °C. The analyses were performed on an Aquasil C18 column (250 × 4 mm, 5 μm particle size; Thermo Electron Corp.) maintained at 40 °C. Mobile phase A was 5 mm ammonium formate (pH 8.0, adjusted with ammonia):acetonitrile (95:5, v/v). Mobile phase B was acetonitrile. For elution, initially mobile phase A was held at 100% with a starting flow rate of 0.35 ml/min for 6 min. By 1 min the aqueous phase was brought down to 25% A and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and held for 1 min. Finally the gradient was brought back to 100% mobile phase A and was held for 4 min for equilibration at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Calculations—The relative concentrations of metabolites (inhibitor versus control) were calculated (24Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol.

The formula was used to calculate relative concentrations (inhibitor versus control group). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significance was tested by independent sample t test with SPSS software. Statistical significance was set for p < 0.05. Our studies were conducted in four directions, i.e. (i) flux measurements (glucose production and release of CAC intermediates (Figs. 1 and 2)); (ii) redox indicators reflecting the [NADH]/[NAD+]ratios; (iii) comparisons of metabolite profiles by crossover analysis (28Chance B.

Each cluster of three bars shows glucose production (in nanomoles of C3·min–1·g–1), total release of CAC intermediates, and total release of glutamate + aspartate (in nanomoles·min–1·g–1). The releases of CAC intermediates, glutamate and aspartate, are detailed in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding data for groups 7 and 8 (perfusions with dimethyl [1,4-13C2]succinate ± MPA). The rates of glucose production confirm previous data as follows: (i) inhibition of GNG from lactate, pyruvate, or succinate by MPA (18Jomain-Baum M. Schramm V.L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) inhibition of GNG from lactate, but not pyruvate, by AOA (19Rognstad R. Clark D.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Ochs R.S. Harris R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 632: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in all cases (Figs. 1 and 2), the livers released CAC intermediates, of which 70% or more was α-ketoglutarate (Table 1). The other CAC intermediates released were, in decreasing order of abundance, malate, succinate, fumarate, and citrate. The livers also released glutamate (no glutamine) and aspartate, which reflect the release of CAC intermediates and proteolysis. In some cases, the release of CAC intermediates + glutamate + aspartate increased as a result of the inhibition of GNG (groups 2 and 8 versus 1 and 7). However, under all conditions, part of the gluconeogenic carbon left the liver as compounds, which, under in vivo conditions, are excreted in urine and/or are converted to glucose in the kidney (29Nishiitsutsuji-Uwo J.M. Ross B.D. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of a liver-to-kidney traffic of gluconeogenic anions. Such traffic may explain why mice lacking liver PEPCK have normal glycemia and glucose turnover (30She P. Burgess S.C. Shiota M. Flakoll P. Donahue E.P. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In these mice, compensatory renal GNG is presumably fueled in part by cataplerotic gluconeogenic intermediates released by the liver.TABLE 1Release of CAC intermediates, aspartate, and glutamate from perfused rat liversSubstrate ± inhibitorSuccinateFumarateMalateαKGCitrateGlutamateAspartate5 mm lactate control1.6 ± 0.7-0.57.5 ± 0.369.1 ± 1.50.01 ± 0.126.8 ± 11.1-0.035 mm lactate + 0.3 mm MPA4.0 ± 0.6-0.47.5 ± 0.455.6 ± 1.60.2 ± 0.232.5 ± 6.80.1 ± 0.25 mm lactate + 0.5 mm AOA6.3 ± 2.85.4 ± 1.59.9 ± 0.9108.4 ± 10.90.5 ± 0.134.2 ± 9.718.1 ± 3.42 mm pyruvate control1.6 ± 0.7-0.26.4 ± 0.681.0 ± 6.70.3 ± 0.0482.4 ± 16.80.3 ± 0.02 mm pyruvate + 0.3 mm MPA4.6 ± 0.62.5 ± 0.95.8 ± 0.594.9 ± 16.90.9 ± 0.294.5 ± 10.41.1 ± 0.12 mm pyruvate + 0.5 mm AOA1.9 ± 0.4-0.15.2 ± 0.2112.8 ± 9.60.2 ± 0.0576.1 ± 16.42.0 ± 0.80.5 mm dimethyl succinate control9.3 ± 2.70.6 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.34.9 ± 1.82.9 ± 0.435.0 ± 6.01.0 ± 0.60.5 mm dimethyl succinate + 0.3 mm MPA4.5 ± 1.06.2 ± 0.914.8 ± 0.830.0 ± 5.112.8 ± 2.140.6 ± 5.60.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab A minimum rate of pyruvate carboxylation can be calculated, in perfusions with lactate or pyruvate (Fig. 1), by adding the rates of glucose production (in C3 units) and the releases of CAC intermediates (as indicated in Fig. 1 by numbers above the first two bars of each set). A maximal rate of pyruvate carboxylation can be calculated as the sum of glucose production, release of CAC intermediates, and release of glutamate + aspartate. One cannot distinguish the production of glutamate and aspartate derived from proteolysis versus release of CAC intermediates. Although the labeling of glutamate and aspartate from NaH13CO3 was substantial, such labeling could have occurred by isotopic equilibration of amino acids derived from proteolysis with OAA and α-ketoglutarate (more on this below and in the accompanying article (41Yang L. Kasumov T. Kombu R.S. Zhu S.-H. Cendrowski A.V. David F. Anderson V.E. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21988-21996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). In any case, pyruvate carboxylation exceeded GNG by at least 10% in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 1, groups 1 and 4) and by up to 200% in the presence of an inhibitor (Fig. 1, groups 2, 3, 5, and 6). Although MPA inhibits PEPCK fairly specifically, its inhibition of GNG from lactate or pyruvate led to 6- and 3-fold decreases, respectively, in pyruvate carboxylation (Fig. 1). This effect resulted probably from the accumulation of OAA (Fig. 4, B and C, to be discussed below). In contrast, AOA had very different effects on pyruvate carboxylation in experiments with lactate (84% decrease from controls) versus pyruvate (no significant change from controls). It is likely that, in some of the conditions tested, the inhibition of GNG by MPA and/or AOA led to a decrease in the uptake of the gluconeogenic precursor lactate or pyruvate. The uptake of the precursors could not be measured in our nonrecirculating perfusions with fairly high concentrations of precursors. In conclusion, when GNG is inhibited, the modulation of pyruvate carboxylation and of the release of CAC intermediates is a multifactorial process that requires further investigation. Redox and Crossover Analyses of Metabolomic Data—Determining the relative concentrations of metabolites (inhibitor groups versus corresponding control groups) allowed calculating two relative redox ratios (Fig. 3) and performing a number of crossover analyses (28Chance B. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3036-3040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7), which confirm and expand previous studies. The tissue [αGP]/[DHAP] ratio reflects the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio in the cytosol if the activity of αGP dehydrogenase is sufficient to equilibrate the cytosolic [αGP]/[DHAP] and [NADH]/[NAD+] pools. The tissue [malate]/[OAA] ratio reflects a composite of the cytosolic and mitochondrial [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios. We were unable to measure the [β-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio, which reflects the mitochondrial [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio, because of the very low abundance of acetoacetate. The relative redox ratios shown in Fig. 3 are expressed in relation to the ratios of the lactate control group taken as 100%. The interpretation of these relative redox ratios must take into account the following. (i) They are computed from the"

Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated if mono-colonization with E. coli mpk or B. vulgatus mpk differentially modulates distribution, activation and maturation of intestinal lamina propria (LP) dendritic cells (DC). LP DC in mice mono-colonized with protective B. vulgatus mpk or co-colonized with E. coli mpk/B. vulgatus mpk featured a semi-mature LP DC phenotype (CD40loCD80loMHC-IIhi) whereas mono-colonization with colitogenic E. coli mpk induced LP DC activation and maturation prior to onset of colitis. Accordingly, chemokine receptor (CCR) 7 surface expression was more strikingly enhanced in mesenteric lymph node DC from E. coli mpk than B. vulgatus mpk mono- or co-colonized mice. Mature but not semi-mature LP DC promoted Th1 polarization. As B. vulgatus mpk promotes differentiation of semi-mature DC presumably by IL-6, mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 was investigated in LP DC. The data demonstrated that IL-6 mRNA and protein was increased in LP DC of B. vulgatus mpk as compared to E. coli mpk mono-colonized IL-2−/−-mice. The B. vulgatus mpk mediated suppression of CCR7 expression and DC migration was abolished in IL-6−/−-DC in vitro. Conclusions/Significance From this data we conclude that the B. vulgatus triggered IL-6 secretion by LP DC in absence of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 or TNF-α induces a semi-mature LP DC phenotype, which might prevent T-cell activation and thereby the induction of colitis in IL-2−/−-mice. The data provide new evidence that IL-6 might act as an immune regulatory cytokine in the mucosa by targeting intestinal DC."

Animal models have confirmed that DVD deficiency is associated with a range of altered genomic, proteomic, structural and behavioural outcomes in the rat. Because the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, in the current study we examined protein expression in this region in adult rats exposed to DVD deficiencyFemale Sprague Dawley rats were maintained on a vitamin D deficient diet for 6 weeks, mated and allowed to give birth, after which a diet containing vitamin D was reintroduced. Male adult offspring (n = 8) were compared to control male (n = 8). 2-D gel electrophoresis-based proteomics and mass spectroscopy were used to investigate differential protein expression.There were 35 spots, mapped to 33 unique proteins, which were significantly different between the two groups. Of these, 22 were down-regulated and 13 up-regulated. The fold changes were uniformly small, with the largest FC being -1.67. Within the significantly different spots, three calcium binding proteins (calbindin1, calbindin2 and hippocalcin) were altered. Other proteins associated with DVD deficiency related to mitochondrial function, and the dynamin-like proteins.Developmental vitamin D deficiency was associated with subtle changes in protein expression in the nucleus accumbens. Disruptions in pathways related to calcium-binding proteins and mitochondrial function may underlie some of the behavioural features associated with animal models of developmental vitamin D deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2006014042,"E2Fs are key regulators of cell-cycle progression, and their transcriptional activities are regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins (pRb, p107 and p130) bind to E2Fs and inhibit their transcriptional activities by disrupting HAT binding and recruitment of histone deacetylases. In this study, we show that IκB kinases (IKKα or IKKβ) activation inhibits cell growth and E2F-dependent transcription in normal human fibroblasts. The inhibition of E2F by IKKs was not observed in cells lacking nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65; however, it was observed in cells lacking three Rb family genes. p65 disrupted the physical interaction between activator E2Fs (F2F1, E2F2 and E2F3) and the HAT cofactor transactivation/transformation-domain associated protein, resulting in a reduction in E2F-responsive gene expression. Furthermore, IKKα and IKKβ directly phosphorylated E2F4, resulting in nuclear accumulation and enhanced DNA binding of the E2F4/p130 repressor complex. Our study describes a novel growth inhibitory system that functions by Rb-independent suppression of E2Fs by the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway."

Here we show that, although hepatic overexpression of PDZK1 restored normal SR-BI protein abundance and function in PDZK1 KO mice, hepatic overexpression of only the PDZ1 domain was not sufficient to restore normal SR-BI function. In wild-type mice, overexpression of the PDZ1 domain overcame the activity of the endogenous hepatic PDZK1, resulting in a 75% reduction in hepatic SR-BI protein levels and intracellular mislocalization of the remaining SR-BI. As a consequence, the plasma lipoproteins in PDZ1 transgenic mice resembled those in PDZK1 KO mice (hypercholesterolemia due to large HDL).

SR-BI is highly expressed in the liver and steroidogenic tissues (adrenal gland, ovary, and testis), which exhibit the highest levels of HDL cholesterol uptake (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landshulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Experimental manipulations of murine SR-BI expression (e.g. hepatic overexpression, homozygous null gene knock-out) can lead to changes in total plasma cholesterol levels, the ratio of plasma unesterified to total cholesterol, HDL structure, biliary cholesterol secretion, the amounts of cholesterol stored in steroidogenic tissues, and susceptibility to atherosclerosis (15Kozarsky K.F.

Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This protein, PDZK1, regulates SR-BI expression in a tissue-specific, post-transcriptional manner (32Kocher O. Yesilaltay A. Cirovic C. Pal R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52820-52825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PDZK1 is a scaffold protein containing four PDZ protein interaction domains (Fig. 1A, top), which bind to the carboxyl termini of a number of membrane transporter proteins, including ion channels (e.g. CFTR) and cell surface receptors (33Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yesilaltay A. Kocher O. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin.

Its most N-terminal PDZ domain, PDZ1, binds to the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI (31Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Unlike the four C-terminal residues in murine SR-BI (EAKL), those in SR-BII (SAMA) are not expected to bind to PDZ domains (42Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Loss of the most C-terminal amino acid of SR-BI abolishes its interaction with the PDZ1 domain of PDZK1 (36Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).PDZK1 is most highly expressed in the kidney and is also expressed, as is the case for SR-BI, in the liver and intestines but has very low expression in the adrenal gland, ovary, and testis, in which SR-BI is abundantly expressed (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landshulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 31Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Strikingly, PDZK1 knock-out (KO) mice show a dramatic, >95% decrease in SR-BI expression in the liver and a partial decrease in the small intestine but no change in steroidogenic tissues (32Kocher O. Yesilaltay A. Cirovic C. Pal R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52820-52825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the decrease in hepatic SR-BI protein, PDZK1 KO mice exhibit abnormally high plasma cholesterol levels (∼1.7-fold) transported in abnormally large HDL particles (32Kocher O. Yesilaltay A. Cirovic C. Pal R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52820-52825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These features are similar to, although not as severe as, those found in SR-BI KO mice (19Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that hepatic overexpression of an SR-BI transgene in SR-BI/PDZK1 double knock-out mice leads to SR-BI expression on the cell surface and normal function (43Yesilaltay A. Kocher O. Pal R. Leiva A. Quinones V. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28975-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, when SR-BI is on the cell surfaces of hepatocytes at steady state levels similar to those in wild-type hepatocytes, it can function normally without PDZK1 (43Yesilaltay A. Kocher O. Pal R. Leiva A. Quinones V. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28975-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PDZK1 regulates the abundance and/or localization of hepatic SR-BI in nontransgenic animals remains unclear.PDZK1 includes three PDZ domains (PDZ2, PDZ3, and PDZ4) and a 66-residue C-terminal tail (Fig. 1A), which are not involved in direct binding to SR-BI (31Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). The role(s) of these domains in the regulation of hepatic SR-BI are unknown. Nakamura et al. (35Nakamura T. Shibata N. Nishimoto-Shibata T. Feng D. Ikemoto M. Motjima K. Iso-O N. Tsukamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is possible that PDZ2, PDZ3, and/or PDZ4 bind to other, as yet unidentified, cellular components involved in SR-BI regulation. Other hepatic proteins (e.g. OATP1A1) (44Wang P. Wang J.J. Xiao Y. Murray J.W. Novikoff P.M. Angeletti R.H. Orr G.A. Lan D. Silver D.L. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30143-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have been shown to interact with the PDZK1 PDZ domains.Here we have further analyzed the influence of one of the PDZ domains of PDZK1, PDZ1, on hepatic SR-BI abundance, localization and function in vivo. We have compared the effects of transgenes encoding either the full-length PDZK1 or only the SR-BI-binding PDZ1 domain on hepatic SR-BI protein expression and plasma lipoproteins in WT and PDZK1 KO mice. We found that overexpressing full-length PDZK1 in PDZK1 KO mice restored normal hepatic SR-BI protein levels and function, yet in WT mice, it had little, if any, effect on hepatic SR-BI levels and function. However, hepatic overexpression of only the PDZ1 domain was not sufficient to restore normal SR-BI function in PDZK1-deficient mice. In addition, in WT mice, overexpression of the PDZ1 domain overcame the activity of the endogenous hepatic PDZK1, resulting in a 75% reduction in hepatic SR-BI protein levels and intracellular mislocalization of the remaining SR-BI. As a consequence the plasma lipoproteins resembled those in PDZK1 KO mice (hypercholesterolemia, large HDL). Our results suggest that the PDZ1 domain can control both the abundance and intracellular localization of hepatic SR-BI and that normal regulation of SR-BI by PDZK1 is likely to require that its other domains interact with other, as yet unidentified, cellular components.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of PDZK1 and PDZ1 Transgenic Mice—PDZK1 and PDZ1 transgenic mice were generated using the pLIV-LE6 plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. John M. Taylor (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, University of California, San Francisco). The pLiv-LE6 plasmid contains the promoter, first exon, first intron, and part of the second exon of the human apoE gene; the polyadenylation sequence; and a part of the hepatic control region of the apoE/C-I gene locus (45Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To generate the full-length PDZK1 transgenic mouse, a 2.3-kilobase DNA fragment spanning the wild-type murine PDZK1 cDNA was subcloned between the KpnI and XhoI sites of pLIV-LE6 plasmid. The PDZK1-coding region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The new construct harboring the PDZK1 gene, as well as the above mentioned apoE/apoC-I control locus elements, was linearized by SacII/SpeI digestion, and the resulting 7.3-kilobase fragment was used to generate transgenic mice using standard procedures (46Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 465-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar).To generate the PDZ1 transgenic mouse, a 400-bp DNA fragment containing the first 116 amino acids of PDZK1, including its first PDZ domain, was generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned between the KpnI and XhoI sites of pLIV-LE6 plasmid. The sequence of the resulting plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The new construct harboring PDZ1 as well as the apoE/apoC-I control locus elements was linearized by SacII/SpeI digestion, and the resulting 5.4-kilobase fragment was used to generate transgenic mice using standard procedures (46Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 465-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar).Founder animals for the PDZK1 or PDZ1 transgenes in an FVB/N genetic background were identified by PCR performed on tail DNA using the following oligonucleotide primers: full-length PDZK1 transgene, one at the 3′-end of the PDZK1 cDNA (GCAGATGCCTGTTATAGAAGTGTGC), and one corresponding to the 3′-end of the human apoE gene sequence included in the cloning vector (AGCAGATGCGTGAAACTTGGTGA); PDZ1 transgene, one located within the first PDZ domain of PDZK1 cDNA (CAATGGTGTCTTTGTCGACAAG), and the same 3′-primer used for the full length PDZK1 transgene. Founders expressing the PDZK1 or PDZ1 transgenes were crossed with PDZK1 knock-out mice (129SvEv background). Heterozygous pups expressing the PDZK1 or PDZ1 transgene were crossed with wild-type and PDZK1 knock-out mice to obtain mice with PDZK1 or PDZ1 transgene expression and nontransgenic wild-type and knock-out control mice, thus ensuring that the mixed genetic backgrounds of experimental and control mice in each founder line are matched. Genotyping of PDZK1 knock-out mice was performed as previously described (47Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Transgene expression levels were determined in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and small intestines by immunoblotting as described below. Expression was only observed in the liver and kidney, with hepatic transgene expression ∼4-fold higher than that seen in the kidney. Expression of the PDZK1 and PDZ1 transgene did not alter the undetectable level of SR-BI in the kidney.Animals—All mice on a 25:75 FVB/N:129Sv genetic background were maintained on a normal chow diet (47Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and ∼6–13-week-old male mice were used for experiments. Four PDZK1-Tg and three PDZ1-Tg founder lines were generated, all showing similar effects on plasma cholesterol levels, respectively. Observations from animals derived from two of the four PDZK1-Tg and two of the three PDZ1-Tg expressing founders were pooled, because transgene-driven protein expression levels for these two sets of founders were similar. All procedures on transgenic and nontransgenic mice were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on Animal Care.Blood and Tissue Sampling and Processing—After a 4-h fast, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1.25% Avertin, and blood was collected by heart puncture with a heparinized syringe. Plasma was separated from cells by two sequential centrifugations (15 and 10 min, 2500 × g) and stored at 4 °C prior to analysis. Tissue samples, including liver, kidney, adrenal, and small intestine were harvested and immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C. Frozen tissue was finely chopped with a blade in SDS buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and then sonicated on ice, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The protein concentrations of these lysate supernatants were then determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Lysates were then denatured at 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol immediately before fractionation by gel electrophoresis and analysis by immunoblotting.Analysis of Plasma Cholesterol and Lipoproteins—Plasma samples from individual mice were collected and analyzed for total cholesterol levels using a commercial kit (Wako Chemical USA, Inc., Richmond, VA) before and after size fractionation by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). FPLC cholesterol profiles shown are from representative individual mice. Total plasma cholesterol data from founders with similar hepatic transgene expression levels were pooled.Immunoblotting and Immunoperoxidase Analysis of Tissues—For immunoblotting, protein samples (∼30 or 1.5 μg) from total tissue lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-SR-BI antipeptide antibody (mSR-BI495–112) (1:1000) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDZK1 antipeptide antibody (1:5000–1:10,000), followed by an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; Invitrogen), and visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (catalog number RPN2132; GE Healthcare). The rabbit polyclonal anti-mSR-BI495–112 antipeptide antibody (prepared by Invitrogen) was generated using similar procedures and against the same peptide as a previously described anti-mSR-BI495 antibody and gives the same results as the anti-mSR-BI495 antibody (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landshulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 43Yesilaltay A. Kocher O. Pal R. Leiva A. Quinones V. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28975-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared against a 30-mer amino-terminal peptide from the murine PDZK1 protein sequence, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA), and affinity-purified. Immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-ϵ-COP (1:5000) (48Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or anti-actin (1:500) (Sigma) antibodies were used as loading controls. The relative amounts of proteins were determined by quantitation using an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 440 CF and Kodak 1D software. Multiple independent determinations of band intensities from serially diluted samples were made to ensure that the intensities were both in the linear range of the detector and reproducible.For immunoperoxidase analysis, livers were harvested, fixed, and frozen. Sections (5 μm) were stained with the anti-mSR-BI495–112 antibody and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, visualized by immunoperoxidase staining, and counterstained with Harris modified hematoxylin, as described previously (32Kocher O. Yesilaltay A. Cirovic C. Pal R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52820-52825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Enzymatic Digestion of Tissue Lysates—Liver lysates (30 μg of protein) from WT animals with or without the PDZ1 transgene were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and subsequently treated with 187.5 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F (in the presence of 50 mm sodium phosphate and 1% Nonidet P-40), 1250 units of endoglycosidase H (in the presence of 50 mm sodium citrate), or no enzyme at 37 °C for 3.5 h (New England Biolabs). The treated lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-mSR-BI495–112 polyclonal antibody with chemiluminescence visualization of the bands as described above.Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as the means ± S.D. Statistically significant differences were determined by either pairwise comparisons of values using the unpaired t test, with (if variances differed significantly) or without Welch's correction, or by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison post-test when comparing three or more sets of data with each other. Mean values for experimental groups are considered statistically significantly different for p < 0.05 for both types of tests.RESULTSTo determine the effects of expressing the full-length or a truncated form (PDZ1 domain) of the PDZK1 protein on hepatic SR-BI protein levels and function, we generated two cDNA constructs that encode either the full-length PDZK1 protein (designated “PDZK1-Tg”) or only the N terminus and PDZ1 domain (“PDZ1-Tg”) (Fig. 1A). These constructs were used to generate transgenic mice with liver- and kidney-specific expression in both wild-type (WT[PDZK1-Tg] or WT[PDZ1-Tg]) and PDZK1 KO (PDZK1 KO[PDZK1-Tg] or PDZK1 KO[PDZ1-Tg]) mice on a mixed FVB/129SvEv background. Transgene expression in the kidney did not alter the undetectable expression of SR-BI in this organ (see “Experimental Procedures”).Hepatic levels of PDZK1 and PDZ1 proteins in nontransgenic and transgenic mice from two founders each were determined by immunoblotting (typical result in Fig. 1B). Quantitative analysis of multiple immunoblots showed that the steady state levels of transgene-encoded proteins were greater by ∼21-fold in PDZK1-Tg-expressing and 24-fold in PDZ1-Tg-expressing mice than that of endogenous PDZK1 in WT nontransgenic mice (Fig. 1B; note there was lower total protein loading for samples from transgenic animals). Analysis by immunoblotting also showed that the levels of endogenous hepatic PDZK1 in WT[PDZ1-Tg] mice were similar to those in nontransgenic WT mice (83 ± 18% of WT levels of endogenous PDZK1; p = 0.339).Effects of the PDZK1-Tg on Hepatic SR-BI Expression and Lipoprotein Metabolism—In WT mice, hepatic overexpression of PDZK1 had little effect on the steady state levels (immunoblottin"
https://openalex.org/W2140961082,"Background Animals use carotenoid-pigments for coloration, as antioxidants and as enhancers of the immune system. Carotenoid-dependent colours can thus signal individual quality and carotenoids have also been suggested to mediate life-history trade-offs. Methodology To examine trade-offs in carotenoid allocation between parents and the young, or between skin coloration and plasma of the parents at different levels of brood demand, we manipulated brood sizes of Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). Principal Findings Brood size manipulation had no overall effect on plasma carotenoid levels or skin hue of parents, but female parents had twice the plasma carotenoid levels of males. Males work physically harder than females and they might thus also use more carotenoids against oxidative stress than females. Alternatively, females could be gaining back the carotenoid stores they depleted during egg-laying by eating primarily carotenoid-rich food items during the early nestling stage. Fledglings in enlarged broods had higher plasma carotenoid concentrations than those in reduced broods. This difference was not explained by diet. In light of recent evidence from other species, we suggest it might instead be due to fledglings in enlarged broods having higher testosterone levels, which in turn increased plasma carotenoid levels. The partial cross-foster design of our experiment revealed evidence for origin effects (genetic or maternal) on carotenoid levels of fledglings, but no origin-environment interaction. Significance These results from wild birds differ from studies in captivity, and thus offer new insights into carotenoid physiology in relation to division of parental care and demands of the brood."

TLR3 is localized in intracellular compartments, such as endosomes, and initiates signals in response to virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The TLR3 ectodomain (ECD), which is implicated in dsRNA recognition, is a horseshoe-shaped solenoid composed of 23 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Recent mutagenesis studies on the TLR3 ECD revealed that TLR3 activation depends on a single binding site on the nonglycosylated surface in the C-terminal region, comprising H539 and several asparagines within LRR17 to −20. TLR3 localization within endosomes is required for ligand recognition, suggesting that acidic pH is the driving force for TLR3 ligand binding. To elucidate the pH-dependent binding mechanism of TLR3 at the structural level, we focused on three highly conserved histidine residues clustered at the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD: His39 in the N-cap region, His60 in LRR1, and His108 in LRR3. Mutagenesis of these residues showed that His39, His60, and His108 were essential for ligand-dependent TLR3 activation in a cell-based assay. Furthermore, dsRNA binding to recombinant TLR3 ECD depended strongly on pH and dsRNA length and was reduced by mutation of His39, His60, and His108, demonstrating that TLR3 signaling is initiated from the endosome through a pH-dependent binding mechanism, and that a second dsRNA binding site exists in the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD characteristic solenoid. We propose a novel model for the formation of TLR3 ECD dimers complexed with dsRNA, which incorporates this second binding site.

To date, more than 10 functional TLRs have been reported in humans and in mice (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar). All TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins composed of an ectodomain (ECD) containing varying numbers of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) linked by a transmembrane domain to a cytoplasmic signaling Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. TLR ECDs are responsible for ligand binding; specific ligands derived from bacterial and viral constituents and their respective TLRs have been identified, including lipoteichoic acid (TLR2), lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), flagellin (TLR5), single-stranded RNA (TLR7 and TLR8), and unmethylated CpG DNA motifs (TLR9) (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar). The binding of a ligand to a TLR initiates a series of signaling processes that activate and mediate innate and adaptive immune responses (2Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). The basic mechanism of TLR signaling is thought to involve ligand-induced dimerization (3Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Weber A.N. Nat.

Toll-like receptor ectodomain leucine-rich repeat Toll/interleukin-1 receptor polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid small interfering RNA double-stranded RNA human embryonic kidney quartz crystal microbalance 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. TLR3 is activated by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I: C)), an analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as well as by viral infection-associated dsRNAs (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). TLR3 is quite distinct from other TLRs in that it is not dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88 for signaling. Upon ligand binding, the TLR3 TIR domain recruits the intracellular adaptor molecule TICAM-1, also known as TRIF (TIR-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β) (5Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 6Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The recruitment of this adaptor leads to the production of antiviral cytokines, such as IFN-β. TLR3 is specifically expressed in immune cells, such as conventional dendritic cells and natural killer cells, as well as in fibroblasts and intestinal epithelial cells (1Akira S. Uematsu S.

Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 462-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the human TLR3 ECD was recently elucidated by two groups (10Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 11Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The TLR3 ECD is a horseshoe-shaped solenoid composed of 23 LRRs, which is capped on both ends by characteristic N- and C-terminal structures, and its surface is extensively modified with N-linked glycans. However, one surface of the LRR solenoid is free from glycosylation, and the charge properties and two loops protruding from LRR12 and LRR20 on this surface are predicted to be involved in TLR3 function. Recent mutagenesis studies on the TLR3 ECD revealed that a single binding site is present on the nonglycosylated surface near the C terminus. This binding site includes His539 and several asparagines in LRR17 to −20 and is essential for TLR3 activation, suggesting a model for TLR3 recognition of dsRNA and the formation of a signaling complex (12Bell J.K.

Because the inhibition of endosomal acidification abrogates poly(I:C)-driven TLR3 activation, TLR3 is thought to be localized in intracellular compartments, such as endosomes (8Matsumoto M. Funami K. Tanabe M. Oshiumi H. Shingai M. Seto Y. Yamamoto A. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent report confirmed that TLR3 associates with c-Src tyrosine kinase on endosomes to initiate antiviral signaling (15Johnsen I.B. Nguyen T.T. Ringdal M. Tryggestad A.M. Bakke O. Lien E. Espevik T. Anthonsen M.W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3335-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that TLR3, as well as the nucleic acid-recognizing TLRs, TLR7, TLR8 (16Gibbard R.J. Morley P.J. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27503-27511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and TLR9 (17Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), resides in the endosomal membrane and that binding of each TLR to its ligand occurs in the endosomal compartment. The intracellular localization of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs seems to discriminate between self and nonself nucleic acids (18Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In addition to this function, several studies have also shown that an acidic pH within endosomes is required for TLR3 recognition of dsRNA and subsequent downstream receptor signaling (13Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Miller W. Xiong J. Russell W.K. Lamb R. Santos J. Duffy K.E. Cleveland L. Park M. Bhardwaj K. Wu Z. Russell D.H. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C.C. J. Biol.

To understand the mechanisms underlying TLR3 function and intracellular localization at the structural level, we focused our attention on conformational changes in the receptor ectodomain of TLR3, especially the ionization of histidine side chains. Because one pKa of histidine is 6.0, protonation of this group within endosomes can generate an ionic attraction to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of dsRNA. If this hypothesis is correct, then the highly conserved histidine residues clustered in the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD, namely His39 in the N-cap region, His60 in LRR1, and His108 in LRR3, may play a key role in TLR3 function in acidified endosomes. Here, we demonstrate that His39, His60, and His108 are indeed critical for human TLR3 activation and direct binding to dsRNA. This indicates that, in addition to the C-terminal binding site, there is a second dsRNA binding site in the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD characteristic solenoid. Based on these data, we propose a novel model for the formation of TLR3 ECD dimers complexed with dsRNA. Cell Culture—For the expression of plasmids encoding human TLR3 and its mutants, HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were used and cultured in DMEM cell culture medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biosource) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Sf21 cells used for baculovirus generation and protein expression were grown in suspension culture in Sf-900 II SFM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin and gentamicin). Plasmids Carrying Wild-type TLR3 and TLR3 ECD—pEF-BOS/TLR3, which consists of a human TLR3 cDNA cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEFBOS, was previously described (20Okahira S. Nishikawa F. Nishikawa S. Akazawa T. Seya T. Matsumoto M. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To obtain the recombinant TLR3 ECD protein with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen), a construct for the human TLR3 extracellular domain (residues 28-703) was generated by PCR using pEFBOS/TLR3 as a template and a 5′ primer encoding a HindIII site and a 3′ primer encoding a His6 tag, STOP codon, and HindIII site. The PCR product was cloned into the HindIII site of pFastBac1/rtTLR5S (21Tsujita T. Tsukada H. Nakao M. Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Seya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48588-48597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which contains a pFastBac1 donor plasmid backbone, resulting in the construction of pFastBac/TLR3-ECD. The protein expressed from pFastBac/TLR3-ECD contains the preprotrypsin secretion signal sequence and a FLAG tag at the N terminus. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced by PCR-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis using essentially the same procedure as described previously (22Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Human TLR3 cDNA in pEFBOS/TLR3 was mutated to produce eight mutant plasmids for a reporter gene assay: H39A, H39E, H60A, H60E, H108A, H108E, H539A, and H539E. To generate the four recombinant mutant proteins rH39A, rH60A, rH108A, and rH108E, a cDNA of the human TLR3 ECD in pFastBac/TLR3-ECD was mutated. The mutagenic primers used to mutate human TLR3 are listed in the supplemental materials (Table S1). The mutated DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing with an Applied Biosystems model 3100A automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of Recombinant TLR3 ECD and Its Mutants—Recombinant human TLR3 ECD protein (TLR3-ECD) was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). To generate the bacmid DNA encoding the TLR3 ECD, Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells were transformed with the recombinant donor plasmid pFastBac/TLR3-ECD. The isolated recombinant bacmid DNA was then transfected into Sf21 cells with UniFECTOR (B-Bridge International, San Jose, CA) to generate the recombinant baculoviruses. To express TLR3-ECD, a suspension culture of Sf21 cells in Sf-900 II SFM (Gibco) was infected by the recombinant baculoviruses, and the cell culture supernatant was harvested 5 days after infection. Subsequently, TLR3-ECD was purified using a HiTrap chelating column (5 ml size; GE Healthcare) at 4 °C and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). The dialyzed pool was concentrated using YM-50 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and TLR3-ECD was identified by immunoblotting with both anti-FLAG tag and anti-His6 tag antibodies. The four recombinant TLR3-ECD mutant proteins (rH39A, rH60A, rH108A, and rH108E) were also expressed and purified by the same procedure. This procedure produced about 50 μg of recombinant protein from 500 ml of culture medium. RNA and DNA Preparations—For the production of siRNA and dsRNA40, two transcription templates were generated by PCR by using two respective sets of primers (Table S2), which contained T7 RNA promoter sequences on each end of the template. Subsequently, siRNA and dsRNA40 were transcribed using a T7 AmpliScribe kit (Epicenter Technologies) with [α-32P]CTP. Following in vitro transcription, siRNA was prepared according to the instructions for the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion). After in vitro transcription, annealed dsRNA40 was purified in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. Corresponding, respective sense and antisense strands were used as follows: siRNA, 5′-CCUGUUCCAUGGCCAACACUU-3′ and 5′-GUGUUGGCCAUGGAACAGGUU-3′; dsRNA40, 5′-GGGAGACAGGCCUGUUCCAUGGCCAACACGUUUGUCUCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGACAAACGUGUUGGCCAUGGAACAGGCCUGUCUCCC-3′. The respective sense and antisense strands of dsRNA48, 5′-UCGAGACAGUCACAGUAUCCUCCAGCCUUACAGCCAAGUAUGAGAGCU-3′ and 5′-AGCUCUCAUACUUGGCUGUAAGGCUGGAGGAUACUGUGACUGUCUCGA-3′, were purchased as a duplex RNA from Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K. The single-stranded RNA of rC30 was synthesized using an automated DNA/RNA synthesizer (model 394; ABI). The dsDNA40, with a sequence identical to that of dsRNA40, was amplified by overlapped-PCR with primers 5′-GGGAGACAGGCCTGTTCCATGGCCA-3′ and 5′-GGGAGACAAACGTGTTGGCCATGGA-3′. The single-stranded DNA of dC30 was purchased from Texas Genomics Japan Co. Ltd. All dsRNA48, rC30, dsDNA40, and dC30 were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. For the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis, the respective sense and antisense strands of dsRNA24 (5′-end-biotinylated), 5′-CGUAGACAGUCACAGAAUGCUCCA-3′ and 5′-UGGAGCAUUCUGUGACUGUCUACG-3′, and 5′-endbiotinylated dsRNA48 were purchased as duplex RNAs from Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K. Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well). Twenty-four hours later, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transiently transfect the cells with pEFBOS/TLR3 or TLR3 mutant expression vectors (0.1 μg) together with a p125-luc reporter (0.1 μg) and a Renilla luciferase reporter (0.25 ng). The total amount of transfected plasmid (0.8 μg) was held constant by supplementing with empty vector as needed. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing poly(I:C) (10 μg/ml), and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 h. Cells were collected and washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The collected cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the cell lysates were assayed for dual luciferase activities (Promega). Data are expressed as mean relative stimulation ± S.D. for a representative experiment from three independent experiments, performed in triplicate. Western Blots—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with target expression vector (0.8 μg) as described above. After 24 h, the cells were collected, washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were obtained. The concentration of the supernatants was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Separated samples were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed with a mouse anti-TLR3 antibody (IMG315A; Imegenex Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Biosource) was used as a secondary antibody. Detection of horseradish peroxidase was carried out using a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). Filter Binding Analysis—To analyze the ability of TLR3 to bind siRNA, dsRNA40, dsRNA48, rC30, dsDNA40, and dC30, each 32P-labeled RNA and DNA (10 nm) was incubated with TLR3-ECD (20, 50, or 100 nm) in 50 μl of binding buffer (2 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6) and 5 mm MES-NaOH (pH 4.2, 5.0, or 6.0) with 100 mm NaCl and 3 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 1 h. To evaluate the binding of TLR3-ECD mutants, dsRNA40 (10 nm) was incubated with mutants (20 nm) in 50 μl of binding buffer (pH 5.0) as above. The protein-RNA complex was separated by filtration on a nitrocellulose filter (HAWP filter, 0.45 μm; Millipore) fitted in a pop top filter holder (Nucleopore), followed by a wash with 1 ml of binding buffer. Radioactivity remaining on the filter was measured using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji-Film), and the amount of RNA bound to TLR3-ECD or mutants was calculated as a percentage of the RNA input prior to filtration. QCM Analysis—QCM measurements were performed with a 27-MHz Affinix Q QCM (Initium Co.). The QCM sensor tips were directly immobilized with NeutrAvidin (100 μg/ml; Pierce) in HEPES-NaOH (20 mm, pH 7.6) and NaCl (200 mm) for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with H2O, the sensor tips were stirred (1000 rpm) at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (1.5 ml) in an incubation chamber. 5′-End biotinylated dsRNA24 or dsRNA48 (100 pmol) was added to the incubation chamber. To prevent nonspecific interactions between the sensor tip and proteins, phosphate-buffered saline was exchanged with a blocking solution (5 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.0), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.4% Block-Ace Powder (Dainippon Pharma)). TLR3-ECD was then injected stepwise into the incubation chamber containing the immersed dsRNA-coated sensor tip. The binding affinity was indicated by QCM frequency changes recorded by Affinix Q version 1.53 software (Initium), and the disassociation constant (KD) was calculated with Prism 5 version 5.0a software (Graph Pad Software Inc.). Importance of Low pH and dsRNA Length for TLR3 ECD Binding—To study the molecular recognition events and biochemical interactions between TLR3 and dsRNA, we first examined the effect of pH on the binding of recombinant TLR3 ECD (TLR3-ECD) to dsRNA. A filter binding assay for TLR3-ECD (20, 50, or 100 nm) was carried out with siRNA, dsRNA40, and dsRNA48 (10 nm) at pH 4.2-7.6 (Table 1). Binding to TLR3-ECD was undetectable or slight at pH 6.0 and 7.6. However, all dsRNAs bound strongly at lower pH, particularly at pH 4.2. Similar binding patterns were observed for dsRNA40 and dsRNA48; however, both of these interacted more efficiently with TLR3-ECD than with shorter dsRNA (i.e. siRNA).TABLE 1Analysis of the interaction between TLR3 ECD and nucleic acids under different pH conditionsTLR3-ECDBindingsiRNAdsRNA40dsRNA48rC30dsDNA40dC30nm%%%%%%pH 4.22013 ± 0.323 ± 0.824 ± 2.49.4 ± 0.39.2 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.85018 ± 0.722 ± 2.823 ± 2.010 ± 0.68.4 ± 0.24.8 ± 1.010021 ± 1.019 ± 2.021 ± 0.411 ± 1.56.9 ± 0.95.9 ± 0.3pH 5.0202.4 ± 0.618 ± 0.920 ± 1.02.9 ± 0.73.8 ± 0.32.6 ± 1.0505.7 ± 0.219 ± 2.222 ± 1.35.3 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.61008.8 ± 0.321 ± 3.324 ± 0.97.1 ± 1.25.2 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.6pH 6.020ND1.8 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.3NDND1.2 ± 0.450ND3.4 ± 0.45.7 ± 1.9NDND1.9 ± 0.9100ND8.3 ± 0.710 ± 0.1NDND2.3 ± 0.7pH 7.620NDND2.0 ± 0.3NDND2.2 ± 1.850ND0.1 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.3NDND1.6 ± 0.3100ND0.2 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.3NDND2.0 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab To examine whether TLR3-ECD could discriminate between single-stranded RNA and dsRNA structures in vitro, a filter binding assay was conducted using single-stranded RNA of rC30 under the same conditions. Although no detectable binding complex was detected at pH 6.0 or 7.6, binding of rC30 at pH 4.2 or 5.0 was moderate compared with the strong binding of dsRNA40 (Table 1). Given the preference of TLR3-ECD for dsRNA, the same approach was used to evaluate whether TLR3-ECD could recognize a DNA structure. TLR3-ECD formed a complex with dsDNA40, which encoded a sequence identical to that of dsRNA40, and the binding was sensitive to pH (Table 1). Although dsDNA40 binding was inefficient at pH 6.0 or 7.6, it was moderate at lower pH. Binding of dsDNA40 at pH 4.2 and 5.0 was markedly reduced compared with that of dsRNA40. The binding of TLR3-ECD to the single-stranded DNA of dC30 was much weaker than that to dsDNA40 and was not dependent on acidic pH (Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of TLR3-ECD with nucleic acids, especially with dsRNA, is significantly dependent on acidic pH. We used QCM to more directly characterize the effects of dsRNA length on TLR3 ECD binding in an acidic environment. This highly sensitive QCM technique detects solution phase protein-nucleic acid interactions by monitoring the linear decrease of the emitted frequency, which occurs with increasing mass on the QCM sensor tip. When the dsRNA48-coated sensor tip was used, a positive response was observed at all tested concentrations of TLR3-ECD (0-52.5 nm), with an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 19 nm (Fig. 1). Strikingly, when the sensor tip was coated with dsRNA24 and higher concentrations of TLR3-ECD were used (0-121 nm), the positive response was dramatically reduced, and the KD value could no longer be determined (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the interaction of TLR3 ECD with dsRNA highly depends on acidic pH and dsRNA length. His39, His60, and His108 Are Essential for the Ligand-dependent Activation of TLR3—To assess how TLR3 senses acidic pH for binding dsRNA, we focused on three highly conserved histidine residues clustered in the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD: His39 in the N-cap region, His60 in LRR1, and His108 in LRR3 (Fig. 2A). These histidine residues are located between the concave and nonglycosylated lateral surfaces of the TLR3 ECD structure, and all of their imidazole side chains are exposed on the outside of the protein (Fig. 2B). Because one pKa of histidine is 6.0, a pH change within the endosome from neutral to acidic protonates the imidazole group. This is thought to generate an ionic attraction between the histidine and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the dsRNA. To test our hypothesis that the N-terminal histidines are crucial for pH-dependent binding of TLR3 ECD to dsRNA, we constructed the site-specific substitution mutants H39A, H39E, H60A, H60E, H108A, and H108E and carried out a reporter gene assay to analyze how mutations in TLR3 influence TLR3 activation. TLR3-negative HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type (pEFBOS/TLR3) or mutant TLR3 expression plasmids together with a reporter plasmid containing a luciferase gene under the control of the human IFN-β promoter; the cells were then stimulated with poly(I:C). Although H108A failed to substantially abrogate the TLR3-mediated activation of luciferase activity, the H39A, H39E, H60A, H60E, and H108E mutants showed a nearly complete loss of function (Fig. 2C). The replacement of the histidine residues with glutamic acid rather than alanine had a stronger effect on TLR3 activation by poly(I:C), especially for His108. This may be due to the ionic repulsion between the glutamic acid introduced at His39, His60, and His108 and the negative charge on the phosphate backbone of the dsRNA. The mutants did not regain activity, even when 5-fold higher concentrations of the mutant TLR3 expression plasmids were employed (data not shown). This loss of activity was not due to low expression, since Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of each mutant protein was equal to or greater than that of the wild-type (Fig. 2D). Thus, His39, His60, and His108 in the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD are essential for ligand-dependent activation of TLR3. Direct Binding between His39, His60, and His108 and dsRNA—To elucidate whether these essential histidine residues directly contacted dsRNA, we analyzed the binding between recombinant mutant TLR3 proteins and dsRNA40 at acidic pH. Purified TLR3-ECD mutant proteins, rH39A, rH60A, rH108A, and rH108E, were verified by performing 8% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Fig. 3A). rH108A showed partial loss of binding (about 60% of the wild type) to dsRNA40 at pH 5.0 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, rH39A, rH60A, and rH108E exhibited remarkably diminished binding to dsRNA40 (Fig. 3, B and C). These observations clearly correlated with the results obtained in the reporter gene assay (Fig. 2C). It can therefore be concluded that the loss of function observed in the TLR3 mutants is due to their inability to recognize dsRNA and that His39, His60, and His108 are essential for the direct binding of TLR3 to dsRNA at acidic pH. Mutational analyses have identified several important residues in the TLR3 ECD that are essential for ligand recognition and signal transduction. An impressive report by Bell et al. (12Bell J.K. Askins J. Hall P.R. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) showed that His539 and Asn541 in LRR20 are crucial for the activation of TLR3. Following this report, Ranjith-Kumar et al. (13Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Miller W. Xiong J. Russell W.K. Lamb R. Santos J. Duffy K.E. Cleveland L. Park M. Bhardwaj K. Wu Z. Russell D.H. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7668-7678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) identified asparagines in LRR17 to LRR20 that also contribute to TLR3 activation. In this study, we identified three histidine residues, His39 in the N-cap region, His60 in LRR1, and His108 in LRR3, that are essential for human TLR3 activation and ligand binding. In contrast with our results, Bell et al. (12Bell J.K. Askins J. Hall P.R. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) reported that H39A and H60A had no effect on TLR3 activation. This discrepancy may be due to sensitivity differences in the cell-based assay systems used, as observed for the His539 substitution mutants. According to their report, the H539E mutation, but not the H539A mutation, resulted in almost complete loss of function. However, in our assay system, both H539E and H539A showed significant effects on TLR3 activation (Fig. 2C). Because dsRNA40 was bound to TLR3-ECD more efficiently than to the same sequence of dsDNA40, we posit that there exists a difference between forms of dsRNA (A-DNA-like form) and dsDNA (B-form) with respect to nucleic acid backbone helical structures and/or recognition of the 2′-OH group in the ribose of dsRNA (Table 1). Indeed, it has been reported that the presence of the ribose 2′-OH group in poly(I:C) is essential for its recognition by TLR3 (20Okahira S. Nishikawa F. Nishikawa S. Akazawa T. Seya T. Matsumoto M. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the efficiency of TLR3-ECD binding to dsRNA was strictly modulated by the acidic pH conditions, as shown in Table 1. These results indicate that His539 and the histidine cluster at the N-terminal region might act as pH sensors to recruit dsRNA. Once the imidazole side chains are protonated in an acidic compartment, such as an endosome, the resulting positive electrostatic potential would presumably lead to the interaction of TLR3 with dsRNA. This suggests that TLR3 signaling is initiated from within the endosome, based on a pH-dependent binding mechanism that is regulated by these functional histidine residues. Consistent with this, Ranjith-Kumar et al. (13Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Miller W. Xiong J. Russell W.K. Lamb R. Santos J. Duffy K.E. Cleveland L. Park M. Bhardwaj K. Wu Z. Russell D.H. Sarisky R.T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7668-7678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) previously reported observations from a UV cross-linking assay showing that the TLR3 ECD specifically interacts with dsRNA at acidic pH. Furthermore, Bouteiller et al. (19de Bouteiller O. Merck E. Hasan U.A. Hubac S. Benguigui B. Trinchieri G. Bates E.E. Caux C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38133-38145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have shown using a chimeric TLR3-CD32 receptor that recognition of dsRNA by TLR3 and subsequent signal transduction require an acidic pH. It is therefore likely that TLR3-dsRNA interactions occur in acidic compartments to activate signal transduction. Histidine residues on other receptors have also been implicated in acid-regulated mechanisms (23Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Doi T. Kurasawa M. Higashino K. Imanishi T. Mori T. Naito M. Takahashi K. Kawabe Y. Wada Y. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other nucleic acid-recognizing TLRs, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, are localized in acidic compartments, such as endosomes, indicating that the ligand-binding and signaling of these receptors are also likely to require acidic pH. Indeed, it has been reported that TLR9 interacts with its ligand, nonmethylated CpG DNA, at acidic pH (25Rutz M. Metzger J. Gellert T. Luppa P. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The basic mechanism of TLR signaling is thought to involve ligand-induced dimerization. In a model proposed by Bell et al. (12Bell J.K. Askins J. Hall P.R. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the TLR3 ECD contains a single ligand-binding site in LRR20 close to the C terminus, and two TLR3 monomers sandwich a dsRNA in a precisely symmetrical arrangement. Ranjith-Kumar et al. (13Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Miller W. Xiong J. Russell W.K. Lamb R. Santos J. Duffy K.E. Cleveland L. Park M. Bhardwaj K. Wu Z. Russell D.H. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7668-7678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) proposed a similar architecture for TLR3 ECD complexed with dsRNA, although they suggested a model different from that of Bell et al. (12Bell J.K. Askins J. Hall P.R. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), in which ligand binding to the TLR3 ECD induces dimerization and subsequent TIR domain activation. In this study, we revealed a second histidine-enriched binding site in the N-terminal region of the TLR3 ECD, in addition to the limited C-terminal binding site. We also found that the binding constant of dsRNA24 was much higher than that of dsRNA48 (Fig. 1). This indicates that the stability of the TLR3-dsRNA complex is affected by the dsRNA length. Although the 24-bp length of dsRNA would be sufficient for TLR3 binding if the ECD contained only the limited C-terminal binding site, the binding constants indicate that dsRNA24 affinity for TLR3-ECD is quite low compared with that of dsRNA48. Given the approximate distance between the N- and C-terminal binding sites (∼30 bp of dsRNA; gray surface in Fig. 4A), dsRNA48, but not dsRNA24, is sufficiently long to bridge the distance between the regions. These results, together with the recent report that TLR3 ECD monomers bind cooperatively to dsRNA to form stable dimeric complexes and require a dsRNA length of at least 40-50 bp to bind a single dimmer (26Leonard J.N. Ghirlando R. Askins J. Bell J.K. Margulies D.H. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that there exist two binding sites in the TLR3 ECD, which are both essential for the dsRNA recognition by the TLR3 ECD. Taking into account all of these data, we determined that a 29-bp length of dsRNA (Fig. 4A, gray surface) can lie across the two binding sites on the TLR3 solenoid, based on configuration adaptability predicted by a manual docking analysis (Fig. 4A). From this analysis, we propose a new model for the formation of symmetric TLR3 dimers (Fig. 4B). Given that the N- and C-terminal binding sites appear on the same glycosylation-free face, it would be possible to assemble at least four ternary architectural units, each composed of two TLR3s and a single dsRNA (Fig. 4B). A commonly observed feature is that two TLR3 monomers contact a dsRNA via two N- and C-terminal binding sites, so that a dsRNA is fixed at four different positions in a single unit. Although the capability to form dimers in the TIR domain is vital for subsequent signaling, the symmetric arrangement of the two TLR3 molecules can vary along the length of a dsRNA (see the legend to Fig. 4B). Communication between the two nonglycosylated faces of the TLR3 ECD separated by the dsRNA (e.g. the loop structure protruding from LRR12), might determine the exact structure of the dimer. Further biochemical analyses or determination of the crystal structure of TLR3 ECD in complex with a dsRNA will be required to determine the precise mechanism by which TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. Our study with single amino acid mutations in TLR3 demonstrates that the histidine cluster in the N-terminal region functions to recognize dsRNA based on acid-regulated mechanisms, indicating the presence of a second dsRNA binding site in the characteristic solenoid of the TLR3 ECD. This finding has led us to propose a novel dimer structure, which provides insight into the ligand recognition mechanism of TLR3. We thank K. Ito, K. Funami, and E.

https://openalex.org/W2054645912,"In this second of two companion articles, we compare the mass isotopomer distribution of metabolites of liver gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle labeled from NaH(13)CO(3) or dimethyl [1,4-(13)C(2)]succinate. The mass isotopomer distribution of intermediates reveals the reversibility of the isocitrate dehydrogenase + aconitase reactions, even in the absence of a source of alpha-ketoglutarate. In addition, in many cases, a number of labeling incompatibilities were found as follows: (i) glucose versus triose phosphates and phosphoenolpyruvate; (ii) differences in the labeling ratios C-4/C-3 of glucose versus (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate)/(dihydroxyacetone phosphate); and (iii) labeling of citric acid cycle intermediates in tissue versus effluent perfusate. Overall, our data show that gluconeogenic and citric acid cycle intermediates cannot be considered as sets of homogeneously labeled pools. This probably results from the zonation of hepatic metabolism and, in some cases, from differences in the labeling pattern of mitochondrial versus extramitochondrial metabolites. Our data have implications for the use of labeling patterns for the calculation of metabolic rates or fractional syntheses in liver, as well as for modeling liver intermediary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2058417518,"The c-Myc transcription factor is commonly dysregulated in cancer. c-Myc also sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by a variety of toxic events. c-Myc turnover is rapid and mediated by the proteasome and intracellular calpains. Therefore, c-Myc accumulation could contribute to cell death associated with protease inhibitors. We investigated the response of c-Myc-positive and c-Myc-negative rat fibroblast cells to proteasome and calpain inhibitors. Apoptosis induced by the proteasome inhibitor, epoxomycin, was c-Myc-independent, whereas apoptosis induced by the calpain inhibitor, PD150606, or by knockdown of calpain small subunit 1 (CPNS1) was strongly dependent on c-Myc. HL60 cells knocked down for c-Myc expression exhibited reduced calpain activity and decreased sensitivity to PD150606 but not epoxomycin. Calpain inhibitor- or CPNS1 knockdown-induced apoptosis in c-Myc-positive fibroblasts was associated with cell detachment and could be prevented by plating cells on fibronectin, suggesting an anoikis phenomenon. c-Myc stimulated calpain activity by suppressing calpastatin expression, the endogenous calpain inhibitor. Knockdown of calpastatin in c-Myc-negative cells led to a restoration of calpain activity, enhanced cell growth, cell cycle redistribution, anchorage independence, and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. Taken together, these results indicate that c-Myc regulates calpain activity through calpastatin; apoptosis induced by calpain inhibition is dependent on c-Myc, and calpastatin knockdown promotes transformation in c-Myc-negative cells.

Taken together, these results indicate that c-Myc regulates calpain activity through calpastatin; apoptosis induced by calpain inhibition is dependent on c-Myc, and calpastatin knockdown promotes transformation in c-Myc-negative cells. c-Myc is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates upward of 10% of all genes. c-Myc is also one of the most commonly dysregulated genes in human cancer through mechanisms as diverse as gene amplification, translocation, and mutation (1Nass S.J. Dickson R.B. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 44: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Chana J.S. Wilson G.D. Cree I.A. Alexander R.A. Myatt N. Neale M. Foss A.J. Hungerford J.L. Br. J.

Many c-Myc-regulated genes are involved in cell growth and size, protein synthesis, and metabolism highlighting the multiple contributions of this transcription factor to normal and abnormal growth. Intriguingly, c-Myc also sensitizes cells to apoptosis in response to growth factor withdrawal (3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z.

Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated, in part, through the mitochondria-associated apoptotic response and proapoptotic BCL-2 family members (6Mitchell K.O. Ricci M.S. Miyashita T. Dicker D.T. Jin Z. Reed J.C.

The transforming potential of c-Myc is therefore strongly enhanced when pro-survival molecules such as BCL-2 are also up-regulated. c-Myc is a very labile protein, with an estimated half-life of 20 min (10Hann S.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutations interfering with c-Myc degradation have been identified in tumor cells reinforcing the importance of turnover in regulating c-Myc protein levels (10Hann S.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). c-Myc degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (11Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitors represent a new class of anti-cancer agent with demonstrated efficacy in myeloma and broad activity in a range of other cancer types (12Richardson P.G. Mitsiades C. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Because c-Myc overexpression sensitizes cells to apoptosis, and the protein is subject to degradation by the proteasome, it is possible that c-Myc acccumulation could contribute to cell death associated with proteasome inhibitors. Watt and Molloy (13Watt F. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5092-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and Small et al. (14Small G.W. Chou T.Y. Dang C.V. Orlowski R.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 400: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that c-Myc is also degraded by calpains, ubiquitous Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases. However, the role of c-Myc in the cellular response to calpain or proteasome inhibition is not known. We have investigated the c-Myc dependence for cell death associated with inhibition of these proteases. Here we report that although c-Myc does not contribute significantly to apoptosis mediated by the proteasome inhibitor epoxomycin, it greatly sensitizes cells to calpain inhibitor PD150606-mediated cell death. Calpain activity is regulated by c-Myc and contributes to its growth regulatory properties. Furthermore, knockdown of the calpain negative regulator calpastatin in c-Myc-negative cells results in enhanced cell growth, emergence of anchorage independence, and tumorigenicity, suggesting that calpain promotes transformation in the absence of c-Myc. Cells and Cell Culture—c-Myc-negative rat-1-derived HO15.19 cells (c-Myc-negative) and HO15.19-derived HOmyc3 cells expressing c-Myc (c-Myc-positive) (15Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM 2The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CPNS1, calpain small subunit 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; KD, knockdown; BOC-LM-CMAC, 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin, t-BOC-l-leucyl-l-methionine amide. H21 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. All cultures contained antibiotics. Small Interfering RNA Transfection—HO15.19 and HOmyc3 cells were incubated in DMEM H21 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Transfection of siRNA was carried out by using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. The sequence for rat calpastatin was 5′-CUC CUU UGG AGA UGC UAA-3′. To maintain levels of intracellular siRNA, a second transfection was performed 5 days following the first transfection. The sequence used for rat CPNS1 was 5′-GGAGCAUGGUGGCUGUUAU-3′. Cell viability and calpain activity was measured 48 h after transfection. Growth of Cells in Semisolid Media—The ability of cells to grow in medium containing methylcellulose was tested according to procedure of Wright et al. (16Wright T.C. Ukena T.E. Campbell R. Karnovsky M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in a mixture of 10% fetal bovine serum, 90% DMEM H21, and 1.2% methylcellulose at densities of 1 × 104, 4–5 × 103, and 0.5 × 103 cells per 2 ml of medium. This mixture was layered onto a 2.5-mm plate containing 1 ml of 0.3% agar and DMEM H21 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were scored for growth after 2 weeks. Only colonies visible without magnification were counted. Apoptosis—Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PD150606 or epoxomycin (Calbiochem). After 12–18 h, cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2% FBS and stained with CY-5-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide for 15 min. Samples were analyzed in the LSR II (BD Biosciences). Adhesion Assay—1 × 106 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After overnight culture, cells were treated with 100 μm PD150606. The number of detached cells was counted with a hemocytometer after the indicated incubation times. Calpain Activity—Calpain activity was measured by flow cytometry as described previously (17Niapour M. Berger S. Cytometry. 2007; 71: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized, washed, counted, and used at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. The same cell concentration was used for HL60 cells. All measurements were performed on an LSR-II (BD Biosciences). The cells were maintained in a temperature-controlled water jacket set at 25 °C. Filters were set for the Lightwave Xcyte (UV) laser, excitation line 355 nm, and laser power 25 milliwatts, emission of 405 and 450 nm for substrate and product, respectively. Band pass filters for substrate and product were 405/20 and 450/20. Long pass filters for substrate and product were chosen at 405 and 450. The photomultiplier tube voltage was set on 350–375 for substrate and 325–350 for the product. To ensure reproducible results, the LSR-II was calibrated before each series of measurements with AlignFlow and AlignFlow plus fluorescent beads (Invitrogen). The photomultiplier tube voltage was adjusted to place the peak of the bead fluorescence histogram in the same channel prior to every experiment. The acquisition (threshold) rate of 250–280 events/s was chosen, and the sample was delivered at a low sample delivery rate. The calpain substrate BOC-LM-CMAC (10 μm unless otherwise indicated) was added after 30 s, and kinetic data were collected for the indicated time. Western Blotting—Calpains 1 and 2, calpastatin, c-Myc, and CPNS1 expression were measured by Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in triple lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 μm phosphatase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody clone 9E10, anti-calpastatin monoclonal antibody 1F7E3D10 obtained from Sigma, CPNS1-specific antibody 28239 (Abcam), or rabbit polyclonal anti-calpain 1 and 2 (Sigma). Membranes were then probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and reacted with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and signals were detected by medical film processor. The primary antibodies were used at the 1:2,000 dilutions. Measurement of Intracellular Calpastatin Levels by Flow Cytometry—105 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and then were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin for 20 min. Anti-calpastatin antibody was added for 15 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS, and the phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody was added for 15 min. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on the LSRII. Extracellular Fibronectin Staining—Cells were plated overnight on sterile coverslips and were washed twice with PBS at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h. Primary antibody against fibronectin (IST-9; Abcam) was added to each coverslip at a final concentration of 1:500, and cells were incubated for 2 h in a humidified environment. Excess antibody was washed twice with PBS, and secondary antibody was added to final concentration of 1:10,000 for 30 min. Stained cells were washed and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy (Leica Leitz DM RBE). Images were collected using the Leica Application Suite (version 2.5.0 R1) for 1.3 s. Images were cropped but otherwise unmanipulated. Lentiviral Vector Construction and Infection—The empty lentivirus vector pLEN (H1GFP), which uses the H1 promoter to drive the expression of shRNA sequences, was a gift from Dr. John Dick (University Health Network, Toronto, Canada). The sequences of the shRNAs used were as follows: human c-Myc 1330, 5′-TAA GAT GAG GAA GAA ATC GAT GTG GAT CCA CAT CGA TTT CTT CCT CAT CTT TTT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA GAT GAG GAA GAA ATC GAT GTG GAT CCA CAT CGA TTT CTT CCT CAT CTT AAT-3′; and human c-Myc 917, 5′-TAA ACG ACG AGA CCT TCA TCA AAG GAT CCT TTG ATG AAG GTC TCG TCG TTT TTT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA ACG ACG AGA CCT TCA TCA AAG GAT CCT TTG ATG AAG GTC TCG TCG TTT AAT-3′. The oligonucleotide sequences for rat calpastatin shRNA were as follows: rat calpastatin 513, 5′-TAA CAA GGT GGT TGT TAA GTC AAG GAT CCT TGA CTT AAC AAC CAC CTT GTT TTT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA CAA GGT GGT TGT TAA GTC AAG GAT CCT TGA CTT AAC AAC CAC CTT GTT AAT-3′; rat calpastatin 2088, 5′-TAA GGA TGA AGA TGC AAC ATA AAG GAT CCT TTA TGT TGC ATC TTC ATC CTT TTT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA GGA TGA AGA TGC AAC ATA AAG GAT CCT TTA TGT TGC ATC TTC ATC CTT AAT-3′. Each pair of oligonucleotides were mixed, annealed by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min, and cooled slowly. The annealed mixture was ligated into pLEN vector that had been digested with PacI and XbaI. Lentivirus vectors harboring shRNA were produced by transient transfection into 293T cells as described previously (18Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the backbone plasmid vector construct (10 μg) was mixed with the accessory plasmids VSVG (3.5 μg), pRRE (6.5 μg), and pREV (2.5 μg) and transfected into 293T cells using the Calphos mammalian transfection kit (Clontech). The cell supernatant was replaced with 4 ml of fresh Iscove's minimum Eagle's medium (10% fetal calf serum) after 24 h, and virus was harvested at 48 h after the plasmid transfection. 1 × 105 HL60 cells or c-Myc-negative rat fibroblasts were co-infected with 2 ml of lentivirus culture supernatant (∼2 × 106 virus particles) from both shRNA viruses in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) for 4 days. Green fluorescent-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and cultured in RPMI (10% fetal calf serum) for further analysis. Because knocked down cell cultures tended to regain c-Myc expression after several weeks, all analysis reported here was performed on cells knocked down within 3 weeks of infection. Cell Cycle Analysis—1 × 105 cells (c-Myc-positive cells, c-Myc-negative cells infected with lentiviral vector control, or c-Myc-negative cells infected with calpastatin-specific shRNAs 513c + 2088-1) were seeded in 6-well plates overnight in DMEM H21 supplemented with 10% FBS and then were washed twice with PBS. Cells were washed, and fresh DMEM H21 with 10% FBS was added for 16 h. Cells were trypsinized and were fixed in 70% cold ethanol. The next day, cells were resuspended in PBS, 2% FBS, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 10 units/ml RNase in the dark for 20 min. Fixed cells were examined by flow cytometry (LSRII, BD Biosciences) by initially gating on an area versus width propidium iodide dot plot, used as doublet discrimination. 10,000 cells were collected with a low flow rate (200 events/s). The data were analyzed using the Dean/Jett/Fox method of FlowJo (TreeStar) to determine cell cycle distribution. Tumor Growth—2088-1 + 513c infected c-Myc-negative cells, vector only c-Myc-negative cells, and c-Myc-positive cells were grown in the DMEM H21 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. When cells were 70–80% confluent, the cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium with no FBS to a final concentration of 1.0 × 106/ml. 3 × 104 cells were injected subcutaneously into lower flank of SCID mice, and tumor growth was followed over time. The volume of the tumor was calculated by the following formula: volume = (width)2 × length/2 every 10 days. Mice were also monitored for any signs of disease or distress. Statistics—Where reported, error bars are standard errors of duplicate or triplicate measurements. Statistical significance was determined by t tests or analysis of variance as appropriate. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001. All experiments are representative and were repeated at least twice with similar results. c-Myc-dependent Apoptosis by Calpain but Not Proteasome Inhibition—To investigate the role of c-Myc in sensitizing cells to protease inhibition, we exposed c-Myc-negative or c-Myc-positive rat fibroblasts to a proteasome or calpain inhibitor and measured induction of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1A, both the proteasome inhibitor epoxomycin and the calpain inhibitor PD150606 (19Wang K.K. Nath R. Posner A. Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert A.W.J. Marcoux F.W. Ye Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. Caner H. Collins J.L. Fergus A. Lee K.S. Lunney E.A. Hays S.J. Yuen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6687-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) induced apoptosis in c-Myc-expressing cells. However, only epoxomycin induced equivalent levels of apoptosis in c-Myc-negative cells. Apoptosis measurements at higher and lower concentrations of epoxomycin also showed no significant differences between c-Myc-negative and c-Myc-positive cells (not shown). In contrast, PD150606 had a much reduced effect in c-Myc-negative cells, inducing apoptosis significantly above background only at the highest concentration tested. This observation therefore indicates that although the ability of epoxomycin to induce apoptosis is c-Myc-independent, PD150606 induces apoptosis in a c-Myc-dependent manner. This observation prompted us to further investigate the relationship between c-Myc and calpain and calpain inhibitor-mediated cell death. Increased Calpain Activity in c-Myc-expressing Cells—Calpains are a ubiquitously expressed family of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases. Structurally, calpains consist of a large catalytic subunit of which the best known are calpains 1 and 2 (also known as μ-calpain and m-calpain), and the common small subunit CPNS1 (also known as CAPN4). Calpains are also negatively regulated by the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. As shown in Fig. 1C, calpain 2 was expressed in c-Myc-negative and -positive cells; however, the highest level of protein was observed in c-Myc-negative cells. Calpain 1 was detected in c-Myc-negative cells but not in c-Myc-positive cells. In contrast to the expression data, calpain activity was observed to be high in c-Myc-positive cells and practically undetectable in c-Myc-negative cells (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that calpains undergo autolysis (20Li H. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1691: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Franco S.J. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), which may explain the lower level of detectable protein in cells with high activity. The observation of a correlation between c-Myc expression and calpain activity further suggested that c-Myc may control calpain activity. Calpain activity is regulated, in part, through the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. As shown in Fig. 1D, calpastatin protein was detected by Western blot in c-Myc-negative cells but not in c-Myc-positive cells. A similar difference in expression was observed when intracellular calpastatin expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1E). This observation is consistent with previous gene expression profile studies that identified calpastatin as a gene negatively regulated by c-Myc (22Louro I.D. Bailey E.C. Li X. South L.S. McKie-Bell P.R. Yoder B.K. Huang C.C. Johnson M.R. Hill A.E. Johnson R.L. Ruppert J.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5867-5873PubMed Google Scholar, 23O'Connell B.C. Cheung A.F. Simkevich C.P. Tam W. Ren X. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12563-12573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and suggests that c-Myc expression may increase calpain activity through its regulation of the calpain inhibitor calpastatin. c-Myc Knockdown in HL60 Cells Leads to Decreased Calpain Activity—To further confirm the relationship between c-Myc and calpain activity in an independent cell type, we reduced c-Myc levels in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells using lentivirus-mediated shRNA and determined its effect on calpain activity. Although HL60 cells are strongly dependent on c-Myc for autonomous growth, we were able to decrease c-Myc levels significantly below control levels. As shown in Fig. 2A, c-Myc-specific shRNA reduced c-Myc protein levels by 67% compared with vector controls. Calpain activity was observed to be reduced in the knockdown cells by 71% (Fig. 2B) suggesting a direct relationship between c-Myc levels and calpain activity. When calpastatin expression was measured, we observed increased calpastatin levels in c-Myc knockdown cells (Fig. 2C) consistent with the observed decrease in calpain activity. We also observed a modest but significant increase in calpain 1 and 2 protein levels in c-Myc KD cells (Fig. 2D). This observation is consistent with accumulation of calpain protein because of decreased activity and therefore decreased autolysis. Furthermore, decreased c-Myc levels also resulted in decreased sensitivity to PD150606 (Fig. 2E) but did not alter sensitivity to epoxomycin, consistent with epoxomycin-induced cell death being c-Myc-independent. Taken together, these observations indicate that calpain activity and sensitivity to the calpain inhibitor PD150606 correlate with c-Myc levels in HL60 cells. CPNS1 Knockdown Induces Apoptosis in c-Myc-positive but Not c-Myc-negative Cells—The results described above indicate that c-Myc sensitizes cells to calpain inhibition by PD150606. To further confirm the role of c-Myc in sensitizing cells to loss of calpain activity, we treated c-Myc-positive and -negative cells with siRNA specific for CPNS1, the regulatory calpain small subunit 1. As shown in Fig. 3A, c-Myc-negative cells expressed higher levels of CPNS1 than c-Myc-positive cells, consistent with the increased levels of calpains 1 and 2 observed in these cells. As also shown in Fig. 3A, siRNA treatment resulted in significant decreases in CPNS1 protein levels. Furthermore, this loss of CPNS1 resulted in suppression of calpain activity in c-Myc-positive cells (Fig. 3B). To evaluate the consequences of CPNS1 knockdown, induction of apoptosis in c-Myc-positive and -negative cells was measured. Some cells were also incubated with PD150606, together or singly. As shown in Fig. 3C, extensive apoptosis was observed in c-Myc-positive cells treated with CPNS1-specific siRNA, whereas no apoptosis was observed in similarly treated c-Myc-negative cells. Furthermore, the combination of both siRNA and PD150606 resulted in less than additive effects on apoptosis, consistent with their targeting of a common pathway. These observations therefore support the hypothesis that c-Myc sensitizes cells to calpain inhibition. Calpastatin Knockdown in c-Myc-negative Cells Restores Calpain Activity—The results described above indicate that c-Myc regulates calpastatin expression, which may be responsible for suppressing calpain activity in c-Myc-negative cells. To confirm this mechanism, we used siRNA to knock down expression of calpastatin in c-Myc-negative cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, calpastatin-specific siRNA knocked down protein expression of the inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, with a second siRNA transfection to maintain the knockdown, this resulted in the restoration of calpain activity over a period of 5–10 days (Fig. 4, B and C). These observations therefore confirm that calpastatin is responsible for suppressing calpain activity in c-Myc-negative cells. c-Myc-negative Cells Knocked Down for Calpastatin Remain Relatively Insensitive to Calpain Inhibition—The restoration of calpain activity in c-Myc-negative cells following calpastatin knockdown raised the possibility that these cells might now exhibit sensitivity to calpain inhibition. However, as shown in Fig. 5, c-Myc-negative cells knocked down for calpastatin remained mostly resistant to apoptosis in response to PD150606. This observation indicates that c-Myc expression is required to induce a comparable apoptosis response by calpain inhibition. Fibronectin Protects c-Myc-expressing Cells from Calpain Inhibition—As described above, we observed that c-Myc-expressing cells, but not c-Myc-negative cells, exposed to PD150606 (Fig. 1A) or CPNS1-specific siRNA (Fig. 3C) underwent apoptosis. In the course of performing these experiments, we noted that c-Myc-expressing cells exposed to PD150606 detached from the plate, although c-Myc-negative cells did not. To better characterize this phenomenon, we plated c-Myc-positive and -negative cells and then exposed the cells to PD150606. We then collected the culture medium and counted the cells. As shown in Fig. 6, c-Myc-positive cells detached from the plate in increasing numbers after exposure to PD150606, although c-Myc-negative cells did not. This suggested that cell detachment was correlated with induction of apoptosis, possibly through an anoikis-based mechanism (24Gilmore A.P. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1473-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 25Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Crouch et al. (26Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696PubMed Google Scholar) had previously reported that fibronectin could protect c-Myc-expressing cells from serum withdrawal. Furthermore, a variety of proteins associated with focal adhesions, including focal adhesion kinase (27Sawhney R.S. Cookson M.M. Omar Y. Hauser J. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8497-8510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), paxillin, spectrin, and talin, are potential calpain substrates (28Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J.

Cell Res. 2004; 299: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been reported previously that c-Myc negatively regulates fibronectin expression (22Louro I.D. Bailey E.C. Li X. South L.S. McKie-Bell P.R. Yoder B.K. Huang C.C. Johnson M.R. Hill A.E. Johnson R.L. Ruppert J.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5867-5873PubMed Google Scholar, 30Coller H.A. Grandori C.

We therefore investigated whether fibronectin could protect c-Myc-expressing cells from calpain inhibition. We first confirmed that fibronectin expression was regulated by c-Myc. As shown in Fig. 7A, c-Myc-positive cells had significantly less detectable fibronectin than c-Myc-negative cells. Next, c-Myc-positive cells were incubated in plates pre-coated with fibronectin and then exposed to increasing concentrations of calpain inhibitor PD150606. We observed that cells incubated in fibronectin-coated plates did not detach from the plastic when exposed to PD150606 (not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7B, the cells were strongly protected from PD150606-induced apoptosis by fibronectin. To confirm these results, we again used siRNA to knock down expression of CPNS1 in c-Myc-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 7C, knockdown led to decreased calpain activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7D, loss of calpain activity was associated with loss of cell viability when cells were cultured in the absence of added fibronectin. In contrast, cells cultured on fibronectin maintained viability. These observations further link loss of cell adhesion with apoptosis in response to calpain inhibition. They also suggest that fibronectin-me"
https://openalex.org/W2151106442,"Unrepaired or misrepaired DNA damage has been implicated as a causal factor in cancer and aging. XpdTTD mice, harboring defects in nucleotide excision repair and transcription due to a mutation in the Xpd gene (R722W), display severe symptoms of premature aging but have a reduced incidence of cancer. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of the mutant-specific manifestation of age-related phenotypes, we used comparative microarray analysis of young and old female livers to discover gene expression signatures distinguishing XpdTTD mice from their age-matched wild type controls. We found a transcription signature of increased apoptosis in the XpdTTD mice, which was confirmed by in situ immunohistochemical analysis and found to be accompanied by increased proliferation. However, apoptosis rate exceeded the rate of proliferation, resulting in homeostatic imbalance. Interestingly, a metabolic response signature was observed involving decreased energy metabolism and reduced IGF-1 signaling, a major modulator of life span. We conclude that while the increased apoptotic response to endogenous DNA damage contributes to the accelerated aging phenotypes and the reduced cancer incidence observed in the XpdTTD mice, the signature of reduced energy metabolism is likely to reflect a compensatory adjustment to limit the increased genotoxic stress in these mutants. These results support a general model for premature aging in DNA repair deficient mice based on cellular responses to DNA damage that impair normal tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2095026676,"Germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase gene are responsible for the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). However, knowledge of the fundamental principles that determine the mutant RET-mediated signaling remains elusive. Here, we report increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP-2) in carcinomas developed in transgenic mice carrying RET with the MEN2A mutation (RET-MEN2A). The expression of MKP-2 was not only induced by RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B mutant proteins but also by the activation of endogenous RET by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). MKP-2 expression was also evident in the MKK-f cell line, which was established from a mammary tumor developed in a RET-MEN2A transgenic mouse. Inhibition of MKP-2 attenuated the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of MKK-f cells, which was mediated by the suppression of cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, we found that MKP-2 is highly expressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas derived from MEN2A patients. These findings suggest that the increased expression of MKP-2 may play a crucial role in oncogenic signaling downstream of mutant RET, leading to deregulation of cell cycle."

High RIIβ expression level in C7–14 cells is associated with elevated total PKA cellular activity and cAMP sensitivity, which consequently lead to an increased basal PKA activity. cAMP analogs that selectively activate type II PKA recapitulate the effects of forskolin of promoting apoptosis and antagonizing AKT/PKB activity in both GC-sensitive and GC-resistant clones, whereas type I PKA-selective agonists do not. Furthermore, down-regulation of RIIβ leads to increased AKT/PKB activation and enhanced GC resistance in C7–14 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1985855159,"Tune deafness (TD) is a central auditory processing disorder characterized by the inability to discriminate pitch, reproduce melodies or to recognize deviations in melodic structure, in spite of normal hearing. The cause of the disorder is unknown. To identify a pathophysiological marker, we ascertained a group of severely affected TD patients using the Distorted Tunes Test, an ecologically valid task with a longstanding history, and used electrophysiological methods to characterize the brain's responses to correct and incorrect melodic sequences. As expected, we identified a neural correlate of patients' unawareness of melodic distortions: deviant notes modulated long-latency auditory evoked potentials and elicited a mismatch negativity in controls but not in affected subjects. However a robust P300 was elicited by deviant notes, suggesting that, as in blindsight, TD subjects process stimuli that they cannot consciously perceive. Given the high heritability of TD, these patients may make it possible to use genetic methods to study cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying conscious awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2028418371,"When the left and the right eye are simultaneously presented with incompatible images at overlapping retinal locations, an observer typically reports perceiving only one of the two images at a time. This phenomenon is called binocular rivalry. Perception during binocular rivalry is not stable; one of the images is perceptually dominant for a certain duration (typically in the order of a few seconds) after which perception switches towards the other image. This alternation between perceptual dominance and suppression will continue for as long the images are presented. A characteristic of binocular rivalry is that a perceptual transition from one image to the other generally occurs in a gradual manner: the image that was temporarily suppressed will regain perceptual dominance at isolated locations within the perceived image, after which its visibility spreads throughout the whole image. These gradual transitions from perceptual suppression to perceptual dominance have been labeled as traveling waves of perceptual dominance. In this study we investigate whether stimulus parameters affect the location at which a traveling wave starts. We varied the contrast, spatial frequency or motion speed in one of the rivaling images, while keeping the same parameter constant in the other image. We used a flash-suppression paradigm to force one of the rival images into perceptual suppression. Observers waited until the suppressed image became perceptually dominant again, and indicated the position at which this breakthrough from suppression occurred. Our results show that the starting point of a traveling wave during binocular rivalry is highly dependent on local stimulus parameters. More specifically, a traveling wave most likely started at the location where the contrast of the suppressed image was higher than that of the dominant one, the spatial frequency of the suppressed image was lower than that of the dominant one, and the motion speed of the suppressed image was higher than that of the dominant one. We suggest that a breakthrough from suppression to dominance occurs at the location where salience (the degree to which a stimulus element stands out relative to neighboring elements) of the suppressed image is higher than that of the dominant one. Our results further show that stimulus parameters affecting the temporal dynamics during continuous viewing of rival images described in other studies, also affect the spatial origin of traveling waves during binocular rivalry."
https://openalex.org/W2056386124,"Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) secretes hundreds of proteins—including major virulence proteins—into the host erythrocyte. In order to reach the host cytoplasm, most P. falciparum proteins contain an N terminal host-targeting (HT) motif composed of 11 amino acids. In silico analyses have suggested that the HT motif is conserved throughout the Plasmodium species but experimental evidence only exists for P. falciparum. Here, we show that in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei (P. berghei) a reporter-like green fluorescent protein expressed by the parasite can be exported to the erythrocyte cytoplasm in a HT-specific manner. This provides the first experimental proof that the HT motif can function as a signal for protein delivery to the erythrocyte across Plasmodium species. Further, it suggests that P. berghei may serve as a model for validation of P. falciparum secretome proteins. We also show that tubovesicular membranes extend from the vacuolar parasite into the erythrocyte cytoplasm and speculate that these structures may facilitate protein export to the erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2021910315,"Background The breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA1 functions to maintain the integrity of the genome. The exact mechanisms by which it does so, however, remain unclear. The ability of BRCA1 to bind directly to DNA suggests a more direct role. However, little research has been conducted to understand the functional relevance of this characteristic of BRCA1. In this study we examine the DNA substrate specificity of BRCA1 and how this may be controlled by one of its interacting partners, p53. Methodology/Principal Findings Using competition gel retardation assays we have examined the ability of residues 230-534 of BRCA1 to discriminate between different synthetic DNA substrates that mimic those recognised by the DNA damage response i.e. four-way junction DNA, mismatch containing DNA, bulge containing DNA and linear DNA. Of those tested the highest affinity observed was for four-way junction DNA, with a 20 fold excess of each of the other synthetic DNA's unable to compete for any of the bound BRCA1 230-534. We also observed a higher affinity for C∶C and bulge containing DNA compared to linear duplex and G∶T containing DNA. BRCA1 230-534 also has interaction sites for the tumour suppressor p53 and we show that titration of this complex into the DNA binding assays significantly reduces the affinity of BRCA1 for DNA. Conclusions/Significance In this paper we show that BRCA1 can discriminate between different types of DNA damage and we discuss the implications of this with respect to its function in DNA repair. We also show that the DNA binding activity can be inhibited by the tumour suppressor p53 and suggest that this may prevent genome destabilizing events such as HR between non-homologous sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2013293176,"Parasite virulence genes are usually associated with telomeres. The clustering of the telomeres, together with their particular spatial distribution in the nucleus of human parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei, has been suggested to play a role in facilitating ectopic recombination and in the emergence of new antigenic variants. Leishmania parasites, as well as other trypanosomes, have unusual gene expression characteristics, such as polycistronic and constitutive transcription of protein-coding genes. Leishmania subtelomeric regions are even more unique because unlike these regions in other trypanosomes they are devoid of virulence genes. Given these peculiarities of Leishmania, we sought to investigate how telomeres are organized in the nucleus of Leishmania major parasites at both the human and insect stages of their life cycle. We developed a new automated and precise method for identifying telomere position in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, and we found that the telomeres are organized in clusters present in similar numbers in both the human and insect stages. While the number of clusters remained the same, their distribution differed between the two stages. The telomeric clusters were found more concentrated near the center of the nucleus in the human stage than in the insect stage suggesting reorganization during the parasite's differentiation process between the two hosts. These data provide the first 3D analysis of Leishmania telomere organization. The possible biological implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2145235651,"The steroid and xenobiotic receptor SXR (human pregnane X receptor) is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in the body's detoxification response by regulating genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. SXR ligands include a wide range of compounds, which induce transcription of SXR target genes via activation of a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of SXR and the related nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR). We investigated the effect of RXR-selective ligands, rexinoids, on SXR/RXR activity. In agreement with previous reports, we found that rexinoids are weak activators of SXR, but we also found that they can antagonize SXR activation by the potent SXR agonist rifampicin. This antagonism included suppression of rifampicin-induced expression of SXR target genes, as well as reduced binding of SXR/RXR to SXR response elements both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, two rexinoids, bexarotene (LGD1069/Targretin®) and LG100268, caused a rapid and sustained decrease in the protein levels of both SXR and RXR. The decrease in SXR level was due to an enhanced rate of protein degradation and was dependent on calpain activity, as opposed to rexinoid-induced RXR degradation, which is mediated via the proteasome. Thus, we have demonstrated a novel, rexinoid-modulated mechanism regulating SXR protein stability, which may explain why rexinoids are only weak activators of SXR/RXR-mediated transcription, despite reports that they bind to SXR with high affinity. We suggest that the ability of rexinoids to induce degradation of both SXR and RXR, in combination with competition for binding to SXR, can also explain why rexinoids antagonize the activation of SXR by drugs like rifampicin. The steroid and xenobiotic receptor SXR (human pregnane X receptor) is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in the body's detoxification response by regulating genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. SXR ligands include a wide range of compounds, which induce transcription of SXR target genes via activation of a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of SXR and the related nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR). We investigated the effect of RXR-selective ligands, rexinoids, on SXR/RXR activity. In agreement with previous reports, we found that rexinoids are weak activators of SXR, but we also found that they can antagonize SXR activation by the potent SXR agonist rifampicin. This antagonism included suppression of rifampicin-induced expression of SXR target genes, as well as reduced binding of SXR/RXR to SXR response elements both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, two rexinoids, bexarotene (LGD1069/Targretin®) and LG100268, caused a rapid and sustained decrease in the protein levels of both SXR and RXR. The decrease in SXR level was due to an enhanced rate of protein degradation and was dependent on calpain activity, as opposed to rexinoid-induced RXR degradation, which is mediated via the proteasome. Thus, we have demonstrated a novel, rexinoid-modulated mechanism regulating SXR protein stability, which may explain why rexinoids are only weak activators of SXR/RXR-mediated transcription, despite reports that they bind to SXR with high affinity. We suggest that the ability of rexinoids to induce degradation of both SXR and RXR, in combination with competition for binding to SXR, can also explain why rexinoids antagonize the activation of SXR by drugs like rifampicin.

SXR ligands comprise a structurally diverse group of compounds, including natural and synthetic steroids and many xenobiotics, such as the antibiotic rifampicin, the insulin-sensitizing drug troglitazone, the cholesterol-lowering drug SR12813, and the anti-cancer drugs paclitaxel, cisplatin, and tamoxifen (2Synold T.W.

Because activation of SXR by these drugs induces transcription of genes like CYP3A4 and MDR1, SXR is a central regulator of drug/drug interactions and may also play a role in the development of resistance to chemotherapy in tumor cells (2Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). SXR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (subfamily 1, group I, member 2) and as such is a ligand-inducible transcription factor for which transcriptional activity requires heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor, RXR (7Blumberg B. Sabbagh Jr., W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. van Meter C.M. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The SXR/RXR heterodimer binds to a variety of response elements in target gene promoters, including direct repeats (DR3–5) and inverted repeats (IR6), but the preferred binding site in vitro is βDR4 with the half site sequence AGTTCA (7Blumberg B. Sabbagh Jr., W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. van Meter C.M. Ong E.S. Evans R.M.

RXR is the common heterodimerization partner for many nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, liver X receptors (LXRs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and others (12Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar), and thus plays an important role in many diverse physiologic processes, including embryogenesis, calcium homeostasis, and lipid and glucose metabolism (13Ahuja H.S. Szanto A. Nagy L. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 2003; 17: 29-45PubMed Google Scholar, 14Szanto A. Narkar V. Shen Q. Uray I.P. Davies P.J. Nagy L. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S126-S143Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, RXR forms homodimers, and RXR agonists, or rexinoids, are thought to activate transcription of target genes predominantly via these RXR/RXR dimers. However, in the context of different heterodimers, RXR can function either as a silent receptor that does not bind rexinoids (non-permissive dimers), as an active partner that binds rexinoids and activates transcription (permissive dimers), or even as an antagonistic partner that binds rexinoids and thus inhibits activation of transcription. For example, rexinoids stimulate transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and LXR target genes through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/RXR and LXR/RXR (15Mukherjee R. Davies P.J. Crombie D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L. Hamann L.G. Boehm M.F. Mondon C.E. Nadzan A.M. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of several rexinoids to farnesoid X receptor/RXR antagonizes its activation by farnesoid X receptor ligands via reduced DNA binding and coactivator recruitment (16Kassam A. Miao B. Young P.R. Mukherjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10028-10032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the case of the SXR/RXR heterodimer, rexinoids have been shown to bind to SXR itself in vitro but only weakly activate transcription of SXR target genes in vivo (2Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 8Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors are targets of many post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which critically affect their activity and often protein stability. For example, all-trans-retinoic acid triggers ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of its cognate receptors RARα and γ (17Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C.

A. 1999; 96: 14807-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Degradation of RARγ is dependent on its phosphorylation by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and is essential for transactivation of this receptor, whereas phosphorylation of RARα inhibits its degradation (17Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Of note, all-trans-retinoic acid also triggers RXR degradation, and likewise, rexinoids stimulate degradation of both RARα and RXR via the proteasome (19Zhu J. Gianni M. Kopf E. Honore N.

Schulman I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Activation of the estrogen receptor ERα by estradiol has also been convincingly shown to involve its ubiquitin-dependent degradation, further demonstrating that regulation of protein stability can be a critical factor controlling receptor activity. Murine PXR has been reported to be a target of proteasomal degradation as well, but in contrast to RAR, RXR, and estrogen receptor, its turnover rate was shown to be significantly slower in the presence of several chemicals that bind and activate murine PXR, indicating that stabilization of this receptor may promote its activation (21Masuyama H. Inoshita H. Hiramatsu Y. Kudo T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to proteasome-mediated degradation, nuclear receptors are targets of other proteases, including calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, calpains, which tend to cleave their substrates in a limited manner and thereby modify their activity (22Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Accordingly, cleavage of the androgen receptor by calpain produces a truncated protein that acts as a ligand-insensitive, constitutively active transcription factor that may play a role in androgen-independent prostate cancer (23Pelley R.P.

Calpain cleavage of RXR has been demonstrated in liver, and the resulting 44-kDa protein has been shown to localize to the mitochondrial matrix, where it forms a heterodimer with the thyroid hormone receptor and increases mitochondrial mRNA in response to the endogenous rexinoid 9-cis-retinoic acid and the thyroid hormone T3 (25Casas F.

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of two rexinoids, bexarotene (LGD1069/Targretin®) and LG100268, on SXR/RXR activity and levels. Bexarotene is currently used as an effective treatment of early and advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have failed on other therapies. Bexarotene has been tested in several clinical trials in patients with other types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (27Govindan R. Crowley J. Schwartzberg L. Kennedy P. Williams C.

Interestingly, bexarotene has also been shown to significantly delay the development of resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs in lung, breast, and prostate cancer cells (32Yen W.C. Corpuz M.R.

McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D.E. Suto C.M. Davies J.A. Heyman R.A. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) but is not in clinical use. We report here, in agreement with previous reports (8Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), that rexinoids can weakly activate SXR-dependent transcription on their own. However, we also found that they suppress rifampicin-induced activation of transiently expressed SXR response elements, as well as induction of endogenous MDR1 and CYP3A4 expression. Importantly, in addition to causing proteasome-dependent degradation of RXR, the rexinoids were found to trigger a rapid calpain-dependent decrease in SXR protein levels, which may partially explain why rexinoids, although they bind to SXR with high affinity in competition binding assays (8Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), are not potent activators of transcription. Rifampicin, on the other hand, which is a potent activator of SXR, did not significantly affect SXR stability. We thus propose that rexinoids may antagonize rifampicin-induced SXR activation by competing for binding to SXR and by triggering degradation of the SXR/RXR transcription factor. Drugs and Reagents—Rexinoids and TTNPB were supplied by Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA). Rifampicin and SR12813 were purchased from Sigma and Biomol, respectively, and all compounds were dissolved in DMSO and stored in the dark at –70 °C. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for SXR (H-11 and H-160), RXRα (ΔN 197), c-Jun, and lamin B were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and monoclonal anti-Pgp (C-19) was from Calbiochem.

Cell Culture—LS180, HepG2, and MCF-7 cells (ATCC) were routinely maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5–10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. During all treatment experiments, cells were cultured in phenol red-free α-modified Eagle's medium with 5% charcoal-stripped serum or in serum-free medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin and holo-transferrin. Transient Transfections—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. The next day, fresh medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum was added, and the cells were cotransfected with pCMX-SXR (a kind gift from Dr. W. W. Lamph, Ligand Pharmaceuticals), reporter plasmid βDR4(LXRE)3-tk-luc (a gift from R. M. Evans, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies), and control plasmid pRL-tk (Promega), using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as specified by the manufacturer. 4–5 h post-transfection, SXR and/or RXR agonists were added, and the cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega Dual-Luciferase assay kit. Quantitative PCR—RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA, using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantification of MDR1 and CYP3A4 gene expression was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR system with TaqMan® gene expression assays Hs00184500_m1 and Hs00430021_m1, respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the endogenous control. Quantification of SXR mRNA was done using the following primers: 5′-GAAGTCGGAGGTCCCCAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTGAAAAAGCCCTTGCAT-3′ (reverse) with SYBR® Green-based detection. Primers for amplification of RXR mRNA were 5′-GGCTTCTCCGTACGATTGTCTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCCTTTGCGTGTTCCTTTT-3′ (reverse). Amplifications were performed with 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by washing the cells in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspending them in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) followed by incubation on ice, and microcentrifugation at maximum speed for 10 min to exclude insoluble material. To prepare nuclear extracts, plasma membranes were lysed on ice for 10 min in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 2% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors, followed by gentle vortexing for 10 s. Intact nuclei were pelleted by quick centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitors, and proteins were extracted on ice for 20 min. Insoluble material was excluded by microcentrifugation at maximum speed for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoretically separated in 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were immobilized by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoprobed with primary antibody followed by a secondary, peroxidase-labeled antibody. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed using the Upstate Biotechnology protocol with some modifications. 2–3 × 106 LS180 cells were used per immunoprecipitation. Protein-DNA cross-linking was achieved by incubation in formaldehyde (1%) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by glycine (0.125 m) for 10 min to stop the reaction. The cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS + protease inhibitors), followed by sonication (5 × 15 s at 20% amplitude using a Sonic dismembrator Model 500, Fisher) to shear DNA into fragments of 200–1000 base pairs. Insoluble material was pelleted by microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 16.7 mm NaCl + protease inhibitors). Samples were precleared with 60 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate Biotechnology) and subsequently incubated with two different anti-SXR antibodies (3 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology clone H-11, plus 3 μg of rabbit polyclonal, H-160) or 4 μg of anti-RXRα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, ΔN 197) or 4 μg RARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20) at 4 °C overnight. DNA-protein complexes were pulled down for 4 h at 4 °C with a mixture of protein A-Sepharose and protein G-agarose beads (GE Healthcare and Sigma, respectively) for SXR or protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate Biotechnology) for RXR and RARα. The beads were sequentially washed with wash buffer one to three as described in the protocol and twice with Tris/EDTA (pH 8). DNA/proteins were eluted in 120 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 m EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl), and cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. DNA was purified using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification was then performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR system with SYBR® Green-based detection. Primers used to amplify the region around the SXRE (DR4) in the MDR1 promoter (1Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) were 5′-TGTTCTAAAGAAATAAGTGAGTGAACG-3′ (forward) and 5-TGAACTTGTTTAATCTCAAATGAACTC-3 (reverse). Primers used to amplify the proximal promoter region were 5′-CGGGCGCTCCCTCTTACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCAGCTCATTAGCCAAATG-3′ (reverse). Amplification was performed with 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Analysis of in vitro binding of nuclear proteins (isolated as described above) or in vitro translated proteins (prepared from expression plasmids using the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega) to the 32P end-labeled, double-stranded probe 5′-gcttaagGGTTCAcgaaAGTTCActcgcat-3′ (sense), containing a βDR4 SXRE (7Blumberg B.

Protein-DNA complexes were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo 35S-Labeling Experiments—MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and transfected with FLAG-SXR (constructed by insertion of the complete SXR cDNA sequence into 3xFLAG-pCMV14) the following day. 1 day later, the cells were labeled by addition of Expre35S35S in vivo labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 100 μCi/well) to culture medium containing no methionine or cysteine. To measure protein degradation by pulse-chase analysis, cells were labeled for 3 h and then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Complete culture medium was added, and cells were incubated in the presence or absence of rexinoid (10–6 m) for up to 3 h. For the analysis of protein synthesis, cells were pulse-labeled for up to 3 h in the absence or presence of bexarotene (10–6 m). Whole cell extracts were prepared by 15–30min incubation in lysis buffer without SDS (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Equal amounts of protein (∼200 μg) were precleared with protein A-agarose for at least 1 h at 4 °C, and the cleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween at 4 °C, followed by elution of bound proteins with SDS loading buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and labeled proteins were visualized and quantified using a Cyclone phosphorimaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with Optiquant 4.0 software (Packard Instruments Co.). In Vitro Calpain Cleavage Assay—Nuclear extracts (60 μg), prepared as above and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a final volume of 30 μl, were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C in the presence of calpain-1 (1 unit; purchased from Sigma) and CaCl2 (10–3 m). The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, the proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and SXR was visualized by Western blotting. In Vivo Calpain Activity Assay—Cells were seeded on coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then treated as indicated, with addition of the fluorogenic calpain substrate t-Boc-LM-CMAC (10–5 m; purchased from Molecular Probes) during the last hour. At the end of 3 h, fluorescence was immediately visualized using a Zeiss microscope, and images were captured using equal exposure times. Statistics—Experiments were performed at least three times, and results from representative experiments are shown as means ± S.E. of the number of replicates indicated in each figure. Unpaired Student's t tests (comparing two groups, see Fig. 5) or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test (comparing more than two groups, see Figs. 1 and 2) were performed using GraphPad InStat 3.0. Significant differences compared with control (untreated cells) are indicated by * (p < 0.05) or ** (p < 0.01), and significant differences compared with rifampicin or SR12813 are indicated by # (p < 0.05) or ## (p < 0.01).FIGURE 1Rexinoids suppress activation of SXR-dependent transcription by rifampicin and SR12813. A, LS180 cells were transiently cotransfected with βDR4(LXRE)3-tk-luc and pRL-tk-luc and treated with rexinoids (10–6 m) or TTNPB (10–6 m) ± rifampicin (Rif; 5 × 10–6 m) or SR12813 (10–6 m) for 24 h (n = 3). Bex, bexarotene. B, expression of endogenous MDR1 mRNA and protein measured in LS180 cells treated as indicated (n = 3), is shown. WB, Western blotting. RQ, relative quantity. C, activation of βDR4(LXRE)3-tk-luc (left panel) and induction of MDR1 mRNA (right panel) in MCF-7 cells (n = 3) is shown. D, induction of MDR1 and CYP3A4 mRNA in HepG2 cells (n = 3) is shown. Numbers in B indicate optical density measured by densitometry and normalized to actin. #, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2Bexarotene reduces receptor occupancy at the MDR1 promoter. A, ChIP analysis of SXR occupancy on the MDR1 promoter. LS180 cells were treated with bexarotene (BEX; 10–6 m) and/or rifampicin (RIF; 5 × 10–6 m) for 18 h. B+R, bexarotene plus rifampicin; IgG, immunoglobulin G; CTL, control. Primers were designed to amplify the DR4 region known to mediate SXR regulation of MDR1 or a region proximal to the transcriptional start site (n = 6).
