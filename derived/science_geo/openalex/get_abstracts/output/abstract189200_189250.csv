https://openalex.org/W1994739812,"Thousands of the world's languages are vanishing at an alarming rate, with 90% of them being expected to disappear with the current generation1. Here we develop a simple model of language competition that explains historical data on the decline of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Quechua (the most common surviving indigenous language in the Americas) and other endangered languages. A linguistic parameter that quantifies the threat of language extinction can be derived from the model and may be useful in the design and evaluation of language-preservation programmes."

In this report, we identify GADD45b as an effector of TGF-β-induced apoptosis. GADD45b has been shown to be a positive mediator of apoptosis induced by certain cytokines and oncogenes. We show that Gadd45b is an immediateearly response gene for TGF-β and that the proximal Gadd45b promoter is activated by TGF-β through the action of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. We show that ectopic expression of GADD45b in AML12 murine hepatocytes is sufficient to activate p38 and to trigger apoptotic cell death, whereas antisense inhibition of Gadd45b expression blocks TGF-β-dependent p38 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, we also show that TGF-β can activate p38 and induce apoptosis in mouse primary hepatocytes from wild-type mice, but not from Gadd45b –/– mice. All of these findings suggest that GADD45b participates in TGF-β-induced apoptosis by acting upstream of p38 activation.

The number of cells in a particular organ is maintained through a delicate balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Precise regulation of cell division and apoptosis is required for normal morphogenesis, and alterations in these processes can lead to neoplastic transformation.

For example, TGF-β has been implicated in controlling liver size, and an intravenous injection of TGF-β induces atrophy and apoptosis in the normal and regressing liver (3Oberhammer F. Fritsch G.

Hepatic overexpression of TGF-β in transgenic mice also causes apoptosis (5Sanderson N. Factor V. Nagy P. Kopp J. Kondaiah P. Wakefield L. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Moreover, altered expression of TGF-β and its receptors in human and rodent hepatic neoplasias has been linked to apoptosis (7Jirtle R.L. Meyer S. Dig. Dis.

The TGF-β ligands signal through a heteromeric receptor complex consisting of both type I and II transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases. After TGF-β binds, the type II receptor kinase transphosphorylates and thereby activates the type I receptor kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates the cytoplasmic signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3. Receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 undergo a conformational change that allows heteromerization with a common partner, Smad4 (12Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

Current understanding of the mechanisms used by TGF-β to elicit its various cell biological effects is limited mostly to its effects on cell cycle arrest. Thus, although TGF-β-induced apoptosis is a well documented phenomenon in many different cell types, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for mediating this death process are still poorly understood. Several pro-apoptotic events, including induction of oxidative stress (20Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar), have been implicated in TGF-β-mediated apoptosis. Recently, several intracellular mediators, including apoptosis-related protein in the TGF-β signaling pathway, Daxx, death-associated protein kinase, and Src homology 2 domain-containing 5′-inositol phosphate, were shown to be involved in apoptosis induced by TGF-β (27Jang C.W.

However, the precise mechanisms whereby TGF-β signaling leads to the activation of these pro-apoptotic events are currently unknown. Using microarray analyses of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from wild-type and Smad2 and Smad3 knockout mice, we found that the mRNA level of Gadd45b is strongly up-regulated in cells treated with TGF-β for 1 h (31). Previous studies have suggested that the stress- and cytokine-inducible GADD45 family proteins (GADD45a, GADD45b, and GADD45g; also referred to as GADD45, MyD118, and CR6 as well as GADD45α, GADD45β, and GADD45γ) function as specific activators of MTK1 (also known as MEKK4), a MAPK kinase kinase upstream in the p38 pathway (32Mita H. Tsutsui J. Takekawa M. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4544-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and induce apoptosis (33Takekawa M. Saito H.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We have also suggested that specific binding of GADD45a to p38 (but not to JNK or ERK) is a potential mechanism by which GADD45a has a direct role in p38 activation by Ha-Ras (34Bulavin D.V. Kovalsky O. Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3859-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify GADD45b as an effector of TGF-β-induced apoptosis. TGF-β induces GADD45b expression in a Smad-dependent manner. We show that ectopic expression of GADD45b in AML12 cells is sufficient to activate p38 and to trigger apoptotic cell death, whereas antisense inhibition of Gadd45b expression blocks TGF-β-dependent p38 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, we also show that TGF-β can activate p38 and induce apoptosis in mouse primary hepatocytes from wild-type mice, but not from Gadd45b knockout mice. All of these findings suggest that GADD45b participates in TGF-β-induced apoptosis by acting upstream of p38 activation. Cell Cultures and Reagents—AML12 murine hepatocytes (ATCC CRL-2254, American Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenium (5 μg/ml), dexamethasone (40 ng/ml), and fetal bovine serum (10%). NIH3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658, American Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All culture media contained antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Antibodies against phospho-specific and total ERK, p38, and JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. MAPK inhibitors PD98059, SP600125, and SB203580 were from Calbiochem. All other reagents and compounds were analytical grade. Plasmid Constructs—The mouse Gadd45b promoter fragment has been described previously (35Balliet A.G. Hatton K.S. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 5′-Deletion constructs of the mouse Gadd45b promoter were made by PCR using pG118Bgl (35Balliet A.G. Hatton K.S. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as a template. PCRs were carried out with the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase. After digestion with KpnI/XhoI or MluI/XhoI, the PCR products were extracted from an agarose gel with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The purified fragments were subcloned into the pGL-3 basic vector (Promega). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—NIH3T3 and AML12 cells were plated at 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with the reporters in the presence or absence of expression plasmids using the pcDNA3 plasmid to normalize the total amount of transfected DNA and pCMV-β-gal to normalize transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the transfection medium was replaced with 0.2% fetal bovine serum-containing medium, and the cells were left untreated or were stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β. After 18 h, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. All assays were performed in triplicate. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—AML12 cells were transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged and antisense Gadd45b expression plasmid. Forty-eight h after transfection and every 3–4 days thereafter, the cells were refed with fresh selective medium containing G418 (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. Neomycin-resistant clones were first visible after 7 days and were continuously cultured in selective medium for ∼14 days. The clones were then individually transferred into 6-well plates for expansion using a cloning cylinder (Sigma). After two additional passages in selective medium, expanded independent clones were cultured in standard medium. As a mock transfection control, the pcDNA3 empty vector was used to transfect AML12 cells and selected in the presence of neomycin following the same procedure. Immunoblotting and p38 Kinase Assay—At different time periods after treatment with TGF-β, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). p38 kinase activity was determined using a p38 MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, endogenous phospho-p38 was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of cell lysates with immobilized anti-phospho-p38 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with lysis buffer and kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). p38 kinase activity was measured using 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein as substrate, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μm ATP. After the cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody. Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from AML12 cells at the indicated times using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. RNAs were separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nylon filter. and then hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe for Gadd45b. The blot was washed with SSC/SDS solutions before autoradiography. To assess the presence of sense transcripts in antisense transfectants, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript (Invitrogen) and random hexamer at 42 °C for 50 min and at 70 °C for 15 min. Following reverse transcription, the samples were incubated with RNase H for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, PCR amplification was performed as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The Gadd45b 5′-primer (cttctggtcgcacgggaagg) and 3′-primer (gctccaccgcggcagtcacc) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 5′-primer (ctcatgaccacagtccatgc) and 3′-primer (ccctgttgctgtagccaaat) were used. The RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose and stained with ethidium bromide. Apoptosis Detection—For detection of apoptosis using the TUNEL assay, cells were fixed and stained using the in situ cell death detection POD kit (Roche Applied Science) and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate solution (Roche Applied Science). The cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science), which detects internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA, was used with lysates of transfected cells according to the manufacturers' protocol. Results were read using an FL-600 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek). Preparation of Primary Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion of the liver, followed by isodensity centrifugation in Percoll. Liver was perfused for 5 min with Hanks' balanced solution without calcium and magnesium and containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.2 mm EGTA, followed by a 10–15-min perfusion with Williams' medium E containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.03% collagenase H (0.19 units/mg; Roche Applied Science). Viable hepatocytes were selected by isodensity centrifugation in Percoll and plated in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 6.25 μg/ml insulin, 6.25 μg/ml transferrin, 6.25 ng/ml selenium, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5.25 μg/ml linoleic acid, 2 mm glutamine, 30 μg/ml proline, 1 mg/ml galactose, 18 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 14 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After a 4-h attachment, the medium was changed to 0.2% fetal bovine serum-containing medium. Induction of Smad-dependent Gadd45b Expression during TGF-β-induced Apoptosis—Microarray analyses of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from wild-type and Smad2 and Smad3 knockout mice demonstrated that Gadd45b is an immediateearly response gene for TGF-β treatment because its expression is up-regulated in 30 min, peaks at 1 h, and decreases to basal levels in 4 h (31Yang Y.-C. Piek E. Zavadil J. Liang D. Xie D. Heyer J. Pavlidis P. Kucherlapati R. Roberts A.B. Böttinger E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10269-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from AML12 murine hepatocytes, which underwent apoptosis as early as 8 h after exposure to 5 ng/ml TGF-β (Fig. 1, A and B), demonstrated that Gadd45b mRNA was present in these cells and was rapidly induced after treatment with TGF-β (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether the induction of Gadd45b expression by TGF-β requires de novo protein synthesis, we assessed the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Although cycloheximide itself caused an increase in Gadd45b mRNA levels, a significant superinduction was seen in cells treated with cycloheximide and TGF-β (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Gadd45b is a primary target of TGF-β signaling. The increase in Gadd45b mRNA levels in the presence of cycloheximide was probably caused by an increase in mRNA stability or loss of transcriptional repressors by cycloheximide. The addition of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, inhibited the TGF-β-induced Gadd45b expression (Fig. 1D), indicating that up-regulation of Gadd45b expression is transcriptionally dependent. Thus, we conclude that Gadd45b is an immediateearly gene product of TGF-β in cells responsive to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. To determine whether TGF-β-induced expression of Gadd45b involves direct transcriptional activation of the Gadd45b promoter, the 5′-flanking region of the Gadd45b gene was isolated and characterized. A DNA fragment corresponding to region –4730 to +235 of the Gadd45b promoter (35Balliet A.G. Hatton K.S. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene to determine the induction of transcription from the Gadd45b promoter by TGF-β. When transfected into AML12 cells, this reporter conferred promoter activity and inducibility by TGF-β (Fig. 2A). To identify the minimum promoter region required for induction by TGF-β, a series of 5′-promoter deletion constructs was generated, and promoter activity was assessed in NIH3T3 cells because the promoter inducibility by TGF-β was higher in these cells than in AML12 cells (Fig. 2A). Deletion up to position –220 still conferred responsiveness to TGF-β. However, deletion of sequence –220 to –100 reduced TGF-β induction, and deletion up to position –1 totally abolished TGF-β induction (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest the existence of a TGF-β-responsive sequence in promoter region –220 to –1. Next, to confirm the involvement of Smad proteins in TGF-β-induced Gadd45b promoter activation, we examined the effect of overexpression of Smad proteins on the Gadd45b promoter activity in the presence or absence of exogenous TGF-β. Cotransfection of the –220/+235 reporter construct, which contains the TGF-β-responsive sequence (Fig. 2B), with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 independently resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in luciferase activity, whereas combinations resulted in an ∼5-fold increase (Fig. 2C). TGF-β enhanced the level of transactivation of the Gadd45b promoter by all overexpressed Smad proteins. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Smad2 and Smad3 completely abolished inducibility by TGF-β (Fig. 2C). Altogether, our results indicate that Smad proteins are required for TGF-β-induced Gadd45b expression. TGF-β Specifically Activates p38 in AML12 Cells, Resulting in Apoptosis—To address the role of GADD45b in TGF-β-induced apoptosis in AML12 cells, we assessed the activation of p38 and JNK because GADD45b has been shown to activate p38 and JNK and to induce apoptosis (33Takekawa M. Saito H.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). For this purpose, phospho-specific antibodies for the activated forms of p38, SAPK/JNK, and ERK1/2 were used in Western blot analyses of cell lysates. Anti-phospho-p38 antibody, which recognizes specifically the activated form of p38 phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182, revealed TGF-β-induced p38 phosphorylation 8 h after stimulation of AML12 cells, which persisted for up to 24 h (Fig. 3A). The total amount of p38 did not change during the period of observation. In contrast, TGF-β did not lead to phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK in AML12 cells, and the level of phospho-ERK did not change significantly (Fig. 3B). We also assessed the activation of JNK in the FaO rat hepatoma cell line to confirm the sensitivity of anti-phospho-JNK antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that p38 MAPK (but not JNK or ERK) was activated in TGF-β-induced apoptosis of AML12 cells. To confirm the involvement of the p38 signaling pathway in TGF-β-induced apoptosis, we investigated the role of SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38, in TGF-β-induced apoptosis in AML12 cells. Pretreatment of cells with SB203580 (1 μm) blocked the apoptotic response induced by TGF-β (Fig. 3, C and D). Consistent with the lack of induction of JNK or ERK by TGF-β in these cells, pretreatment of cells with PD98059 and SP600125, selective inhibitors of ERK and JNK, respectively, had no effect on the apoptotic response induced by TGF-β (data not shown). All of these results suggest that p38 activation is important to induce TGF-β-mediated apoptosis. GADD45b Activates p38 MAPK and Enhances TGF-β-mediated Apoptosis—Having demonstrated that Gadd45b expression is induced by TGF-β signaling through the action of Smad proteins and that p38 is activated by TGF-β, we next investigated whether ectopic overexpression of GADD45b could activate p38 and lead to apoptosis in the absence of TGF-β stimulation. To test this prediction, AML12 cells were stably transfected with a hemagglutinin-tagged Gadd45b expression plasmid or empty vector used as a control. In GADD45b-expressing cells (Gadd#2 and Gadd#4, detected by anti-hemagglutinin antibody), p38 was activated in the absence of TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4A). To assure that the enhanced levels of activated p38 represented increased p38 kinase activity, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using ATF-2 as substrate. The results show that the basal level of p38 kinase activity in Gadd#2 cells exceeded that in empty vector control cells that had been treated with TGF-β and that this activity could be enhanced slightly by treatment of the cells with TGF-β (Fig. 4B). To confirm that the induction of GADD45b is a determining factor in the sensitivity of cells to the apoptotic effect of TGF-β, we tested the ability of these cells to undergo apoptosis in the absence or presence of TGF-β. In GADD45b-expressing cells, both the basal level of apoptosis and the sensitivity to TGF-β-induced apoptosis were increased (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, our results indicate that the induction of Gadd45b expression by TGF-β is an important step in the apoptotic pathway of TGF-β. To address the question of whether endogenous GADD45b might be essential for TGF-β-mediated p38 activation and apoptosis, AML12 cells were stably transfected with antisense Gadd45b cDNA, thereby blocking expression of the endogenous Gadd45b gene. In each transfectant, Gadd45b mRNA levels were assayed by RT-PCR before and after TGF-β stimulation. Antisense Gadd45b effectively suppressed endogenous Gadd45b expression (Fig. 5A, AS#1 and AS#9). We then assessed the p38 activity in these cells using anti-phospho-p38 immunoblot analysis. Fig. 5B shows that antisense Gadd45b RNA significantly suppressed p38 activation in response to TGF-β stimulation, indicating a requirement for GADD45b expression in TGF-β-induced p38 activation. We further tested the effect of reduced GADD45b expression on apoptosis. Both the ELISA (Fig. 5C) and TUNEL stain (Fig. 5D) showed that AML12 cells transfected with antisense Gadd45b exhibited a marked reduction in their apoptotic response to TGF-β, indicating that expression of endogenous GADD45b is necessary to direct TGF-β signaling toward apoptotic end points. Finally, to determine whether GADD45b is also important for the TGF-β-induced apoptosis of primary hepatocytes, we examined the effects of TGF-β on apoptosis of primary hepatocytes from wild-type and Gadd45b-deficient mice (36Amanullah A.

Liebermann, unpublished data. TGF-β treatment of wild-type primary hepatocytes induced apoptosis, with ∼50% of the cells undergoing cell death in wild-type primary hepatocytes compared with 6% in Gadd45b-deficient primary hepatocytes (Fig. 6, A and B). p38 was also activated by TGF-β in wild-type cells, but not in Gadd45b-deficient cells (Fig. 6C). Our results demonstrate that induction of GADD45b by TGF-β is a critical and necessary prerequisite for its p38-dependent apoptotic effects in normal primary hepatocytes. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of TGF-β-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. TGF-β regulates cell growth during embryonic development and has been suggested to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in hepatocytes in a wide variety of human liver diseases (37Bedossa P. Peltier E. Terris B. Franco D. Poynard T. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 760-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Roberts R.L. Gores G.J. Prog. Liver Dis. 1998; 3: 57-83Google Scholar). Loss of TGF-β-induced apoptosis has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (39Sue S.R. Chari R.S. Kong F.M. Mills J.J. Fine R.L. Jirtle R.L. Meyers W.C. Ann. Surg. 1995; 222: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our results provide strong evidence suggesting that GADD45b is a critical upstream component in the apoptotic pathway of TGF-β in the liver. First, TGF-β rapidly induced expression of GADD45b in cells sensitive to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Second, ectopic expression of GADD45b was sufficient to trigger apoptotic death in the absence of TGF-β stimulation. Third, down-regulation of GADD45b expression with an antisense construct inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Finally, TGF-β-mediated apoptosis was strikingly reduced in Gadd45b-deficient primary hepatocytes. Altogether, these data indicate that GADD45b functions as an effector of TGF-β-dependent apoptosis. However, this does not rule out the possibility that other factors may cooperate with GADD45b in mediating TGF-β-induced cell death or, alternatively, that other cell-specific pathways might also be operat"
https://openalex.org/W2088570393,"A growing body of empirical and theoretical work supports the plausibility of sympatric speciation, but there remain few examples in which all the essential components of the process are well understood. The African indigobirds Vidua spp. are host-specific brood parasites. Indigobird nestlings are reared along with host young, and mimic the mouth markings of their respective hosts. As adults, male indigobirds mimic host song, whereas females use these songs to choose both their mates and the nests they parasitize. These behavioural mechanisms promote the cohesion of indigobird populations associated with a given host species, and provide a mechanism for reproductive isolation after a new host is colonized. Here we show that all indigobird species are similar genetically, but are significantly differentiated in both mitochondrial haplotype and nuclear allele frequencies. These data support a model of recent sympatric speciation. In contrast to the cuckoo Cuculus canorus, in which only female lineages are faithful to specific hosts, host switches have led to speciation in indigobirds because both males and females imprint on their hosts."

During wound healing, keratocytes in the corneal stroma transdifferentiate into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. In this study, molecular markers were developed to identify keratocyte, fibroblast, and myofibroblast phenotypes in primary cultures of corneal stromal cells and the structure of glycosaminoglycans secreted by these cells was characterized. Quiescent primary keratocytes expressed abundant protein and mRNA for keratocan and aldehyde dehydrogenase class 3 and secreted proteoglycans containing macromolecular keratan sulfate. Expression of these marker compounds was reduced in fibroblasts and also in transforming growth factor-β-induced myofibroblasts, which expressed high levels of α-smooth muscle actin, biglycan, and the extra domain A (EDA or EIIIA) form of cellular fibronectin. Collagen types I and III mRNAs were elevated in both fibroblasts and in myofibroblasts. Expression of these molecular markers clearly distinguishes the phenotypic states of stromal cells in vitro. Glycosaminoglycans secreted by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were qualitatively similar to and differed from those of keratocytes. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate abundance, chain length, and sulfation were increased as keratocytes became fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis analysis demonstrated increased N-acetylgalactosamine sulfation at both 4- and 6-carbons.

The corneal stroma is a dense connective tissue with a highly organized extracellular matrix responsible for the remarkable strength and light transparency of the cornea. A notable feature of this matrix is its unique proteoglycan content consisting of proteins of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SLRP, small leucine-rich proteoglycan; Gal, galactose; Gn, N-acetylglucosamine; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; FACE, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis; ALDH, aldehyde-3-dehydrogenase; β-d-xyloside, 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: SLRP, small leucine-rich proteoglycan; Gal, galactose; Gn, N-acetylglucosamine; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; FACE, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis; ALDH, aldehyde-3-dehydrogenase; β-d-xyloside, 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside. family. Lumican, a SLRP protein abundant in the stroma, has been implicated in formation of the small and highly regular collagen fibrils required for corneal transparency (1Chakravarti S. Petroll W.M. Hassell J.R. Jester J.V. Lass J.H. Paul J. Birk D.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2000; 41: 3365-3373PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosaminoglycans modifying SLRPs also appear to have a role in corneal transparency. Keratan sulfate in cornea is of higher polymer length and is at least an order of magnitude more abundant than the keratan sulfate found in other tissues (2Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, corneal chondroitin/dermatan sulfate is low in abundance and sulfate content compared with the dermatan sulfate of skin and sclera (3Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This unusual glycosaminoglycan composition has long been considered important in corneal transparency, a hypothesis consistent with several heritable disease conditions. Individuals with macular corneal dystrophy, for example, develop cloudy corneas as a result of an inability to produce keratan sulfate (4Hassell J.R. Newsome D.A. Krachmer J.H. Rodrigues M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Nakazawa K. Hassell J.R. Hascall V.C. Lohmander L.S. Newsome D.A. Krachmer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13751-13757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Hurler's and Scheie's syndromes, a lack of glycosaminoglycan-degradative enzymes results in accumulation of highly sulfated dermatan sulfate in the cornea, causing corneal opacity at an early age (6Huang Y. Bron A.J. Meek K.M. Vellodi A. McDonald B. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Quantock A.J. Meek K.M. Fullwood N.J. Zabel R.W. Can. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 28: 266-272PubMed Google Scholar). Corneal proteoglycans are also implicated in the pathology of corneal scarring. As a result of trauma or chronic corneal inflammation, the stroma develops fibrotic deposits that disrupt visual acuity. Such corneal scars are long-lasting and often constitute the cause for corneal transplantation. A number of early studies showed that corneal wound healing resulted in a reduction of keratan sulfate and in accumulation of highly sulfated chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in the scar (3Hassell J.R.

More recent studies on scars developing during the chronic stress associated with keratoconus showed a glycosaminoglycan profile similar to that occurring in acute healing (15Funderburgh J.L.

Corneal wound healing is associated with appearance in the stroma of cells with phenotypes clearly distinct from those of the normal tissue. In the normal cornea, keratocytes are flattened, quiescent, and neural crest-derived cells with a stellate morphology. Extensive cellular processes link adjacent cells via gap junctions (20Watsky M.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 2568-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Filamentous actin is confined to the cortical region and is not organized into stress fibers (21Jester J.V. Barry P.A. Lind G.J. Petroll W.M. Garana R. Cavanagh H.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 730-743PubMed Google Scholar). In response to wounding, keratocytes become motile and mitotic and develop actin cytoskeletal fibers associated with fibronectin in the extracellular matrix (21Jester J.V. Barry P.A. Lind G.J. Petroll W.M. Garana R. Cavanagh H.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 730-743PubMed Google Scholar). These fibroblastic cells also secrete metalloproteinases that are thought to initiate tissue remodeling (22Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Kublin C. Tessier M.J. Cintron C. Fini M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104 (Pt 4): 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In latter stages of healing, keratocyte-derived fibroblasts express α-smooth muscle actin incorporated into cytoplasmic stress fibers (23Jester J.V. Rodrigues M.M. Herman I.M. Am. J.

Surg. 1996; 12: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells known as myofibroblasts exhibit reduced motility and cell division compared with the repair fibroblasts and may contribute to the contractile force involved in wound closure (28Jester J.V.

Cell Res. 2000; 257: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Myofibroblastic cells appear in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and are associated with secretion of fibrotic extracellular matrix both in the cornea and in other tissues. In vitro, primary keratocytes can be maintained in serum-free or low mitogen serum-containing culture media in a quiescent state exhibiting a cellular morphology and matrix secretion similar to keratocytes in vivo (21Jester J.V.

When stromal cells are subjected to serial passage in media containing fetal bovine serum, they lose the dendritic morphology typical of keratocytes, develop actin stress fibers, and begin secretion of metalloproteinases (31Long C.J.

Cultures of quiescent primary keratocytes secrete proteoglycans similar to those found in vivo, including all three of the proteoglycans bearing keratan sulfate: lumican, keratocan, and mimecan (30Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell J.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar, 31Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh M. Smit R. Conrad G.W.

It has long been observed that keratan sulfate secretion is greatly reduced or absent in serially passaged corneal fibroblasts (36Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and we recently demonstrated that freshly isolated primary bovine keratocytes exhibit a loss of sulfated keratan sulfate-proteoglycans and an increase in sulfated chondroitin/dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans during transdifferentiation from keratocytes to myofibroblasts (35Funderburgh J.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44173-44178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) shows that myofibroblasts exhibit reduced expression of keratocan, a keratan sulfate-linked proteoglycan, and up-regulate biglycan, a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. These proteins, however, represent minor components of the total cellular proteoglycan, and the overall expression of core proteins modified by keratan sulfate and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate was not greatly altered in myofibroblasts compared with keratocytes. Incorporation of labeled sulfate into proteoglycans, however, did exhibit marked differences between the two phenotypes with chondroitin/dermatan sulfate increased and keratan sulfate decreased. This observation lead to the hypothesis that a major feature of the alteration in corneal proteoglycan profile during the phenotypic transition in wound healing arises via modulation of the structure of the glycosaminoglycan chains modifying the core proteins. The present study addresses this hypothesis by characterization of keratan sulfate and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains modifying proteoglycans secreted by stromal cells of different phenotypes. Primary non-passaged keratocyte cultures were characterized using molecular markers to identify the keratocyte, fibroblast, and myofibroblast phenotypes. Structural analyses of glycosaminoglycans secreted by the three cell types demonstrated a marked increase in chain length and sulfation of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and a reduction in both sulfation and chain length of the keratan sulfate secreted by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. These results establish the key link between cells observed in pathological corneas and specific alterations in biosynthesis of corneal glycosaminoglycans. Cell Culture—Primary keratocytes were obtained from fresh bovine corneal stromae by collagenase digestion as described previously (35Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Corpuz L. Roth M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44173-44178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cells were diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium containing antibiotics and cultured on tissue culture-treated plastic at 4 × 104 cells/cm2 (keratocytes) or 1 × 104/cm2 (fibroblasts and myofibroblasts) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Culture medium was changed after 24 h (day 1) to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium with antibiotics (35Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Corpuz L. Roth M.R. J. Biol.

These media were changed at day 4, and cultures were harvested at day 5 or 6 as noted in the figure legends. Glycosaminoglycans—Cultures were labeled with 100 μCi/ml carrier-free [35S]sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) added on day 5 and the medium collected on day 6. In some experiments, 0.5 mm 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (N2132, Sigma-Aldrich) was added 1 h before labeling. Proteoglycans in the culture medium were purified by ion-exchange chromatography, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. For chondroitin/dermatan sulfate quantitation, glycosaminoglycans from six identical 9.5-cm2 cultures were dissolved and combined to make triplicate samples of 100 μl in 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8. These samples were digested with 2 μl of chondroitinase ABC (C3667, Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 units/ml, for 2 h at 37 °C. Digested products were recovered by ultrafiltration with Microcon YM-3 microfiltration devices (Millipore). Keratan sulfate was digested in a similar manner using a mixture of 0.2 milliunits of Escherichia freundii endo-β-galactosidase and 0.2 milli-units of keratanase II (Seikagaku) in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5, at 37 °C overnight. The amount of labeled fragments liberated by digestion was determined by scintillation counting, corrected for non-digested controls, and normalized to protein content of the cells as described below. For size determination, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans were separated from total 35S-labeled proteoglycans by selective alcohol precipitation without enzymatic digestion of keratan sulfate (37Sundarraj N. Chao J. Gregory J.D. Damle S.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein was hydrolyzed with 20 μg/ml proteinase K twice for 30 min at 45 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% SDS. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from xyloside-treated cultures were analyzed in the same manner. Keratan sulfate chains were obtained from total [35S]proteoglycans by treatment with chondroitinase ABC (as above), dialysis, lyophilization, and proteinase K digestion in a similar manner. The protein-free [35S]glycosaminoglycan chains were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gels (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) or 10–20% gels (keratan sulfate), electrotransferred in buffer without methanol to Genescreen Plus-charged nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and subjected to autoradiography as described previously (35Funderburgh J.L.

Fluorophore-assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis (FACE) Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans—Non-labeled proteoglycans were purified from media of triplicate 75-cm2 cultures conditioned on days 4–6 as described above. They were digested with chondroitinase ABC in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, or with combined keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, followed by collection of the products by ultrafiltration as described above. Dried aliquots of the digestion products were fluorescently labeled with 5 μl of 0.1 m 2-aminoacridone in 3:17 acetic acid:dimethyl sulfoxide for 15 min followed by 5 μl of freshly dissolved cyanoborohydride 1 m at 37° overnight (38Plaas A.H. West L.A. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Borohydride was quenched with 30 μl of 25% glycerol and 2 μl of 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue. The derivitized digestion products were separated on 8 × 10 × 0.05-cm gels of 28.5% acrylamide, 0.76% bisacrylamide containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The running buffer was 0.089 m Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.4, chilled to 4 °C. This formulation duplicates the separation previously described for gels from Glyco Corp. (38Plaas A.H. West L.A.

Fluorescent bands were immediately photographed using a 12-bit Bio-Rad FluorS Max imaging system, and quantification was accomplished with Bio-Rad Quantity One software. FACE bands generated by chondroitinase were identified by co-electrophoresis with purified standards of fragments from chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan (Sigma-Aldrich). Monosaccharide standards for keratan sulfate analysis were purchased from Sigma. Disaccharide standards were produced by digestion of purified bovine corneal keratan sulfate (Seikagaku) with endo-β-galactosidase or keratanase II, purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-Peptide column (Amersham Biosciences), and identified by FACE analysis as described previously (38Plaas A.H. West L.A. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Molecular mass of the disaccharide keratan sulfate standards was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (39Harvey D.J. J Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 900-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Histology—Cellular morphology was observed after 2 days in cultures fixed in 100% methanol for 20 min and then stained with 1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 30 min followed by destaining in water. The cells were photographed by Brightfield optics with a ×20 objective. For cytoskeletal analysis, cells after 2 days culture were fixed in a room temperature paraformaldehyde (35Funderburgh J.L.

Cytoskeletal photographs were acquired on a Bio-Rad laser-scanning confocal microscope using a ×60 oil objective. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Cells were collected by centrifugation after scraping into cold saline, and RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion) according to supplier's protocol and then concentrated by alcohol precipitation in the presence of GlycoBlue (Ambion). RNA was quantified by fluorimetry using RiboGreen (Molecular Probes). RNA (400 ng) was transcribed to cDNA in a 100-μl reaction containing 1× PCR II buffer (Roche Applied Science), 5 mm MgCl2, 800 μm dNTP mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2.5 μm random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.4 units of RNase inhibitor, and 125 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out for 40 cycles of 15 min at 95° and 60 min at 60° after an initial incubation at 95° for 10 min in an ABI7700 thermocycler. Reaction volume was 50 μl containing 1× TaqMan Buffer A (Applied Biosystems), 5 mm MgCl2, 300 μm each dNTP, 0.025 units/ml AmpliTaq Gold polymerase, and 5 μl of cDNA. Forward and reverse primers and fluorescent internal hybridization probes for each gene, as shown in Table I, were used at optimized concentrations. Sequences for these genes were obtained from GenBank™ with the exception of that of the extra domain A form of bovine fibronectin. This information was obtained by direct sequencing of reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification products obtained from myofibroblast cDNA using primers based on published flanking sequence data. The bovine extra domain A sequence thus obtained was deposited in GenBank™ with accession number AY221633. Amplification efficiency for each of the primer pairs shown was determined to be >90%.Table IPrimers and probes for real-time RT-PCRGene nameDNA sequenceALDHGGAAGCCATCCAGTTCATCAForwardGTCTCCGCGATCATCTTCTTReverseTGGCGCTCTACGTCTTCTCACCGProbeKeratocanTGCTGGCCTTCCTTCTAGTGForwardGATGAAGGTGCTGCAGATGAReverseCAAAGGTCCCCAAAATCAGTGCProbeBiglycanTCTCAGAGGCCAAGCTCACTForwardTAGCTCGATTGCCTGGATTTReverseCAATGAACTCCACCTGGACCACAACAProbeCellular fibronectinTTGATCGCCCTAAAGGACTGForwardCATCCTCAGGGCTCGAGTAGReverseCCTGTGGGCTTTCCCAAGCAATTTProbeα-Smooth muscle actinCACTCCCTGCTCTCTTGTCTGForwardCAGAGCTTGGGCTAGGAATGReverseTGAAGGCATTATTCCACAGAACATTCACAProbe18 S ribosomalCCCTGTAATTGGAATGAGTCCACForwardGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCTReverseTGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTCProbeCollagen Ia2CAACCATGCCTCTCAGAACAForwardGCCAGTTTCCTCATCCATGTReverseCCTACCATTGCAAGAACAGCATTGCAProbeCollagen IIIGTCCTGATGGTTCCCGTAAAForwardTTCAGGATGGCAGAATTTCAReverseCCCTGCACGGAACTGCAGGGProbe Open table in a new tab For each gene/cDNA combination, amplifications without reverse transcriptase were carried out as negative controls. Amplification of 18 S ribosomal RNA was carried out for each cDNA (in triplicate) for normalization of RNA content. Threshold cycle number (C t) of amplification in each sample was determined by ABI software. Relative mRNA abundance was calculated as the C t for amplification of a gene-specific cDNA minus the average C t for 18 S expressed as a power of 2, i.e. 2ΔCt. Three individual gene-specific values thus calculated were averaged to obtain mean ± S.E. Immunoblotting—Proteoglycans from culture media collected at days 4–6 were digested with chondroitinase ABC or keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase as described above. Samples from the digests normalized for cell number (by total cell DNA content) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes subjected to immunoblotting as previously described. Keratan sulfate, biglycan, and keratocan were detected in proteoglycans pooled from 3–4 individual cultures. Biglycan was examined in chondroitinase digests and keratocan after digestion of keratan sulfate. Cell layers were lysed directly in 1% SDS sample buffer. Protein was determined using the Micro BCA assay (Pierce) and DNA by fluorimetry with PicoGreen (Molecular Probes). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, 10% gels for ALDH and α-smooth muscle actin and 4–20% for keratan sulfate and fibronectin.

https://openalex.org/W2024020458,"At the beginning of last century, Gerlach and Lehrer observed the rotational Brownian motion of a very fine wire immersed in an equilibrium environment, a gas. This simple experiment eventually permitted the full development of one of the most important ideas of equilibrium statistical mechanics: the very complicated many-particle problem of a large number of molecules colliding with the wire, can be represented by two macroscopic parameters only, namely viscosity and the temperature. Can this idea, mathematically developed in the so-called Langevin model and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem be used to describe systems that are far from equilibrium? Here we address the question and reproduce the Gerlach and Lehrer experiment in an archetype non-equilibrium system, by immersing a sensitive torsion oscillator in a granular system of millimetre-size grains, fluidized by strong external vibrations. The vibro-fluidized granular medium is a driven environment, with continuous injection and dissipation of energy, and the immersed oscillator can be seen as analogous to an elastically bound Brownian particle. We show, by measuring the noise and the susceptibility, that the experiment can be treated, in first approximation, with the same formalism as in the equilibrium case, giving experimental access to a ''granular viscosity'' and an ''effective temperature'', however anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and yielding the surprising result that the vibro-fluidized granular matter behaves as a ''thermal'' bath satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation relation."

To systematically investigate the role of TGF-β in human osteoclastogenesis, monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by three distinct approaches, resulting in either a lymphocyte-rich, a lymphocyte-poor, or a pure osteoclast precursor (CD14-positive) cell population. In each of these osteoclast precursor populations, the effect of TGF-β on proliferation, TRAP activity, and bone resorption was investigated with respect to time and length of exposure. When using the highly pure CD14 osteoclast precursor cell population, the effect of TGF-β was strongly dependent on the stage of osteoclast maturation. When monocytes were exposed to TGF-β during the initial culture period (days 1–7), TRAP activity and bone resorption were increased by 40%, whereas the cell number was reduced by 25%. A similar decrease in cell number was observed when TGF-β was present during the entire culture period (days 1–21), but in direct contrast, TRAP activity, cell fusion, cathepsin K, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression as well as bone resorption were almost completely abrogated. Moreover, we found that latent TGF-β was strongly activated by incubation with MMP-9 and suggest this to be a highly relevant mechanism for regulating osteoclast activity. To further investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the divergent effects of continuous versus discontinuous exposure to TGF-β, we examined RANK expression and p38 MAPK activation. We found the TGF-β strongly induced p38 MAPK in monocytes, but not in mature osteoclasts, and that continuous exposure of TGF-β to monocytes down-regulated RANK expression. The current results suggest that TGF-β promotes human osteoclastogenesis in monocytes through stimulation of the p38 MAPK, whereas continuous exposure to TGF-β abrogates osteoclastogenesis through down-regulation of RANK expression and therefore attenuation of RANK-RANK-L signaling.

The skeleton is a dynamic tissue that is undergoing continuous remodeling to sustain calcium homeostasis, repair microfractures, and react to strain and stress of the skeleton. The remodeling process is a complex process and relies on the coupling between bone resorption and formation that involves osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. The constant regeneration of bone emphasizes the delicate balance between bone resorption and bone formation, which, if altered, may lead to pathological conditions such as osteoporosis or osteopetrosis. The investigation of the cellular actions of the major players of bone remodeling may therefore contribute significantly to the discovery of new and better drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis (1Karsdal M.A. Larsen L.

Of particular interest for the regulation of bone turnover is the growth factors and cytokines produced in the bone microenvironment and the signal events involved in their regulation of resorption. One of many important cellular events in bone remodeling is osteoclastic bone resorption, which is preceded by osteoclastogenesis and followed by apoptosis. The life, function, and death of osteoclasts are known to be influenced at many different levels by a variety of growth factors, including but not restricted to M-CSF, 1The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; R-M-CSF, M-CSF receptor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CTX, C-terminal type I collagen fragment(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.1The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; R-M-CSF, M-CSF receptor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CTX, C-terminal type I collagen fragment(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. vascular endothelial growth factor, parathyroid hormone, TGF-β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (2Lee S.E.

TGF-β is by far the most abundant cytokine in bone, and by its mere abundance in bone, 200 μg/kg tissue, must be considered as a central player in bone turnover (10Bonewald L.F. Mundy G.R. Clin. Orthop. 1990; 250: 261-276PubMed Google Scholar) and potentially able to couple bone resorption with bone formation (11Karsdal M.A. Fjording M.S. Foged N.T. Delaisse J.M. Lochter A. J. Biol.

TGF-β is unique among growth factors in its potent and widespread actions. Almost every cell in the body has been shown to make some form of TGF-β, and almost every cell has receptors for TGF-β (14Dallas S.L. Rosser J.L. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. Biol.

Therefore, it becomes apparent that the mechanisms of actions of TGF-β are extensive and complex and that TGF-β possesses multifunctional biological activities. Restricted to the bone environment, target cells include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, their precursors as well as bone marrow and stromal cells (1Karsdal M.A. Larsen L. Engsig M.T. Lou H. Ferreras M.

TGF-β1 knockout mice display an about 30% decrease in tibia length and a reduction in bone mineral content (17Geiser A.G. Zeng Q.Q. Sato M. Helvering L.M. Hirano T. Turner C.H. Bone. 1998; 23: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In vivo studies involving exogenously administered recombinant TGF-β show that TGF-β increases bone formation and promotes fracture healing (18Rosier R.N. O'Keefe R.J. Hicks D.G. Clin. Orthop. 1998; 355: S294-S300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β is a part of the “vicious cycle” of developing osteolytic bone metastasis and giant cell tumors of bone (19Mundy G.R. Cancer. 1997; 80: 1546-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin.

At the cellular level, it is well established that TGF-β both stimulates and inhibits bone formation, most likely through different actions of TGF-β at unique stages of osteoblast maturation (1Karsdal M.A. Larsen L.

Since this molecule influences most if not all cells of the bone and their precursors, highly controlled and pure cell culture systems must be used when evaluating the direct molecular mechanism elicited by TGF-β. Most importantly, complex and heterogeneous cell culture systems make accurate assessment of the direct effect of TGF-β virtually impossible, since TGF-β stimulates, for example, osteoprotegerin and other factors in stromal cells that indirectly inhibit osteoclastogenesis (31Thirunavukkarasu K. Miles R.R. Halladay D.L. Yang X. Galvin R.J. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. J. Biol.

Thus, since TGF-β exerts pleiotropic effects on a large range of bone cells, this has hampered the molecular understanding of the exact role of this growth factor. The study of the direct effect of TGF-β on human osteoclastogenesis has been extremely limited because of technical difficulties with obtaining human osteoclasts in culture. However, with the recently established technique of peripheral blood monocyte purification followed by in vitro differentiation into mature osteoclasts, the possibility of investigating the direct effects of TGF-β on human osteoclastogenesis has been enabled. However, this approach results in a highly heterogeneous cell population consisting of, among other cells, T-cells, B-cells, and osteoclast precursors. This procedure has been further refined by the finding that the osteoclasts precursors reside in the CD14-positive population (33Shalhoub V. Elliott G. Chiu L. Manoukian R. Kelley M. Hawkins N. Davy E. Shimamoto G. Beck J. Kaufman S.A. Van G. Scully S. Qi M. Grisanti M. Dunstan C. Boyle W.J. Lacey D.L. Br. J.

In this study, we systematically describe the effect of TGF-β on three different populations of osteoclast precursors, namely in a lymphocyte-rich, lymphocyte-poor, and pure CD14 population of cells. We describe in depth the new CD14 cell culture system for obtaining a highly pure source of human osteoclast precursors and use this specific system to assess the direct effects of TGF-β on osteoclastogenesis. We investigate the effect of TGF-β that clearly is dependent on time and length of addition as well as both biological context and stage of osteoclastogenesis. We find that TGF-β modulates all of the osteoclastic phenotypes investigated (i.e. proliferation, fusion, TRAP activity, cathepsin K, and MMP-9 expression) as well as the resorptive activity itself. By further investigation of TGF-β-controlled osteoclastogenesis, we found that TGF-β potently induced p38 MAPK and regulated RANK expression, and we therefore present data suggesting how TGF-β can modulate human osteoclastogenesis. Cell Culture—Isolation of CD-14-positive monocytes with primary coated Dynabeads M-450 (111.11 Dynal Biotech) was as follows. Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood, obtained from healthy volunteers both male and female in the age range of 18–67 years. In the present studies, we did not observe differences between age and sex; however, the design was not optimized to investigate such effects. The blood was diluted 1:1 with PBS (catalog no. BE17-512F; Bio-Whittaker). The blood/PBS was carefully layered on the on Ficoll-Paque (catalog no. 17-1440-03; Amersham Biosciences). This gradient was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. The lymphocytes were collected from the interface between the plasma and the Ficoll-Paque and washed with ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 12 min. The wash was repeated twice, after which the cells were resuspended with cold PBS containing 2% serum (catalog no. S0415; Biochrom). The cells were kept on ice while the preparation of beads was done. For 300 million cells, 125 μl of beads (10 million beads) were used (Dynal Biotech). The tube was placed with the beads and ice-cold PBS in the magnetic device (Dynal Biotech) for 2 min, after which the supernatant was discarded. This wash was repeated three times. 300 million cells were added to the beads and incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end homogenization for 20 min. After the incubation at 4 °C, the tube was placed in the magnetic device for 2 min, after which the supernatant was discarded. Thereafter, 5 ml of PBS containing 2% serum was added, following which the beads were gently resuspended. The tube was placed in the magnetic device for 2 min. This wash was repeated at least five times. Finally, the cells were resuspended in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were seeded in 75-cm2 bottles and cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 ng/ml M-CSF (catalog no. 216-MC; R&D Systems), 25 ng/ml Rank Ligand (catalog no. 310-01; Peprotech), or TRANCE (catalog no. 390-TN; R&D Systems). After 3 days, the cells were washed with PBS twice. Hereafter trypsin was added, and the cells and trypsin were incubated at 37 °C for approximately 20 min. The cells were scraped off and reseeded as indicated. The cells were cultured as described above in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 ng/ml M-CSF (catalog no. 216-MC; R&D Systems), and 25 ng/ml Rank Ligand (catalog no. 310-01; Peprotech) or TRANCE (catalog no. 390-TN; R&D Systems). TGF-β1 (catalog no. 100-B-010; R&D Systems) was used when indicated at 10 ng/ml. To quantify the cell number, the AlamarBlue assay (Trek Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. TRAP Assay—At the end of each culture period, TRAP activity was measured in the conditioned media by adding a colorimetric substrate, 6 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, in the presence of 25 mm sodium tartrate at pH 5.5. The reaction products were quantified by measuring optical absorbance at 405 nm. Enzyme Assays—Human pro-MMP-2 was a kind gift from Drs. F. Frankenne and J. M. Foidart (University of Liege, Belgium). Mouse pro-MMP-9 was purified from cell culture media of transformed baby hamster kidney cells, by means of two consecutive chromatographic steps on gelatin-Sepharose and concanavalin A-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) (47Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Pro-MMPs were activated with 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate. The molar concentration of active MMPs (48Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was determined by using the MMP inhibitor BB94 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Van Wart; Roche Applied Science). Latent TGF was incubated with 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate-activated MMP for 5 or 24 h unless otherwise indicated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij, pH 7.5). Activation of latent TGF-β was followed by Western blotting. Bone Resorption—Bone resorption was measured by formation of resorption pits. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD14-positive cells were cultured for the indicated time periods before adherent cells were scraped gently off with a cotton swab and bone slices were washed in distilled water. Resorption pits were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and subsequently washed. Resorbed bone area was measured using CAST-GRID software (Microsoft Corp., Olympus, WA), and results are expressed as resorbed bone area in percentage of total bone. The measurement of C-terminal type I collagen fragments (CTX) release from bone slices was performed by the CrossLaps for culture ELISA kit (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics), which was used according to the manufacture's instructions. Cell Fusion—Cell fusion was determined of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differentiated CD14-positive cells cultured for 7 days in the presence of factors as indicated. After culture, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and methanol, each for 5 min, and incubated in Wright-Giemsa solution (1% of Wright solution and 10% of Giemsa solution diluted in water) for 10 min at room temperature. Cell fusion, as measured by cells with three or more nuclei, was determined under a light microscope using CAST-GRID software (Microsoft). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed on total cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 mm NaF and 50 mm Na3VO4. Equal protein levels were determined and adjusted by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay according to the manufacturer's descriptions. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After blotting, equal and sufficient loading was investigated by Ponceau Red solution (catalog no. P-7170; Sigma) stainings of the membranes, after which the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl) containing 5% milk powder. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with antibodies against either MMP-9 (catalog no. MAB13418; Chemicon), cathepsin K (catalog no. MAB3324; Chemicon), p38 MAPK total form (catalog no. 9212; Cell signaling), p38 MAPK active form (catalog no. 9216; Cell Signaling), RANK (catalog no. AB1861; Chemicon), R-M-CSF (catalog no. AF329; R&D Systems), or TGF-β (catalog no. MAB240; R&D Systems). After washing vigorously with TBS-T for 1 h, membranes were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (DAKO) and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL™; Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—All graphs show one representative experiment of at least three, each with four individual replications. All graphs show the mean of four replications and S.D. values. All statistical calculations have been performed by Student's two-tailed unpaired t test assuming normal distribution with equal variance. Statistical significance is given by the number of asterisks (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.01. The Effect of TGF-β in a Lymphocyte-rich Environment—To systematically investigate the role of TGF-β on human osteoclastogenesis, we isolated monocytes from peripheral blood by three distinct approaches, resulting in (i) lymphocyte rich osteoclast precursor population, (ii) a lymphocyte-poor osteoclast precursor population consisting only of adherent cells, and (iii) a pure osteoclast precursor population obtained by CD14-positive magnetic cell sorting technique. In each of these populations, we investigated the effects of TGF-β on proliferation, TRAP activity, fusion, and resorption. The lymphocyte-rich culture system is a highly heterogeneous population that contains, among other cell types, CD19 B-cells (9%), CD3 T-cells (70%), CD14 monocytes (14%), and CD56 natural killer cells (6%) (33Shalhoub V. Elliott G. Chiu L. Manoukian R. Kelley M. Hawkins N. Davy E. Shimamoto G. Beck J. Kaufman S.A. Van G. Scully S. Qi M. Grisanti M. Dunstan C. Boyle W.J. Lacey D.L. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 111: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This heterogeneous population has previously been used to investigate the effects of TGF-β on human osteoclastogenesis (25Massey H.M. Scopes J. Horton M.A. Flanagan A.M. Bone. 2001; 28: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, since approximately 85% of the monocyte fraction is not osteoclast precursors, the direct and indirect effects of TGF-β are impossible to distinguish. Furthermore, of the different cell types present in the peripheral blood monocyte fraction, more cells than the CD14-positive monocytes express the receptor for RANK-L, RANK. The CD19-positive B-cells have previously been reported to express RANK and to be able to differentiate into osteoclasts (33Shalhoub V. Elliott G. Chiu L. Manoukian R. Kelley M. Hawkins N. Davy E. Shimamoto G. Beck J. Kaufman S.A. Van G. Scully S. Qi M. Grisanti M. Dunstan C. Boyle W.J. Lacey D.L. Br. J.

Biochem. 2000; 78: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, B-cell-deficient mice do not lose bone when they are ovariectomized (36Toyosaki-Maeda T. Takano H. Tomita T. Tsuruta Y. Maeda-Tanimura M. Shimaoka Y. Takahashi T. Itoh T. Suzuki R. Ochi T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The importance of the immune system in osteoclastogenesis is further emphasized by the fact that RANK-L originally was identified on activated T-Cells (41Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar) and that T-cell-deficient mice did not lose bone when ovariectomized (42Onoe Y. Miyaura C. Ito M. Ohta H. Nozawa S. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 43Cenci S. Weitzmann M.N. Roggia C. Namba N. Novack D. Woodring J. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Finally, TGF-β has been proven to dramatically increase the RANK-L expression on activated T-cells (44Wang R. Zhang L. Zhang X. Moreno J. Celluzzi C. Tondravi M. Shi Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, to reproduce previous published results and to expand these with the time-dependent effects of TGF-β on osteoclastogenesis, we used the described lymphocyte-rich cell population and cultured these cells in the presence of RANK-L and M-CSF (both at 25 ng/ml) and exposed the cells to TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods (Fig. 1). We found, as previously described (25Massey H.M. Scopes J. Horton M.A. Flanagan A.M. Bone. 2001; 28: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), that TGF-β stimulated bone resorption, namely by ∼400% measured by CTX analysis (Fig. 1C) and pit area measurements (data not shown). However, resorption was only stimulated when TGF-β was present in the initial part of the culture period (Fig. 1C). When TGF-β was present for a longer time or throughout the culture period, resorption was restored to control levels (Fig. 1C). Supporting this observation, TRAP activity followed the same pattern of modulation by TGF-β (Fig. 1B). Most interestingly, proliferation was just slightly and nonsignificantly increased when TGF-β was present at the initial culture period and just slightly and nonsignificantly decreased when present through the culture period (Fig. 1A)."

Recent evidence indicates that bisphosphonates have direct cytotoxic activity on tumor cells and suppress angiogenesis, but the associated molecular events have not been fully characterized. In this study we investigated the effects of zoledronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, and clodronate, a non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion, migration, and survival, three events essential for angiogenesis. Zoledronate inhibited HUVEC adhesion mediated by integrin αVβ3, but not α5β1, blocked migration and disrupted established focal adhesions and actin stress fibers without modifying cell surface integrin expression level or affinity. Zoledronate treatment slightly decreased HUVEC viability and strongly enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death. HUVEC treated with zoledronate and TNF died without evidence of enhanced annexin-V binding, chromatin condensation, or nuclear fragmentation and caspase dependence. Zoledronate inhibited sustained phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and in combination with TNF, with and without interferon (IFN) γ, of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). Constitutive active PKB/Akt protected HUVEC from death induced by zoledronate and TNF/IFNγ. Phosphorylation of c-Src and activation of NF-κB were not affected by zoledronate. Clodronate had no effect on HUVEC adhesion, migration, and survival nor did it enhanced TNF cytotoxicity. Taken together these data demonstrate that zoledronate sensitizes endothelial cells to TNF-induced, caspase-independent programmed cell death and point to the FAK-PKB/Akt pathway as a novel zoledronate target. These results have potential implications to the clinical use of zoledronate as an anti-angiogenic or anti-cancer agent.

Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogues in which the oxygen is replaced by a carbon atom with various side chains (1Fleisch H. Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). They efficiently accumulate in bone due to their high affinity for calcium. Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption used for the treatment of diseases characterized by excessive bone loss, such as Paget's disease, osteoporosis, and osteolytic tumor bone metastases (2Rogers M.J. Watts D.J. Russell R.G. Cancer. 1997; 80: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brown D.L. Robbins R. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999; 39: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Green J.R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity at multiple levels; they prevent differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, block the activity of mature osteoclasts, and induce osteoclast apoptosis (5Rogers M.J. Gordon S. Benford H.L. Coxon F.P. Luckman S.P. Monkkonen J. Frith J.C. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2961-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rodan G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanisms of action of bisphosphonates are only partially understood and appear to differ among different families of bisphosphonates (6Rodan G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Fleisch H. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 80-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Non-nitrogen containing bisphosphonates (e.g. clodronate and etidronate) can be incorporated into non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, which accumulate intracellularly and thereby suppress ATP-dependent enzymes (8Rogers M.J. Brown R.J. Hodkin V. Blackburn G.M. Russell R.G. Watts D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronate and pamidronate) inhibit critical enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, in particular farnesyl diphosphate synthase, required for the synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and thereby suppress prenylation of small GTPases essential for many cellular functions (9Bergstrom J.D.

Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that bisphosphonates suppress progression of bone metastases, and recent observations suggest that this effect may be independent of the inhibition of bone resorption (13Neville-Webbe H.L. Holen I. Coleman R.E. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2002; 28: 305-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Green J.R. Cancer. 2003; 97: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Tumor progression and metastasis formation are critically dependent on tumor angiogenesis (15Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). Anti-angiogenic treatments suppress tumor progression in animal models, and many anti-angiogenic substances are currently being tested in clinical trials for their therapeutic efficacy against human cancer (16Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that zoledronate possesses anti-angiogenic activities. Zoledronate was shown to inhibit serum-, fibroblast growth factor-2-, or vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated proliferation and to modulate adhesion and migration of cultured endothelial cells (17Wood J. Bonjean K. Ruetz S. Bellahcene A. Devy L. Foidart J.M. Castronovo V. Green J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). These effects were paralleled by a reduced vascular sprouting in the aortic ring and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assays and by the suppression of fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis in mice (17Wood J. Bonjean K. Ruetz S. Bellahcene A. Devy L. Foidart J.M. Castronovo V. Green J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Furthermore, zoledronate suppressed testosterone-stimulated vascular re-growth in the ventral prostate of castrated rats (18Fournier P. Boissier S. Filleur S. Guglielmi J. Cabon F. Colombel M. Clezardin P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6538-6544PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and angiogenesis are critically dependent on integrin-mediated cell adhesion and signaling (19Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 20Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 21Rüegg C. Mariotti A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1135-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Integrins are αβ heterodimeric cell surface complexes acting as the main receptors for extracellular matrix proteins with bi-directional signaling activity (21Rüegg C. Mariotti A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1135-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Ligand binding function is tightly regulated by cell signaling events, and in turn, ligated integrins activate multiple signaling pathways essential for cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Integrin αVβ3 is highly expressed in osteoclasts and is strongly up-regulated in angiogenic endothelial cells (23Teitelbaum S.L. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2000; 18: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Cancer J. 2000; 6: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacological antagonists of αVβ3 efficiently inhibit bone resorption (25Hartman G.D. Duggan M.E. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 9: 1281-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and angiogenesis, including tumor angiogenesis, in many different animal models (21Rüegg C. Mariotti A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1135-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Cancer J. 2000; 6: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results demonstrate, however, that developmental and tumor angiogenesis can proceed in the absence of αVβ3 integrin, thus demonstrating that additional integrins contribute to angiogenesis (26Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 27Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We raised the hypothesis that bisphosphonates may exert their anti-angiogenic effects, at least in part, by interfering with vascular integrin function or signaling. To test this hypothesis, we exposed cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) 1The abbreviations used are: HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN, interferon; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; LIBS, ligand-induced binding site; PKB, protein kinase B; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PI, propidium iodide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; PCD, programmed cell death. to zoledronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, and clodronate, a non-nitrogen containing bisphosphonate, and tested the effects on integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration and on cell survival.

The Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum was from Caltag (South San Francisco, CA), and the goat-anti-rat-HRP conjugated antiserum was from BIOSOURCE International. The plasmids mpPKB and wtPKB were kindly provided by Dr. B. Hemmings (FMI, Basel, Switzerland), whereas the AdΔNI-kB and AdLacZ vectors were from Dr. Ch. Esslinger (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Epalinges, Switzerland). Cell Culture, Electroporation, and Adenoviral Infection—HUVEC were prepared and cultured as previously described (28Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For electroporation, sub-confluent HUVEC were collected and incubated on ice 5 min with 20 μg of the specific plasmid DNA in serum-free M199 medium and electroporated with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). HUVEC were resuspended in complete medium and cultured for 36 h before use in the experiments. Electroporation efficiency (between 70 and 80%) was routinely assessed by FACS® analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression from a co-transfected pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech, La Jolla, CA). HUVEC infected with AdΔNI-kB or AdLacZ (multiplicity of infection 100) were used 24 h post-infection. Cell Adhesion Assays—Maxisorp II Nunc enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin, vitronectin, or gelatin overnight at 4 °C and blocked with bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Assays were done as previously described (28Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated cells or cells treated for 24 h with clodronate, zoledronate, or EDTA (100 μm each) were collected and seeded in serum-free M199 medium at a concentration of 104 cells/well. After 1 h at 37 °C wells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and attached cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Absorbance of each well was read at 620 nm in a plate reader (Packard Spectra Count, Meriden, CT). Results are expressed as mean value of triplicate determinations ± S.D. Migration Assay—Confluent HUVEC monolayers were cultured in complete medium alone or in the presence of clodronate, zoledronate, or EDTA (100 μm). After 16 h, wells were washed with serum-free medium, and one wound per well was applied with a plastic tip. Cells were further cultured in serum free human endothelial basal growth medium (Invitrogen) in the absence or presence of clodronate, zoledronate, or EDTA (100 μm). Ten hours later, cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Migration was assessed by taking pictures of three different regions of each wound and counting the number of cells migrated inside of the wound area. Results are expressed as the mean of the number of migrated cells/1000 μm2 wound ± S.D. Cell Viability Assays—HUVEC (104 cells/well) were plated on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) Maxisorp II Nunc enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates in complete medium alone or in the presence of zoledronate, clodronate, or EDTA at the indicated concentrations. Eight hours later TNF (200 ng/ml or as otherwise indicated) or medium alone was added to the wells. Sixteen hours later viability was determined by MTT assay (29Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Spertini O. Lejeune F.J. Ruegg C. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or by staining of adherent cells with crystal violet. Stained cells were lysed in Me2SO (for MTT reading) or in 0.1 m sodium citrate, 50% ethanol (for crystal violet reading). Absorbance of each well was measured at 620 nm (MTT) or 570 nm (crystal violet) in a plate reader (Packard Spectra Count). Results are expressed as mean value of triplicate determinations ± S.D. Immunofluorescence—HUVEC were cultured in complete medium or in medium supplemented with clodronate, zoledronate, or EDTA (100 μm each) for 24 h and fixed in 4% parafomaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) cells were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin, washed, and incubated for 1 h with an anti-paxillin mAb (5 μg/ml). After washing, cells were incubated with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse (8 μg/ml). To stain the actin fibers, permeabilized cells were incubated with phalloidin-FITC. Flow Cytometry—HUVEC were collected by trypsinization, washed, and incubated with anti-integrin or anti-ICAM-1 antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with a FITC-labeled antiserum for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed with a FACScan II® and Cell Quest® software (BD Biosciences). For annexin-V binding, HUVEC were harvested as above and sequentially incubated with FITC-conjugated annexin-V (1:40 dilutions) and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) following the manufacturer's recommendations (Apotech). For detection of DNA degradation, control and treated adherent and non-adherent HUVEC were collected as above, resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol under vortex, and incubated for 2 h at –20 °C. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. 50 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science) was added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min before staining with propidium iodide (PI, 50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Stained cells were analyzed with a FACScan II® and Cell Quest® software. Western Blotting—Total cell lysates (40 μl/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland). For caspase-3, PARP, phospho-PKB, phospho-FAK, phospho-c-Src, and phospho-IκB detection, membranes were sequentially incubated in 5% dry milk, primary antibodies (at recommended concentrations), and the appropriate horseradish peroxide-labeled secondary antibody (1 μg/ml). The ECL system was used for detection (Amersham Biosciences). To determine total FAK, PKB/Akt, and IκB, membranes were stripped 15 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol) and re-probed with the appropriate antibodies. Caspase Activity Assay—106 cells were lysed in 70 μl of 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. 20 μl of cell lysate were transferred into a black microwell plate and mixed with 100 μl of substrate buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with 7 μl of a 5 mm Ac-DEVD-amidomethylcoumarin solution (Alexis Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C in the dark, substrate conversion was determined in a multi-well fluorimeter (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) (Packard Fluoro Count, Meriden, CT). Results are expressed as arbitrary units and represent the mean value of duplicate determinations ± S.D. Hoechst 33258 Staining—HUVEC were cultured for 16 h in complete medium alone or in medium supplemented with EDTA, clodronate, or zoledronate (100 μm each) with and without ZVAD (50 μm). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with 2.5 μg/μl Hoechst 33258 in 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Stained cells were washed, and nuclei were viewed by epifluorescence microscopy (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss AG, Zürich) equipped with a CCD camera (Photonic Science Milham, UK) at 360 nm. Zoledronate Inhibits α V β 3-mediated HUVEC Adhesion— Bisphosphonates have been reported to decrease the adhesion of tumor cells to bone matrices (30Boissier S. Magnetto S. Frappart L. Cuzin B. Ebetino F.H. Delmas P.D. Clezardin P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3890-3894PubMed Google Scholar, 31van der Pluijm G. Vloedgraven H. van Beek E. van der Wee-Pals L. Lowik C. Papapoulos S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 698-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and to modulate endothelial cell adhesion to vitronectin (17Wood J. Bonjean K. Ruetz S. Bellahcene A. Devy L. Foidart J.M. Castronovo V. Green J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Whether bisphosphonates may differentially modulate adhesion mediated by different integrins was not reported. HUVEC adhesion to gelatin and vitronectin fully depends on integrin αVβ3, whereas HUVEC adhesion to fibronectin is predominantly mediated by integrin α5β1, with only a minor contribution from αVβ3 (Fig. 1A). To test whether bisphosphonates may selectively interfere with αVβ3-mediated adhesion, we cultured HUVEC for 24 h in medium alone or in medium supplemented with zoledronate, clodronate, or EDTA (100 μm each) and assessed their ability to attach to fibronectin, vitronectin, and gelatin in a short term adhesion assay. Because bisphosphonates chelate cations and integrin function is modulated by divalent cations (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+), EDTA treatment was included in this and the successive experiments to exclude nonspecific effects due to cation chelation. Zoledronate treatment inhibited adhesion to vitronectin and gelatin by 50 and 80%, respectively, but did not affect adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with clodronate or EDTA (100 μm each) had no effect on HUVEC adhesion (Fig. 1B). Zoledronate Inhibits HUVEC Migration—To test for the effects of zelodronate and clodronate on cell migration, HUVEC were cultured until they reached confluence and then supplemented with EDTA, zelodronate, or clodronate for 16 h. A “scratch” wound was then made with a plastic tip, and 10 h later wells were fixed, and migration was quantified (32Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Zoledronate treatment suppressed cell migration by more than 90%, whereas treatment with EDTA or clodronate had no effect (Fig. 2). Zoledronate Does Not Affect Cell Surface Integrin Expression or Affinity—Decreased HUVEC adhesion and migration caused by zoledronate could be due to a reduced cell surface expression or a decreased affinity of integrins. To test for these possibilities, the total cell surface level of β1 and αVβ3 integrins and LIBS expression (33Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) on β1 and β3 subunits were determined. HUVEC cultured for 24 h in medium alone or in the presence of EDTA, clodronate, or zoledronate (100 μm each) were first stained with anti-αVβ3 or -β1 integrin mAbs and analyzed by flow cytometry. Exposure to zoledronate had no effect on β1 or αVβ3 integrin expression levels (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Thereafter, control or treated HUVEC were stained with mAb HUTS-21 and LIBS-1, which specifically bind to the high affinity conformation of β1 or β3 integrin subunits, respectively (34Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11067-11075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 35Frelinger A.d. Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to test whether zoledronate suppressed integrin affinity maturation. Zoledronate-treated HUVEC had β1 and β3 LIBS-staining profiles identical to control or clodronate-treated HUVEC (Fig. 3B and data not shown). MnCl2, which is used to promote integrin affinity maturation (36Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), induced LIBS expression regardless of HUVEC pretreatment (Fig. 3B). MnCl2 did not modify total β1 and αVβ3 integrin levels (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that zoledronate, but not clodronate, inhibit αVβ3-mediated HUVEC attachment to vitronectin and gelatin and block HUVEC migration without affecting αVβ3 and β1 integrin cell surface expression or affinity. Zoledronate Disrupts Focal Adhesions and Actin Stress Fibers—Stable integrin-dependent cell adhesion and efficient cell migration are critically dependent on integrin post-receptor events, including focal adhesion assembly and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (37Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). To test whether zoledronate interferes with these events, HUVEC were cultured for 24 h in medium alone or in the presence of EDTA, clodronate, or zoledronate and then stained for paxillin, to visualize focal adhesions, and for F-actin, to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Untreated and EDTA- and clodronate-treated HUVEC showed the typical focal paxillin staining and the fibrillar actin cytoskeleton, consistent with focal adhesion assembly and actin stress fiber formation. In contrast, in zoledronate-treated HUVEC the focal paxillin staining was completely lost, and the F-actin cytoskeleton was nearly completely dissolved (Fig. 4A). Zoledronate Treatment Inhibits Phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase—FAK is a critical regulator of focal adhesion formation, maintenance, and turnover (38Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). FAK is activated by auto-phosphorylation in response to integrin ligation and by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation (39Abbi S. Guan J.L. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 1163-1171PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of zoledronate on FAK phosphorylation, HUVEC were cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of EDTA, clodronate, or zoledronate (100 μm each), and FAK phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho-FAK-specific antibody. Zoledronate, but not clodronate or EDTA treatment, efficiently suppressed FAK phosphorylation without altering total FAK protein levels (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of c-Src was not diminished by zoledronate, suggesting that decreased FAK phosphorylation was not due to suppressed c-Src activation (Fig. 4B). These experiments demonstrated that zoledronate disrupted focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in stably adherent cells and inhibited FAK phosphorylation, three events downstream of integrin ligation. Zoledronate Reduces HUVEC Viability and Enhances TNF Cytotoxic Activity—FAK-dependent signaling events promote cell survival and protect cells against death induced by stress, cytotoxic drugs, and TNF (40Kasahara T. Koguchi E. Funakoshi M. Aizu-Yokota E. Sonoda Y. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Fang Y. Wang L. Jin J. Zha X. Eur. J.

To test whether zoledronate treatment had an effect on cell viability, HUVEC were cultured in medium alone or in the presence of bisphosphonates, and cell viability was determined after 24 h. Zoledronate treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in HUVEC viability, with a 30% cell loss at 100 μm, whereas EDTA and clodronate had no effect (Fig. 5A). Zoledronate-treated cells had a retracted cytoplasm, an elongated shape with long protrusions at the ends (Fig. 5B). Because HUVEC are normally resistant to TNF-induced death (29Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Spertini O. Lejeune F.J. Ruegg C. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 43Ruegg C. Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Bamat J. Chaubert P. Lejeune F.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether zoledronate may sensitize HUVEC to TNF cytotoxicity. HUVEC were cultured for 8 h in the absence or presence of bisphosphonates and then exposed to TNF at doses ranging from 0.02 ng/ml up to 200 ng/ml, and viability was determined 24 h later. Treatment with TNF alone had a minimal effect on viability. Zoledronate pretreatment, however, induced a dose-dependent decrease in viability of cells exposed to TNF (Fig. 5C). Zoledronate/TNF-treated cells showed a severely altered morphology, with many cells rounding up and retra"

https://openalex.org/W2085341523,"The orphan nuclear hormone receptor SHP (gene designation NROB2) is an important component of a negative regulatory cascade by which high levels of bile acids repress bile acid biosynthesis. Short term studies in SHP null animals confirm this function and also reveal the existence of additional pathways for bile acid negative feedback regulation. We have used long term dietary treatments to test the role of SHP in response to chronic elevation of bile acids, cholesterol, or both. In contrast to the increased sensitivity predicted from the loss of negative feedback regulation, the SHP null mice were relatively resistant to the hepatotoxicity associated with a diet containing 0.5% cholic acid and the much more severe effects of a diet containing both 0.5% cholic acid and 2% cholesterol. This was associated with decreased hepatic accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides in the SHP null mice. There were also alterations in the expression of a number of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, notably cholesterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), which was strongly reexpressed in the SHP null mice, but not the wild type mice fed either bile acid containing diet. This contrasts with the strong repression of CYP8B1 observed with short term bile acid feeding, as well as the effects of long term feeding on other bile acid biosynthetic enzymes such as cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). CYP8B1 expression could contribute to the decreased toxicity of the chronic bile acid treatment by increasing the hydrophilicity of the bile acid pool. These results identify an unexpected role for SHP in hepatotoxicity and suggest new approaches to modulating effects of chronically elevated bile acids in cholestasis.

These results identify an unexpected role for SHP in hepatotoxicity and suggest new approaches to modulating effects of chronically elevated bile acids in cholestasis. Intracellular and extracellular cholesterol levels are tightly controlled by complex transcriptional control mechanisms based to a large degree on several members of the nuclear receptor family (1Chawla A.

The primary route of cholesterol elimination from the body is via bile, based on both direct canalicular excretion of biliary cholesterol as well as conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids (4Vlahcevic Z.R. Stravitz R.T. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Pandak W.M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1949-1957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both bile acids and cholesterol are recycled to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation, and the efficiency of this process is a crucial component of bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol conversion to bile acids occurs via two different pathways: the classic and the alternative pathways, the end products of which are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. The classic pathway begins with the rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP27, sterol 27-hydroxylase; CYP7B1, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP8B1, sterol 12α-hydroxylase; BA, bile acid; L-FABP, liver fatty acid-binding protein; 3α-HSD, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSEP, bile salt export pump; ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter; I-BAT, sodium-dependent BA transporter ASBT; CH, cholesterol diet; CA, colic acid diet; CON, control diet; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; mEH, microsomal epoxide hydrolase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; IL, interleukin; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; PXR, pregnane X; SHP, small heterodimer partner; LRH-1, liver receptor homolog.1The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP27, sterol 27-hydroxylase; CYP7B1, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP8B1, sterol 12α-hydroxylase; BA, bile acid; L-FABP, liver fatty acid-binding protein; 3α-HSD, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSEP, bile salt export pump; ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter; I-BAT, sodium-dependent BA transporter ASBT; CH, cholesterol diet; CA, colic acid diet; CON, control diet; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; mEH, microsomal epoxide hydrolase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; IL, interleukin; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; PXR, pregnane X; SHP, small heterodimer partner; LRH-1, liver receptor homolog.

Sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of the 12α-position of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in its conversion to cholic acid and is a key determinant of the ratio of cholic acid (hydrophilic) to chenodeoxycholic acid (hydrophobic), and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool (9Pandak W.M.

Alterations in the ratio of cholic to deoxycholic acid have been postulated to play roles in cholesterol gallstone formation (10van de Heijning B.J. Stolk M.F. van Erpecum K.J. Renooij W. Groen A.K.

Paigen B. Carey M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G751-G760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flux of bile acids is tightly controlled by nuclear receptors. When hepatic cholesterol levels are high, oxysterols accumulate and activate the LXRs, which stimulate the transcription of CYP7A1 (12Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J.

This results in increased bile acid synthesis and the subsequent excretion of cholesterol. When bile acid levels are high, bile acid synthesis is inhibited through a regulatory cascade based on FXR, SHP, and LRH-1 (14Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J.

In this pathway the bile acid receptor FXR induces expression of SHP, which negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of other nuclear receptors through a two-step mechanism (16Johansson L.

North Am. 1999; 28: 27-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26St-Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp.

A number of BA transport proteins are involved in this process. These include the Na+-dependent Na+-taurocholate cotransport protein, called NTCP, and the Na+-independent organic anion-transporting polypeptides Oatp1, Oatp2, and Oatp4, all of which import BA from the basolateral surface of hepatocytes. BAs are transported to the canalicular membrane by the intracellular BA-binding protein L-FABP (liver fatty acid-binding protein), 3α-HSD (3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and GST (glutathione S-transferase) isoforms. They are excreted from the hepatocyte by the bile salt export pump BSEP and the multidrug-resistance-associated protein Mrp2. In a cholehepatic shunt in bile ductules, a minor portion of BA are reabsorbed via the apical sodium-dependent BA transporter ASBT (I-BAT), transported back into the periductular capillary plexus by Mrp3, and returned to the hepatocytes. BAs are released from the gallbladder into the intestine where they are reabsorbed by enterocytes, primarily in the ileum. This process depends on ASBT for import, the cytosolic intestinal BA-binding protein I-BABP for intracellular transport, and basolateral Mrp3 for export into the portal circulation. Defects in the expression or transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of components of this enterohepatic BA transporter pathway have been recognized as important causes for various cholestatic liver diseases (27Meier P.J. Stieger B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 635-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Elevated concentrations of bile acids within the liver can cause severe liver injury and even liver failure (27Meier P.J. Stieger B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 635-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Bile acid toxicity is generally thought to be correlated with relative hydrophobicity, with more hydrophobic bile acids being more cytotoxic, although specific effects of distinct bile acids may depend on additional factors (28Rust C. Karnitz L.M. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Simari R.D. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20210-20216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids to hepatocytes has been attributed to membrane-disruptive effects based on their detergent properties (29Schmucker D.L. Ohta M. Kanai S. Sato Y. Kitani K. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Primary bile acids are conjugated to either taurine or glycine before secretion into bile, and taurine-conjugated bile acids are relatively less toxic (30Torchia E.C. Stolz A. Agellon L.B. BMC Biochem. 2001; 2: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SHP plays a crucial role in the acute negative feedback regulation of BA biosynthesis (20Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y.

To characterize its role in a more chronic context, we tested the long term effect of diets rich in cholesterol and CA (chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol and/or 0.5% cholic acid). As expected, wild type mice developed severe cholestasis on diets supplemented with CA and cholesterol. Unexpectedly, however, SHP-deficient mice were protected against this liver damage. Examining gene expression revealed that the CYP8B1, but not CYP7A1 or a number of other targets of FXR or SHP, was re-expressed in the SHP null mice on the BA diets. This recovery of CYP8B1 function may contribute to the decreased toxicity observed in the SHP null livers. Animal Experiments—SHP-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting as previously described (20Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and were maintained with a C57B1/129sv hybrid background. Unless otherwise indicated, mice were housed 6 per cage in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) in virus-free facilities on a 12-h light/dark cycle (7:00 a.m. on/7:00 p.m. off) and were fed a standard rodent chow (No. 5001, Test Diet) and water ad libitum. Age-matched groups of 8- to 9-week-old wild type (+) and SHP (–) mice were used in all the experiments. All protocols for animal use and euthanasia were approved by the Animal Care Committee at Baylor College of Medicine and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Special diet feeding experiments were performed with experimental diets consisting of the control (CON) diet supplemented with 2% (w/w) cholesterol (CH), or 2% cholesterol plus 0.5% (w/w) cholic acid (CH+CA), or 0.5% (w/w) cholic acid (CA). Both wild type and SHP–/– mice were divided into four groups (CON, CH, CH+CA, and CA) and fed each diet for 12 weeks. At the end of the feeding, mice were placed in individual Metabowl cages for collection of feces for 72 h. At the last day before sacrificing, mice were fasted overnight (15 h), and blood was collected from the orbital plexus after mice were anesthetized with avertin. Livers were removed for histological analysis. Tissues not used for histology were weighed, sectioned, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Histological Analyses—Liver was fixed in 4% formaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (4 μm). Sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma). For Oil Red O staining, frozen tissue sections were used. Sections were examined under bright-field microscopy with an Olympus model BX50 photomicroscope. Gene Expression—Total RNA was isolated from liver and ileum as indicated using Tri reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Gene expression was assessed by Northern blot analysis. RNA samples were processed as previously described (31Wang L. Bogerd J. Choi H.S. Seong J.Y. Soh J.M. Chun S.Y. Blomenrohr M. Troskie B.E. Millar R.P. Yu W.H. McCann S.M. Kwon H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 10 or 20 μg of RNA was denatured, electrophoresed, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with different cDNA probes. Mouse cDNA probes for numerous genes analyzed were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR of liver or, where appropriate, ileum total RNA using primers designed from the mRNA sequence of each gene that were obtained from the published GeneBank™ data base, as described previously (20Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The new primers used in this study are as follows: I-BAT (sense 5′-TCCTCTGTCTGRCCCCCAAATG and antisense 5′-TCACAATCGTTCCCGAGTCAAC), I-BABT (5′-ATGGCCTTCAGTGGCAAATATGAATTTGA and antisense 5′-TCAAGCCAGCCTGTTGCTTACGCG), OATP1 (sense 5′TCTTGCCCAAATACCTGGAGC and antisense 5′-ACTCGCTTTCCTTCTCTGTGAGC), OATP3 (sense 5′-CAGATGACCTGACCATAACTCCCAC and antisense 5′-TCCAACAGACTTCTCACAGCCC), OATP4 (sense 5′-CAAACTCAGCATCCAAGCAA antisense 5′-CCATCAATCAAACCGGAAAT), L-FABP (sense 5′-TCATCCAGAAAGGGAAGGACATC and antisense 5′-GTCTCCATTGAGTTCAGTCACGG), 3α-HSD (sense 5′-TGGATTCCGCCATTTTGACTC and antisense 5′-TTCCGCCATTTTGACTCTGC), GST (sense 5′-GCAGACCAAAGCCATTCTCAACTAC and antisense 5′-AGGAACTTCTTCACTGTGGGGAG), MDR2 (sense 5′-ACTTCTGCTGTTATCGGTTGTTCC and antisense 5′GGAGCCACTGGACATTGAGTTTC), and mEH (sense 5′-GCACCAGAGGATAGATAGGTTCCG and antisense 5′-CAGGAGAGTCATTCAGAGCACAGC). MRP2, MRP3, and OATP2 probes were obtained from a colleague in our laboratory. Plasma, Feces, and Tissue Chemical Analyses—Serum was prepared from whole blood by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 10 min using Microtainer serum separator tubes (Terumo Medical Corp., Elkton, MD). Serum was frozen in aliquots and stored at –20 °C. Enzymatic assay kits were used for the determination of serum cholesterol, total triacylglycerol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA C, Wako). Serum insulin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using mouse insulin as a standard (Crystal Chem Inc.). Serum ALT and AST levels were measured by routine clinical chemistry testing performed by the chemistry laboratory of Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX. The bile acid (BA) pool size was determined as described previously (32Yu C. Wang F. Kan M. Jin C. Jones R.B. Weinstein M. Deng C.X. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15482-15489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gallbladders, including the region of liver immediately surrounding the gallbladder, and the entire small intestine were minced and extracted in 75% ethanol at about 50 °C for 2 h. The extract was centrifuged, and aliquots of samples of supernatant were diluted with 75% ethanol and further diluted with 25% phosphate-buffered saline before the enzymatic reaction. The BA content was measured colorimetrically using a Sigma Diagnostics BA analysis kit (St. Louis, MO). The pool size was expressed as micromoles of bile acid/g of body weight. To determine fecal bile acid excretion, the feces from individually housed mice were collected, weighed, and dried over a 72-h period. Urine was collected each day. The bile acid concentration was measured as described before (32Yu C. Wang F. Kan M. Jin C. Jones R.B. Weinstein M. Deng C.X. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15482-15489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The daily fecal output (grams/day/g of body weight) and fecal bile acid content (micromoles/g) were used to calculate the rate of bile acid excretion (micromoles/day/g of body weight. To extract lipid from liver, 100 mg of liver was homogenized in chloroform: methanol (2:1), and the resulting homogenate was centrifuged. The lower phase containing the lipid was dried down completely under a stream of N2 and resuspended uniformly in phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100 solution by ultrasonication. Hepatic cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and free fatty acid concentrations were determined as for the serum samples. Diminished Hepatomegaly in SHP-deficient Mice—Recent results demonstrate that SHP has a crucial role in the acute negative feedback regulation of bile acid biosynthesis in vivo (20Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 21Kerr T.A. Saeki S. Schneider M. Schaefer K. Berdy S. Redder T. Shan B. Russell D.W. Schwarz M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 713-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To further characterize the function of SHP in response to chronically elevated BA and cholesterol, both wild type and SHP mutant mice were fed four different diets: control chow (CON) and chow supplemented with 2% cholesterol (CH), 2% cholesterol plus 0.5% cholic acid (CH+CA), or 0.5% cholic acid (CA) for 12 weeks. Wild type and SHP null mice exhibited normal weight gain and growth on the control diet, while the mutant mice showed a modestly diminished growth rate on the cholesterol diet. At the early stages of CH+CA or CA feeding, the mutant mice exhibited a markedly slowed increase in body weight, although the food intake was similar in wild type and SHP null mice (data not shown). At later stages, wild type mice fed the CH+CA diet exhibited wasting and decreased adipose tissue, but SHP null mice showed normal food consumption and adipose tissue weight (data not shown). With respect to liver mass, the wild type mice did not differ significantly from SHP null mice on the CON, CH, or CA diets. However, there was a dramatic color change and size enlargement in livers of wild type mice on the CH+CA diet that was not observed in the SHP null mice (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the serum levels of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Fig. 1C) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Fig. 1D) were strongly elevated in the wild type, but not the SHP null mice, on either of the CA-containing diets. Thus, the loss of SHP is associated with an unexpected decrease in hepatotoxicity of the CA-containing diets. Diminished Hepatotoxicity and Lipid Accumulation in SHP-deficient Mice—In agreement with the gross morphological effects and alterations in liver enzymes, histological examination revealed obvious deleterious effects of long term CH+CA feeding in the wild type animals. In hematoxylin-eosin-stained liver sections, no obvious differences were observed between wild type and SHP null mice on the control diet (Fig. 2, A and B). There was also little difference between the cholesterol-fed wild type and SHP null livers, although the wild type showed an apparent increase in lipid deposition (Fig. 2C) that was confirmed by further studies (see below). On the CH+CA diet, the wild type livers showed inflammatory non-suppurative cholangitis with portal inflammation and ductular proliferation (Fig. 2E). Inflammatory non-suppurative destruction of bile ducts is a feature of various cholestatic diseases in humans. This pathology is caused by defective bile secretion, resulting in cholestasis with accumulation of bile salts and other toxic bile constituents within hepatocytes. This parallels the increase in serum ALT and ALP levels. In striking contrast, the livers of SHP null mice were only mildly affected on the same diet, with intact bile ducts and no hepatocyte damage, inflammation, or disruption of overall architecture, although increased lipid storage was clearly seen (Fig. 2F). There was also evidence of hepatocellular degeneration in livers of wild type mice on the CA diet, which developed centrilobular hypertrophy with degeneration of individual hepatocytes along with some increases in cell size and intercellular sinusoidal spaces (Fig. 2G). These changes were much less evident in SHP null mice (Fig. 2H). Thus, histological analysis confirms the decreased toxicity of CA-containing diets in the SHP null mice. Oil Red O staining revealed a consistent decrease in neutral lipid content of the SHP null livers on all diets, including the control chow. As expected, staining was increased in both wild type and SHP null livers on the CH and CH+CA diets, and, as also expected from the gross morphology, neutral lipid accumulation was particularly dramatic in the wild type CH+CA-fed livers (Fig. 2, a–h). Alteration of Lipid Homeostasis in SHP-deficient Mice—The hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels of wild type mice were all higher than those of SHP null mice maintained on a control diet (Fig. 3, A–C), consistent with the decreased neutral lipid staining (Fig. 2b). These differences were not observed in the livers of young SHP null mice (8–12 weeks) (20Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), but were obvious in these and other studies with mice at least 20 weeks old. This indicates an age-dependent progressive change in lipid metabolism in the SHP null mice. Cholesterol feeding caused a clear increase in hepatic cholesterol in both wild type (2.5-fold) and SHP null mice (1.5-fold) (Fig. 3A). This was accompanied by an increase in triglycerides (3-fold and 2-fold), but hepatic free fatty acid contents were decreased for both wild type and SHP null mice on the CH diet (Fig. 3, B and C). In agreement with the enlarged liver mass and distinct color change, hepatic cholesterol was dramatically increased in the CH+CA-fed wild type mice (13.2-fold relative to control diet). Consistent with the Oil Red O staining, SHP null mice showed a lesser total accumulation of hepatic cholesterol than the wild type mice on the CH+CA diet but still exhibited a marked increase (10-fold) (Fig. 3A). No major changes were observed for hepatic triglycerides or free fatty acids in the wild type mice fed the CH+CA diet, but triglycerides were modestly increased in the SHP null mice and free fatty acids were increased by ∼3-fold (Fig. 3B). The CA diet increased hepatic cholesterol levels in a similar extent in both the wild type and SHP null mice, but did not change the hepatic triglycerides levels. Hepatic free fatty acid levels were decreased in both genotypes by this diet. Interestingly, although there were dramatic and differential alterations in hepatic lipid contents in both wild type and SHP null mice upon different diets, serum lipid levels were relatively unchanged, except for the markedly elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acid levels in wild type mice on CH+CA diet (Fig. 3, D–F). With the previous results, this indicates a significant defect in the capacity of the wild type CH+CA-fed liver, but not the similarly fed SHP null liver, to store and appropriately regulate lipid levels Alteration of Bile Acid Homeostasis in SHP-deficient Mice—A number of parameters were assessed to explore potential defects in bile acid homeostasis in the wild type and SHP null animals. The BA pool was approximately twice as large in SHP null mice versus wild type mice on regular chow diet (Fig. 4A), confirming the negative regulatory role of SHP in bile acid biosynthesis. This increase is somewhat greater than that observed with younger SHP null mice (20Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2058875911,"Synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), a member of membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, has been implicated in the processes of targeting ionotropic glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites. Here we show that SAP97 is enriched at the postsynaptic density where it co-localizes with both ionotropic glutamate receptors and downstream signaling proteins such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). SAP97 and αCaMKII display a high co-localization pattern in hippocampal neurons as well as in transfected COS-7 cells. Metabolic labeling of hippocampal cultures reveals that N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activation induces CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97; co-incubation with the CaMKII-specific inhibitor KN-93 reduces SAP97 phosphorylation to basal levels. Our results show that SAP97 directly interacts with the NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor both in an in vitro “pull-out” assay and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from homogenates and synaptosomes purified from hippocampal rat tissue. Interestingly, in the postsynaptic density fraction, SAP97 fails to co-precipitate with NR2A. We show here that SAP97 is directly associated with NR2A through its PDZ1 domain, and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 disrupts NR2A interaction both in an in vitro pull-out assay and in transfected COS-7 cells. Moreover, expression of SAP97(S232D) mutant has effects similar to those observed upon constitutively activating CaMKII.

Our findings suggest that SAP97/NR2A interaction is regulated by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic targeting of NMDA receptor subunits. The correct delivery of synaptic proteins is a key process in the regulation of physiological neuronal response. This mechanism requires the coordination of a number of molecular components. In fact, it implies the formation of multimolecular complexes that bring transmembrane receptors together with molecular organizers and involves the action of signaling elements, i.e. specific kinases, that govern the regulatory processes responsible for a dynamic assembly/disassembly of these complexes.

MAGUKs are characterized by a common multimodular structure including three PDZ domains, an Src homology domain 3, and a guanylate kinase-like domain (1Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 2Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Members of this family act as molecular scaffolds for synapse-targeted components mainly by direct interaction with a SXV motif on the cytoplasmic termini of their binding proteins. MAGUK partners are ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits, as well as other signal transduction elements (1Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L.

A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Among MAGUKs, SAP97 (3Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the rat homologue of the Drosophila (Dlg) and human (hDlg) discs large tumor suppressor protein. Dlg is highly concentrated in postsynaptic membranes where it has been shown to interact with synaptic molecules such as Shaker potassium channels (4Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mammalian central nervous system, SAP97 has been described to be enriched both at pre- and postsynaptic compartments (3Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B.

Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, SAP97 has been implicated in the early processing of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (6Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a possible interaction with NR2-type NMDA subunits has been put forward. In particular, the NR2A subunit has been proposed to interact in vitro with SAP97 (7Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) even if the physiological relevance and the mechanisms regulating these interactions are still unclear. It is well known that the cytosolic domain of the NR2 subunits can serve as a docking site not only for members of MAGUK protein family (9Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) but also for signaling molecules such as CaMKII (10Gardoni F. Schrama L.H. Kamal A. Gispen W.H. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKII is a flower-shaped enzyme highly enriched in brain neurons and represents the main signaling protein of the postsynaptic density (PSD). It is well established that a fine modulation of its activity and autophosphorylation state is central to the regulation of glutamatergic synapse (11Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Several data have demonstrated that CaMKII uses different molecular strategies to spatially and temporally control signal transduction in the hippocampal neuron, including phosphorylation of a variety of substrates. Nevertheless, although several CaMKII substrates have been identified in the last few years (12Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), little is known about the functional role of specific CaMKII phosphorylation processes that take place in vivo in the postsynaptic compartment. Recently, different members of MAGUK as possible new targets for CaMKII have been suggested (12Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Koh Y.H. Popova E. Thomas U. Griffith L.C. Budnik V. Cell. 1999; 98: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a new mechanism regulating MAGUK function in the postsynaptic neuron. Here we show that, in hippocampal neurons, SAP97 interacts with NR2A subunits through its PDZ1 domain and that Ser-232 within this domain is phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro and in vivo in metabolically labeled transfected COS-7 cells and in cultured hippocampal neurons. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of this site disrupts SAP97 interaction with NR2A suggesting that CaMKII activation in the postsynaptic compartment can serve as a molecular mechanism influencing NR2A-SAP97 complex thereby regulating synaptic targeting of this NMDA receptor subunit. COS-7 Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells at 20-50% confluency (24 h after plating on glass coverslips in 12-well plates) were transfected by Superfect® Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with cDNA expression constructs (1-1.5 μg of DNA/well) for 2-3hat5% CO2, 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and grown for 24-48 h before fixation for immunocytochemistry or before metabolic labeling experiments. Mutated products were obtained by using the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Where indicated in the text, Ile-Glu-Arg-Val-Ile-Ser-Ile-Phe-Gln-Ser-Asn SAP97-(34-44) or Leu-Glu-Arg-Gly-Asn-Ser-Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe-Ser SAP97-(227-237) peptides were transfected in COS-7 by means of the Pro-Ject Protein Transfection Reagent (Pierce) 4 h before immunolabeling. Neuronal Cultures and Immunofluorescence Labeling—Low density hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 to E19 rat hippocampi as described (14Gardoni F. Bellone C. Viviani B. Marinovich M. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Goslin K. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons or transfected COS-7 cells were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in GDB buffer (30 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.8 m NaCl). Fluorescence images were acquired using Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope. Image Acquisition and Quantification—Confocal images were obtained using a Nikon 60× objective with sequential acquisition setting at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. Each image was a z series projection of ∼8-12 images taken at 0.5-1-μm depth intervals. Labeled transfected COS-7 cells were chosen randomly for quantification from two to five coverslips from three to five independent experiments for each construct. Co-localization analysis was performed using Laserpix software (Bio-Rad). Quantification of Western blot analysis and autoradiography were performed by means of computer-assisted imaging (Quantity-One® System; Bio-Rad), and statistical evaluations were performed according to one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni as post hoc comparison test. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST Fusion Protein— SAP97 fragments were subcloned downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the BamHI and HindIII site of the expression plasmid pGEX-KG by PCR using the Pfu polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The inserts were fully sequenced with ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (ABI Prisma). In particular, SAP97-PDZ1 and SAP97-PDZ3 GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), and eluted as described previously (16Gardoni F. Schrama L.H. van Dalen J.J.W. Gispen W.H. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fusion Protein Phosphorylation—GST-SAP97-PDZ1 and GST-SAP97-PDZ3 purified fusion proteins were incubated with αCaMKII-(1-325) (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C, in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.4 μm calmodulin, 2 mm CaCl2 with 100 μm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP 2 μCi/tube; 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was initiated by the addition of kinase solution to the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out for 5 min and stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Hippocampal cultures were preincubated for 2 h in phosphate-free minimal essential medium and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free minimal essential medium for 2 h at 37 °C. The cultures were washed and incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °C with either Hanks' buffer (HBSS; for control cultures) or HBSS containing NMDA (50 μm) or NMDA (50 μm) + KN-93 (10-5m). Following two quick washes with cold HBSS, the cells were harvested into 0.5 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer containing (unless otherwise indicated) 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF in the presence of a complete set of proteases inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics). Each solubilized sample was then incubated for2hat4 °C with 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads and anti-SAP97 polyclonal antibody. Following this incubation, the supernatants were removed, and the beads were washed five times with solubilization buffer. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, incubated with agitation for 5 min, and briefly centrifuged; the supernatants were loaded on 9% SDS-PAGE gels as described. Incorporation of 32P was quantified by exposing dried gels to film for varying lengths of time, and then densitometric analysis was performed by means of computer-assisted imaging (Quantity-One® System; Bio-Rad). Cells were solubilized in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and Complete™ where indicated. The homogenized cells were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min. The resulting pellet (P1) was resuspended in an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm KCl and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min to obtain a Triton-insoluble fraction (TIF). COS-7 cells were transfected with empty vectors, GFP-SAP97wt + αCaMKII-T286D or GFP-SAP97(S232D) + αCaMKII-T286D. 48 h after transfection, cells were preincubated for 1 h in phosphate-free minimal essential medium. The medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml). After 1 h okadaic acid 0.2 μm was added to the medium, and cells were incubated for an additional hour. Cells were harvested into 0.5 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer containing a complete set of protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics). Each solubilized sample was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody. Protein A-Sepharose beads washed in the same buffer were added, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Western blots were performed on all immunoprecipitated samples to verify that equal amounts of SAP97 protein were being precipitated under all experimental conditions (data not shown). PSD Preparation—To isolate PSD from rat hippocampus, a modification of the method by Carlin et al. (17Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) was used, as described previously (18Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). “Pull-out” Assay—Aliquots containing 5 μg of hippocampal PSD were diluted with PBS, 0.1% or 1% SDS to a final volume of 1 ml and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with glutathione-agarose beads saturated with GST fusion proteins or GST alone. After the incubation period, the beads were extensively washed with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with polyclonal anti-NR2A and anti-GluR1 antibodies. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: mouse αCaMKII antibody, polyclonal GluR1, NR1, and NR2A antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA); polyclonal SAP97 antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents Inc. (Golden, CO); polyclonal anti-GFP and AlexaFluor 488, 568, and 633 secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). SAP97 Co-localization and Co-precipitation with NR2A and CaMKII—To determine SAP97 enrichment into different subcellular compartments of hippocampal neurons, we used a biochemical fractionation approach to isolate purified postsynaptic densities (PSD) from hippocampal rat tissue (Fig. 1). The expression of SAP97 as well as pre- and postsynaptic marker proteins in various subcellular compartments was investigated. SAP97 displays a high co-localization pattern with αCaMKII and ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits being enriched in the PSD fraction and present with a similar distribution in the total homogenate (H), crude synaptosomal membrane (Syn), and the low speed supernatant (S1) fractions. SAP97 was only barely detectable in the nuclei-associated membranes (P1). By using the same biochemical fractions, we also examined the subcellular distribution of synaptophysin, PSD-95, GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptor, and NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor. As expected, synaptophysin was present in all subcellular compartments analyzed but not in the PSD-purified fraction, whereas all the other proteins have a similar distribution pattern being enriched in synaptosomes and PSD fractions (Fig. 1A). Recent data documented that SAP97 can interact with different subsets of proteins in vitro (5Valtschanoff J.G. Burette A. Davare M.A. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Weinberg R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We performed immunoprecipitation experiments in homogenate, synaptosomes, and PSD fractions to evaluate the capability of SAP97 to bind putative interacting proteins. Anti-SAP97 immunoprecipitates were challenged in WB with NR1, NR2A, GluR1, and αCaMKII antibodies. Fig. 1B shows that in all tested compartments, SAP97 co-precipitates with GluR1 and αCaMKII; co-precipitation assay shows an association of SAP97 with NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor in homogenate and synaptosomal fraction but not in the PSD fraction. The absence of any NR1 signal in SAP97 co-immunoprecipitates tends to exclude that in our experimental conditions the co-precipitation of NR2A reflects an unspecific immunoprecipitation of insoluble proteins. Furthermore, anti-NR2A and anti-αCaMKII immunoprecipitates from synaptosomes challenged for SAP97 confirmed the co-precipitation of these proteins (Fig. 1C). Co-clustering of SAP97 and αCaMKII in Transfected COS-7 Cells—It is well known that αCaMKII Thr-286 autophosphorylation is crucial for its persistent activation, keeping the enzyme in a catalytically active conformation independent of the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (11Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitution of Thr-286 with Asp (αCaMKII-T286D) mimics autophosphorylation, rendering the enzyme constitutively active. Clustering assay in heterologous cells was used to study possible interactions of both wild type and active-T286D αCaMKII with SAP97 in intact cells. COS-7 cells were first singly transfected with αCaMKII, αCaMKII-T286D, SAP97, or NR1. In single transfections both αCaMKII and αCaMKII-T286D showed a diffuse distribution, whereas both SAP97 and NR1 displayed a perinuclear accumulation with characteristic clusters (Fig. 2, A-D). Co-transfection of SAP97 with αCaMKII or αCaMKII-T286D caused a redistribution of SAP97 staining throughout the cell (Fig. 2, E-J). Of relevance, quantification of SAP97 co-clustering with T286D-mutated enzyme shows a higher and almost complete co-localization value (97.1 ± 2.3%) when compared with the wild type αCaMKII (75.4 ± 2.9%) suggesting a higher affinity of the activated form of the enzyme for SAP97. No effect on NR1 distribution was observed when it was co-transfected with either αCaMKII or T286D-αCaMKII (Fig. 2, K-P). We then examined the distribution pattern of SAP97 and αCaMKII in 2-3-week-old cultured hippocampal neurons exposed or not exposed to NMDA (50 μm) for 15 min in order to allow Ca2+ influx and endogenous CaMKII activation (14Gardoni F. Bellone C. Viviani B. Marinovich M. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In untreated cultures, SAP97 labeling was diffused in the somatic cytoplasm of cultured neurons; the same diffuse staining was also observed within dendrites (Fig. 3). Both in the dendrites and in the soma of cultured neurons, it appears to have a moderate co-localization pattern with αCaMKII. Fifteen-minute treatment of hippocampal cultures with NMDA (50 μm), known to maximally activate neuronal αCaMKII, leads to a punctate staining of αCaMKII in the dendrites. Interestingly, SAP97 staining in these experimental conditions changed from a diffuse to a punctate labeling in the dendritic compartment leading to a higher co-localization degree between the two proteins, thus confirming a higher co-clustering of SAP97 with activated CaMKII as shown in COS-7 cells. CaMKII-dependent Phosphorylation of SAP97 in Purified PSD and in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—We then tested whether αCaMKII/SAP97 interaction may lead to SAP97 phosphorylation. PSDs from hippocampi were reacted under conditions optimal to maximally activate αCaMKII; immunoprecipitation studies were performed on 32P-phosphorylated PSD with a polyclonal SAP97 antibody. A phosphorylated band at about 130 kDa, corresponding to SAP97, is clearly visible (Fig. 4A, lane 3). In the same autoradiography, a phosphorylated band at 50 kDa is also present. This phospho-band corresponds to the autophosphorylated αCaMKII that co-precipitates with SAP97 as demonstrated by the WB analysis reported in the figure (lanes 1 and 2). In a more direct approach, hippocampal neurons were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then exposed for 15 min to NMDA in the absence or presence of CaMKII-specific inhibitor KN-93 (10-5m). Cultures were harvested, and neuronal lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal SAP97 antibody. WB was performed on all immunoprecipitated samples to verify that equal amounts of SAP97 protein were being precipitated under these experimental conditions (data not shown). Autoradiography of anti-SAP97 immunoprecipitates showed a major 32P band at about 130 kDa co-migrating with the SAP97 immunoreactive band. NMDA treatment significantly increased 32P incorporation into the 130-kDa SAP97 phospho-band (+81.2 ± 8.9%, NMDA versus control, p < 0.01). In the same autoradiogram a phosphorylated band at 50 kDa corresponding to αCaMKII co-precipitation with SAP97 is also present, consistent with the above finding (Fig. 1B and Fig. 4A). The increase in phosphorylation of both SAP97 and αCaMKII protein bands induced by NMDA was completely blocked by co-incubation of the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. Of relevance, NMDA and KN-93 treatment modulated both αCaMKII activation-inhibition and kinase association/dissociation from SAP97 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). In addition, Fig. 4C shows that SAP97 phosphorylation is restricted only in the Triton-insoluble fraction (TIF) and in a P1 crude membrane fraction where both SAP97 and αCaMKII are present. In fact, no SAP97 phosphorylation was detectable in the Triton-soluble fraction (TSF) enriched in SAP97 but not containing a detectable amount of αCaMKII. SAP97-Ser-232 Is a CaMKII Phosphorylation Site—Several CaMKII phosphorylation consensus sequences are distributed along SAP97 protein (19White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, two optimal CaMKII consensus sites are present at the beginning of the PDZ1 domain (RGN-Ser-232-GLG) (13Koh Y.H. Popova E. Thomas U. Griffith L.C. Budnik V. Cell. 1999; 98: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and inside the PDZ3 domain (HRG-Ser472-TLG), respectively. Fusion proteins of GST with SAP97-PDZ1-(217-318) or SAP97-PDZ3-(465-545) were prepared and incubated with purified CaMKII in presence of [γ-32P]ATP as phosphate donor. Fig. 5A shows a representative autoradiography corresponding to in vitro CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-PDZ1-(217-318) and SAP97-PDZ3-(465-545) GST fusion proteins; a radioactive band corresponding to both fusion proteins is clearly visible confirming the presence of the CaMKII phosphosites into the two PDZ domains. The phosphorylation signal shown by SAP97 fragments is specific because GST alone did not show any phospho-band (rightmost lane). We then tested whether the full-length SAP97 was phosphorylated in vitro by CaMKII. GFP, GFP-SAP97wt, or GFP-SAP97(S232D) was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP, and subsequently phosphorylated in the presence of recombinant αCaMKII. Representative autoradiography in Fig. 5B shows that SAP97wt is effectively phosphorylated by exogenous αCaMKII; abrogation of Ser-232 as phosphosite by S232D mutation resulted in a significant reduction (-54.3 ±4.4%, SAP97 S232D versus SAP97wt, p < 0.01; values are mean ± S.E. obtained from three experiments, each including two independent samples) of 32P incorporation in GFP-SAP97(S232D) when compared with GFP-SAP97wt. To confirm that Ser-232 represented also in vivo a “major” phosphorylation site in SAP97, we performed metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate in COS-7 cells transfected with either GFP-SAP97wt + αCaMKII-T286D or GFP-SAP97-(S232D) + αCaMKII-T286D (Fig. 5C). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Autoradiography revealed a significant reduction of 32P incorporation in SAP97(S232D)-transfected cells when compared with SAP97wt, indicating that Ser-232 is a major phosphorylation site in SAP97 also under these experimental conditions (-63.3 ± 5.1%, SAP97 S232D versus SAP97wt, p < 0.01; values are mean ± S.E. obtained from three experiments, each including two independent samples and normalized for SAP97wt and SAP97 S232D expression levels in total cell lysates). However, SAP97wt and SAP97 S232D expression levels were comparable in all experimental conditions as tested by Western blotting analysis using a polyclonal SAP97 antibody (data not shown). CaMKII-dependent Phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 Disrupts NR2A but Not GluR1 Interaction—By using the pull-out procedure, we tested whether the CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-PDZ1 region could influence the association of SAP97-interacting proteins (see Fig. 1B). GST-SAP97-PDZ1 fusion protein, phosphorylated in vitro by purified CaMKII in the presence or absence of ATP as phosphate donor, was incubated in a pull-out assay with solubilized hippocampal PSD. As expected, SAP97-PDZ1 domain was able to directly bind both the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor and the NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor (Fig. 6A). Phosphorylation of the CaMKII consensus site inside the SAP97-PDZ1 domain affects NR2A but not GluR1 binding (Fig. 6A); on this line, SAP97-(227-237) peptide containing SAP97-Ser-232 phosphosite competes with NR2A but not with GluR1 association in the in vitro pull-out assay (Fig. 6B). CaMKII-dependent Phosphorylation Affects NR2A/SAP97 Co-clustering in Transfected COS-7 Cells—We then performed a clustering assay in transfected COS-7 cells to determine NR2A-SAP97 protein interaction in a mammalian cell context. As expected, double NR1 and SAP97 transfection confirmed the lack of interactions between the two proteins (Fig. 7, D-F). In contrast, cells double-transfected with NR2A and SAP97 formed plaque-like clusters in which SAP97 immunoreactivity co-localized precisely with NR2A (Fig. 7, G-I). In cells transfected with NR2A + SAP97 in presence of the competing SAP97-(227-237) peptide, however, SAP97 immunoreactivity remained diffuse and did not co-localize with NR2A clusters (Fig. 7, J-L). In addition, the SAP97(S232D) mutation mimicking CaMKII-dependent SAP97-Ser-232 phosphorylation interfered with the NR2A-mediated clustering of SAP97 (Fig. 7, M-O). On the other hand, SAP97-(34-44) peptide containing another CaMKII consensus site (-RVI-Ser-39-IFQ-) outside a PDZ domain had no effect on NR2A/SAP97 aggregates (Fig. 7, P-R). To test directly the binding of wild type and S232D mutated SAP97 to NR2A, we performed immunoprecipitation assays in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 7S). Although wild type SAP97 was strongly associated to NR2A, S232D mutation was sufficient to disrupt almost completely the NR2A/SAP97 interaction (Fig. 7S). To confirm the specific role of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation in the modulation of NR2A/SAP97 interaction, we looked for co-clustering assay in COS-7 cells (Fig. 8). In cells triply transfected with NR2A + SAP97 + αCaMKII, co-clusters of NR2A/SAP97 were clearly visible with a precise co-localization of the two proteins, whereas αCaMKII immunostaining remained diffuse in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 8, A-D). In NR2A + SAP97 + αCaMKII-T286D triple transfections, αCaMKII-T286D disrupted the clustering of SAP97 by NR2A (Fig. 8, E-H) most probably due to SAP97-Ser-232 phosphorylation (see Fig. 5). In fact, SAP97-S232A clustered precisely with NR2A even in presence of αCaMKII-T286D (Fig. 8, I-L), strengthening the idea that SAP97-Ser-232 phosphorylation plays a central role in the modulation of NR2A association to SAP97. CaMKII has been implicated in a variety of brain functions including activity-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity by multiple mechanisms (11Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Particularly relevant is its ability to transform a transient change in calcium levels into a long lasting change in kinase activity. CaMKII can phosphorylate a large number of proteins in vitro, and recently several substrates involved in synaptic plasticity have been identified (12Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 21Yoshimura Y. Aoi C. Yamauchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that SAP97 directly interacts with the NR2A NMDA receptor subunit and that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 modulates the dynamic association/dissociation of this complex. The co-localization of SAP97 and CaMKII in Western blot from different subcellular compartments, the in vitro phosphorylation of SAP97 fusion proteins, the metabolic labeling of cultured hippocampal neurons and transfected COS-7 cells, the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins, and the distribution pattern in transfected COS-7 cells, all these results clearly indicate that SAP97-Ser-232 is in vivo phosphorylated by CaMKII. Basal phosphorylation of SAP97 in cultured resting hippocampal neurons is quite low, and phosphorylation is markedly enhanced by NMDA treatment. KN-93 treatment is able to reduce SAP97 phosphorylation to basal levels, indicating a central role for CaMKII in NMDA-mediated phosphorylation. This represents the first direct evidence of phosphorylation of a mammalian MAGUK protein by CaMKII, confirming recent in vitro data that identified MAGUK protein family as possible substrates in PSD for CaMKII (12Yoshimura Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Kobayashi K. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Yoshimura Y. Aoi C. Yamauchi T. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling experiments in transfected COS-7 cells clearly address Ser-232 as a major CaMKII in vivo phosphorylation site in SAP97 protein. The SAP97-Ser-232 CaMKII consensus site here described corresponds to the Drosophila MAGUK Dlg-Ser-48 site indicated previously (13Koh Y.H. Popova E. Thomas U. Griffith L.C. Budnik V. Cell. 1999; 98: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) to be implicated in the regulation of Dlg association with synaptic complex. On the other hand, inspection of SAP97 sequence reveals the presence of at least two other domains containing serine residues (Ser-39 in the N terminus and Ser-472 inside the PDZ3 domain) that might represent putative phosphate acceptor sites for CaMKII (19White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Both sites are phosphorylated in vitro by the kinase even if with lower affinity when compared with PDZ1-Ser-232 (data not shown). Future experiments are needed to determine the possible role of these consensus sites that are located in two important strategic domains of SAP97 (22Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies (6Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have put forward the idea of a direct physical interaction between SAP97 and ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits, identifying GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptor and NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor as major binding targets for SAP97 in hippocampal neurons. In particular, the NR2A subunit has been demonstrated to display in vitro a strong interaction with SAP97; the C-terminal SDV motif of the NR2A subunit has been proposed to be mandatory for efficient interaction with SAP97 (7Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, immunohistochemistry experiments comparing the distribution of NR2A and SAP97 demonstrated a high level of regional, cellular, and subcellular co-localization of the two proteins (3Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our results confirm and extend these findings. In fact, here we show that the SAP97-PDZ1 domain binds both NR2A and GluR1 and that CaMKII phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 inside its PDZ1 consensus site is critical for SAP97 interaction with NR2A but not with GluR1. Significantly, we demonstrate that constitutive activation of CaMKII results in alteration of SAP97/NR2A clustering in triply transfected COS-7 cells. No effect is obtained when wild type enzyme is used, suggesting that CaMKII activation-phosphorylation is needed to affect SAP97/NR2A clustering. Expression of site-directed SAP97-(S232D) mutants that mimic phosphorylation has similar effects to those observed upon constitutively activating CaMKII, whereas S232A abrogation of CaMKII consensus site blocks any effect of active CaMKII on SAP97/NR2A interaction. In vitro competition and phosphorylation assays confirm cell transfection data strengthening the role of SAP97-Ser-232 consensus site in modulating NR2A binding. In the last few years, members of MAGUK protein family have been addressed as key elements for the correct targeting and clustering of ionotropic glutamate receptor to the postsynaptic complex (2Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Several indications suggest a PDZ-mediated interaction of NMDA receptor subunits before they are delivered to synapses (24Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev.

Very recently, an NR2-binding protein, i.e. SAP102, has been shown to bind the exocyst sec6/8 protein complex suggesting a role for members of MAGUK protein family in synaptic delivery of the NR2-NMDA receptor subunits (24Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Data presented here confirm this hypothesis describing a dynamic association of SAP97 to NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor complex in specific subcellular compartments. Our results show that SAP97 interacts with the NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor in an in vitro pull-out assay and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed from homogenates and synaptosomes purified from hippocampal tissue. Furthermore, we show here that in the PSD fraction SAP97 is dissociated from NR2A, suggesting that this protein-protein interaction is not involved in NMDA anchoring at the postsynaptic compartment but rather in the targeting of the NMDA subunit. Of relevance, our results show that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97 in hippocampal cultures is detectable only in a Triton-insoluble fraction mimicking the PSD fraction but not in a Triton-soluble fraction. This suggests that CaMKII-mediated dissociation of NR2A-SAP97 complex could take place in the PSD fraction or close to it where the kinase is highly enriched. Together, our results demonstrate that the association of SAP97 with the NR2A subunit is regulated by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic protein interactions during synaptic plasticity events. We are grateful to S. Nakanishi for providing NR2A cDNA, to M. Passafaro for providing SAP97 cDNA, and to H. Schulman for providing αCaMKII cDNA."

In this report, we demonstrate that mammalian Cdc37 is phosphorylated on Ser13 in situ in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in cultured K562 cells and that casein kinase II is capable of quantitatively phosphorylating recombinant Cdc37 at this site. Mutation of Ser13 to either Ala or Glu compromises the recruitment of Cdc37 to Hsp90-kinase complexes but has only modest effects on its basal (client-free) binding to Hsp90. Furthermore, Cdc37 containing the complementing Ser to Glu mutation showed altered interactions with Hsp90-kinase complexes consistent with compromised Cdc37 modulation of the Hsp90 ATP-driven reaction cycle.

Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends, immunoresins were washed four times with 10 mm PIPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20. Samples were assessed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and/or autoradiography. Purification of Recombinant Cdc37 Protein Constructs from Escherichia coli—His-tagged full-length Cdc37 and His-tagged Cdc37/ΔC were purified as described previously (7Shao J. Gramatikakis N.

The wild type Cdc37 samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in either the presence or absence of alkaline phosphatase (calf intestine, Calbiochem).

Immunopellets were washed and then incubated in the presence or absence of alkaline phosphatase. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, excised from the gel, and analyzed for phosphorylation. To identify Cdc37 phosphopeptides, gel pieces were washed with 50% acetonitrile (ACN), dehydrated in 100% ACN, rehydrated with 50 mm NH4HCO3, washed with 50% ACN, 25 mm NH4HCO3, and then dried under vacuum and rehydrated/infiltrated with 1 gel volume of 12.5 ng/μl chymotrypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) prepared in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm CaCl2. Digestions were incubated at 37 °C for ∼16 h. The digestion fluid was removed, and the gel pieces were extracted with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts and digestion fluid were combined, concentrated to a volume of 10–20 μl, and purified with Zip-tips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Aliquots (1 μl) of the peptide mixtures were spotted onto a MALDI plate and were immediately covered by the same volume of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (matrix) prepared in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After drying, samples were analyzed using a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operated in the linear, negative-ion mode. Mass spectra were compared with the chymotryptic peptide mass fingerprints predicted for Cdc37 by the MS-Digest program from the Protein Prospector suite (17Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser13 of Cdc37 Inhibits Its Kinase Binding Capacity—To examine the role of Ser13 in modulating the function of Cdc37, the ability of wild type Cdc37, and the Cdc37/S13A or Cdc37/S13E mutants to bind to newly synthesized kinase client, HRI, in RRL was assessed. The binding of Cdc37/S13A and Cdc37/S13E to HRI client was compromised by 98 and 85%, respectively, relative to wild type Cdc37 (Fig. 1A). This reduction was not simply due to a lack of interaction with Hsp90; the binding of the S13A and S13E mutants to immunoadsorbed Hsp90 was decreased by only ∼40 and ∼10%, respectively (Fig. 1B). A similar reduction in the binding of Hsp90 to immuno-adsorbed Cdc37 mutants was observed relative to wild type Cdc37 (Fig. 1C). Similar to wild type Cdc37 (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the binding of the mutant proteins to Hsp90 was sensitive to washing with high salt (Fig. 1C). The ability of the S13E mutant to bind Hsp90 at near wild type levels compared with the S13A mutant likely contributed to its greater capacity to bind HRI. The differences in the kinase binding capacities of the Cdc37/S13E and S13A mutants is consistent with the extent to which the growth of yeast strains carrying the double Ser to Glu or Ser to Ala mutations in the analogous Ser14,Ser17 motif were compromised (8Bandhakavi S. McCann R.O. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2829-2836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cdc37 Is Phosphorylated on Ser13 in Situ and in Vivo—The phosphorylation status of Cdc37 was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS performed in linear negative-ion mode. Chymotrypsinolysis of recombinant Cdc37 generated a peptide anion with an average m/z of 2497 (Fig. 2A) that corresponded well with that predicted for the theoretical peptide anion containing Cdc37 amino acids 8–29 (DHIEVS13DDEDETHPNIDTASLF; average m/z 2498), with the difference between the observed and the theoretical m/z lying well within the mass accuracy of the instrument in this mode of operation (500 ppm mass accuracy in linear mode). However, this peptide was absent from the mass spectra of wild type Cdc37 synthesized in RRL. Instead, a peptide with an m/z of 2577 was observed, which corresponds to that predicted for the phosphorylated peptide-(8–29) (2498 + 80) (Fig. 2B). Treatment of this Cdc37 with alkaline phosphatase yielded spectra containing a peptide peak with the average m/z of 2497 (Fig. 2C), corresponding to that predicted for the unphosphorylated peptide-(8–29). To confirm that the apparent phosphorylation was present on Ser13, Cdc37/S13A was synthesized in RRL and analyzed. For this mutant, a peptide anion with the average m/z of 2480 was observed (Fig. 2D), corresponding within error to that predicted for the unphosphorylated S13A 8–29 peptide (m/z 2481). The mass of this mutant peptide and the absence of phosphorylation thereon demonstrated that Ser13 was the site phosphorylated on Cdc37 produced in RRL. Because peptide-(8–29) of Cdc37 contains a consensus CKII phosphorylation motif at Ser13, we determined whether CKII could phosphorylate this site in vitro. These assays utilized purified recombinant Cdc37 lacking its C-terminal domain, because of its availability due to ongoing structural characterizations. 2R. L. Matts, T. Prince, and S. D. Hartson, unpublished data. The spectra of chymotryptic peptides from Cdc37/ΔC included a peak with an average m/z (2497) corresponding to that of the unphosphorylated peptide-(8–29) (Fig. 2H). This peak was absent from spectra of peptides derived from recombinant protein treated with CKII (Fig. 2G). Instead, a peak corresponding to the phosphorylated peptide-(8–29) (m/z 2477) was observed (Fig 2G). Additionally, Coomassie Blue staining of the gel indicated that treatment of Cdc37/ΔC with CKII quantitatively slowed its electrophoretic mobility (not shown). Thus CKII had the capacity to quantitatively phosphorylate Cdc37/ΔC in vitro. To determine whether Cdc37 was phosphorylated in vivo, Cdc37 was immunoadsorbed from extracts prepared from K562 cells, and immunoadsorptions were or were not treated with alkaline phosphatase. MALDI-TOF analysis detected a chymotryptic peptide peak with an average anionic m/z of 2578, consistent with the predicted average mass of the phosphorylated form of the 8–29 peptide (Fig. 2E): the peak corresponding to the predicted average m/z of the unphosphorylated 8–29 peptide was absent. Treatment of these Cdc37 immunoadsorptions with alkaline phosphatase led to the loss of the peak at m/z 2578, while a new peak at m/z 2498 was now detected (Fig. 2F). The mass difference between these peaks (80 Da) was consistent with phosphorylation and its loss upon phosphatase treatment. Thus, Cdc37 appears to be heavily phosphorylated on Ser13 in K562 cells, consistent with the apparent quantitative phosphorylation of Cdc37 observed in RRL (Fig. 2B). However, our data do not rule out the possibility that a small pool of unphosphorylated Cdc37 exists in vivo but that representative peptides were not detectable in our MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Mutation of Ser13 Compromises the Ability of Cdc37 to Stimulate Nucleotide-modulated Conformational Switching of Hsp90 —Cdc37 interacts with both kinase clients and with Hsp90 (6Hartson S.D.

Chen J.-J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This coincident binding allows Cdc37 to stimulate Hsp90 nucleotide-modulated conformational switching, resulting in the formation of salt-stable heterocomplexes containing Hsp90, Cdc37, and kinase clients (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Shao J. Gramatikakis N. Scroggins B. Uma S. Huang W. Chen J.-J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The formation of these meta-stable complexes is inhibited by the Hsp90 antagonist, geldanamycin, and is enhanced by the stabilizing agent, molybdate (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Shao J. Gramatikakis N. Scroggins B. Uma S. Huang W. Chen J.-J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. J.

To investigate the role of phosphorylated Ser13 on the Cdc37 stimulation of Hsp90 conformational switching, we examined the ability of the S13E and S13A mutants to form salt-stable complexes with HRI. The S13E mutant was constructed in anticipation that the Ser to Glu mutation would wholly or partially mimic phosphorylated Cdc37. Wild type Cdc37 and Cdc37/S13E were synthesized in RRL and mixed with RRL containing His-tagged molecules of the client kinase, HRI (Fig. 3A). As previously demonstrated, wild type Cdc37 formed salt-stable complexes with newly synthesized HRI in the absence of molybdate, and the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin inhibited Cdc37 binding to HRI but not the weak salt-labile binding of Hsp90 to HRI (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Shao J. Gramatikakis N. Scroggins B. Uma S. Huang W. Chen J.-J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cdc37/S13E formed salt-labile complexes with kinase client and Hsp90; high salt washes stripped ∼80% of the bound Cdc37/S13E from the kinase client. Furthermore, although geldanamycin nearly quantitatively blocked the interaction of wild type Cdc37 with HRI, the interaction of Cdc37/S13E with HRI was reduced by only 70%. The cause and relevance of residual salt- and geldanamycin-resistant binding remains uncertain. The addition of molybdate restored the salt-stability of Cdc37/S13E complexes with Hsp90 and client kinase, consistent with the documented ability of molybdate to stabilize Hsp90 heterocomplexes (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Shao J. Gramatikakis N. Scroggins B. Uma S. Huang W. Chen J.-J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, Cdc37/S13A was not capable of forming salt-stable complexes with newly synthesized HRI, and the addition of molybdate was required to restore the salt stability of Hsp90-kinase complexes containing the S13A protein (Fig 3B). Thus, although the S13E and S13A mutations diminished Cdc37 recruitment to kinase complexes, it also compromised the normal function of Cdc37 in stimulating Hsp90 conformational switching to form high affinity salt-stable complexes with kinase client. To further investigate the effect of the S13E mutation on the ability of Cdc37 to modulate conformational switching of Hsp90, we characterized the impact of molybdate on the dynamic interactions of Cdc37/S13E with Hsp90-kinase heterocomplexes. Normally, the interaction of Cdc37 with its clients is reiterative, but molybdate “freezes” Cdc37 binding and thus prevents the turnover of these complexes (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous results (6Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), inhibition by molybdate of the Hsp90 ATP-driven reaction cycle blocked the chase of [35S]Cdc37 from Hsp90-kinase complexes (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, however, at 30 °C [35S]Cdc37/S13E chased from Hsp90-kinase complexes even in the presence of molybdate. Therefore, the S13E mutation compromised the ability of Cdc37 to coordinate the sensing and communication of the protein-protein interactions that regulate Hsp90 nucleotide-modulated conformational switching. Thus, although the carboxylate anion of Glu is able to maintain a near wild type level of binding of Cdc37/S13E to Hsp90, its trigonal planar geometry cannot mimic the tetrahedral geometry of a phosphate anion and maintain normal Cdc37 function. In summary, our data indicate that Ser13 of Cdc37 is phosphorylated in vivo. This phosphorylation is functionally relevant, since mutation of S13 disrupts Cdc37 recruitment to and retention within Hsp90-kinase heterocomplexes and disrupts the Cdc37 role in regulating Hsp90 nucleotide-mediated conformational switching (6Hartson S.D.

Whether the diminished capacity of the mutant proteins to bind kinase is caused by the mutations altering the structural integrity of the Cdc37 N-terminal kinase binding domain, directly diminishing their capacity to bind kinase and thus to coordinate kinase binding with Hsp90 conformational switching, or is a result of the inability of the mutants to stimulate Hsp90 conformational switching, which is required to generate high affinity complexes among Hsp90, Cdc37, and kinase client, remains to be determined. Regardless of the mechanism, the results suggest that CKII regulates Cdc37 function in vivo by phosphorylating S13 of Cdc37, enabling Cdc37 modulation of Hsp90-mediated kinase folding. These findings further invite the speculation that reversible phosphorylation of Cdc37 may regulate the ATP-driven reaction cycle of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with protein kinases and that Cdc37 activity may be regulated physiologically by fluctuations in CKII activity.

We demonstrated that PARP-1 and PCNA co-immunoprecipitated both from the soluble and the DNA-bound fraction isolated from S-phase-synchronized HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments with purified proteins further confirmed a physical association between PARP-1 and PCNA. To investigate the effect of this association on PARP-1 activity, an assay based on the incorporation of radioactive NAD was performed. Conversely, the effect of PARP-1 on PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis was assessed by a DNA polymerase δ assay. A marked inhibition of both reactions was found. Unexpectedly, PARP-1 activity also decreased in the presence of p21 waf1/cip1. By pull-down experiments, we provided the first evidence for an association between PARP-1 and p21, which involves the C-terminal part of p21 protein. This association was further demonstrated to occur also in vivo in MNNG (N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine)-treated human fibroblasts.

Most of the PCNA-interacting proteins have a QXX(h)XX(a)(a) box that specifically binds the interdomain connector loop (12Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). PARP-1 shows a putative PCNA-binding consensus sequence (QDLIKMIF) at position 669 within the NAD-binding domain that is essential for the conversion of NAD into ADP-ribose and, consequently, for PARP-1 catalytic activity. In this work we sought to attain a greater understanding of the interaction between PARP-1 and PCNA. We have demonstrated that PARP-1 and PCNA co-immunoprecipitate both from the soluble and the DNA-bound fraction isolated from S-phase-synchronized HeLa cells. These results were supported by immunoprecipitation experiments with purified proteins. To investigate the effect of this association on the properties of each protein, we evaluated the conversion of NAD into ADP-ribose (PARP assay) as well as PCNA-dependent nucleotide incorporation (pol δ assay), and we found a marked inhibition of both reactions. Unexpectedly, an inhibitory effect on PARP-1 activity was also noted in the presence of p21 waf1 / cip1. By pull-down experiments either with a mAb against PCNA or with p21-GST, we provided the first evidence for an association between PARP-1 and the C-terminal part of p21, i.e. the same region involved in binding to PCNA. Remarkably, the in vivo association between PARP-1 and p21 was further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments on human fibroblasts treated with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Cell Culture and Treatments—HeLa-S3 cells and primary cultures of human embryonic lung fibroblasts were grown as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 4 mm glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and trypsinized when confluent. HeLa cells were synchronized in S-phase by a double thymidine treatment (7Frouin I. Montecucco A. Biamonti G. Hübscher U. Spadari S. Maga G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) followed by a further growth in complete medium for 3 h. High salt (0.35 m NaCl) extracts, formaldehyde cross-linking in vivo, and DNA-protein complexes were obtained as reported previously (7Frouin I. Montecucco A. Biamonti G. Hübscher U. Spadari S. Maga G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In some experiments, HeLa cells were incubated for 3 h with 100 μm MNNG (Sigma) or for 12 h with 1 mm 3-aminobenzamide (Sigma), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for further analyses. Fibroblasts were treated for 1 h with 5 μm MNNG and incubated further in drug-free medium for 4 or 8 h. Protein content was evaluated by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Aliquots of 1 × 107 HeLa cells were lysed for 10 min in ice with 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 μm okadaic acid, and 150 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) (13Prosperi E. Stivala L.A. Sala E. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at 4,500 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the soluble fraction was kept apart. Pelleted nuclei were washed in isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of digestion buffer containing 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 200–400 units of DNase I (Sigma) (14Savio M. Stivala L.A. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were pelleted at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant, containing the DNA-released material, was taken. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of soluble and DNA-bound fractions were incubated for1hat room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C, with 5 μg of the mAb PC10 to PCNA (Dako) or F1–23 to PARP-1 (Alexis, Vinci Biochem). As a negative control, IP was performed with anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After adding protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; 600 μg in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature under agitation, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, washed, and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Experiments of in vivo interaction among p21, PARP, and PCNA were performed on human fibroblasts treated for 1 h with 5 μm MNNG and incubated further in drug-free medium for 4 or 8 h. Detergent-soluble and chromatin-bound fractions were prepared from aliquots of 1 × 107 cells as above described. Samples (1 mg each) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C with a mixture (2 μg each) of C-19 and N-20 rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), previously bound to protein A-Sepharose. As a negative control, rabbit IgG (Dako) were used. After three washings in lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated peptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was then performed with the following antibodies: C-2-10 to PARP-1, C-19 to p21, and PC10 to PCNA (see below). Pull-down Experiments—PARP-1 (60 ng), PCNA (120 ng) and p21 CTE (C-terminal peptide)-GST fusion protein (15Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (25 ng) were incubated in IP buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture) in different combinations for 2 h at 4 °C. Then, 4 μg of the mAb PC10 or anti-mouse IgG (used as isotype control, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added, and tubes were rotated gently overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C after the addition of 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose. Pull-down experiments were also performed by using the recombinant p21CTE protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose (16Knibiehler M.K. Goubin F. Escalas N. Jónsson Z.O. Mazarguil H. Hübscher U. Ducommun B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PARP-1 (60 ng) and/or PCNA (120 ng) were preincubated in IP buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of p21-GST, samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washings, beads were analyzed by Western blot. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were electrophoresed in a minigel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Bio-Rad) (17Donzelli M. Bernardi R. Negri C. Prosperi E. Padovan L. Lavialle C. Brison O. Scovassi A.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After saturation for 1 h with PTN (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 10% newborn calf serum), the membrane was incubated overnight with the following mAbs: C-2-10 to PARP-1 (Alexis), diluted 1:2500 in PTN; PC10 to PCNA (Dako), diluted 1:1000; 187 to p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:100; AE-4 to histone H1 (Santa Cruz), diluted 1:1000. The membrane was washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Visualization of immunoreactive polypeptides was obtained by the ECL system (Sigma). pol δ Assay—In a final volume of 25 μl, the reaction mixture contained 250 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.6, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μm [3H]dTTP (Amersham Biosciences, 1.5 Ci/mmol), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 μg of poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (10:1 base ratio), 0.05 units of pol δ (corresponding to ∼150 ng of protein), and 30–60 ng of rPCNA (15Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recombinant PARP-1 (Alexis; specific activity 6 units/μl; 30–240 ng) was preincubated with PCNA for 5 min at room temperature. After a reaction at 37 °C for 30 min, the precipitated material was collected on Whatman GF/C filters, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Three independent experiments were carried out in duplicate. PARP Assay—In a final volume of 50 μl, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml of activated DNA, 100 μm NAD+, 15 μCi of 32P-NAD+ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 800 Ci/mmol), rPARP-1, and 6 μg of either rPCNA or p21. In some experiments, to rule out possible aspecific effects, 6 μg of recombinant leukocyte elastase inhibitor (LEI, kindly provided by Dr. A. Torriglia) was used. The reaction was carried on for 10 min at 25 °C. Aliquots of 20 μl were processed for the evaluation of acid-insoluble radioactivity. Three independent experiments were carried out in duplicate. Co-immunoprecipitation of PARP-1 and PCNA—PCNA is present in the cell as a free/detergent-soluble form, and as a DNA-bound/detergent-insoluble form associated to the replication forks during S-phase. To enrich the DNA-bound fraction, which normally accounts for a low percentage of the total PCNA, we synchronized HeLa cells in the S-phase and isolated two cellular fractions containing either soluble or DNA-bound/insoluble proteins (13Prosperi E. Stivala L.A. Sala E. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Savio M. Stivala L.A. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-associated proteins were further released by DNase I, and PCNA was immunoprecipitated from both fractions with the specific mAb PC10. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated samples (IP) revealed the presence of both PCNA and PARP-1 in the soluble fraction (S) and, to a lesser extent, in the insoluble fraction (I) (Fig. 1A). To address whether the association between PCNA and DNA could be mediated by poly(ADP-ribose), we treated the cells with the PARP-1 inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, and found an amount of immunoprecipitated DNA-bound PCNA similar to that of untreated cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the association of PARP-1 and PCNA occurred when the two proteins were in a chromatin-bound status, we released bound proteins with a high salt treatment. PARP-1 and PCNA were co-immunoprecipitated by both the anti-PCNA and the anti-PARP-1 antibody (Fig. 1C) and were also detectable in a cross-linked DNA-protein complex (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, both proteins were cross-linked more efficiently in MNNG-treated cells (Fig. 1D), an effect that cannot be ascribed to the general behavior of nuclear proteins as demonstrated by the levels of histone H1 (Fig. 1D). These results could suggest an active role of PARP-1 and PCNA in DNA repair induced by alkylating agents. In fact, this type of DNA damage triggers the recruitment of PCNA from a soluble to an insoluble chromatin-bound complex (18Savio M. Stivala L.A. Bianchi E. Vannini V. Prosperi E. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is a potent activator of poly(ADP-ribosylation) (19Küpper J.H. Müller M. Jacobson M.K. Tatsumi-Miyajima J. Coyle D.L. Jacobson E.L. Bürkle A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3154-3163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PARP-1 Inhibits pol δ Activity—To investigate whether the association between PARP-1 and PCNA affects the activity of PCNA as a co-factor of pol δ, we performed a PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis assay after pre-incubating PARP-1 and PCNA at different concentrations. Fig. 2A shows the results of a typical experiment. With an excess of PCNA (PARP-1:PCNA molar ratio, 1:6 or 1:3), PARP-1 did not affect pol δ activity. However, a higher PARP-1 amount, up to 240 ng, caused a net inhibition of pol δ activity, thus suggesting that an excess of PARP-1 allowed the sequestration of most PCNA molecules, with a consequent impairment of pol δ processivity. Indeed, the Dixon plot analysis of the results of three independent experiments carried out with increasing amounts of both PARP-1 (30–240 ng) and PCNA (30–150 ng) clearly showed that the inhibition of pol δ activity by PARP-1 is dependent strictly on PCNA concentration (Fig. 2B). This effect is more clearly illustrated in Fig. 2C, where the ID50 of PARP on pol δ activity was expressed as a function of PCNA concentration. The data show that for increasing PCNA concentration, an increasing amount of PARP-1 is required to inhibit PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis, possibly because of a physical association between the proteins. PCNA and p21 Inhibit PARP-1 Activity—The interaction between PARP-1 and PCNA is likely to occur through a short peptide motif, which is typically present within the sequence of PCNA partners (12Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Indeed, inspection of the PARP-1 sequence reveals a putative PCNA-binding consensus sequence at the position 669, i.e. within the NAD-binding domain, that is essential for PARP-1 activity. Thus, one would expect that binding of PCNA to PARP-1 in this region would affect the catalytic activity of PARP-1. To test this hypothesis, we measured the conversion of 32P-NAD, i.e. the substrate for the poly-(ADP-ribosylation) reaction, into 32P-poly(ADP-ribose). As illustrated in Fig. 2D, radioactive NAD incorporation decreased by 4-fold when rPCNA was added to the reaction mixture. To confirm the physical association between PARP-1 and PCNA, we attempted to sequester PCNA by adding the C-terminal peptide of p21 (p21CTE), which is known to interact with a region of the PCNA molecule representing a shared binding site for many PCNA partners. Surprisingly, under these conditions, the PCNA-dependent decrease in NAD incorporation was not fully prevented. A possible direct effect of p21 on PARP-1 was then tested by adding p21CTE to the PARP assay. Under these conditions, we found that p21 inhibits PARP-1 activity to the same extent as PCNA, thus suggesting a possible interaction of p21CTE and PARP-1 (Fig. 2D). To rule out a nonspecific inhibitory effect of any recombinant protein on PARP-1 activity, we carried out the assay in the presence of the recombinant protein LEI and found that PARP-1 activity was not decreased (not shown). p21 Associates with PARP-1—The finding of a direct effect of p21 on PARP-1 activity prompted us to perform pull-down experiments with recombinant proteins. A typical Western blot of the IP is shown in Fig. 3A, where lane 1 represents the positive control of immunoprecipitated PCNA. Its amount was greatly reduced by the presence of PARP-1 (lane 2) or p21 (lane 4). A similar result was obtained by adding PARP-1 to PCNA bound to p21 (lane 5). However, when PARP-1 and p21 were first preincubated, the amount of immunoprecipitated PCNA was very high (lane 6). These data suggest that the association of PARP-1 with p21 makes PCNA free to react with the mAb PC10. On the contrary, the binding of PCNA to one partner (either PARP-1 or p21) possibly masks the epitope recognized by PC10. Indeed, p21 binds PCNA through residues 119–133 (20Goubin F. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2281-2287PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which overlap the region spanning residues 111–125, representing the epitope that reacts with PC10 (22Roos G. Landberg G. Huff J.P. Houghten R. Takasaki Y. Tan E.M. Lab. Investig. 1993; 68: 204-210PubMed Google Scholar). The immunodetection of PARP-1 in the IP provided results consistent with those obtained for PCNA (Fig. 3A). To confirm the interaction between p21 and PARP-1, we performed pull-down experiments with p21CTE-GST. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the incubation of either PARP-1 (lane 2) or PCNA (lane 3) with p21CTE-GST resulted in the pull-down of the proteins. When the three proteins were present, the levels of pulled down PARP-1 and PCNA were reduced, as shown for lanes 4 and 5. The decrease occurred to a similar extent when PARP-1 and PCNA (lane 4) or PCNA and p21 (lane 5) were first preincubated. These results further support the finding that p21 and PARP-1 associate and that they compete for the interaction with PCNA. To investigate the existence of an in vivo interaction between p21 and PARP-1, we immunoprecipitated p21 from total extracts prepared from human fibroblasts and found that PARP-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with p21. Moreover, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated p21 and PARP-1 was higher in fibroblasts treated with MNNG than in untreated control cells (not shown). These results prompted us to repeat the experiments on isolated detergent-soluble and chromatin-bound fractions from control and MNNG-treated fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3C, the Western blot analysis of p21 revealed the presence of the protein in samples before (Input) and after immunoprecipitation (IP), thus attesting to the specificity of the applied procedure. The amount of p21 was higher in MNNG-treated cells, where it could be actively involved in DNA repair (23Stivala L.A. Riva F. Cazzalini O. Savio M. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, PARP-1 was detected in the input of both fractions, and it co-immunoprecipitated with p21, thus confirming the in vivo interaction between these proteins. Based on the amount of PARP-1 that is present in the lysate from each fraction (input) compared with the respective IP, we estimate that p21-interacting PARP-1 represents no more than 5% of the soluble fraction and accounts for 20–25% of the chromatin-bound counterpart. That the interaction occurs mainly in MNNG-treated cells suggests that it could have a functional role in DNA repair. Remarkably, PCNA was not co-immunoprecipitated with p21 in the chromatin-bound fraction, although it was in the soluble fraction. Because chromatin-bound PCNA is the form actively involved in DNA repair, our results suggest that the association of chromatin-bound p21 with PARP-1 may avoid an untimely interaction of p21 with PCNA (14Savio M. Stivala L.A. Scovassi A.I. Bianchi L. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar), thus enabling PCNA to be freely recruited to DNA repair sites. PARP-1 interacts with and modifies a number of proteins, thereby regulating their activity. However, little is known about a possible direct association between PARP-1 and its partners. The association of PARP-1 with nuclear proteins could be mediated by the noncovalent binding of poly(ADPribose) through a poly(ADP-ribose)-binding domain (24Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Strohm M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), which has not been found in the PCNA sequence but is present at the C terminus of p21 waf1 / cip1 (24Pleschke J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), where it coincides with the residues involved in the binding to the interdomain connector loop of PCNA (20Goubin F. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2281-2287PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). We aimed at elucidating the functional role of the physical interaction of PARP-1 and PCNA, which was previously suggested by their co-immunoprecipitation from replication complexes (4Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.

In the present study, we demonstrated the following. (i) PARP-1 associates in vitro and in vivo with PCNA in HeLa cells; the increase in the DNA-bound form of both PARP-1 and PCNA observed in MNNG-treated cells suggests a role for this association in DNA metabolism. (ii) PARP-1 affects PCNA-dependent pol δ activity in vitro, in agreement with previous data suggesting a binding of PARP-1 to DNA free ends of pol δ substrate (3Eki T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because the physical association of PARP-1 and PCNA is concentration-dependent, and an excess of PARP-1 allows the sequestration of PCNA (its interaction with pol δ is essential for processive DNA synthesis), we propose an alternative explanation, i.e. that the region of PCNA involved in the association with PARP-1 overlaps with the pol δ-interacting domain. In this view, PARP-1 could be a negative regulator of PCNA-dependent pol δ activity when replicative DNA synthesis has to be inhibited, e.g. under damage conditions. (iii) The inhibitory effect of PCNA on PARP-1 activity suggests that a physical interaction occurs through a putative PCNA-binding sequence located within the catalytic domain of PARP-1. In this respect, PCNA could act as a negative regulator of PARP-1. Unexpectedly, we found that p21CTE, which corresponds to the PCNA-binding portion of p21, interacts directly with PARP-1, and that this interaction occurs also in vivo. This observation is new and intriguing. The C-terminal domain of p21 associates with the interdomain connector loop of PCNA and inhibits pol δ-catalyzed DNA synthesis in vitro (25Dotto G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M43-M46PubMed Google Scholar). As suggested by the co-immunoprecipitation data, PARP-1 could compete with the C-terminal portion of p21 in binding the interdomain connector loop of PCNA. Competition between pol δ and p21 for PCNA binding has been proposed to regulate the differential inhibition of DNA replication versus DNA repair. Our observations that DNA binding of p21, PCNA, and PARP-1 is increased upon DNA damage, together with the finding that PARP-1 binds both PCNA and p21, might suggest a role for these interactions in coordinating the cell response to DNA damage. Thus, PARP-1 and p21 could cooperate in regulating PCNA functions during DNA replication/repair. We are indebted to Prof. B. Ducommun for providing us with p21CTE-GST-expressing bacteria and to Dr. Alicia Torriglia for recombinant LEI."

SPF-3059, was identified as a strong semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) inhibitor. Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse of dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro was completely abolished in the presence of SM-216289 at levels less than 2 μm (IC50 = 0.16 μm). When dorsal root ganglion explants were co-cultured with Sema3A-producing COS7 cells in a collagen gel matrix, SM-216289 enabled neurites to grow toward the COS7 cells. SM-216289 diminished the binding of Sema3A to its receptor neuropilin-1 in vitro, suggesting a direct interference of receptor-ligand association. Moreover, our data suggest that SM-216289 interacted with Sema3A directly and blocked the binding of Sema3A to its receptor. We examined the efficacy of SM-216289 in vivo using a rat olfactory nerve axotomy model, in which strong Sema3A induction has been reported around regenerating axons. The regeneration of olfactory nerves was significantly accelerated by a local administration of SM-216289 in the lesion site, suggesting the involvement of Sema3A in neural regeneration as an inhibitory factor. SM-216289 is an excellent molecular probe to investigate the function of Sema3A, in vitro and in vivo, and may be useful for the treatment of traumatic neural injuries.

Many studies suggest that the limited capacity for nerve regeneration is due to the presence of axonal growth inhibitory components in the CNS tissue (1Fawcett J.W. Asher R.A. Brain Res.

A number of molecules that may contribute to this inhibition have been reported, such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, tenascins, and some chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, etc. One of the in vitro activities of these molecules is growth cone collapse or retraction of growing neurites (1Fawcett J.W.

These results suggest that CNS neurons possess growth ability and support the hypothesis that inhibition of endogenous axonal growth inhibitors might allow regeneration of injured axons in the adult CNS. Various molecules, such as semaphorins and ephrins, have also been shown to have inhibitory activity for axonal growth of neurons during development (10Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S.

Trigeminal sensory axons innervating the cornea are repulsed by Sema3A derived from a Sema3A expression plasmid introduced into the eye of rabbits by gene gun transfection (27Tanelian D.L. Barry M.A. Johnston S.A. Le T. Smith G.M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1398-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that adult DRG neurons are sensitive to Sema3A (28Reza J.N. Gavazzi I. Cohen J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Owesson C. Pizzy J. Tonge D. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 165: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).

These results suggest the possibility that induced Sema3A in glial scars may suppress the re-growth of injured CNS axons. In order to investigate the function of semaphorin in vitro and in vivo, a specific inhibitor for the molecule would be very useful. In this report, we describe the identification of a novel semaphorin inhibitor, xanthofulvin or SM-216289, which was isolated from a fungus. In addition, we characterize the activity of SM-216289 in vitro and in vivo. Production of SM-216289 by Fermentation of Penicillium sp. Strain SPF-3059 —The detailed procedure for the fermentation and purification of SM-216289 (50Kumagai K. Hosotani N. Kikuchi K. Kimura T. Saji I. J. Antibiotics. 2003; 56: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fermentation broth of Penicillium sp. SPF-3059 that was cultured for 8 days at 27 °C with reciprocal shaking at 110 rpm was centrifuged to harvest the cell mass and the supernatant, which were extracted with acetone and ethyl acetate containing 1% formic acid, respectively. The crude extracts were combined and purified by a combination of gel filtration chromatography and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to isolate SM-216289. Collapse Assay—Mouse Sema3A cDNA was cloned into the pUCSRα expression vector, pUCSRα-mSema3A (14Püschel A.W. Adams R.H. Betz H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Shimamoto A. Kimura T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics), as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, the conditioned medium was collected and used for the growth cone collapse assay after determination of Sema3A activity. The growth cone collapse assay was performed as described by Luo et al. (19Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Briefly, DRG explants derived from E7–8 chick or E14 rat embryos were cultured for 16–20 h in F12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Promega, Madison, WI) in 96-well plates (Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) pre-coated with poly-l-lysine and laminin. In order to measure the Sema3A inhibitory activity of SM-216289, the compound was added to the cultures 30–60 min before Sema3A. A small amount of Sema3A-containing conditioned medium was added to the cultures to give final concentration of 300 pm, followed by a 1-h incubation. Then the DRG explants were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, and collapsed growth cones were counted under a light microscope (×200). According to the unit definition of Sema3A by Luo et al. (19Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), 1 unit corresponded to 100 pm and 1.0 nm of purified mouse Sema3A and Sema3A-AP, respectively, in our assay condition. Cell Growth Assay—A cell growth assay was performed to test the cytotoxicity of SM-216289. Approximately 2000 COS7 cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate (Sumitomo Bakelite), and the compound was added to the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS) at various concentrations. After 48 h of cultivation, cell growth was measured using the MTT Cell Growth Assay Kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Co-culture Assay in Collagen Gel—Collagen co-culture experiments were performed as described previously (34Guthrie S. Lumsden A. Neuroprotocols. 1994; 4: 116-120Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. COS7 cell aggregates were prepared as follows. COS7 cells (105 cells) grown in a 35-mm dish were transfected with 1 μg of pUCSRα-mSema3A or the vector plasmid using FuGENE 6. Four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% FBS. Droplets of 20 μl of the cell suspension were suspended under the surface of a culture dish lid and incubated for 12 h (35Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). COS7 cell aggregates and DRG explants derived from E8 chick embryos were co-cultured in 0.2% collagen gel (Koken, Tokyo, Japan) separated by a distance of 1 mm. The collagen gel containing the cell aggregate, and the DRG explant was incubated for 2 days in F12 medium containing 10% FBS and 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor, with or without SM-216289. Pre-mix Experiment—The “pre-mix” experiment we performed was based on the growth cone collapse assay. Usually the inhibitor was pre-incubated with the culture, before addition of Sema3A. In the pre-mix experiments, Sema 3A was incubated with the inhibitor for 30 min before being used to treat the DRG explant. Alternatively, cultured DRG was incubated for 30 min with a relatively high concentration of compound, before the DRG was mixed with a large volume of Sema3A containing medium in the counteractive pre-mix experiment. Receptor Binding Assay—Alkaline phosphatase-fused Sema3A (Sema3A-AP) was used as a ligand for receptor binding assays. A DNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 1–758 of mouse Sema3A was cloned into the N-terminal portion of the human alkaline phosphatase (AP) gene in the pAPtag-2 vector (36Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) in order to insert a His6 tag sequence at the C-terminal end of the recombinant protein. A DNA fragment for the chimeric gene, Sema3A-AP, was re-cloned into the pUCSRα expression vector. Recombinant Sema3A-AP protein was expressed in COS7 cells that were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid using FuGENE 6. Sema3A-AP protein was purified from the conditioned medium by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) chromatography, as described by Takahashi et al. (37Takahashi T. Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9183-9193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to express NP-1, cDNA of mouse NP-1 (38Kawakami A. Kitsukawa T. Takagi S. Fujisawa H. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pUCSRα expression vector, pUCSRα-NP-1. COS7 cells were transfected with the pUCSRα-NP-1 (NP-1-COS). 24 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, re-seeded in 24-well plates (104 cells/well, Sumitomo Bakelite), and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then treated with Sema3A-AP (10 nm) in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10% FBS, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1% NaN3 (modified-HBHA buffer) to perform a receptor binding assay, as described by Flanagan and Leder (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In order to examine the effect of SM-216289 on the binding of Sema3A-AP to NP-1 or DRG neurons, the compound was added to the cells prior to Sema3A-AP addition. For in situ detection of Sema3A-AP bound to cell surface receptors, the cells were fixed after the binding reaction and stained using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates. For quantitative analysis, the cells were solubilized by lysis buffer containing Triton X-100, and AP activity derived from bound Sema3A-AP was measured colorimetrically (absorbance at 405 nm) using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Dissociation culture of E7 or E8 chick DRG neurons was performed as described previously (37Takahashi T. Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9183-9193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Olfactory Nerve Axotomy—All aspects of animal care and treatment were carried out according to the local guidelines of the experimental animal care committee. Wistar rats (male; 6.5 weeks old) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The left olfactory bulb was exposed by opening the region of the frontal bone covering the olfactory bulb using a dental drill. The olfactory nerves were then axotomized by insertion of a custom knife between the cribriform plate and the olfactory bulb (40Costanzo R.M. Brain Res. 1985; 361: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Following the operation, SM-216289 was locally and continuously administered into the injury site at a 6-μl/day rate using a cannula and an osmotic pump (Alza, Mountain View, CA). Regeneration of the olfactory nerve was monitored histologically as follows. Two or 3 weeks after the operation, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and placed on their backs. For anterograde labeling of the olfactory nerve, 100 μlof 1% wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (WGA-HRP) in PBS was injected slowly into nasal cavity (41Baker H. Spencer R.F. Exp. Brain Res. 1986; 63: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the animals were re-anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. The olfactory bulb was dissected and frozen at –80 °C. Cryostat sections (30 μm thickness) were prepared from the entire olfactory bulb (Fig. 5A), and every third section was transferred into a 24-well plate containing PBS. For visualization of the labeled olfactory nerve and glomerulus, the sections were treated with 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.03% H2O2 in PBS for 15 min. After the visualization, the sections were mounted onto glass slides. The number of the first glomeruli-stained sections from the top of the olfactory bulb was defined as the nerve regeneration score for each animal. Identification of a Sema3A Inhibitor, SM-216289, from the Fungus Penicillium sp. SPF-3059 —We found a strong Sema3A inhibitory activity in the cultured broth of a fungal strain, SPF-3059, which was isolated from soil and identified as a strain belonging to the genus Penicillium. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract of the fungal strain led to the isolation of the active compound, SM-216289. The molecular formula of SM-216289, as determined by HRFAB-MS, was C28H18O14 and the molecular weight was 578. The structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis and was found to be identical to xanthofulvin (Fig. 1A), which was previously isolated from a strain of Eupenicillium, as appeared in patent literature but not in a paper (50Kumagai K. Hosotani N. Kikuchi K. Kimura T. Saji I. J. Antibiotics. 2003; 56: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SM-216289 Is a Potent Sema3A Inhibitor—Sema3A induces growth cone collapse in cultured chick DRG neurons. The growth cone collapse was completely abolished in the presence of SM-216289, even at less than 2 μm, where IC50 was 0.16 μm (Fig. 1B), without any prior morphological differences observed in growth cone structure. The inhibition was also observed on rat DRG neurons (Fig. 1B;IC50 = 0.12 μm). SM-216289 showed a similar inhibitory effect to human and chick Sema3A, as well as to that from mouse (data not shown). These observations suggested that the inhibitory effect was not species-specific. When COS7 cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of SM-216289, no growth inhibition was detected at 500 μm (Fig. 1D). This level of SM-216289 is more than 3,000-fold higher than the IC50 value for growth cone collapse inhibition. SM-216289 Has a Persistent Inhibitory Effect on Sema3A— Although growth cone collapse caused by Sema3A is a localized and rapid biological reaction at the tip of the neurites (42Fan J. Mansfield S.G. Redmond T. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Raper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), long term exposure of growing neurites to gradients of Sema3A concentration changes the direction of the neurite growth through a process of chemorepulsion. This process is thought to be an important mechanism of axonal pathfinding during neural development. To assess if SM-216289 has the potential to inhibit the redirection of growing axons by Sema3A, we employed a collagen gel co-culture system. When neurons are co-cultured in a collagen gel matrix very close to cells producing repulsive or attractive guidance molecules, such as a semaphorin or netrin, growing neurites sense the concentration gradient and change their direction of growth accordingly (34Guthrie S. Lumsden A. Neuroprotocols. 1994; 4: 116-120Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, an aggregate of Sema3A-expressing COS7 cells (Sema3A-COS) and E8 chick DRG explant were co-cultured in a collagen gel for 2 days with or without SM-216289 in the growth medium. Although the neurons in the DRG explant extended their neurites radially in the control cultures (Fig. 2A), neurites all grew away from the COS7 cell aggregate when co-cultured with Sema3A-COS (Fig. 2B). However, in the presence of 0.5 or 1.0 μm SM-216289, the repulsion was suppressed. Furthermore, growing neurites were observed in the direction of Sema3A-COS, although their length was reduced in comparison to the control (Fig. 2, C and D). At 4.0 μm SM-216289, neurites were radially extended from the DRG explant and were indistinguishable from the control culture (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2, the length of neurites growing away from COS7 cell aggregates was similar between the SM-216289-treated DRG explant and the non-treated DRG explant, suggesting that SM-216289 did not affect neurite extension per se. When COS7 cells were transfected with the Sema3A-AP expression plasmid (see below), neither mRNA expression nor protein production for Sema3A was affected by SM-216289 (data not shown). These results indicated that SM-216289 inhibits the activity of Sema3A continuously during the culture period and suppressed the repulsive activity of Sema3A. SM-216289 Targets Sema3A Molecule—In order to explore the mechanism of action of SM-216289, we examined the effect of the pre-treatment time of the cultured explants with SM-216289 before the addition of Sema3A in the growth cone collapse assay. In the assay, the collapsing activity of Sema3A was inhibited regardless of the SM-216289 pretreatment time. When SM-216289 and Sema3A were applied to cultured DRG explants simultaneously, the collapsing activity of Sema3A was almost completely inhibited. However, when the compound was added 5 min after Sema3A, little inhibition was observed (data not shown). This result suggests that Sema3A may interact with SM-216289, thereby preventing Sema3A from binding to the receptor. In order to examine whether SM-216289 directly acts on Sema3A, we performed a pre-mix experiment as follows. As described above, the inhibitory effect of SM-216289 was dependent on its concentration. In our general experimental procedure in which SM-216289 and Sema3A were added to the culture medium separately (“one-by-one” procedure), 0.5 μm SM-216289 largely suppressed 300 pm Sema3A activity, whereas little inhibition was observed at 0.1 μm SM-216289 (Fig. 3). In the pre-mix experiment, 1500 pm Sema3A was mixed with 0.5 μm of SM-216289 and incubated for 30 min. A small volume of the mixture was then added to a four times larger volume of culture medium in which DRG explants were cultured. This gave a final concentration of Sema3A (300 pm) and SM-216289 (0.1 μm) which was equivalent to that used in the one-by-one experiment. Although 0.1 μm SM-216289 resulted in little inhibition of Sema3A in the one-by-one procedure, the collapsing activity of Sema3A was significantly inhibited in the pre-mix experiment. The critical difference between the two experiments is that in the pre-mix scenario, Sema3A came into contact with a higher concentration of SM-216289 causing inhibition. This is also supported by the counteractive pre-mix experiment. In this procedure, a cultured DRG explant was incubated with 0.5 μm SM-216289 followed by dilution with a large volume of Sema3A-containing medium to give a final concentration of 0.1 μm SM-216289. Interestingly, no inhibition of Sema3A was observed in this case (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the final concentration of SM-216289 and Sema3A in the culture medium was the same in all these experiments. Therefore, SM-216289 inactivated Sema3A in an experimental procedure-dependent manner. SM-216289 Inhibits Binding of Sema3A to Neuropilin-1—In order to examine the mode of action of SM-216289 more directly, we studied the effect of SM-216289 on the binding of Sema3A to neuropilin-1 (NP-1), an essential component of the Sema3A receptor complex (43He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 44Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.-T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We employed alkaline phosphatase-fused Sema3A (Sema3A-AP) for the following binding experiments (39Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). As described previously (37Takahashi T. Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9183-9193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Sema3A-AP-fused protein had a lower growth cone collapsing activity (EC50 = 1.0 nm) than the native Sema3A (Fig. 1C). Likewise, SM-216289 inhibited the collapsing activity of Sema3A-AP but at a higher concentration (IC50 = 1.7 μm) (Fig. 4A). The binding of Sema3A-AP to NP-1 in the presence or absence of SM-216289 was examined by using COS7 cells that were transiently expressing NP-1 (NP-1-COS). As shown in Fig. 4B, Sema3A-AP binds to NP-1-COS, and the binding was significantly inhibited by the presence of SM-216289. Quantitative analysis of the binding by alkaline phosphatase activity revealed that the inhibitory effect of SM-216289 was dose-dependent (Fig. 4A). The effect of SM-216289 on direct interaction between Sema3A and plexin-A1, which is another component of Sema3A receptor (46Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), could not be examined because Sema3A does not bind to plexin-A1 itself (46Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). However, binding of Sema3A-AP to DRG neurons was also inhibited by SM-216289 at a similar concentration (Fig. 4C). SM-216289 did not affect the AP activity itself nor the protein expression level of NP-1 (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that SM-216289 inhibits the collapsing activity of Sema3A by diminishing its receptor binding ability. SM-216289 Accelerates Nerve Regeneration in Vivo in a Rat Olfactory Nerve Axotomy Model—Pasterkamp et al. (30Pasterkamp R.J. De Winter F. Holtmaat A.J. Verhaagen J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9962-9976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that axotomy of the olfactory nerve leads to an induction of Sema3A mRNA at the injured site. Because NP-1 is expressed on the olfactory nerve, induced Sema3A may inhibit extension of olfactory axons (30Pasterkamp R.J. De Winter F. Holtmaat A.J. Verhaagen J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9962-9976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using this animal model, we examined the in vivo efficacy of SM-216289. Following olfactory nerve axotomy, SM-216289 was locally and continuously administered between the cribriform plate and the olfactory bulb of operated animals at the rate of 6 μg/6 μl/day through a cannula using osmotic pumps. Two or 3 weeks after the axotomy, olfactory nerves were anterogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (WGA-HRP) (41Baker H. Spencer R.F. Exp. Brain Res. 1986; 63: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and the length of regenerated olfactory nerve was determined by the methods described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5, the glomerulus of SM-216289-treated animals was stained to a more distant level from the entry zone of olfactory nerves compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5B). At 2 weeks following the axotomy, the regeneration score for SM-216289-treated animals was 8.3 ± 1.9 on average, but the score in vehicle-treated animals was 11.8 ± 0.3. At 3 weeks, the scores of SM-216289- and vehicle-treated animals became significantly different, at 5.2 ± 0.9 and 8.0 ± 0.7, respectively (Fig. 5C). It should be noted that the regeneration scores were defined so that the greater the length of the regenerated neurites the smaller the score. As SM-216289 has a strong Sema3A inhibitory activity, the acceleration of olfactory nerve regeneration observed in this experiment may due to the inhibition of Sema3A by SM-216289. We isolated SM-216289 from the cultured broth of Penicillium sp. SPF-3059, and we identified this compound as a potent Sema3A inhibitor. SM-216289 inhibited Sema3A from collapsing growth cones and repulsing growing neurites in vitro. The binding of Sema3A to its receptor was abolished by SM-216289, which may be attributed to direct interaction with Sema3A. Moreover, SM-216289 promoted nerve regeneration in vivo in a rat olfactory nerve axotomy model. As shown in Fig. 1, growth cone collapse was almost completely suppressed in the presence of 2 μm SM-216289 (IC50 = 0.16 μm). However, higher concentrations were needed to inhibit the repulsive activity of Sema3A in the gel assay (0.5 and 4.0 μm gave partial or complete inhibition, respectively). The apparent discrepancy in the inhibitory concentration for growth cone collapse and neurite repulsive activity may be explained in terms of the nature of the two phenomena. Once Sema3A binds to a receptor and induces growth cone collapse or retraction, the neurite stop extending and may even shorten. If the neurite is to grow normally in the presence of Sema3A, its activity needs to be continuously and completely blocked during the culture by a relatively high concentration of inhibitor as compared with that for the growth cone collapse assay. Alternatively, the local concentration of Sema3A in the collagen gel matrix may be higher than the concentration of Sema3A used for the collapse assay (300 pm). Indeed this difference in the local concentration of Sema3A is highly likely because growing neurites on an ascending gradient of inhibitory molecules are desensitized by a mechanism called habituation (47Walter J. Muller B. Bonhoeffer F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 84: 104-110Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 1, a higher Sema3A concentration will require more SM-216289 to suppress the Sema3A activity. Thus, we can rationalize the elevated concentration of SM-216289 needed to suppress Sema3A in the collagen gel assay. The binding of Sema3A-AP (a chimera of Sema3A and alkaline phosphatase) to both NP-1-expressing COS cells and DRG neurons was suppressed by SM-216289. Thus the compound would not only inhibit binding of Sema3A to NP-1 but also to the receptor complex that includes NP-1 and plexin-A1. Ten times more SM-216289 was needed to inhibit binding of Sema3A-AP to the receptor than was needed to suppress growth cone collapse of native Sema3A. This observation may be due to different assay conditions and/or that Sema3A-AP was used for the binding assay instead of native Sema3A. In accordance with previous reports (19Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 37Takahashi T. Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9183-9193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the specific activity of Sema3A-AP for growth cone collapse was 10 times lower than that of wild-type Sema3A in our experiments (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, a higher concentration of SM-216289 was needed to inhibit the collapsing activity of Sema3A-AP, IC50 = 1.7 μm. Thus there was a good correlation between the concentration of SM-216289 required to inhibit binding of Sema3A-AP and the IC50 value for growth cone collapse by Sema3A-AP. The reason why Sema3-AP shows lower activity than native Sema3A is unclear. The structural differences between Sema3A-AP and the wild-type Sema3A may reduce its affinity for the receptor, as well as the inhibitor. In our pre-mix experiment, when 0.5 μm of the compound was pre-incubated with Sema3A in culture medium, the growth cone collapse activity was suppressed (Fig. 3). However, no inhibition was observed when 0.5 μm compound was exposed to DRG in culture. Thus, direct contact of SM-216289 with Sema3A was essential for inactivation. Sema3A is activated by proteolytic cleavage. The mechanism of action of SM-216289 must be independent of this proteolytic processing because the reported cleavage sites (48Adams R.H. Lohrum M. Klostermann A. Betz H. Püschel A.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6077-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were deleted in our Sema3A-AP construct, and the observed molecular weight of Sema3A-AP by Western blot analysis was unaffected by incubation with cultured DRG. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SM-216289 directly interacts with Sema3A to inhibit its activity. In the pre-mix experiments, the inhibition was always partial (30–36% collapse observed in five independent experiments). This observation suggests that the inhibition was reversible and that a proportion of the compound was released after the pre-mixed solution was added to the DRG explants and diluted to a non-inhibitory concentration (Fig. 3). This was further confirmed by an experiment in which the collapsing activity of Sema3A was recovered from inactivation by an inhibitory level (1.0 μm) of SM-216289 after dialysis against culture medium (data not shown). Interestingly, SM-216289 also showed efficacy in vivo as well as in vitro Sema3A inhibition. Olfactory nerve axotomy induces Sema3A mRNA expression in cells between the cribriform plate and the olfactory bulb, where regenerating axons grow, in this animal model (30Pasterkamp R.J. De Winter F. Holtmaat A.J. Verhaagen J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9962-9976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Sema3A protein distribution remains to be confirmed because of the lack of a reliable antibody for immunohistochemistry, it is reasonable to suppose that secreted Sema3A is distributed widely in the injured area. As shown in Fig. 5, olfactory nerve regeneration was significantly enhanced when SM-216289 was administered directly onto the injury site. Because pharmacokinetic property of the compound remains to be studied, the route of administration was chosen to minimize the effect and to simplify the interpretation of the result. We confirmed the distribution of the administered solution in our system by a control experiment using a dye (Evans Blue) in place of SM-216289. After 2 days of administration of the dye solution, the blue color was widely distributed in the olfactory bulb. Thus the enhanced nerve regeneration is most likely attributable to the inhibition of Sema3A by SM-216289. It should be noted that the specificity of SM-216289 to other semaphorins remains to be studied. Our preliminary experiment suggested that SM-216289 inhibits Sema6C but at much higher concentration compared with Sema3A (data not shown). Recently, Shirvan et al. (49Shirvan A. Kimron M. Holdengreber V. Ziv I. Ben-Shaul Y. Melamed S. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Solomon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49799-49807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that anti-Sema3A antibodies rescued retinal ganglion cells from cell death following optic nerve axotomy. It would be very interesting to examine whether the antibody promotes regeneration of olfactory nerves. The essential issue that remains for future study is to appraise the recovery of function after axotomy. As regenerated axons reach the olfactory glomerulus, synapse formation with secondary neurons may be established. However, a careful physical and functional examination is required to establish that the regenerating axons reach their correct targets. This is the first evidence to support the hypothesis that the suppression of Sema3A activities in glial scar tissue promotes the regeneration of axons in adult animals. Although olfactory primary neurons are peripheral neurons, the regenerating axons traveled in the olfactory bulb of the CNS. Interestingly, in many CNS nerve injury models, the regeneration of injured nerves may be affected by Sema3A expressed in glial scars (23De Winter F. Oudega M. Lankhorst A.J. Hamers F.P. Blits B.

If semaphorin, especially Sema3A, in scar tissue is the major obstacle to the regeneration of CNS axons, SM-216289 might promote re-growth of the axons. SM-216289 is the first Sema3A inhibitor showing both in vitro and in vivo efficacy and is an excellent molecular probe to investigate the mechanism of Sema3A function. In addition, SM-216289 may be clinically useful as a pharmaceutical to promote neural regeneration, especially in therapy of some types of anosmia. Growing evidence suggests an involvement of Sema3A in the inhibition of regeneration of CNS axons after traumatic injury. Future studies will examine the effects of SM-216289 on CNS regeneration using animal models with other clinical relevance, such as spinal cord transections. We are grateful to Dr. K.

Except for the terminal regions (residues 1–10 and 91–95) that are disordered, the tertiary fold of the remainder of the protease is essentially identical to that of the individual subunit of the dimer. In the monomer, the side chains of buried residues stabilizing the active site interface in the dimer, such as Asp25, Asp29, and Arg87, are now exposed to solvent. The flap dynamics in the monomer are similar to that of the free protease dimer. We also show that the protease domain of an optimized precursor flanked by 56 amino acids of the N-terminal transframe region is predominantly monomeric, exhibiting a tertiary fold that is quite similar to that of PR1–95 structure. This explains the very low catalytic activity observed for the protease prior to its maturation at its N terminus as compared with the mature protease, which is an active stable dimer under identical conditions. Adding as few as 2 amino acids to the N terminus of the mature protease significantly increases its dissociation into monomers.

In HIV-1, a single copy of the protease, composed of 99 amino acids, is synthesized as part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein (Fig. 1) (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the initial critical step in the maturation of the protease involves the folding and dimerization of the protease domain in the form of a Gag-Pol precursor in order to catalyze the hydrolysis of the peptide bonds at its termini. The released active mature protease is expected to process the remainder of the Gag-Pol precursor and the Gag precursor at specific sites into the necessary mature functional and structural proteins required for viral maturation (1Oroszlan S.

Kinetics of the protease maturation from a model precursor containing only the two native cleavage sites, p6pol/PR at the N terminus and PR/RT at the C terminus (Fig. 1), showed that the reaction takes place in two independent sequential steps (7Louis J.M.

The first step involves an intramolecular cleavage at the N terminus of the protease domain concomitant with a large increase in mature-like enzymatic activity and the appearance of the transient protease intermediate containing the flanking C-terminal polypeptide. The transient protease intermediate that exhibits similar kinetic parameters and dissociation constant to that of the mature protease is converted in a second step to release the mature protease via an intermolecular cleavage (8Wondrak E.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4477-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The native transframe region that flanks the N terminus of the protease in the Gag-Pol polyprotein, comprises two domains, the transframe octapeptide (TFP) followed by the 48 amino acid p6pol, both separated by protease cleavage sites (9Candotti D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reactions using the full-length TFP-P6pol-PR (Fig. 1) at pH 5.0, optimal for catalytic activity of the mature protease and the autocatalytic maturation reaction, showed the release of the protease to occur in two distinct steps (2Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Louis J.M. Wondrak E.M. Kimmel A.R. Wingfield P.T. Nashed N.T. J. Biol.

In the second step, P6pol-PR is converted to the mature protease concomitant with a large increase in catalytic activity. Thus, the two proteins, TFP-P6pol-PR and P6pol-PR, exhibit nearly the same low catalytic activity and the rate-limiting intramolecular cleavage at the p6pol-PR site is indeed concomitant with the appearance of mature-like enzymatic activity and stable tertiary structure formation characteristic of a protease dimer (2Louis J.M.

These results are consistent with studies showing that HIV-1 particles of four different strains obtained from different cell lines contained only the 11-kDa mature protease and no p6pol-PR precursor (12Tessmer U. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3459-3463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, a mutation of the N-terminal protease cleavage site p6pol/PR leading to the production of an N-terminally extended 17-kDa protease species caused a severe defect in Gag polyprotein processing and a complete loss of viral infectivity (12Tessmer U. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3459-3463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mature protease has been the target of drug development and hundreds of crystal structures of the protease dimer bound to various inhibitors have been solved (13Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Vondrasek J. van Buskirk C.P. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This has contributed to a large database for improved design of drugs that bind to the active site. However, treatment of HIV-1 infection on a longer term without the emergence of drug-resistance against protease inhibitors has been a challenge for the past decade (15Condra J.H. Haemophilia. 1998; 4: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although second generation active-site inhibitors are being developed in an effort to overcome the problem of drug-resistance, strategies to define an alternative mode of inhibition such as disrupting or preventing dimer formation may provide another avenue toward inhibitor design (16Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These latter inhibitors may have a greater success in curbing the emergence of drug resistance. There have been published reports of dimerization inhibitors of the protease (17Schramm H.J. Billich A. Jaeger E. Rucknagel K.P. Arnold G. Schramm W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These studies have been hampered by the fact that monomeric protease is difficult to obtain since the mature protease is predominantly dimeric in solution with a dissociation constant < 5 nm (2Louis J.M.

To our knowledge there is no evidence for the existence of a folded monomer species during folding of the wild-type mature protease or structural data to support the dissociation of the dimer into a folded monomer. The existence of a folded monomer was recently observed only when unique dimer interface contacts were disrupted via mutations. These mutations increased the dissociation constant of the protease dramatically such that a monomer could be studied by solution NMR at a high protein concentration of up to 1 mm (in monomer) (24Ishima R.

A series of mutants PRR87K, PRD29N, PRT26A, PR5–99, and PR1–95 has been described to exhibit a monomer fold in the absence of inhibitor. Of these, only PR1–95 did not form a ternary complex with DMP323, an inhibitor that binds tightly (K I < 10–9m) (26Lam P.Y. Ru Y. Jadhav P.K. Aldrich P.E. DeLucca G.V. Eyermann C.J. Chang C.H.

The structure of the monomer together with the NMR relaxation results has allowed comparison of the structure of the monomer with the subunit of the uninhibited dimer. In addition, using an inactive precursor bearing the active site D25N mutation, termed TFP-P6pol-PRD25N (Fig. 1), we show that the protease domain of the uninhibited precursor is mainly monomeric, adopting a tertiary fold very similar to that of the PR1–95 monomer. Systematic analyses of NMR and kinetic data of protease constructs, flanked either by 4 residues or 1 residue of the p6pol sequence, suggest that local interaction and packing of the terminal Pro1 and Phe99 residues in the mature protease are critical to achieve native-like dimer stability. Finally, the above results are discussed in the context of a model for the regulation of the HIV-1 protease in the viral replication cycle (2Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtease Constructs—The protease (PR) domain in all constructs, optimized for NMR and kinetic studies, bears 5 mutations, Q7K, L33I, L63I to minimize the autoproteolysis of the protease and C67A and C95A to prevent cysteine-thiol oxidation (2Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (pET11a, Novagen, Madison, WI) encoding TFP-p6pol-PR and PR (2Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were used with the appropriate oligonucleotide primers to generate the constructs TFP-p6pol-PRD25N and PRD25N. Similarly, a stop codon was introduced to produce TFP-p6pol-PR1–95 and PR1–95. The PR-encoding plasmid was sequentially extended one codon at a time to produce SFNFPR. SFNFPR template was then used to introduce a D25N mutation. MIPR, MFPR and MGPR constructs were derived from PR. The initiator Met residue when not excised upon their expression in Escherichia coli is indicated as in the case of MIPR, MFPR and MGPR. All constructs were generated using the QuickChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown in minimal media containing 15N ammonium chloride with or without 13C glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively, at 37 °C and induced for expression. Proteins were prepared using an established protocol as described previously (24Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol.

Specific cleavages giving rise to products due to the autoprocessing of active precursor proteins were accessed both by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry.NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination—All 1H-15N correlation spectra were recorded using ∼0.5 mm protein in monomer (unless noted otherwise) in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.8. NMR experiments for structure determination of PR1–95 were carried out using 0.4–0.5 mm protein in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 in 95% H2O/5% D2O and a sample volume of ∼280 μl in a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi, Inc., Allison Park, PA). Spectra were acquired on DMX500 spectrometers with or without a cryoprobe (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA) at 20 °C. Backbone and side chain resonance assignments, and heteronuclear seperated proton NOESY spectra, for structure determination, were obtained using standard triple-resonance three-dimensional NMR experiments (27Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were obtained from 3JHNHα coupling constants, and χ1 angle restraints were determined from 3JNHβ coupling constants and NOESY data (28Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Residual 1DNH dipolar couplings were measured in 6% gel medium (29Tycko R. Blanco F.J. Ishii Y. J. Am. Chem.

Gels were prepared from a stock solution of 36% w/v acrylamide and 0.92% w/v N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide yielding a acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 39:1. Gels (280 μl) were cast to a diameter of 5.4 mm, rinsed in water overnight, dehydrated to about one-sixth the original size over a period of 5–6 h at 37 °C, soaked in protein solution (desired buffer and pH) for 16–20 h at room temperature and gently pushed into a Wilmad open-ended NMR tube (4.24 ± 0.012 ID) as described (29Tycko R.

The bottom end of the tube was sealed with a susceptibility-matched plug and the top with a regular, susceptibility matched Shigemi (Allison Park, PA) microcell plunger.NMR data were processed and analyzed using the nmrPipe, nmrDraw, and PIPP software (31Garrett D.S.

Studies characterizing the HIV protease monomer were not feasible until we recently demonstrated that mutations of the interface residues, such as D29N, R87K, or deletion mutants of the terminal residues 1–4 or 96–99, destabilize the dimer (24Ishima R.

While it is apparent that deletion of the terminal residues precludes the formation of the terminal β-sheet and disrupts dimerization, these studies also revealed that subtle intermonomer contacts formed by the conserved Asp29 and Arg87 residues are essential to the dimerization of the mature protease. NMR and equilibrium sedimentation analyses show that these mutants exhibit a monomer fold and a range of dimer dissociation constants. We chose to determine the monomer structure of PR1–95 because it is predominantly monomeric with no observable dimer formation up to a concentration of 1 mm, even in the presence of the high affinity inhibitor DMP323 (24Ishima R.

Although PR1–95 undergoes aggregation that limited the number of experiments performed as well as the acquisition time of individual experiments, all necessary data for a high resolution structure were obtained. 40 of 100 calculated structures converged without angle or NOE violations greater than 5° or 0.5 Å, respectively. PR1–95 is a β-rich protein, composed of seven β-strands and one α-helix. A superposition of 10 conformers depicted in Fig. 2 shows that the structure is well defined except for disordered terminal and loop segments.Fig. 2Overall stereoview of the PR1–95 structure showing the final ensemble of 10 NMR conformers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A backbone superposition of the average NMR structure with the monomer subunit of two different crystal structures of the free mature protease dimer (21Lapatto R.

As is apparent, residues 10–90 of the PR1–95 monomer exhibit a nearly identical fold to that of one subunit of the protease dimer. This similarity in structures is consistent with the backbone chemical shifts of the PR1–95 monomer compared with those of the wild-type dimer (Fig. 4A). Characteristics that distinguish the PR1–95 structure from the monomer subunit of mature protease dimer are (I) disorder of the: (a) N-terminal residues 1–10, (b) flap residues 48–54, and (c) residues 91–95 at the C terminus of the α-helix and (II) solvent-exposed active site residues, comprising mainly polar amino acids. Interesting aspects of these regions of the monomer structure are discussed below.Fig. 3Structural details of the protease monomer.

The lack of secondary structure of the N-terminal residues in the PR1–95 monomer is not surprising given that deletion of residues 96–99 precludes formation of the terminal interface β-sheet. The loss of the terminal β-sheet and chain flexibility observed for PR1–95 (Figs. 2 and 4) also occurs in monomer constructs such as PRT26A and PRR87K that contain intact terminal sequences. Thus, specific interactions distant from the terminal region clearly influence the stability of the termin"

It is important to understand the factors that influence production of these species, because two of them, CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP, have been proposed to be key neurotoxic intermediates in certain prion diseases. In this paper, we perform a mutational analysis of PrP synthesized using an in vitro translation system in order to further define sequence elements that influence the formation of CtmPrP. We find that substitution of charged residues in the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide increases synthesis of CtmPrP and also reduces the efficiency of translocation into microsomes. Combining these mutations with substitutions in the transmembrane domain causes the protein to be synthesized exclusively with the CtmPrP topology. Reducing the spacing between the signal peptide and the transmembrane domain also increases CtmPrP. In contrast, topology is not altered by mutations that prevent signal peptide cleavage or by deletion of the C-terminal signal for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition. Removal of the signal peptide completely blocks translocation. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model in which the signal peptide and transmembrane domain function in distinct ways as determinants of PrP topology. We also present characterization of an antibody that selectively recognizes CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP by virtue of their uncleaved signal peptides. By using this antibody, as well as the distinctive gel mobility of CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP, we show that the amounts of these two forms in cultured cells and rodent brain are not altered by infection with scrapie prions.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 2Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). PrPC, which is soluble and protease-sensitive, consists of an α-helical, C-terminal domain and an unstructured N-terminal domain. In contrast, PrPSc is rich in β-sheets, aggregated, and protease-resistant. The physiological function of PrPC is uncertain but may be related to transport of copper ions or protection from oxidative stress (3Brown L.R. Harris D.A. Massaro E.J. Handbook of Copper Pharmacology and Toxicology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 103-113Google Scholar). PrPC is unusual because it can adopt multiple membrane topologies. Most PrPC molecules are attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane through a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (this topology is designated SecPrP) (4Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

However, some PrPC molecules assume a transmembrane orientation when synthesized in vitro or in cells (6De Fea K.A. Nakahara D.H. Calayag M.C. Yost C.S. Mirels L.F. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. J.

These forms, designated NtmPrP and CtmPrP, span the lipid bilayer once via a highly conserved hydrophobic region in the center of the molecule (amino acids 111-134), with either the N or C terminus, respectively, on the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane. It has been shown that these species are generated in small amounts (<10% of the total PrP) as part of the normal biosynthesis of wild-type PrP in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, mutations within or near the transmembrane domain, including an A117V mutation linked to GSS as well as several “artificial” mutations not seen in human patients, increase the relative proportion of CtmPrP to as much as 20-30% of the total (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 12Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to define the mechanisms responsible for determining PrP topology during the translation process. We discovered that a non-conservative substitution (L9R) within the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence dramatically increased the proportion of CtmPrP (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Combining this mutation with a triple substitution (3AV) within the transmembrane domain resulted in a molecule that was synthesized exclusively as CtmPrP. These results indicated that the signal sequence as well as the transmembrane domain were major determinants of PrP topology. Work by Hegde and colleagues (9Kim S.J. Rahbar R. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26132-26140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that these two determinants act in mechanistically distinct ways. The signal sequence serves a dual function, first targeting the nascent polypeptide chain to the translocon channel in the ER membrane via binding to the signal recognition particle, and subsequently gating the translocon to allow passage of the N terminus into the ER lumen. In contrast, the transmembrane domain acts primarily to trigger integration of the polypeptide into the lipid bilayer. The combined action of both domains operating during the translocation process serves to regulate the proportions of the three topological variants of PrP. Regulatory factors associated with the translocon, in addition to sequence determinants within the PrP molecule itself, have also been shown to influence the final topology achieved (14Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory has identified several novel cell biological features of CtmPrP. First, CtmPrP contains an uncleaved, N-terminal signal peptide (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This characteristic makes CtmPrP unusual among other type II transmembrane proteins, most of which have internal signal-anchor sequences. Second, CtmPrP has a C-terminal GPI anchor in addition to a transmembrane domain, thus displaying an unusual, dual mode of membrane attachment (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, by using the L9R/3AV mutant, we found that CtmPrP expressed in cultured cells remains core-glycosylated and is retained completely in the ER (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This result implies that the protein is recognized as abnormal by the ER quality control machinery that monitors folding of newly synthesized polypeptides. A great deal of interest in the subject of PrP membrane topology derives from the possibility that topological variants of PrP may play an important pathogenic role in prion diseases. Although PrPSc is widely agreed to be the infectious form of PrP, there is considerable debate about whether it is the form responsible for neuronal loss in these disorders (17Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The amount, anatomical distribution, and time course of accumulation of PrPSc often correlates with the development of neuropathology and clinical symptoms, but there are notable exceptions to this association. These discrepancies have led to the hypothesis that alternate forms of PrP, distinct from both PrPC and PrPSc, are the proximate causes of neurodegeneration. One candidate for such a neurotoxic intermediate is CtmPrP. Two major pieces of evidence have been used to argue that CtmPrP plays a key pathogenic role. First, transgenic mice have been generated that synthesize PrP molecules carrying the A117V mutation or one of the other CtmPrP-favoring mutations (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 12Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Animals expressing the mutant proteins above a threshold level synthesize CtmPrP in their brains and spontaneously develop a scrapie-like neurological illness, but without PrPSc detectable by Western blotting or infectivity assays. This result implies that certain familial forms of PrP may be due directly to increased levels of CtmPrP. Second, mice have been constructed in which a wild-type hamster PrP transgene serves as a reporter of CtmPrP formation (12Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). When these animals are inoculated with mouse prions, the amounts of CtmPrP as well as PrPSc in the brain are found to increase during the course of the infection. This result has been interpreted to indicate that PrPSc induces formation of CtmPrP, which is then the proximate cause of neurodegeneration during infectiously acquired prion diseases. In this view then, CtmPrP is a key intermediate in both genetic and infectious prion diseases. Another topological variant of PrP that has been proposed as a neurotoxic intermediate is cytosolic PrP. Expression of an artificial form of PrP lacking a signal sequence, which presumably favors accumulation of PrP in the cytoplasm, has been found to be toxic to cultured cells and transgenic mice (18Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, there is debate about whether PrP is found in the cytoplasm under normal circumstances and, if so, what mechanisms are responsible for delivering it there. Based on the observation that cytosolic PrP accumulates in cells that have been treated with proteasome inhibitors, it has been suggested that some molecules are retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm from the ER lumen as part of normal ER quality control mechanisms (19Ma J. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 20Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, our experiments indicate that cytosolic PrP molecules represents untranslocated chains that have never entered the ER (22Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These chains, which are observed primarily under conditions of protein overexpression, contain an uncleaved N-terminal signal peptide and lack a GPI anchor. A key gap in the experimental evidence supporting roles for CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP in prion-induced neurodegeneration is the lack of data demonstrating that the amounts of these forms increase during the course of a prion infection. In part, this difficulty is due to the absence of direct methods for detecting CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP in infected cells and tissues. In this paper, we present characterization of an antibody that reacts with both CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP by virtue of their uncleaved signal peptides and our use of this antibody to assay CtmPrP and cytosolic PrP in infected samples. In addition, we carry out a mutational analysis of several sequence determinants in PrP to better understand the factors that influence the topology of the protein. Plasmids—Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding point mutations in the PrP signal sequence (Fig. 1A) were used to amplify a portion of the PrP DNA sequence by PCR. DNA fragments carrying the mutation were digested with HindIII and PshA1 and cloned into a pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) containing the WT mouse PrP sequence from which the HindIII-PshA1 fragment had been removed. Plasmids encoding PrP molecules with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) inserted at position 22/23, and with altered numbers of octapeptide repeats (PG0, Δ51-90; PG1, Δ51-82; PG2, Δ67-90; PG14, +9 repeats) have been described previously (5Lehmann S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11432-11438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Other PrP mutants were constructed by PCR (16Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All PrP coding regions carried an epitope tag for monoclonal antibody 3F4, created by changing residues 108 and 111 to methionine. Prior to in vitro transcription, plasmids were linearized with XbaI. In Vitro Translation and PK Protection—mRNAs encoding WT and mutant PrP molecules were transcribed using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and were translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) containing [35S]methionine as directed by the manufacturer, except that the final lysate concentration was 50%. Translation reactions were supplemented with microsomal membranes from mouse BW5174.3 cells (24Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4686-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or from canine pancreas (Promega). After translation, 5-μl aliquots of lysate were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in a final volume of 50 μl with or without 100 μg/ml PK (Roche Applied Science) in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100. PK was inactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5 min, and 12-μl aliquots were added to gel sample buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for analysis by SDS-PAGE. In some cases, PrP was immunoprecipitated from translation reactions (as described below) prior to SDS-PAGE. For enzymatic deglycosylation, PrP was eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads with 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and was then diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 0.33 units/ml N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, proteins were precipitated with methanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands on gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Scrapie Infection of N2a Cells—Highly scrapie-susceptible sub-clones of N2a cells were prepared as described (25Bosque P.J. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4377-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, N2a cells from the ATCC (CCL131) were first sub-cloned by limiting dilution. Each sub-clone was then tested for scrapie susceptibility by incubation for 3 days with an extract of N2a cells that had been infected previously with the Chandler strain of scrapie (26Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cells were then passaged for 6 weeks and analyzed for PrP 27-30 by cell blotting or by Western blotting after PK digestion. The susceptible sub-clone used for the experiment shown in Fig. 7 was designated N2a.3. It was used in the infected state, as well as in the uninfected state as a matched control. Transfection, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation—CHO and N2a cells were transiently transfected with PrP-encoding plasmids using LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 6 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 100-200 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix; Amersham Biosciences). Cultures were then lysed in 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and diluted with 10 volumes of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Diluted lysates were incubated with anti-PrP antiserum for > 1 h at 4 °C and then with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in RIPA buffer, and PrP was eluted by heating at 95 °C in gel sample buffer. Scrapie Infection of Mice and Hamsters—Tg(WT)/Prn-p 0/0 mice (E1 line) expressing wild-type PrP carrying a 3F4 epitope have been described previously (27Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Tg(L9R/3AV)/Prn-p 0/0 mice (B line) express mouse PrP carrying an L9R/3AV mutation and a 3F4 tag, a construct we have expressed previously in cultured cells (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Full characterization of these mice will be provided elsewhere. 2R. S. Stewart and D. A. Harris, manuscript in preparation. Scrapie inocula included the hamster 263K strain, the mouse RML strain, and the RML strain that had been passaged once in Tg(WT) mice to introduce the 3F4 epitope. To prepare inocula, infected brains were homogenized (10%, w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline using sterile, disposable tissue grinders. After clearing by centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min, the homogenates were diluted to a final concentration of 1 or 2.5% in PBS, and 25 μl was injected intracerebrally into the right parietal lobe of 4-6- week-old recipient mice or hamsters using a 25-gauge needle. Western Blots of Brain Homogenates—Brain lysates were prepared in 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 0.33 units/ml N-glycosidase F. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, proteins were precipitated with methanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting with 3F4 antibody. Antibodies—An antibody (anti-SP) that selectively recognizes forms of murine PrP containing an uncleaved signal peptide was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (TMWTDVGLCKKRPK; amino acids 14-27) that spans the signal peptide cleavage site at residues 22/23. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using both glutaraldehyde and 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma). Monoclonal antibodies 3F4 (28Kascsak R.J. Rubinstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J.

Mutations in the Hydrophobic Core of the Signal Peptide Increase the Proportion of CtmPrP and Reduce Translocation Efficiency—For these experiments, we translated PrP mRNA in the presence of microsomes from murine thymoma cells, which are efficient at adding the C-terminal GPI anchor (16Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were subsequently subjected to PK digestion to reveal protease-protected products corresponding to SecPrP and CtmPrP. NtmPrP was not quantitated in these experiments, because negligible amounts of this form are produced in the presence of thymoma microsomes (16Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We showed previously that substitution of arginine for leucine at position 9 (L9R) in the hydrophobic core (h-region) of the signal peptide had a dramatic effect on PrP membrane topology, with ∼50% of the translocated protein assuming the CtmPrP orientation, compared with ∼10% for WT PrP (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We then tested the effects of other amino acid substitutions at this site. The results are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table I (lines 1-12). Substitution of either positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) or a negatively charged residue (Asp) for leucine at position 9 increased the proportion of CtmPrP, with two non-polar residues (Pro and Gly) having very little effect. All of the substitutions also significantly reduced the efficiency of translocation (the total percentage of PK-protected chains) from ∼25% for WT PrP to 5-15% for the mutants (data not shown). To examine the effect of substitutions at another residue in the h-region of the signal peptide, we analyzed V13R and V13D. Both of these mutations completely abolished translocation (Fig. 1).Table IQuantitation of Ctm Prp produced by the mutants used in this studyConstructCtmPrP%1. WT12.42. L9R30.13. L9R/3AV87.64.

Open table in a new tab Previous work demonstrated that certain mutations in the transmembrane segment also increased the amount of CtmPrP. One mutation that has been studied extensively is the triple substitution designated 3AV (substitution of valine for alanine at positions 112, 114, and 117) (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When this mutation was combined with mutations in the signal sequence, an additive increase in the percentage of CtmPrP was observed (Fig. 1; Table I, lines 1-12). PrP molecules carrying the 3AV mutation along with substitution of a charged amino acid (Arg, Lys, and Asp) at position 9 were synthesized almost exclusively as CtmPrP. Lack of Signal Peptide Cleavage Does Not Cause Production of CtmPrP—We have shown previously (13Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that CtmPrP has an uncleaved signal peptide. However, it remained unknown whether the lack of signal peptide cleavage was a cause or a consequence of CtmPrP formation. To address this question, we introduced mutations that prevent cleavage by signal peptidase, and we assayed their effect on synthesis of CtmPrP. The -1 and -3 positions in the c-region of signal peptides have been shown to have the greatest influence on cleavage (30von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar); small polar residues are strongly preferred. We therefore substituted large, hydrophobic residues at these positions to block the action of signal peptidase (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B (lanes 2, 5, and 8) shows that these mutations had no effect on PrP topology. As in the WT molecule, PrP containing either G20W or C22Y substitutions produced primarily SecPrP, with ∼10% being synthesized as CtmPrP (Table I, lines 13-15). This result was verified by assaying the topology of these mutants in transfected cells (data not shown). The mutant C22Y/L9R/3AV produced 90% CtmPrP (Fig. 2B, lane 11; Table I, line 16), indicating that lack of signal peptide cleavage does not inhibit formation of CtmPrP. We confirmed that the signal peptide remained uncleaved in the G20W and C22Y mutants by observing the slightly reduced mobility of the SecPrP bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, compare lane 2 to lanes 5 and 8). We conclude from these results that lack of signal peptide cleavage is a consequence, and not a cause, of CtmPrP formation. Deletion of the Signal Peptide Prevents Translocation— CtmPrP has the topology of a type II transmembrane protein (N terminus in the cytoplasm). Most proteins of this type contain an internal signal-anchor sequence that initiates translocation by binding to the signal recognition particle, and also anchors the polypeptide chain in the lipid bilayer. To test whether the transmembrane segment of PrP could serve a membrane targeting function independent of the N-terminal signal sequence, we assayed PrP constructs in which the N-terminal sequence had been deleted.

Trl1 performs three reactions: (i) the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate of the proximal fragment is hydrolyzed to a 3′-OH, 2′-PO4 by a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD); (ii) the 5′-OH of the distal fragment is phosphorylated by an NTP-dependent polynucleotide kinase; and (iii) the 3′-OH, 2′-PO4, and 5′-PO4 ends are sealed by an ATP-dependent RNA ligase. Trl1 consists of an N-terminal adenylyltransferase domain that resembles T4 RNA ligase 1, a central domain that resembles T4 polynucleotide kinase, and a C-terminal CPD domain that resembles the 2H phosphotransferase enzyme superfamily. Here we show that all three domains are essential in vivo, although they need not be linked in the same polypeptide. We identify five amino acids in the adenylyltransferase domain (Lys114, Glu266, Gly267, Lys284, and Lys286) that are essential for Trl1 activity and are located within motifs I (114KANG117), IV (266EGFVI270), and V (282FFKIK286) that comprise the active sites of DNA ligases, RNA capping enzymes, and T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2. Mutations K404A and T405A in the P-loop (401GXGKT405) of the central kinase-like domain had no effect on Trl1 function in vivo. The K404A and T405A mutations eliminated ATP-dependent kinase activity but preserved GTP-dependent kinase activity. A double alanine mutant in the P-loop was lethal in vivo and abolished GTP-dependent kinase activity. These results suggest that GTP is the physiological substrate and that the Trl1 kinase has a single NTP binding site of which the P-loop is a component. Two other mutations in the central domain were lethal in vivo and either abolished (D425A) or severely reduced (R511A) GTP-dependent RNA kinase activity in vitro. Mutations of the signature histidines of the CPD domain were either lethal (H777A) or conferred a ts growth phenotype (H673A).

Intron-containing tRNAs are widespread in the archaeal and eukaryal domains of the universal phylogenetic tree (1Abelson J. Trotta C.R. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12685-12688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The intron is usually located in the anticodon loop of the pre-tRNA and must be removed precisely for the tRNA to function in protein synthesis. tRNA splicing occurs in two stages: (i) intron excision and (ii) joining of the broken tRNA halves (2Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Greer C.L. Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 537-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Unlike pre-mRNA splicing in eukarya, which relies on ribonucleoprotein catalysts, all of the reactions of the tRNA splicing pathway are performed by protein enzymes. The intron removal phase of tRNA splicing requires two incisions of the pre-tRNA at the exon-intron borders. The chemistry of the reaction entails breakage of the phosphodiester backbone by transesterification to yield 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-OH termini at both incision sites (2Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The breakage reactions are catalyzed by a tRNA splicing endonuclease that specifically recognizes the fold of the pre-tRNA (4Negri E. Fabbri S. Bufardeci E. Baldi M.I. Attardi D.G. Mattoccia E.

The specificity and fidelity of tRNA splicing are largely governed by the endonuclease component, which is conserved in structure and mechanism among archaea and lower and higher eukaryal species (4Negri E.

The joining phase of the tRNA splicing pathway has been studied most extensively in yeast, where a single multifunctional tRNA ligase enzyme (Trl1) catalyzes a series of chemical transformations at the ends of the broken tRNA half-molecules that eventuates in the formation of a ligated tRNA molecule containing a 2′-PO4, 3′-5′ phosphodiester structure at the junction (3Greer C.L.

The mechanism of the ligase component of yeast tRNA ligase resembles that of bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase, whereby RNA joining entails three nucleotidyl transfer steps: (i) ligase reacts with ATP to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)-AMP intermediate plus pyrophosphate; (ii) AMP is transferred from ligase-adenylate to the 5′-PO4 RNA end to form an RNA-adenylate intermediate (AppRNA); and (iii) ligase catalyzes attack by an RNA 3′-OH on the RNA-adenylate to seal the two ends via a phosphodiester bond and release AMP (11Phizicky E.M.

Trl1 is capable of modifying and/or ligating the ends of artificial RNA substrates such as oligo(A)16, oligo(U n G), 5′-(AUCUCG) n AUCUCG, and 5′-GGGCGAAUU (11Phizicky E.M. Schwartz R.C. Abelson J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2435-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which implies that Trl1 activity is not obligately linked to the processing of tRNAs. The final step in yeast tRNA splicing is the removal of the 2′-PO4 at the splice junction by the essential 2′-phosphotransferase Tpt1, which catalyzes the transfer of the tRNA 2′-PO4 to NAD+ to form ADP-ribose 1″-2″ cyclic phosphate (21Culver G.M.

RNA. 1997; 3: 1388-1400PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We are interested in the end-remodeling and strand-joining steps of tRNA splicing, which exemplify a general RNA repair pathway entailing the healing and sealing of broken RNA ends. Another well characterized example of RNA repair is the tRNA restriction/repair phenomenon elicited by infection of Escherichia coli prr strains with bacteriophage T4 (24Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 25Kaufmann G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). T4 infection activates a latent anticodon nuclease (PrrC) encoded by the host bacterium. PrrC specifically incises tRNALys at a single site in the anticodon loop. Depletion of tRNALys blocks phage protein synthesis and arrests the infection before it can spread. However, the T4 enzymes polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase 1 repair the broken tRNAs and thereby thwart the host defense mechanism. The enzymatic steps in tRNA splicing and tRNA restriction/repair are generally similar. The incision steps in both cases result in the formation of 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-OH termini (25Kaufmann G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). tRNA splicing requires two breaks in the backbone of the pre-tRNA to excise the intron, whereas tRNA restriction involves a single break in the mature tRNA. The healing and sealing steps of the phage-encoded tRNA repair pathway are performed by two separate enzymes (Pnk and Rnl1), whereas a single enzyme Trl1 performs these functions in yeast tRNA splicing. The structural basis for the T4 RNA repair reactions has been illuminated recently by extensive site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography (26Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26868-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27Wang L.K. Shuman S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29454-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the yeast Trl1 has received little attention during the past decade. Renewed interest in yeast tRNA ligase is warranted for two reasons. First, the discovery that yeast tRNA ligase is responsible for nonspliceosomal splicing of mRNA in the unfolded protein response pathway (31Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 32Gonzalez T.N. Sidrauski C. Dörfler S. Walter P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3119-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) extends the RNA repair paradigm to mRNA metabolism and holds out the prospect that there are other instances (yet to be discovered) in which RNA primary structure is altered by breakage and repair. Second, the phylogenetic distribution of Trl1-like proteins is surprisingly narrow, given the wide occurrence of tRNA introns. Trl1 homologs are found in several genera of fungi, including Saccharomyces, Candida, Schizosaccharomyces, and Aspergillus (32Gonzalez T.N. Sidrauski C. Dörfler S. Walter P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3119-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Trl1-like proteins are absent from the proteomes of archea and nonfungal eukarya. This may be because archaea and nonfungal eukarya use a different end-joining mechanism for tRNA splicing than do fungi (34Filipowicz W. Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1983; 32: 547-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Laski F.A. Fire A.Z. RajBhandary U.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

Indeed, there is evidence that mammals have two different pathways of tRNA splicing, a yeast-like mechanism yielding a 2′-phosphate at the splice junction and a second pathway in which the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate of the incised pre-tRNA is retained as the 3′-5′ phosphodiester of the spliced tRNA product (37Zillman M. Gorovsky M.A. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter pathway does not require phosphorylation of the 5′-OH of the cleaved tRNA (34Filipowicz W. Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1983; 32: 547-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Laski F.A. Fire A.Z. RajBhandary U.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, mammalian cells possess a nuclear 5′-OH polynucleotide kinase activity that could participate in the yeast-like pathway (38Shuman S. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10396-10404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the specific proteins responsible for tRNA ligation in archaea or higher eukarya have been identified, nor have their genes been cloned. A multifunctional Trl1-like enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity from wheat germ (39Konarska M. Filipowicz W. Gross H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Gegenheimer P. Gabius H.J. Peebles C.L. Abelson J. J. Biol.

Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6694-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the gene encoding wheat germ RNA ligase has not been identified, and there is no obvious Trl1 homolog in the proteome of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This scenario, in which the Trl1-like pathway in metazoa and plants is either redundant or performed by enzymes without recognizable structural similarity to fungal tRNA ligases, recommends Trl1 as an excellent target for antifungal drug discovery. As a trifunctional enzyme with an essential role in vivo, Trl1 is ripe for structure-function analysis. Soon after the Trl1 gene was cloned, the Greer and Abelson laboratories (13Xu Q. Teplow D. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6132-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Apostol B.L. Westaway S.K. Abelson J. Greer C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7445-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated an autonomous CPD domain within the C-terminal portion of Trl1 and an autonomous adenylyltransferase domain within the N-terminal portion of Trl1. The site of covalent AMP attachment was mapped to Lys114 (13Xu Q. Teplow D. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6132-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is located within a conserved sequence motif (KX(D/N)G; motif I) that defines a superfamily of covalent nucleotidyl transferases that includes T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2, DNA ligases, and mRNA capping enzymes (44Thogersen H.C.

Although the kinase function of Trl1 has not been assigned to an autonomous segment, the middle third of the Trl1 polypeptide bears some resemblance to the kinase domain of T4 Pnk (14Apostol B.L. Westaway S.K. Abelson J. Greer C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7445-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), especially with respect to the presence of the Walker A-box motif GXGKT (also known as the “P-loop”) that comprises the NTP binding site of T4 Pnk and numerous other NTP-dependent phosphotransferases (26Wang L.K.

Structure. 2002; 10: 1249-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The CPD domain of Trl1 resembles the so-called “2H” superfamily of phosphoesterases, which is defined by two copies of a histidine-containing motif HϕTϕ (where ϕ is a hydrophobic residue) (Fig. 2). Here we address the following outstanding questions. (i) Does Trl1 activity in vivo depend on all three putative domains? (ii) Is the physical linkage of the domains within a single polypeptide essential for Trl1 function in vivo? (ii) Where is the boundary of the adenylyltransferase domain? (iii) Is the limited primary structure similarity between Trl1 and other covalent nucleotidyl transferases functionally important? (iv) Is the limited similarity between Trl1 and T4 Pnk functionally relevant? (v) Are the histidines of the 2H motifs relevant to Trl1 function in vivo? To answer these questions, we established a plasmid shuffle assay to gauge mutational effects on Trl1 function in vivo. Our studies show that all three domains are essential, although they need not be linked in the same polypeptide. We identify five individual residues in the adenylyltransferase domain that are essential for Trl1 activity and conserved in all members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase family. In contrast, single mutations in the putative NTP binding P-loop of the kinase domain had no effect on Trl1 function in vivo. Our finding that single P-loop mutations severely decreased or eliminated ATP-dependent kinase activity but preserved GTP-dependent kinase activity supports the prior suggestion that GTP is the real substrate for the Trl1 kinase (15Westaway S.K. Belford H.G. Apostol B.L. Abelson J. Greer C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2435-2443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Belford H.G. Westaway S.K. Abelson J. Greer C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2444-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a double-alanine mutant in the P-loop was lethal in vivo and abolished GTP-dependent kinase activity, suggesting that the Trl1 kinase domain has a single NTP binding site of which the P-loop is a component. We report that alanine mutations of the signature histidines of the CPD domain were either lethal (at His777) or conferred a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype (at His673). TRL1 Genomic Clone—A DNA fragment containing the TRL1 gene plus 550 bp of 5′-flanking DNA and 220 bp of 3′-flanking genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using total yeast genomic DNA as template and primers that introduced a SphI site at the 5′-end of the amplified fragment and a SacI site at the 3′-end. The amplified gene was cloned into pUC18 to generate pUC-TRL1. A BamHI site was introduced immediately 5′ of the start codon of the TRL1 open reading frame (ORF), which, together with an endogenous BglII site overlying codon 338 and an endogenous SacII site immediately 3′ of the TRL1 stop codon (TAGACCGCGG), facilitated the cloning of truncated and mutated versions of TRL1 under the control of the natural TRL1 promoter and flanked by the natural TRL1 3′-untranslated region. Deletions and Alanine Mutations of TRL1—Deleted versions of TRL1 were constructed by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers that introduced either a start codon and a BamHI site or a stop codon and a SacII site at the desired positions in the TRL1 ORF. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and SacII and inserted into BamHI/SacII-cut pUC-TRL1. Alanine mutations and overlapping diagnostic restriction sites were introduced via the two-stage PCR overlap extension method (65Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). The mutated PCR products were digested with either BamHI and BglII or BglII and SacI (depending on the location of the mutation) and inserted into BamHI/BglII-cut or BglII/SacI-cut pUC-TRL1 in lieu of the wild-type gene fragment. The inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes during PCR amplification and cloning. Plasmids for Expression of TRL1 in Yeast—Wild-type and mutated versions of the TRL1 gene plus 5′- and 3′-flanking genomic DNA were excised from the respective pUC-TRL1 plasmids with SphI and SacI and inserted into yeast shuttle vectors pSE360 (CEN URA3), pSE358 (CEN TRP1), or pSA360 (CEN ADE2). Selected TRL1 alleles were cloned into the PstI site of pRS413 (CEN HIS3). Deletion of TRL1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—TRL1 was disrupted using a kanMX cassette (61Güldner U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar) flanked by 1-kbp tracts of yeast genomic DNA corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sequences flanking the TRL1 ORF. The disruption was performed in the diploid strain W303 (MATa/MATα, ura3–1/ura3–1 ade2–1/ade2–1 trp1–1/trp1–1 his3–11,15/his3–11,15 leu2–3,11–2/leu2–3,11–2 can1–100/can1–100). Integrative recombination at one chromosomal locus deleted the entire TRL1 ORF. Correct insertion of the kanMX cassette into the TRL1 locus was confirmed by PCR analysis of G418-resistant transformants. A TRL1 trl1::kanMX diploid was sporulated. Tetrad analysis revealed a 2:0 segregation pattern for G418 sensitivity/resistance, consistent with the essentiality of TRL1 reported previously (62Phizicky E.M. Consaul S.A. Nehrke K.W. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4577-4582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TRL1 trl1::kanMX diploid was transformed with pSE360-TRL1 (CEN URA3) and sporulated again. The resulting G418R/Ura+ haploid strain YRS1 (MATα ura3–1 ade2–1 trp1–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,11 can1–100 trl1::kanMX p360-TRL1) was unable to grow on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), a drug that selects against the URA3 gene on the pSE360-TRL1 plasmid. YRS1 was used to test the in vivo function of various mutant TRL1 alleles via the plasmid shuffle procedure. Test of Trl1 Function by Plasmid Shuffle—YRS1 was transformed with CEN plasmids bearing wild-type or mutant alleles of TRL1. Transformants were selected on appropriate drop-out media. Two individual colonies were transferred to drop-out agar medium, and cells from each isolate were then streaked on agar containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-FOA. The plates were incubated at 18, 25, 30, and 37 °C. Lethal mutations were those that did not allow formation of 5-FOA-resistant colonies after 7 days at any of the temperatures tested. Other mutated alleles supported 5-FOA-resistant colony formation within 4 days at one or more of the growth temperatures. Two individual colonies from each streak were picked from the 5-FOA plate, transferred to yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) medium, and then tested for growth on YPD agar at 18, 25, 30, and 37 °C. Plasmids for Expression of Trl1 in Bacteria—T7-based expression vector pET28a-His10 was constructed by replacing the MluI-NdeI fragment of pET28a (encoding a His6 tag) with the MluI-NdeI fragment of pET16B (encoding a His10 tag). The full-length TRL1 ORF was excised from pUC-TRL1 with BamHI and SacI and inserted into pET28a-His10 to yield pET28a-His10Trl1. Full-length mutated genes K404A, T405A, D425A, and R511A were similarly transferred from the respective pUC-TRL1-Ala plasmids into pET28a-His10 to yield pET28a-His10Trl1-Ala plasmids. The ORF encoding the adenylyltransferase domain Trl1-(1–388) was excised from pUC-Trl1-(1–388) with BamHI and SacI and inserted into pET28a-His10 to yield pET28a-His10Trl1-(1–388). DNA fragments containing adenylyltransferase domain mutants K114A, N116A, G152A, E153A, E266A, G267A, K284A, and K286A were amplified by PCR from the respective pUC-Trl1-Ala plasmids. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and SacI and inserted into pET28a-His10 to yield pET28a-His10Trl1-(1–388)-Ala derivatives. Recombinant Trl1 Proteins—Cultures (600 ml) of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET28-His10-TRL1 (wild-type or mutant) were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.06 mg/ml kanamycin until the A 600 reached 0.5. The cultures were adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyroanoside, and incubation was continued at 17 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% sucrose) and left on ice for 10 min. The suspensions were then sonicated for 30 s. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the suspensions were further incubated on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% and sonication was repeated for 1 min to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 18,000 rpm for 45 min. The soluble extracts were applied to 1.5-ml columns of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1%"

The LG4 modules of laminin α chains consist of a 14-stranded β-sheet (A-N) sandwich structure. Several biologically active sequences have been identified in the connecting loop regions. Here, we evaluated the biological activities of the loop regions of the E and F strands in the LG4 modules using five homologous peptides from each of the mouse α chains (EF-1: DYATLQLQEGRLHFMFDLG, α1 chain 2747–2765; EF-2: DFGTVQLRNGFPFFSYDLG, α2 chain 2808–2826; EF-3: RDSFVALYLSEGHVIFALG, α3 chain 2266–2284; EF-4: DFMTLFLAHGRLVFMFNVG, α4 chain 1511–1529; EF-5: SPSLVLFLNHGHFVAQTEGP, α5 chain 3304–3323). These homologous peptides showed chain-specific cell attachment and neurite outgrowth activities. Well organized actin stress fibers and focal contacts with vinculin accumulation were observed in fibroblasts attached on EF-1, whereas fibroblasts on EF-2 and EF-4 showed filopodia with ruffling. Fibroblast attachment to EF-2 and EF-4 was mediated by syndecan-2. In contrast, EF-1 promoted α2β1 integrin-mediated fibroblast attachment and inhibited fibroblast attachment to a recombinant laminin α1 chain LG4-5. The receptors for EF-3 and EF-5 are unknown. Further, when the active core sequence of EF-1 was cyclized, utilizing two additional cysteine residues at both the N and C termini through a disulfide bridge, the cyclic peptide significantly enhanced integrin-mediated cell attachment. These results indicate that integrin-mediated cell attachment to the EF-1 sequence is conformation-dependent and that the loop structure is important for the activity. The homologous peptides, which promote either integrin- or syndecan-mediated cell attachment, may be useful for understanding the cell type- and chain-specific biological activities of the laminins.

Laminins, multifunctional glycoproteins of basement membranes, have diverse biological activities, including promotion of cell adhesion, migration, neurite outgrowth, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Laminins consist of three different subunits, α, β, and γ chains. So far, five α, three β, and three γ chains have been identified, and at least 15 isoforms (laminin-1 to -15) are formed by various combinations of each subunit (2Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M.

These peptides showed chain-specific cell attachment activity with different receptor interactions, including integrins and syndecans, and some of the peptides promoted neurite outgrowth. Further, a cyclized form of the peptide, which interacted with α2β1 integrin, enhanced the biological activity. Synthetic Peptides—All linear peptides were synthesized manually using an Fmoc 1The abbreviations used are: Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HSG, human submandibular glands; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.-based solid-phase strategy and prepared in the C-terminal amide form as previously described (10Nomizu M.

Amino acid derivatives and resins were purchased from Watanabe Chemical (Hiroshima, Japan) and Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). The respective amino acids were condensed manually in a stepwise manner using 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxy or NovaSyn® TGR resin (Novabiochem). Dimethylformamide was used during the synthesis as a solvent. For condensation, diisopropylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxybenzotriazole was employed, and for deprotection of N α-Fmoc groups, 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide was employed. The following side chain protecting groups were used: Asn, Gln, and His, trityl; Asp, Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr, t-butyl; Arg, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl or 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl; and Lys, t-butoxycarbonyl. The resulting protected peptide resins were deprotected and cleaved from the resin using a trifluoroacetic acid-thioanisole-m-cresol-ethanedithiol-H2O (80:5:5:5:5, v/v/v/v/v) at 20 °C for 3 h. The crude peptides were precipitated and washed with ethyl ether and then purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Mightysil RP-18 column (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and a gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A cyclic peptide, cyc-EF-1Xm (CLQLQEGRLHFXFDC, X: norleucine), was synthesized using the synthetic protocol described above with some modifications. Since the methionine residue was easily oxidized during a cyclization step, the methionine residue was replaced with norleucine. Protected peptide resins were prepared on NovaSyn® TGR resin by the Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis. Treatment of the protected peptide resin with a solution of trifluoroacetic acid/1,2-ethanedithiol/H2O (95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v) at 0 °C for 2 h afforded a linear peptide, which was precipitated with ethyl ether. The linear peptide was cyclized by oxidation in a mixture of H2O/acetic acid/dimethyl sulfoxide (45:45:10, v/v/v, 1 mm) at room temperature for 2 days and purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Cosmosil 5C18-ARII column (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with a gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purity and identity of the peptides were confirmed by analytical HPLC and by a fast atom bombardment mass spectrometer (the GC-MS and NMR Laboratory, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University) or an ion-spray mass spectrometer (Kyoto University). Recombinant Protein—Construction of a plasmid for expression of a recombinant mouse laminin α1 chain LG4-5 module (rec-α1LG4-5) and preparation of rec-α1LG4-5 were carried out using similar procedures for the preparation of recombinant human laminin α3 chain proteins described previously (29Utani A.

The plasmid was transfected to 293T cells with the calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium with 1.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) was collected for 3 days at 12-h intervals, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) was added. The conditioned medium was applied to a protein A affinity column (HiTrap; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (buffer A). After washing, the bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.7) and immediately neutralized by 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The buffer was exchanged to buffer A using a desalting column (HiTrap; Amersham Biosciences). The rec-α1LG4-5 protein was detected with biotinylated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and streptavidin-peroxidase (Sigma) in Western blotting.

The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Cell Attachment Assay—Cell attachment assays were performed in 96-well plates (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) coated with either various amounts of synthetic peptides or the rec-α1LG4-5 protein. For peptide coating, various amounts of peptides in 50 μl of Milli-Q water were added to the wells and dried overnight at room temperature. For rec-α1LG4-5 coating, various amounts of rec-α1LG4-5 in 50 μl of buffer A were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The substrate-coated wells were blocked with 150 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in DMEM at room temperature for 1 h and then washed with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were detached with 0.02% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and recovered with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 20 min. After washing with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, cells (2 × 104 cells/100 μl) were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The attached cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet aqueous solution in 20% methanol for 10 min. After washing with Milli-Q water, 1% SDS (150 μl) was used to dissolve the stained cells, and the optical density at 570 nm was measured using a model 550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). For inhibition of cell attachment with heparin, EDTA, and peptides, human fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of either 10 μg/ml heparin, 5 mm EDTA, or various concentrations of peptides. For inhibition of cell attachment with anti-integrin antibodies, human fibroblasts were preincubated in suspension with 10 μg/ml of the anti-integrin antibody for 15 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Attached cells were measured as described above. Neurite Outgrowth Assay—For neurite outgrowth assays, a 24-well plate was coated with the indicated amounts of peptides as described above. After priming with nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, PC12 cells were washed with DMEM and seeded into the wells in serum-free DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in 5% CO2. The cells were fixed and stained with a 0.2% crystal violet aqueous solution in 20% methanol for 10 min. After the wells were washed, the cells were analyzed under a microscope. Actin Cytoskeleton and Vinculin Localization of Cultured Cells—Various amounts of peptides in 120 μl of Milli-Q water were coated on a Chamber Slide (Nunc) and dried overnight at room temperature. The wells were blocked by the addition of 1% BSA in DMEM for 1 h and washed with 0.1% BSA in DMEM. Then, fibroblasts (2 × 104 cells) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin in PBS, treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against vinculin (clone V284; Cymbus Biotechnology, UK) diluted to 10 μg/ml with 1% BSA in PBS overnight. Bound antibodies and actin filaments were labeled for 1 h with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody against mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted to 1:100 and 1:200, respectively, with 1% BSA in PBS, which also contained 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining. After washing with PBS, the cells were mounted with Permafluore (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and examined under an Axioplan-2 epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured with a Quantix CCD camera (Photometrics, München, Germany) and processed using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Deconvolution of images was performed with HazeBuster software (Vay Tek, Fairfield, IA). Cell Attachment and Neurite Outgrowth Activity of Peptides—Five homologous peptides (EF-1 to EF-5) derived from mouse laminin α chains (α1–α5 chains) were prepared based on the alignment of the LG4 modules (14Timpl R. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Andac Z. Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These peptides contained the E and F β-sheet strands and their connecting loop regions. First, we tested their cell attachment activity using human neonatal dermal fibroblasts, HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and HSG cells (Table I and Fig. 2, A–C).

PCC 6803), algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC2696), and higher plants (Spinacia oleracea). Remarkable species-specific differences of the optical properties of P700 were revealed monitoring the (3P700–P700) and (P700+·–P700) absorbance and CD difference spectra. The main bleaching band in the Qy region differs in peak position and line width for the various species. In cyanobacteria the absorbance of P700 extends more to the red compared with algae and higher plants which is favorable for energy transfer from red core antenna chlorophylls to P700 in cyanobacteria. The amino acids in the environment of P700 are highly conserved with two distinct deviations. In C. reinhardtii a Tyr is found at position PsaB659 instead of a Trp present in all other organisms, whereas in Synechocystis a Phe is found instead of a Trp at the homologous position PsaA679. We constructed several mutants in C. reinhardtii CC2696. Strikingly, no PS I could be detected in the mutant YW B659 indicating steric constraints unique to this organism. In the mutants WA A679 and YA B659 significant changes of the spectral features in the (3P700–P700), the (P700+·–P700) absorbance difference and in the (P700+·–P700) CD difference spectra are induced.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318 (references therein): 322-373Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar and 2Heathcote P. guest ed) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507 (references therein)Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In plants and algae, PS I is composed of the core complex and the light-harvesting complex LHCI. LHC I complexes do not exist in cyanobacteria. The PS I core complexes of all organisms consist of two large subunits, PsaA and PsaB, and at least eight smaller subunits (3Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, some differences between the cyanobacterial and chloroplast PS I core complexes exist. (i) In cyanobacteria, two additional small subunits, PsaM and PsaX, are found not present in algae and plants, which instead contain another four additional subunits, PsaH, PsaG, PsaN, and PsaO, not found in cyanobacteria (4Manna P. Chitnis P.R. Singhal G.S. Renger G. Sopory S.K. Irrgang Govindjee K.D. Function and Molecular Genetics of Photosystem I in Concepts in Photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2003: 253-279Google Scholar). (ii) Trimer formation of PS I is common for cyanobacteria but is not observed in algae and plants. (iii) Another difference can be found regarding the type of electron carrier proteins used to transfer electrons to the oxidized primary donor P700+· and their interaction with PS I (6Baymann F. Brugna M. Mühlenhoff U. Nitschke W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In Thermosynechococcus elongatus, cytochrome c6 is the only electron carrier, whereas in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cytochrome c6 or plastocyanin can be used, mainly depending on the nutrient conditions (7Rochaix J.-D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Although only the three-dimensional structure of PS I from T. elongatus is known (8Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar), it is generally assumed that the PS I core complexes, and especially the cofactor arrangement in the reaction center, are similar in all organisms despite the differences described above. The two large subunits, PsaA and PsaB, each consisting of 11 transmembrane helices, form the heterodimeric catalytic core and coordinate most of the cofactors involved in the electron transfer process except for the terminal electron acceptors FA and FB (two [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters) that are bound by one of the extrinsic subunits on the stromal side, PsaC. Besides the reaction center, this heterodimer harbors the core antenna system, together with some of the smaller integral subunits, consisting of about 100 chlorophylls and 20 β-carotenes. The primary sequences of these large subunits are highly conserved and the same holds for the primary photochemistry of the reaction center of PS I, although there is a discussion going on that in some species both branches participate in the primary charge separation whereas in other species only the A-branch seems to be active (9Guergova-Kuras M.

P700 being in the lowest excited singlet state donates an electron to the primary electron acceptor Ao, a chlorophyll a monomer. Charge stabilization is achieved by subsequent electron transfer to secondary acceptors, the phylloquinone A1 and Fx, a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster and finally to FA and FB. The x-ray crystallographic analysis of cyanobacterial PS I (8Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar) has revealed that the primary electron donor P700 of photosystem I is a dimer composed of one chlorophyll a and one chlorophyll a′ that is the 132 epimer of Chl a. The coordinating ligand of Chl a′ (PA) is provided by a His from PsaA (His-A676) (numbering according to Chlamydomonas throughout the text), whereas the one of Chl a (PB) is provided by PsaB (His-B656). Based on ENDOR spectra of P700+·, which exhibit nearly identical hyperfine coupling constants of the methyl protons of all investigated species, it has been concluded that the positive charge is mainly localized on PB (11Käss H.

For example, although the flash-induced (P700+·–P700) absorbance difference spectra of T. elongatus and Spinacia oleracea (spinach) are rather similar (15Hiyama T. Ke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 16Pålsson L.-O. Flemming C. Gobets B. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Schlodder E. Biophys.

Acta. 1972; 267: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and C. reinhardtii (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) look different.To investigate the reasons for species-specific differences, we were looking for differences in the primary sequences. In all organisms sequenced so far, the amino acid residues around P700 are highly conserved. Based on the 2.5-Å structure of PS I from T. elongatus, we searched for all amino acids located within a distance of 10 Å with respect to the magnesium atoms of PA and PB. The sequence comparison shows that the respective amino acids are identical for T. elongatus and spinach. Two differences exist between C. reinhardtii and T. elongatus. A Ser is found at position A654 instead of an Ala in T. elongatus. The exchange of this Ala against Ser using the program Swiss PdbViewer indicates that the Ser could be located close to PA between the vinyl and methyl side chains. Although the polarity of the binding pocket of PA might be slightly higher for C. reinhardtii, we do not expect that this amino acid residue has a significant influence on the optical properties of P700. A striking difference is a Tyr at position B659 in C. reinhardtii, whereas a Trp is conserved in all other organisms. For Synechocystis three differences are found, namely Gly instead of Ala-A675, Phe instead of Leu-A622, and a Phe is present at position A679 which is the homologous position to B659 on PsaA where Trp is always found in the other organisms. We did not investigate further the differences found for Synechocystis due to the mutagenesis system chosen (see below). Unfortunately, the amino acid sequence of Spirulina platensis is not available so far. The amino acid residues at positions B659 and A679 are the most interesting ones due to their close vicinity to P700 and the accessory Chls (within 4 Å). An additional interesting aspect of these residues is their location one helix turn toward the stromal side with respect to the coordinating ligands, forming a roof-like structure orthogonal to P700 (Fig. 1). In C. reinhardtii, the Tyr-B659 might be able to form a hydrogen bond to the keto group of the phytyl side chain of PB. This would be analogous to the proposal based on the crystal structure that the conserved Tyr-A731 might be able to form a hydrogen bond with the phytyl ester carbonyl oxygen of PA. As the single amino acid deviations mentioned above are the only obvious differences between the different species, site-directed mutagenesis has been applied to clarify whether these differences are responsible for the spectroscopic peculiarities of the species. For T. elongatus, it has not been achieved to perform site-directed mutagenesis whereas such a system is established for C. reinhardtii and this organism has been preferred as a model organism for the analysis of photosynthesis using (sitedirected) mutagenesis (12Krabben L.

Academic Press, San Diego1989: 25-64Google Scholar) and is easily amenable to genetic manipulation with the advent of chloroplast genome transformation and selectable markers. Site-directed mutagenesis in turn is a powerful tool to identify the role of individual amino acids and to study the relationships between structure and function of photosynthetic reaction centers.To get reliable information on species-specific differences, we measured and compared triplet-minus-singlet (T-S) difference, (P700+·–P700) absorbance difference, and CD difference spectra of PS I core complexes from various species all purified using β-dodecyl maltoside as detergent. To study the influence of the amino acid side chains described above on the spectroscopic properties of P700 and to gain further insight into protein-cofactor interactions, we mutated Trp-A679 to Ala, Tyr, and His, Tyr-B659 to Trp, Leu, Ala, and His, and Tyr-A731 to His in C. reinhardtii. The effects of these mutations were analyzed using steady state and transient absorbance difference spectroscopy. Additionally, we applied redox titrations and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, Chloroplast Transformation, and Growth Conditions—As the recipient of the donor plasmids, strain C. reinhardtii CC2696 was used which in contrast to wild type carries the DS-521 nuclear mutation leading to a deficiency in the Cab proteins and a deletion in psbA causing the loss of PS II. Therefore, this strain is well suited for the preparation and analysis of PS I core complexes.Chloroplast transformation and selection of the transformants on Tris acetate-phosphate plates containing 150 μg/ml spectinomycin were carried out as described previously (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).For enzyme purification, strains were grown heterotrophically in Tris acetate-phosphate and high salt medium/acetate medium (20Harris E. Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 25-64Google Scholar) at 26 °C under low light conditions and supplemented with spectinomycin for mutant strains.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the altered sites mutagenesis procedure (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) on psaA-3 and psaB. Following mutagenesis and sequencing, a ClaI-PstI fragment of psaA-3 was subcloned into pKR154 (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W.

Plasmid pG528G, which was used for the reintroduction of psaB, has been described before (22Cui L. Bingham S.E. Kuhn M. Käss H. Lubitz W. Webber A.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For mutations in psaB, the EcoRI-PstI fragment that encodes the psaB gene and part of rbcL was subcloned into pAlter-1 to perform site-directed mutagenesis.Preparation of PS I Core Complexes—Isolation of native and mutated PS I core complexes from C. reinhardtii CC2696 was performed according to Witt et al. (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and from S. oleracea (spinach) as described by van der Lee et al. (23van der Lee J. Bald D. Kwa S.L.S. van Grondelle R. Roegmer M. Dekker J.P. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The trimeric PS I core complexes from S. platensis have been prepared as described in Kruip et al. (24Kruip J. Karapetyan N.V. Terekhova I.V. Roegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18181-18188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), from T. elongatus as described by Fromme and Witt (25Fromme P. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 175-184Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and from Synechocystis PCC 6803 (kind gift of M. Rögner) as described in Kruip et al. (26Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Boonstra A.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23353-23360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Chl/P700 ratio has been determined for all PS I core complexes from all the species used in this work. It was calculated from the maximum flash-induced absorbance decrease in the Qy region due to photo-oxidation of P700 by using the molar extinction difference coefficients given under “Results” and from the flash-induced absorbance increase at 826 nm due to the formation of P700+· using an extinction coefficient of 7500 m–1 cm–1. For all PS I core complexes from all the species, the ratio is 100 ± 15. For the PS I preparations from C. reinhardtii and spinach, this gives evidence that virtually no LHC I is present bearing in mind that the Chl a/P700 ratio for PS I holocomplexes is about 200–250.After purification the native and mutated PS I core complexes from C. reinhardtii CC2696 were characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses in comparison to the PS I holocomplex isolated from C. reinhardtii CC125 where LHC I is still present. The same amount of native and mutated PS I from CC2696 and wild type PS I from CC125 was loaded in each lane of a gel, and Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against PsaF showed that PsaF is present at the same level in the purified PS I complexes (not shown). Western blot analysis performed with antibodies directed against PsaA, -C, and -D demonstrated the existence of these subunits. For the native and mutated PS I preparations from CC2696, a minor contamination by LHC I can be deduced both from the measured Chl a/b ratio of 15 ± 5 and from the Western blotting with antibodies directed against LHCI proteins. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined according to Porra et al. (27Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4580) Google Scholar).Transient Absorption Spectroscopy—Flash-induced absorbance difference spectra of (P700+·–P700) were measured at room temperature as described previously (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with PS I complexes diluted to 10 μm Chl in 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.02% β-DM, 5 mm ascorbate, and 10 μm phenazine methosulfate. The difference between the molar extinction coefficients of P700+· and P700 at the peak wavelength was calculated from the flash-induced absorption change of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD) according to Hiyama and Ke (15Hiyama T. Ke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). TMPD is oxidized by the flash-induced P700+·. An extinction coefficient of 12,000 m–1 cm–1 has been determined for oxidized TMPD (pH 8.0).For the light-minus-dark absorbance difference spectra at 77 K, PS I core complexes were diluted to 10 μm Chl in 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, 0.02% β-DM, 5 mm ascorbate, and 60% glycerol. Measurements were performed as described previously (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).To study the triplet state of P700, flash-induced T-S spectra have been recorded at 5 K. PS I core complexes were diluted to 10–15 μm Chl in 100 mm CAPS (pH 10), 10 mm MgCl2,10mm CaCl2, and 0.02% β-DM. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 65% (v/v). 10–20 mm dithionite was added to this solution under argon. The samples were then illuminated at 270 K for 3 min with a 250-watt focused tungsten lamp filtered by water and additional heat-absorbing filters. This procedure leads to the pre-reduction of the secondary electron acceptor A1 whereby further electron transfer to A1 is blocked. The primary radical pair P700+·Ao-· formed under these conditions recombines with a high yield to the triplet state of P700. Measurements were performed according to Ref. 28Schlodder E. Paul A. Cetin M. PS2001 Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Photosynthesis, Brisbane, Australia, August 18–23, 2001. CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne, Australia2001Google Scholar.Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectrometer at room temperature as described previously (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PS I complexes were diluted to 13 μm Chl in 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.02% DM. For the measurements the solution was divided into two samples. Ferricyanide (1 mm) was added to one sample to oxidize P700, whereas 5 mm ascorbate and 10 μm phenazine methosulfate was added to the second sample to keep P700 in the reduced state. Spectra of the samples with P700 oxidized or reduced were measured alternating. Oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the average reduced from the average oxidized spectrum.Redox Titration—To determine the oxidation midpoint potential of P700, the flash-induced absorbance change at 826 nm, associated with oxidation of P700, was measured as a function of the redox potential. Purified PS I complexes were diluted to 20–30 μm Chl in 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.02% β-DM, and the redox potentials were adjusted by adding ferricyanide and ferrocyanide. After each experiment, the potential was measured using a combination Pt/Ag/AgCl electrode (Schott PT5900A) which was calibrated against the redox potential of a saturated solution of quinhydrone as a function of pH. A pH-meter (Knick PHM82) was used to read out the redox potential. All redox potentials are given relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (normal hydrogen electrode).ENDOR—ENDOR measurements were performed on a Bruker ESP 300E X-band EPR spectrometer with home-built ENDOR accessories (29Rautter J. Lendzian F. Lubitz W. Wang S. Allen J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12077-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ENDOR experiments were carried out on the cation radical P700+· of PS I complexes in frozen solution at 150 K as described earlier (17Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C. Niklas J. Bordignon E. Carbonera D. Kohler S. Labahn A. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8557-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples contained between 3 and 5 mm Chl. P700+· was generated by continuous illumination at room temperature with two 150-watt halogen lamps equipped with a water filter (2-cm path length) and a 700-nm edge filter for 20 s followed by rapid freezing under illumination.ADMR Spectroscopy of the P700 Triplet State—Measurements were performed on thylakoid membranes that were diluted to 0.1 mm Chl in 100 mm CAPS (pH 10), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2. Oxygen was removed using a glucose/glucose oxidase system, and 20 mm dithionite was added under nitrogen. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 60% (v/v). The procedure for the pre-reduction of the secondary electron acceptor A1 was essentially the same as described for the flash-induced T-S spectra. Measurements were performed at 1.8 K. The absorption-detected magnetic resonance and the T-S microwave-induced spectra were recorded using the laboratory-built apparatus described previously (30Carbonera D. Collareta P. Giacometti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 115-128Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar).RESULTSBy applying standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques, we constructed several mutants in PsaA and PsaB of PS I from C. reinhardtii CC2696 to investigate the influence of Trp-A679 and Tyr-B659 on the properties of P700. No PS I could be detected in mutants where Tyr-B659 was replaced by Trp or Leu. This is very surprising for the Trp mutant because all other species have a Trp at this position. The native and the mutated PS I core complexes WA A679, WH A679, WY A679, YA B659, and YH B659 from C. reinhardtii were purified and spectroscopically characterized together with PS I core complexes from four other species (T. elongatus, S. platensis, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and S. oleracea) by steady state and transient absorption spectroscopy, circular dichroism, ADMR, ENDOR, and redox titrations.Mutant Phenotype—As the mutations were introduced into the Chlamydomonas strain CC2696, which in contrast to wild type contains the DS-521 nuclear mutation leading to a deficiency in the Cab proteins and a deletion in psbA causing the loss of PS II, PS I is the main chlorophyll-binding protein. It is therefore possible to detect consequences of the amino acid substitution on the amount of PS I by inspection of the phenotype. All mutants contain PS I amounts comparable with the native CC2696 except for YW B659 and YL B659 which show a yellow phenotype indicating the absence of PS I. The negative phenotype of YW B659 was confirmed by Western blots (not shown) using thylakoid membranes and antibodies directed against PsaA which did not show any detectable amount of PS I.Triplet-minus-Singlet (T-S) Absorbance Difference Spectra—To study the triplet state of P700, measurements were performed with PS I complexes under reducing conditions with the secondary acceptor A1 in the reduced state. Therefore, the electron transfer to A1 is blocked and the primary radical pair, P700+·A0-·, recombines to the triplet state of P700 with high yield. Fig. 2, A and B, shows the flash-induced T-S absorbance difference spectra of C. reinhardtii, T. elongatus, S. platensis, Synechocystis, and S. oleracea (spinach) detected at 5 K. These spectra reflect the absorbance difference between P700 in its triplet state and its singlet ground state. The spectra have been normalized between 660 and 726 nm to the same area assuming that the loss of oscillator strength upon triplet formation of P700 is the same in all species. The flash-induced absorbance difference spectra at 5 K attribut"

The mechanism for its cardiac-restricted expression is not yet fully understood. We previously identified a purine-rich negative regulatory (PNR) element in the first intron of the gene, which is essential for its cardiac-specific expression (Gupta, M., Zak, R., Libermann, T. A., and Gupta, M. P. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 7243-7258). In this study we cloned and characterized muscle and non-muscle factors that bind to this element. We show that two single-stranded DNA-binding proteins of the PUR family, PURα and PURβ, which are derived from cardiac myocytes, bind to the plus strand of the PNR element. In functional assays, PURα and PURβ repressed α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) gene expression in the presence of upstream regulatory sequences of the gene. However, from HeLa cells an Ets family of protein, Ets-related protein (ERP), binds to double-stranded PNR element. The ERP·PNR complex inhibited the activity of the basal transcription complex from homologous as well as heterologous promoters in a PNR position-independent manner, suggesting that ERP acts as a silencer of α-MHC gene expression in non-muscle cells. We also show that PUR proteins are capable of binding to α-MHC mRNA and attenuate its translational efficiency. Furthermore, we show robust expression of PUR proteins in failing hearts where α-MHC mRNA levels are suppressed. Together, these results reveal that (i) PUR proteins participate in transcriptional as well as translational regulation of α-MHC expression in cardiac myocytes and (ii) ERP may be involved in cardiac-restricted expression of the α-MHC gene by preventing its expression in non-muscle cells.

Myosin is a chemical-mechanical transducer of motion that acts by converting energy from hydrolysis of ATP into the sliding of myofilaments. The myosin molecule of striated muscles is composed of two pairs of non-identical light chains and two myosin heavy chains (MHC). 1The abbreviations used are: α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; PNR element, purine-rich negative regulatory element; ERP, Ets-related protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; UTR, untranslated region. Two expressed MHCs in the mammalian heart are α-MHC and β-MHC (1Weiss A. Leinwand L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These two MHC isoforms are differentially regulated, and this has considerable physiological relevance to myocardial contraction (2Barany M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The α-MHC promotes faster shortening velocity of cardiac myofibers because of its high ATPase activity, and hearts with predominant α-MHC contents have lesser ventricular systolic resistance and greater intrinsic capacity to generate blood flow (3Shroff S.G. Motz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H386-H394PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shroff S.G. Naegelen D. Clark W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H381-H394PubMed Google Scholar). The β-MHC, which has low ATPase activity, leads to greater economy of force generation, and hearts with higher β-MHC content have greater intrinsic ability to generate force (2Barany M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 3Shroff S.G. Motz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H386-H394PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shroff S.G. Naegelen D. Clark W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H381-H394PubMed Google Scholar). The relative distribution of the two MHC isoforms is developmentally regulated and varies considerably from species to species. In rodents, β-MHC is the predominant isoform in the embryonic heart, whereas α-MHC is the predominant isoform in the adult heart. As the animal ages, levels of α-MHC become suppressed again (for review, see Ref. 1Weiss A. Leinwand L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Unlike in rodents, ∼35% α-MHC mRNA and ∼10% protein content are expressed in the adult human heart, and this has been found to be reduced to undetectable levels in failing hearts (5Nakao K. Minobe W. Roden R. Bristow R.M. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2362-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6Miyata S. Minobe W.A. Bristow M.R. Leinwand LA. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The expression of the two cardiac MHC isoforms can be modified by various pathophysiological stimuli such as thyroid hormone, exercise, adrenergic stimulation, cell-contractile activity, and hemodynamic overload. During pressure overload hypertrophy, β-MHC expression is increased with or without reciprocal decrease of α-MHC (7Mercadier J.J. Lompre A.M. Wisnewsky C. Samuel J.L. Bercovici J. Swynghedauw B. Shwartz K. Circ. Res. 1981; 49: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8Boluyt M.O. O'Neill L. Meredith A.L. Bing O.H.L. Brooks W.W. Conrad C.H. Crow M.T. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, during heart failure, regardless of etiology, α-MHC is invariably reduced (5Nakao K. Minobe W. Roden R. Bristow R.M. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2362-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6Miyata S. Minobe W.A. Bristow M.R. Leinwand LA. Circ.

Res. 1994; 75: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In humans as well as in animals, considerable loss of α-MHC content has been implicated to be responsible for the reduced myocardial contractility during heart failure (5Nakao K. Minobe W. Roden R. Bristow R.M. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2362-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6Miyata S. Minobe W.A. Bristow M.R. Leinwand LA. Circ.

Res. 1994; 75: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for a causal link between loss of α-MHC and development of heart failure came from experiments in which α-MHC gene was ablated. Although homozygous α-MHC-/- null mice die in utero of gross heart defects, the heterozygous mice (α-MHC+/-) survived and had cardiac myopathies characterized by hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis (9Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinaska H. Hewett T.E. Biovin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These hearts had abnormal Frank-Starling pressure/force (length/tension) relations, suggesting propensity toward cardiac failure (9Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinaska H. Hewett T.E. Biovin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were also drawn from studies in which a mis-sense mutation was created in the cardiac α-MHC gene (10Kim S.J. Iizuka K. Kelly R.A. Geng Y.J. Bishop S.P. Yang G. Kudej A. McConnell B.K. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Vatner S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1780-H1787PubMed Google Scholar). Data showing correlation between declines of MHCs content and reduced intrinsic contractile characteristics of the myocardium also support the idea that a critical level of α-MHC content is essential for normal cardiac pump function (3Shroff S.G. Motz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H386-H394PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shroff S.G. Naegelen D. Clark W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H381-H394PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism behind the repression of α-MHC during heart failure still remains unknown. Much information has been accumulated about transcriptional control of α-MHC gene expression. Several positive regulatory elements and their binding factors have been identified such as GATA-4, TEF-1, MEF-2, SRF, and TR (thyroid receptors), which control high level expressions of α-MHC gene in cardiac cell background (11Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Molkentin J.D. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5056-5065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Adolph E.A. Subramaniam A. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Robbins J. J. Biol.

However, mutation of any of these elements does not eliminate gene cardiac specificity, suggesting that they alone are not capable of controlling cell-restricted expression of the α-MHC gene. Furthermore, several recent reports show discordance between the expression level of α-MHC mRNA and protein (15Ivester C.T. Tuxworth W.J. Cooper G. McDermont P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21950-21957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Weisner R.J. Ehmke H. Faulhaber J. Zak R. Rvegg J.C.

A. 1994; 91: 3468-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In several models of cardiac hypertrophy, α-MHC content has been seen to change independently of changes in the expression level of MHC mRNA, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism controls as well the expression of MHC in response to hemodynamic overload (6Miyata S.

We recently identified a highly conserved purine-rich negative regulatory (PNR) element in the first intronic region of the α-MHC gene (18Gupta M. Zak R. Libermann T.A. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7243-7258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element has some unique characteristics not found in other elements identified so far for α-MHC gene regulation. For example, mutation of the PNR element eliminated α-MHC gene cardiac specificity, resulting in its expression in non-muscle cells where it is normally totally inactive. The repression of α-MHC in cardiac hypertrophy/heart failure was no more apparent when the PNR element was removed, suggesting a role of PNR element in down-regulation of α-MHC gene expression during hypertrophy/heart failure as well (18Gupta M. Zak R. Libermann T.A. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7243-7258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results were also confirmed by others utilizing α-MHC promoter as a tool to design a cardiac-specific adenoviral expression vector (19Aikawa R. Huggins G.S. Snyder R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18979-18985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report cloning and characterization of factors binding to the α-MHC gene PNR element. We found that from cardiac nuclear extract two single-stranded DNA-binding proteins analogous to murine PURα and PURβ (for review, see Ref. 20Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bind to the plus strand of the PNR element but not to the minus strand, and they negatively regulate α-MHC gene transcription in cardiac myocytes. In addition, an Ets-related protein, ERP (22Lopez M. Oettegen P. Akbarali Y. Dendorfer U. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3292-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), derived from non-muscle cell extract, binds to the double-stranded PNR element and inhibits α-MHC expression to almost non-detectable levels. We also present evidence that the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, PURα/β, participate in transcriptional as well as translational regulation of α-MHC gene expression. Furthermore, we show robust expression of PUR proteins in the myocardium of animals and humans with cardiac failure, again underscoring their role in down-regulation of α-MHC expression in this situation. These data, thus, demonstrate a complex interaction of single- and double-stranded DNA binding proteins to the PNR element that serves to control cardiac-specific expression of the α-MHC gene. Plasmid Construction—The pXP2 luciferase (ATCC) vector was utilized to generate reporter plasmids. Promoter fragments of the α-MHC (-300/+100 and -74/+100) and Egr-1 genes (-56/+74) were amplified by PCR and subcloned immediately upstream of the luciferase reporter gene between the HindIII and KpnI sites of the pXP2 vector. PURβ and ERP expression vectors were generated by subcloning EcoRI/KpnI fragments of genes obtained from the pBS library screening into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of a cytomegalovirus expression plasmid, pcB6. The PURα expression vector (pcDNA3.1-PURα) was provided by Dr. K. Khalil (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA). To generate the pCAT-mRP reporter plasmid, a mRP-CAT fusion cDNA was first synthesized by PCR using the CAT gene as the template and a composite forward primer, comprising a HindIII site and the mRP and the beginning sequences of the CAT gene (AAGCTTGTGTCCCGGGAAGGGGGCAAGGTCTGCCGCCACCATG), and the reverse primer, complementary to the end of the CAT gene, including the stop codon and a XbaI site (GACTCTAGATTACGCCCCG). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into HindIII and XbaI sites of the pCAT3 promoter vector, in which the original CAT gene was deleted (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). Each construct was confirmed by dideoxy sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from 2-day-old neonatal rats as described before (28Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29677-29687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After differential plating to eliminate fibroblasts, myocytes were further purified using a Percoll density gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and plated at a density of 4 × 106 in 100-mm plates precoated with 2% gelatin. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Non-muscle cells were grown in growth medium containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sol8 muscle cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, and myogenic differentiation of cells was induced by exposure of confluent cultures to differentiation medium containing DMEM plus 10% horse serum. All cultures contained penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) and were maintained in atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cardiac myocytes were transfected 48 h after plating using Tfx reagent (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. Sol8 and HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The pCMV-β-gal was used as a reference plasmid in all transfections. After 48 h, transfected cells were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase (luciferase assay system, Promega), β-galactosidase activities, and protein content (Bio-Rad protein reagent). CAT activity was measured using a CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the protocol given by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Preparation of Nuclear Extract and the Mobility Gel-shift Assay— Nuclear extracts were prepared from primary cultures of purified cardiac myocytes or confluent HeLa cells according to the procedure as described previously (14Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the mobility gel-shift assay, single-stranded probes were prepared by 5 1The abbreviations used are: α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; PNR element, purine-rich negative regulatory element; ERP, Ets-related protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; UTR, untranslated region. end-labeling of single-stranded oligonucleotides with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP. Double-stranded probes were prepared by annealing the single-stranded probe with an excess of unlabeled complimentary strand oligo. All DNA probes were purified by gel electrophoresis. The analytical binding reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing ∼20,000 cpm (0.1-0.5 ng) of the labeled DNA probe, 2-5 μg of the nuclear extract, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor. The binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction mixtures were loaded on 5% native polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V in 0.5 × Tris-buffered EDTA buffer in a cold room. For competition and super-shift assays, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides or the antibody was preincubated with nuclear proteins at room temperature for 30 min in the reaction buffer before addition of the probe. The DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of Chicago, Genomic core facility, and RNA oligonucleotides were commercially made from Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO. Single-strand sequences of oligonucleotides used in the study are: PNR (+), 5′-ACCTAGAGGGAAAGTGTCTTCCCTGGAAGTGGGCT; PNR (+) mt, 5′-ACCTAGAGGGAAAGTGTCTTCCCTGGccGcGGGCT; PNR (-), 5′-AGCCCACTTCCAGGGAAGACACTTTCCCTCTAGGT; c-fos SRE, 5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT; P.Ets, 5′-GTCAGTTAAGCAGGAAGTGACTAAC; S.Ets, 5′-TCGAGCAGGAAGCATTTCCTGG; mRP-RNA, 5′-GUGUCCCGGGAAGGGGGCAAGGUC; mRP-RNA-mt, 5′-GUGUCCCGGCUUUGGGGCAAGGUC; mRP-DNA, 5′-GTGTCCCGGGAAGGGGGCAAGGTC; Y-box, 5′-CTGATTGGCCAA. Expression Screening of cDNA Libraries—Library screening was performed using standard screening procedures as described elsewhere (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A multimer oligo containing four concatenated copies of the PNR element was synthesized. This oligo was labeled by random priming and used as a probe to screen a λ-UniZap fetal rat heart or HeLa cell cDNA expression libraries (Stratagene, Inc.). The library was plated on Escherichia coli Y1090 on six 150-mm plates at a density ∼1 × 106 recombinant phage per plate. Plates were incubated at 42 °C for 3 h and then overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that had been saturated with 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Plates were incubated for an additional 6 h at 37 °C. Replica filters were lifted from each plate and hybridized with the probe in a hybridization buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% nonfat milk for 24 h at 37 °C. Filters were then washed four times in the hybridization buffer at room temperature and exposed for autoradiography. Potential positives were pooled and re-screened. After three rounds of screening, two positive clones were selected. They were re-lifted on new filters, and each filter was then cut in half. Each half was then hybridized with the labeled probe in the presence of either unlabeled wild-type or mutated oligos. Other Analytical Procedures—Heart failure in rabbits was produced by combined volume and pressure overloads from aortic insufficiency and aortic constriction as previously described (52Davis F.J. Gupta M. Pogwizd S.M. Bacha E. Jeevanandam V. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1521-H1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human heart samples were obtained from the University of Chicago Cardiac Transplant Program (procedures involving the use of human tissue were approved by The University Institutional Review Board). Left ventricular samples from five end-stage heart failure patients and two from non-failing hearts were analyzed. Control myocardial samples were obtained intraoperatively from the posteromedial ventricular wall from non-failing patients undergoing valve replacement. Failing left ventricular samples were obtained from diseased hearts that were removed during heart transplant. The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. Western blot, Southern blot, and Northern blot analyses were carried out essentially as described before (14Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gupta M. Zak R. Libermann T.A. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7243-7258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29677-29687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA and poly(A+) RNA were prepared using the RNA isolation kit of Ambion, Inc. For Northern analysis of the rabbit α-MHC mRNA, a synthetic oligo complementary to the unique 3′-untranslated sequences of the transcript was utilized. The sequence of the rabbit α-MHC probe was 5′-CAGGCACTCGTGTTTATTGCGGGTTAACAAGAGCGGGGTTC. Proteins were in vitro synthesized using a TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system of Promega. We have previously identified a highly conserved PNR element in the first intronic region of the α-MHC gene. This element was found to be essential for cardiac-specific expression of the α-MHC gene. Mutation of the PNR element eliminated cardiac-specificity of the gene, resulting in high levels of expression of α-MHC gene in non-muscle cells (HeLa), where it was normally totally inactive (Fig. 1A). In mobility gel-shift analyses, the double-strand PNR oligo produced two different mobility complexes from muscle and non-muscle cell nuclear extracts, a doublet of high mobility complex with cardiac extract, and two slow mobility complexes with HeLa cell extracts (Fig 1B). Cloning and Characterization of Cardiac Nuclear Proteins Binding to the PNR Element—To identify the cardiac factor(s) that binds to this element, a rat heart cDNA library was screened with an oligo probe containing multimers of the PNR element. After several rounds of screening, two positive plaques were selected, and each was re-plated onto separate plates and lifted onto isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-saturated new filters. The specificity of these clones was tested by cutting the filter in two halves and probing each half with the labeled PNR oligo probe in the presence of either a 100 m excess of unlabeled wild-type PNR oligo or unlabeled mutated PNR oligo. For both clones, the excess of unlabeled wild-type PNR oligo effectively competed for probe binding, but the unlabeled mutated oligo did not, indicating that each clone encoded a protein that specifically binds to PNR sequences (Fig. 1C). Both clones contained an ∼1.4-kilobase cDNA insert and, by in vitro protein synthesis, produced ∼44- and ∼46-kDa molecular mass proteins (Fig. 1D). The amino acid sequences deduced from the corresponding nucleotide sequences of each clone suggested that both were structurally highly related proteins. A GenBank™ data base search revealed that the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame of these clones were identical to the cDNA sequence previously characterized for mouse PURα and PURβ proteins (21Kelm R.J.

PURα and PURβ have been previously shown to participate in tissue-specific regulation of several genes, including the smooth muscle-specific expression of vascular-α-actin gene and the neuronal-specific expression of FE65 gene (23Kelm R.J.

To test whether a single strand or coding or non-coding strand of the PNR element was capable of binding to cardiac factors, we carried out mobility gel-shift analysis using PNR sense (+) and/or antisense (-) sequence as probes. As shown in Fig. 2A, PNR plus strand generated a specific complex (doublet, C1 and C2) with the cardiac nuclear extract (lane 2); however, no detectable complex was formed with the minus strand (lane 5). When the double-stranded PNR oligo was used as a probe, in which only the plus strand was labeled, again a specific-complex was generated (lane 8). However, no complex was formed when the minus strand was labeled (lane 11). These results demonstrated that only the plus strand of PNR was recognized by cardiac factors binding to this element. To further characterize these complexes we incubated nuclear extract with polyclonal antibodies against PURα and PURβ proteins and analyzed complexes by the gel-shift assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, PURα and PURβ antibodies super-shifted and abolished the complex generated by the PNR plus strand. In this assay we also used antibodies against MSY-1, another single-stranded DNA binding protein (25Kelm R.J. Elder P.K. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38268-38275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but no specific super-shifted complex was detected (Fig. 2B, lanes 9 and 10). These results, thus, confirmed that two mutually related proteins from cardiac nuclear extract, PURα and PURβ, bind to the α-MHC gene PNR element. Characterization of Non-muscle Cell Nuclear Proteins Binding to the PNR Element—To characterize non-muscle factor(s) binding to PNR, a series of gel-shift analyses were performed using HeLa cell nuclear extract and single- or double-stranded PNR oligos as probes. As shown in Fig. 3A, the PNR plus strand produced four different complexes with HeLa cell extract (C1, C2, NS-1, and NS-2), whereas only two complexes (NS-1 and NS-2) were generated by the minus strand (lane 2). Because NS-1 and NS-2 complexes were produced by both the plus and the minus strand of the PNR, we considered them to be nonspecific. We then used double-stranded PNR oligo as a probe, wherein both the plus and the minus strands were labeled. This probe generated two additional complexes, H1 and H2 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Additionally, when the PNR minus strand was labeled and annealed with an excess of the cold plus strand, the resulting probe produced only the H1 and H2 complexes and no C1 or C2 complexes (Fig. 3A, lane 4). From these results, we concluded that C1 and C2 complexes were"

Transfections of renin-expressing Calu-6 cells with reporter constructs showed that a cis-acting 34-nucleotide AU-rich “renin stability regulatory element” in the REN 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) contributes to basal REN mRNA instability. Yeast three-hybrid screening with the REN 3′-UTR as bait isolated HADHB (hydroxyacyl-CoAdehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (trifunctional protein) β-subunit) as a novel REN mRNA-binding protein. Recombinant HADHB bound specifically to the 3′-UTR of REN mRNA, as did the known mRNA stabilizers HuR and CP1 (poly(C)-binding protein-1). This required the renin stability regulatory element. Forskolin, which augments REN mRNA stability in Calu-6 cells, increased binding of several proteins, including HuR and CP1, to the REN 3′-UTR, whereas 4-bromocrotonic acid, a specific thiolase inhibitor, decreased binding and elevated renin protein levels. Upon decreasing HADHB mRNA with RNA interference, renin protein and mRNA stability increased, whereas RNA interference against HuR caused these to decrease. Immunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-PCR of Calu-6 extracts confirmed that HADHB, HuR, and CP1 each associate with REN mRNA in vivo. Intracellular imaging revealed distinct localization of HADHB to mitochondria, HuR to nuclei, and CP1 throughout the cell. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated enrichment of HADHB in renin-producing renal juxtaglomerular cells. In conclusion, HADHB, HuR, and CP1 are novel REN mRNA-binding proteins that target a cis-element in the 3′-UTR of REN mRNA and regulate renin production. cAMP-mediated increased REN mRNA stability may involve stimulation of HuR and CP1, whereas REN mRNA decay may involve thiolase-dependent pathways.

Renin, secreted by renal juxtaglomerular cells, is rate-limiting in angiotensin II generation and regulated by perturbations in NaCl delivery to the distal nephron and renal perfusion pressure (1Morris B.J.

Thus, the human renin gene (REN) requires tight control to ensure expression appropriate to need. A better understanding of this is necessary in view of the importance of the renin system as a major therapeutic target in hypertension. We have found that REN expression is subject to both transcriptional (2Ying L.-H. Morris B.J. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol.

The REN 3′-UTR is relatively short (196 nucleotides) and lacks classical AREs. Here we sought to identify novel REN 3′-UTR cis-elements and binding proteins, and found interactions involving HADHB (hydroxyacyl-CoAdehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (trifunctional protein) β-subunit), HuR, and CP1 that are likely to play a major role in the regulation of human renin expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The renin-expressing human pulmonary adenocarcinoma Calu-6 cell line was maintained as described previously (30van der Weyden L. Adams D.J. Morris B.J. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Plasmids—All pLuc plasmids (see Fig. 1A) were generated on a pIND backbone (Invitrogen). pLucSV was created by transferring nucleotides 245–2194 from the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega) as a HindIII/BamHI fragment into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pIND. pLucUTR was made by transferring the REN 3′-UTR from IMAGE clone 2161619 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AI480334) as a HindIII/EcoRV fragment into pGem-7Zf+ (Promega) and then into pIND as a BamHI/XbaI fragment (see Fig. 1A). pLucMUT and pRH3′-MUT were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, oligonucleotides UTR-Mut5′ (5′-gacccctgcaccagcccttcgcgactttgaggacaaagagaataaagactttcgcgacacaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-3′) and UTR-Mut3′ (5′-tttttttttttttttttgtgtcgcgaaagtctttattctctttgtcctcaaagtcgcgaagggctggtgcaggggtc-3′) were annealed to these plasmids, extended using PCR High Fidelity SuperMix (Invitrogen) to introduce two NruI sites for subsequent digestion by NruI, and religated to remove the flanked sequence. pLucSV-SRE was generated by introducing the 34-bp renin stability regulatory element (REN-SRE) into pLucSV using primers 5′SV-SRE (5′-ggcggaaagatcgccgtgtaattcctttgaggacaaagagaataaagacttcatgttcggggcggccggccgcttcgagc-3′) and 3′SVSRE (5′-gctcgaagcggccggccgccccgaacatgaagtctttattctctttgtcctcaaaggaattacacggcgatctttccgcc-3′). The pCMV-SEAP plasmid has been described previously (30van der Weyden L. Adams D.J. Morris B.J. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs used in the yeast three-hybrid system included pRH3′ (“bait”), pYESTrp2 (“prey”), and pRH3′-IRE/pYESTrp2-IRP (positive control “bait/prey” interactors) (RNA-Protein Hybrid Hunter™ kit, Invitrogen) (see Fig. 1B). The REN 3′-UTR (nucleotides 1310–1457 of GenBank™/EBI accession number E01074) was cloned into plasmid pRH3′ from IMAGE clone 2161619 as a blunt-ended BbvCI/HindIII fragment and termed pRH3′-UTR. For riboprobe generation, specific REN 3′-UTR fragments were generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene) (see Fig. 1C). GST-HADHB was generated by cloning cDNA from pYESTrp2 into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) (see Fig. 1D). GST-HADHB protein was generated in DH5α as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). GST-HuR (a gift from Dr. Henry Furneaux, University of Connecticut Health Center) was generated from pGEX-2T-HuR as described (31Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

Day N. Trifillis P.M. Methods. 1999; 17: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Brisbane, Australia, and the Department of Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital).Transient Transfection Assays—Calu-6 cells (1.5 × 105) were cotransfected with 1 μg of ecdysone receptor plasmid pRXR (Invitrogen); 1 μg of pLucUTR, pLucMUT, pLucSV, or pLucSV-SRE; and 500 ng of pCMV-SEAP (transfection efficiency control) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 25 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen). After a further 24 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase was measured using the luciferase assay system from Promega. SEAP (Great Escape™ SEAP assay kit, Roche Diagnostics) was assayed in cell medium collected prior to ponasterone A addition.Yeast Three-hybrid Screen—Budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells (strain L40uraMS2, genotype MAT a, ura3-52, leu2-3112, his3Δ200, trp1Δ1, ade2, LYS2::(LexA op)4-HIS3, ura3::(LexA-op)8-lacZ and pLexA/MS2/Zeo) were supplied with the RNA-Protein Hybrid Hunter™ kit. Yeast cells were maintained on plates of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, ant 2% agar at 30 °C and transformed with pRH3′-UTR, pRH3′-MUT, or pRH3′-IRP by the lithium acetate method (33Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on minimal essential medium YC plates (DOBA™ and CSM™, Bio 101, Inc.) deficient in uracil (YC-Ura- medium) to ensure maintenance of their pRH3′ plasmid. Those containing pRH3′-UTR were amplified in YC-Ura- medium and transformed with 250 μg of pYESTrp2 plasmids from a randomly primed human kidney cDNA library (Invitrogen). The transformants were plated onto YC plates deficient in uracil, tryptophan, and histidine, and false positives were eliminated based on ability to grow in the presence of 5 mm 5-fluoroorotic acid (Sigma) (34Park Y.W.

The medium was replenished; and 12–24 h later, the cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin for 24 h or a specific thiolase inhibitor, 4-bromocrotonic acid (4-BCA; 100 μm), for 8 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described (30van der Weyden L. Adams D.J. Morris B.J. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 39Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T.

Cells were scraped from the culture dishes with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 4 min at 450 × g (Jouan C3-12 centrifuge) at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded, washed with unlabeled PBS, and recentrifuged. Cell pellets were incubated with cytoplasmic extract buffer (10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with freshly added protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Diagnostics)) for 20 min and then centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein was quantified by the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal.

Briefly, following incubation at 22 °C for 30 min, 0.3 units of RNase T1 (Roche Diagnostics) was added for 10 min, followed by 50 μg of heparin (Sigma) for 10 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide gel, dried, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In RNA competition assays, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled sense RNA transcript (e.g. REN or pBluescript) was preincubated with the extract for 30 min at 22 °C prior to incubation with the labeled probe as described above. In some assays, antibodies to specific RNA-binding proteins (HADHB, HuR, and CP1) were added as described (25Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L.

After adding heparin, samples were placed on ice in a microtiter tray, UV-irradiated for 30 min, incubated with 20 μg of RNase A (Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C for 15 min, and boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer. RNA-protein complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a PhosphorImager using14C-labeled Rainbow molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoblotting for HADHB, HuR, and CP1 Proteins—A portion of the UV-cross-linked gel (see above) was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Osmonics, Inc., Minnetonka, MA) at 35 V overnight in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.02% SDS. After blocking with 10% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) at 22 °C for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-HADHB polyclonal antibody (1:2000; from Dr. Arnold Strauss, Vanderbilt University), mouse anti-HuR monoclonal antibody 19F12 (1:2000; from Dr. Henry Furneaux), or anti-CP1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; from Dr. Maria Czyzyk-Krzeska, University of Cincinnati) for 1–2 h at 22 °C, followed by secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences); and the proteins were visualized by ECL Plus reagents on ECL Hyperfilm (both from Amersham Biosciences).Thiolase Inhibitor Studies—Freshly seeded Calu-6 cells (4 × 105) were treated with either 100 μm 4-BCA (45Schulz H.

At the time points indicated, cells were collected and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes and then blocked overnight in 5% (w/v) skim milk. Membranes were incubated sequentially with rabbit anti-renin polyclonal antibody (1:350; a gift from Roche Diagnostics) and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:30,000; Sigma) for 2.5 h each. Immune complexes were visualized by incubation of the membranes with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (FAST tablets, Sigma) for 2–5 min. Blots were scanned and quantified using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad).Immunoprecipitation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Assay— Calu-6 cells grown to ∼70% confluence in 10-cm dishes were washed with PBS, trypsinized, washed again with PBS, and then lysed in 1 ml of cytoplasmic extract buffer (see REMSA procedures described above) on ice for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 11,500 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed to fresh tubes. Anti-HADHB antibody (10 μl), anti-HuR antibody (10 μg), anti-CP1 antibody (10 μg), anti-p21WAF1 monoclonal antibody 15091A (BD Biosciences) or no antibody was added to lysates and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Fifty μl of a 50% slurry of a mixture of protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) and protein G beads (Sigma) (pre-swollen and equilibrated in cytoplasmic extract buffer) was added to each sample and incubated for a further 60 min. After centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 2 min, the supernatants were removed; the pelleted beads were washed five times with cold cytoplasmic extract buffer; and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega) to eliminate any genomic DNA, and RT was performed using random hexamers (Promega) and Superscript II (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. PCR was performed for 40 cycles, with annealing at 55 °C, using primers REN-F (5′-gtg ggg tca tcc acc ttg ctc-3′) and REN-R (5′-cct gaa ata cat agt ccg cgc agg t-3′), flanking an intron site within REN cDNA to avoid any genomic DNA effect. PCR products (∼235 bp) were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels.RNA Interference (RNAi) Experiments—Small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were designed 261 and 88 nucleotides 3′ of the first ATG codon in HADHB and HuR mRNAs, respectively. A 21-mer of each was generated with an 8-mer (cct gtc tc) tagged to the 3′-end for T7 priming. Selected sequences were subjected to a BLAST search to determine specificity for the HADHB and HuR genes: HADHB target mRNA, 5′-aa gac aug cca cau gau u-3′; antisense HADHB siRNA oligonucleotide template (with U residues replaced by T residues), 5′-aa gac ctg atg cca cat gat t cct gtc tc-3′; sense HADHB siRNA oligonucleotide template, 5′-aa aat cat gtg gca tca ggt c cct gtc tc-3′; HuR target mRNA, 5′-aa cau gac cca gga uga guu a-3′; antisense HuR siRNA oligonucleotide template, 5′-aa cat gac cca gga tga gtt a cct gtc tc; sense HuR siRNA template, 5′-aa taa ctc atc ctg ggt cat g cct gtc tc-3′; antisense nonsense siRNA oligonucleotide template, 5′-aa tgt cac gag att aca cca t cct gtc tc-3′; and sense nonsense siRNA oligonucleotide template, 5′-aa atg gtg taa tct cgt gac a cct gtc tc-3′.siRNA transcription templates (double-stranded DNA) were generated using an Ambion siRNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After annealing of T7 promoter sequence to siRNA oligonucleotides, double-stranded RNA was generated by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Leader sequences were removed by RNase T1 and DNase I. siRNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and integrity was determined by PAGE.Calu-6 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 2-cm 6-well plates and transfected the next day with siRNA (100 nm/well) using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) as recommended. After 4 h, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 5% fetal calf serum; and then 24 h post-transfection, either cells were harvested for protein, or actinomycin D (ActD) chase assay was performed, and RNA was extracted for RT-PCR.For protein preparation and Western blotting, cells were lysed in total protein lysis buffer (250 μl/well; 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) for total protein was performed.

https://openalex.org/W1972528428,"The hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics by class A β-lactamases is a common cause of bacterial resistance to these agents. The β-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) is able to bind and inhibit several class A β-lactamases, including TEM-1 β-lactamase and SME-1 β-lactamase. Although the TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes share 33% amino acid sequence identity and a similar fold, they differ substantially in surface electrostatic properties and the conformation of a loop-helix region that BLIP binds. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed to identify the residues on BLIP that contribute to its binding affinity for each of these enzymes. The results indicate that the sequence requirements for binding are similar for both enzymes with most of the binding free energy provided by two patches of aromatic residues on the surface of BLIP. Polar residues such as several serines in the interface do not make significant contributions to affinity for either enzyme. In addition, the specificity of binding is significantly altered by mutation of two charged residues, Glu73 and Lys74, that are buried in the structure of the TEM-1·BLIP complex as well as by residues located on two loops that insert into the active site pocket. Based on the results, a E73A/Y50A double mutant was constructed that exhibited a 220,000-fold change in binding specificity for the TEM-1 versus SME-1 enzymes.

Hydrophobic patches on the surface of one protein commonly pack against hydrophobic patches on the other protein, whereas charged residues also commonly match across an interface. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been used to experimentally test the contributions of individual residues to protein interactions (6Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 7Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Studies of several interfaces suggest that functional epitopes determined by mutagenesis are more restricted than structural epitopes revealed by x-ray crystallography (8Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The presence of a small subset of “hotspot” residues that contribute significantly to the binding free energy of a complex may be a general feature of protein-protein interfaces (3Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Based on current understanding, however, it is not possible to reliably predict the energetic contributions of individual residues based on the structure of a protein-protein interface (5DeLano W.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional structure-function studies are required to generate a detailed understanding of the critical components of protein-protein interfaces. β-Lactam antibiotics such as the penicillins and cephalosporins are among the most frequently used antimicrobial agents. Resistance to these drugs is most commonly due to the action of β-lactamase enzymes. β-Lactamases catalyze the hydrolysis of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring to create an ineffective antimicrobial (9Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). There are four classes (A-D) of β-lactamases based on primary sequence homology (10Ambler R.P. Coulson F.W. Frere J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). TEM-1 and SME-1 are class A β-lactamases that are found in Gram-negative bacteria. These enzymes are clinically significant because of their ability to confer β-lactam antibiotic resistance, which has become a serious threat for human health. Both enzymes are able to hydrolyze most of the penicillins and early cephalosporins but not third generation cephalosporins. SME-1 has a wider substrate spectrum than TEM-1 in that it catalyzes the hydrolysis of carbapenem antibiotics (11Queenan A.M. Torres-Viera C. Gold H.S. Carmeli J. Eliopoulos G.M. Moellering R.C. Quinn J.P. Hindler J. Medeiros A.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3035-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes are 33% identical at the amino acid sequence level. The x-ray structure of the TEM-1 and SME-1 β-lactamases have been solved and indicate the enzymes possess a similar fold (12Sougakoff W. L'Hermite G. Pernot L. Naas T. Guillet V. Nordmann P. Jarlier V. Delettre J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The charge characteristics of TEM-1 and SME-1 are substantially different, however, with pI values of 5.4 and 9.5, respectively (11Queenan A.M. Torres-Viera C. Gold H.S. Carmeli J. Eliopoulos G.M. Moellering R.C. Quinn J.P. Hindler J. Medeiros A.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3035-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The β-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) 1The abbreviation used is: BLIP, β-lactamase inhibitory protein.1The abbreviation used is: BLIP, β-lactamase inhibitory protein. is a 165-amino acid protein produced by Streptomyces clavuligerus that has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of class A β-lactamases including TEM-1 (14Albeck S. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of BLIP reveals that it is a flat molecule composed of a tandem repeat of a 76-amino acid domain (16Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The two domains form a concave surface that is largely lined with uncharged, polar residues such as serine and tyrosine. However, there are also three tryptophan and two phenylalanine residues that contribute to two hydrophobic patches on the concave surface. The co-crystal structure of BLIP with TEM-1 β-lactamase indicates that BLIP uses the large (2636-Å2) concave surface to clamp over a protruding loop and helix region of TEM-1 (residues 99-114) (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, at the periphery of the interface, two loops from BLIP insert into the active pocket of TEM-1 to block substrate binding (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). BLIP also contains three charged residues on its surface, Asp49, Glu73, and Lys74, which become buried on complex formation with TEM-1 (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Asp49 is on a loop inserted into the TEM-1 active site pocket and has previously been shown to contribute to binding (14Albeck S. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The role of residues 73 and 74 has not yet been assessed. However, Albeck and Schreiber (14Albeck S. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that electrostatic interactions between BLIP and TEM-1 strongly influence the association kinetics for complex formation. At neutral pH, both TEM-1 and BLIP carry a net negative charge, and mutations at the periphery of the interface that decrease the negative charge on either molecule increase the association rate (14Albeck S. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Selzer T. Albeck S. Schreiber G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this study, alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been performed to determine the functional epitope of BLIP for binding two class A β-lactamases from Gram-negative bacteria. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis is a powerful tool for understanding the contributions of the side chains of individual residues to binding affinity (6Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 7Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 19Atwell A.

A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The apparent binding constants (Ki) of wild type BLIP and 23 alanine mutants for the interaction with TEM-1 and SME-1 were determined using a kinetic assay of β-lactamase inhibition. Several previous studies have focused on the TEM-1·BLIP complex (14Albeck S. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H.

The use of SME-1 in this study allowed an additional investigation into the determinants of binding specificity. It was found that the specificity of binding is significantly altered by mutation of two charged residues, Glu73 and Lys74, that are buried in the structure of the TEM-1·BLIP complex as well as by residues located on two loops that insert into the active site pocket. This information was used to engineer a BLIP molecule with a 220,000-fold change in binding specificity relative to wild type. Materials—All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs except for Pfu polymerase, which was purchased from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Talon cobalt resin was purchased from Clontech. Cephalosporin C was purchased from Sigma. Cation exchange columns (SP Fast Flow) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. BLIP Cloning and PCR Mutagenesis—Wild type, D49A, and F142A BLIPs with N-terminal His tags were constructed previously (15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All other BLIP mutants were constructed by overlapping PCR (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) and cloned into pGR32 with an N-terminal His tag as previously described (15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The external PCR primers used to amplify BLIP were as follows: PD-bla1 (top strand, N-terminal), 5′-CGGGGAGCTCGTTTCTTAGACGTCAGGTGGC-3′; MALBLI-2 (bottom strand C-terminal), 5′-GGGAAATCTAGATTATACAAGGTCCCACTGCCG-3′. A SacI site in PD-bla1 and an XbaI site in MALBLI-2 allowed the PCR product to be digested with SacI and XbaI and cloned into SacI and XbaI-digested pTP123 following treatment of the vector with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The internal top and bottom primers used for constructing the BLIP mutants are shown in Table I. The double mutant E73A/Y50A was constructed by overlap extension PCR using the BLIP Y50A mutant as the template and E73A top and bottom as inside primers. The coding sequences of the R160A and W162A mutants overlap with the MALBLI-2 primer, and therefore the inside primers for the two mutants were not useful, and the external MALBLI-2 was modified to contain the appropriately mutated codon. GCC was chosen as the alanine codon for the mutants because of its abundant usage in Escherichia coli (25Gribskov M. Devereux J. Burgess R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).

Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The plasmids containing either wild type BLIP or the mutants were electrotransformed into E. coli RB791 (equivalent to strain W3110 lacIQ L8) (26Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of each mutant was grown at 37 °C with shaking in 10 ml of LB medium in the presence of 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. 1.5 liters of LB medium containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol were then inoculated using the 10-ml overnight culture. The culture was then grown shaking at 37 °C until A 600 = 1.2. For induction of BLIP, 3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to each culture, and the cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 25 °C. The cells were pelleted and frozen at -80 °C for at least 1 h. The frozen cells were then thawed and resuspended in 40 ml of B-Per (Pierce). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble protein in the supernatant was purified over a 4-ml TALON cobalt resin column (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 10 mm imidizole wash step was utilized to remove protein from the column that bound less tightly than the His-tagged BLIP. BLIP was eluted using a buffer consisting of 50 mm imidizole in washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE to estimate purity and yield. Fractions with more than 90% purity were pooled, concentrated, and then changed into 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, buffer using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.). SDS-PAGE was used to determine the purity of the BLIP preparations (Fig. 1). BLIP concentrations were determined by Bradford assay with a standard curve calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis of purified, wild type BLIP (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). TEM-1 and SME-1 β-Lactamase Expression and Purification—TEM-1 β-lactamase was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity as previously described (28Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SME-1 was expressed and purified from E. coli as previously described (29Majiduddin F.K. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Kinetic Inhibition Assay—The kinetic assay was performed as described previously with minor changes (15Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in a 96-well quartz plate. 12 reactions were monitored simultaneously in a Tecan ultraviolet spectrophotometer controlled by Magellan (Phenix) software. 2 nm TEM-1 β-lactamase or 4 nm SME-1 β-lactamase was incubated with 12 different concentrations of BLIP for 1 h at 25 °Cin50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 100 μm cephalosporin C (Km is 700 μm for TEM-1 and 1300 μm for SME-1) was added to the β-lactamase/BLIP incubation buffer with a 12-channel pipetter. The final reaction volume was 0.3 ml, and hydrolysis of cephalosporin C was monitored at A 280. Plots of the concentration of free β-lactamase versus inhibitor concentration were fit by nonlinear regression analysis to Equation 1, Efree=[E0]-[E0]+Ki-[E0]+[I0]+Ki*)2-(4[E0][I0])2(Eq. 1) where [E free] is the concentration of active β-lactamase calculated from the measured velocity and the activity and concentration of uninhibited β-lactamase, [E O] is the total β-lactamase concentration, and [IO] is the total inhibitor concentration (30Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the equation, apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki*) were determined. Determination of the Functional Epitope for BLIP Binding to TEM-1 β-Lactamase—Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of BLIP was performed to identify the determinants critical for binding TEM-1 β-lactamase. Amino acid residues in BLIP within 4 Å from TEM-1 in the co-crystal structure were chosen for mutagenesis (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Wild type BLIP and the 23 BLIP mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1), and apparent binding constant data were obtained using a kinetic assay of inhibition of β-lactam hydrolysis (Fig. 2, Table II). Residues that result in a >10-fold decrease in binding affinity when mutated are considered components of the functional epitope. By this definition, 11 residues including Phe36, His41, Asp49, Tyr53, Lys74, Trp112, Phe142, His148, Trp150, Arg160, and Trp162 (Fig. 3) comprise the functional epitope. The critical residues are largely located in two patches near the center of the interface as well in the two loops that insert in the active site pocket of the enzyme (Fig. 3).Table IIInhibitor parameters for wild type and mutant BLIP derivativesBLIPK i for TEM-1K i for SME-1nMWild type0.5 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.2E31A2.0 ± 0.57.7 ± 1.9S35A0.5 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.6F36A40 ± 15120 ± 17S39A0.3 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1H41A34 ± 10189 ± 5G48A0.7 ± 0.22.6 ± 1.2D49A20 ± 4185 ± 39Y50A0.011 ± 0.00432 ± 10Y51A0.5 ± 0.0376 ± 24Y53A21 ± 2223 ± 64S71A0.2 ± 0.061.9 ± 0.6E73A0.4 ± 0.062,700 ± 71K74A46 ± 80.1 ± 0.01W112A13 ± 32,600 ± 700S113A0.11 ± 0.0062.7 ± 0.6G141A1.8 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.5F142A16 ± 315 ± 6Y143A0.6 ± 0.211 ± 1R144A0.6 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.4H148A21 ± 21,400 ± 300W150A184 ± 52830 ± 190R160A11 ± 2322 ± 125W162A20 ± 397 ± 19E73A/Y50A0.04 ± 0.0144,000 ± 1400 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Dissection of the BLIP-β-lactamase interaction interface.

The figure was prepared with PyMOL (W. L. DeLano; available on the World Wide Web at www.pymol.org).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As described above, two loops on BLIP (loop 1, residues 46-51; loop 2, residues 136-144) insert into the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Within loop 1, Asp49 forms two salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds with four conserved TEM-1 residues that are essential for enzyme activity: Ser130, Lys234, Ser235, and Arg244 (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The carboxylate of Asp49 assumes the position of the carboxylate of penicillin G in the acyl-enzyme complex of TEM-1 with penicillin G (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phe142 accounts for most of the van der Waals interactions in loop 2, and it mimics the benzyl group of penicillin G for binding TEM-1 (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As expected based on these interactions and consistent with previous results, mutation of these residues to alanine results in >20-fold loss of binding affinity for TEM-1 β-lactamase (Table II). Other loop residues do not play a significant role in binding with the exception of Tyr50. Surprisingly, mutation of this residue to alanine results in a ∼50-fold increase in binding affinity. Tyr50 forms extensive van der Waals interactions interactions with Pro107, Val216, and Met129 of TEM-1. In addition, Tyr50 forms an aromatic patch on BLIP together with residues Tyr51, Phe36, His41, and Tyr53. The aromatic ring of Tyr50 is located between the hydrophobic rings of Pro107 of TEM-1 and Tyr51 of BLIP. Perhaps the Tyr50 side chain hinders Asp49 or other residues in loop 1 from assuming optimal interactions in the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase. For example, removal of the bulky Tyr50 side chain could result in better contacts between BLIP residues His41 and Tyr51 and the TEM-1 enzyme. The x-ray structure of the BLIP·TEM-1 complex reveals several ordered water molecules at the interface between BLIP and the Gln99-His112 region of β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E.

The water molecules are clustered near polar residues such as several serines on the concave surface of BLIP. Mutation of Ser35, Ser39, Ser71, and Ser113 at the interface had no effect on binding (Table II). It has been proposed that the intervening waters at the BLIP-TEM-1 interface may form an adaptable interface that allows BLIP to bind several different β-lactamase sequences (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the BLIP side of this interface is also adaptable in that the serine residues do not contribute to binding affinity. Two negatively charged BLIP residues in the interface, Glu31 and Glu73, do not contribute to binding affinity (Table II). There is a salt bridge between Glu31 and Lys215 of TEM-1 that is partially exposed to the solvent (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The solvation effect may limit the contribution of Glu31 to binding affinity. Glu73 is fully buried inside the interface and makes hydrogen bonds with Glu104, Tyr105, and Ser106 of TEM-1. Removal of the Glu73 side chain, however, does not affect binding affinity to TEM-1 (Table II). In contrast, mutation of several positively charged residues on the binding surface of BLIP significantly increased Ki values (Table II). The mutated residues include Lys74, Arg160, His41, and His148. The significance of the histidine residues may arise from their ring structure rather than the partial positive charge, which will be discussed below. Lys74 is fully buried at the interface and makes a salt bridge with Glu104 from TEM-1 and neutralizes a negative region formed by Glu73 of BLIP and Glu104 of TEM-1 (17Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E.

We have determined the functional energetics of FtsZ assembly, employing FtsZ from the thermophilic Archaea Methanococcus jannaschii bound to GTP, GMPCPP, GDP, or GMPCP, under different solution conditions. FtsZ oligomerizes in a magnesium-insensitive manner. FtsZ cooperatively assembles with magnesium and GTP or GMPCPP into large polymers, following a nucleated condensation polymerization mechanism, under nucleotide hydrolyzing and non-hydrolyzing conditions. The effect of temperature on the critical concentration indicates polymer elongation with an apparent heat capacity change of -800 ± 100 cal mol-1 K-1 and positive enthalpy and entropy changes, compatible with axial hydrophobic contacts of each FtsZ in the polymer, and predicts optimal polymer stability near 75 °C. Assembly entails the binding of one medium affinity magnesium ion and the uptake of one proton per FtsZ. Interestingly, GDP- or GMPCP-liganded FtsZ cooperatively form helically curved polymers, with an elongation only 1-2 kcal mol-1 more unfavorable than the straight polymers formed with nucleotide triphosphate, suggesting a physiological requirement for FtsZ polymerization inhibitors. This GTP hydrolysis switch should provide the basic properties for FtsZ polymer disassembly and its functional dynamics.

FtsZ, the homologue of eukaryotic tubulin, is ubiquitous in Eubacteria, Archaea, and chloroplast. Green fluorescent protein-fused FtsZ has a rapid assembly dynamics in the bacterial Z-ring, comparable to tubulin in a mitotic spindle (13Sun Q. Margolin W. J.

Monomers of FtsZ from E. coli form oligomers, in a magnesium-induced indefinite linear self-association equilibrium, with a light gradual decrease of the affinity of monomer addition with the oligomer size; replacement of GDP by GTP did not increase the affinity of this self-association (24Rivas G.

Lowering the pH and increasing the temperature triggered a different reaction, consisting in the GTP and magnesium-induced assembly 1By self-association we mean the formation of oligomers or quaternary structure, whereas macromolecular assembly distinctly refers to the formation of large polymers and biological superstructures (72Jaenicke R.

These definitions intend to clarify some confusing citation of our previous work describing the quasi-isodesmic self-association of FtsZ (24Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S.

Driessen A.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). of large bi-dimensional polymers made of many FtsZ monomers; it was proposed that the linear oligomers correspond to primary steps for assembly (24Rivas G.

The energetics of assembly of FtsZ has not been characterized before. Apparently contradictory reports have either indicated (16Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) whether the polymerization of FtsZ and the induction of the GTPase are cooperative. Archaeal FtsZ from M. jannaschii is activated for assembly by GTP binding, which has been predicted by molecular dynamics to change the conformation of switch loop T3 at the longitudinal assembly interface (25Diaz J.F. Kralicek A. Mingorance J. Palacios J.M. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17307-17315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This archaeal FtsZ reversibly assembles into polymers, whose filaments are made of two symmetrical tubulin-like protofilaments, which hydrolyze GTP and disassemble upon nucleotide consumption (26Oliva M.A. Huecas S.

In this work we have addressed the assembly equilibrium of archaeal FtsZ with GTP, GMPCPP, 2The abbreviations used are: GMPCPP, guanosine 5′-(α,β-methylenetriphosphate); Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CD, circular dichroism; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. GDP, and GMPCP nucleotides. The results clearly establish that FtsZ assembles in a cooperative condensation polymerization reaction, consistent with the double-stranded filament formation (26Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito Z. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its modulation by temperature and solution variables has been characterized and compared with tubulin assembly. It has been found that the GTP/GDP hydrolysis switch entails, instead of disassembly, a helical curvature of FtsZ filaments with a small free energy difference for polymer growth. FtsZ Protein Expression and Purification—FtsZ from M. jannaschii without a Gly-Ser-His6 C-terminal extension was overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLys, and it was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic chromatography (26Oliva M.A. Huecas S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), stored at -80 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3. FtsZ was equilibrated in the desired buffer by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 prior to use. Protein concentrations were measured from UV absorption spectra in 6 m guanidinium chloride, after subtracting the contribution of the bound guanosine nucleotide, and also approximately measured from native spectra (27Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified FtsZ from M. jannaschii contained 0.45 ± 0.05 nucleotide bound (of which 79 ± 8% was GTP and 21 ± 8% was GDP), which increased to 0.92 ± 0.04 nucleotide upon equilibration with 10 μm GDP or GMPCPP. Nucleotides, Nucleotide Extraction, and Analysis—GTP, dilithium salt, was from Roche Diagnostics. GDP, sodium salt was from Sigma (type I) and contained -1.5% GTP. GMPCPP and GMPCP were from Jena Biosciences. Nucleotides were extracted from FtsZ solutions by the method of Seckler et al. (28Seckler R. Wu G.M. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7655-7661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After addition of ice-cold HClO4 to a final concentration of 0.5 m, the solution was incubated on ice for 10 min and denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was neutralized and buffered by the addition of one-sixth volume of 1 m K2HPO4, one-sixth volume of 3 m KOH and made 0.5 m acetic acid. Upon mixing, samples were frozen at -20 °C until HPLC analysis. Nucleotides were separated by isocratic reversed-phase ion-pair HPLC (29Perrone P.A. Brown P.R. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 317: 301-310Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on octadecyl silica (Supelco LC-18-DB 25 cm × 4.6 mm) and detected by their absorbance at 254 nm. The composition of the mobile phase was 0.2 m K2HPO4, 0.1 m acetic acid plus 4 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate. The injection volume was 20 μl, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Analytical Centrifugation and Circular Dichroism—Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity measurements were performed at 20 and 38 °C in an Optima XL-A (Beckman-Coulter) analytical ultracentrifuge as described (24Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whole cell apparent average molecular weights of FtsZ were obtained using the program EQASSOC (30Minton A.P. Schuster T. Laue T. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients were calculated by global fitting of multiple sedimentation profiles with the program SVEDBERG (retrieved from the RASMB server (31Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The far-UV circular dichroism spectra of FtsZ (5-50 μm) were acquired with JASCO J720 and J810 dicrographs, using 0.1- and 0.01-cm cells in thermostated cell holders; the sample temperature was measured with a thermocouple. FtsZ Assembly Characterization by Electron Microscopy and Light Scattering—M. jannaschii FtsZ was placed into a fluorometer cuvette thermostated to the desired temperature, and its 350-nm light scattering at a 90° angle was monitored with a Shimadzu RF 540 spectrofluorometer. FtsZ assembly was initiated by the addition of magnesium and the nucleotide to the cuvette. FtsZ samples were adsorbed to carbon-coated grids on a plate at the experimental temperature, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and observed under Jeol 1230 electron microscopes. FtsZ Assembly Measurements by Sedimentation—FtsZ was equilibrated into potassium-containing Mes assembly buffer (50 mm Mes-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5 or pH 6.0), or sodium-containing Mes assembly buffer (50 mm Mes-NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5 or 6.0). Reaction mixtures were prepared for a final volume of 100 μl in Beckman polycarbonate centrifuge tubes and incubated at the desired temperature (standard, 55 ± 1 °C) in a drilled aluminum block fitted to an Eppendorf Thermostat Plus. Assembly was started by adding magnesium and nucleotide. Unless indicated, the experiments were performed with 10 mm MgCl2. GTP or GDP were added to a final concentration of 1 mm, GMPCPP or GMPCP to 0.1 mm. Samples were immediately placed into a prewarmed Beckman TL100 rotor and centrifuged 1.5-2 min later at 60,000 rpm for 6 min to pellet the FtsZ polymers. This procedure was found to give maximal polymer recovery with GTP under standard conditions and was readjusted when necessary by incubating the samples before centrifugation. For temperatures above 40 °C, the rotor was prewarmed 1 to 2 °C above the desired experimental temperature in an incubator, and the Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge was set to 40 °C (the maximal setting allowed). This resulted in sample temperatures 1 to 2 °C above the desired value prior to centrifugation, and 1-2 °C below it just after the short centrifugation (measured with a small thermocouple). No more than six reactions were simultaneously sedimented to reduce the handling time. The supernatant was carefully withdrawn, the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer, and their protein concentrations were measured (32Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit in multiwell plates, employing spectrophotometrically calibrated FtsZ standards and a Titertek Multiskan MC plate reader with a 595-nm filter. Each protein concentration was tested at least twice per experiment and the results averaged. The elongation equilibrium constant (K p) data (see “Results”) at varying temperature were fitted by a nonlinear integrated van't Hoff equation (33Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific) as shown in Equation 1, lnKp=a+b(1/T)+clnT(Eq. 1) from which the apparent values of the free energy ΔG 0, enthalpy ΔH 0, entropy ΔS 0, and the heat capacity change ΔC p, of the elongation reaction were calculated by Equations 2-5, respectively. ΔG0=-RTln(Kp)(Eq. 2) ΔH0=R(cT-b)(Eq. 3) ΔS0=(ΔH0-ΔG0)/T(Eq. 4) ΔCp=Rc(Eq. 5) In experiments at varying magnesium concentration, the free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated from the total Mg2+ concentrations by solving the multiple equilibria, which take into account cation binding by EDTA and nucleotide as described (34Menéndez M. Rivas G. Díaz J.F. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of FtsZ from M. jannaschii Is Insensitive to Magnesium and Nucleotide—The association state of FtsZ was first studied using analytical ultracentrifugation. The apparent average molecular weight was measured by sedimentation equilibrium under different solution conditions and with different nucleotides (Fig. 1). Only at low enough concentrations (1-2 μm) FtsZ was close to monomer (M r 38924), and the degree of FtsZ self-association increased with protein concentration in 50 mm Mes-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA buffer, pH 6.5. The association is compatible with the formation of a small FtsZ oligomer (up to a tetramer within the 1-40 μm FtsZ concentration range examined; see the model line in Fig. 1). No significant differences in the association behavior of FtsZ were found with Mg2+ (0 and 6 mm MgCl2), or with the different nucleotides at the start of the experiments (10-50 μm GDP, 50 μm GTP, or 10 μm GMPCPP) at the temperatures employed (20 and 38 °C). The degree of association was slightly reduced in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm KCl, pH 8. The effects of nucleotides on the aggregation state of FtsZ were also examined by shorter sedimentation velocity measurements (in which GTP hydrolysis should be limited). The sedimentation coefficient of FtsZ at 20 °C had practically the same value (s20,w = 5.60 ± 0.13 S at 30 μm FtsZ) irrespectively of 10 μm GDP or 30 μm GTP nucleotide added and magnesium (0 or 6 mm MgCl2). Since FtsZ easily exchanges its bound nucleotide under related conditions (25Diaz J.F. Kralicek A. Mingorance J. Palacios J.M. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17307-17315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we found no available evidence that the oligomerization of FtsZ from M. jannaschii is modulated by the nucleotide or by Mg2+ ions, at difference with the Mg2+-induced self-association of bacterial FtsZ from E. coli (24Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whether oligomerization, magnesium, nucleotides, pH, ionic strength, and temperature induced changes in the average secondary structure of FtsZ was examined by circular dichroism. The CD spectra of FtsZ showed no concentration dependence (5-50 μm FtsZ), and a lack of significant effects of MgCl2 (0-10 mm), GDP or GMPCPP (10 μm), pH 6.5 or 8.0, and 0-500 mm KCl. The effects of temperature were very small between 25 and 80 °C, and at 95 and 100 °C a partial thermal unfolding of FtsZ could be evidenced by the loss of the α-helical CD minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 2). Cooperative Assembly of FtsZ—Raising the temperature with GTP or GMPCPP and Mg2+, under otherwise the same conditions in which FtsZ forms small oligomers, resulted in the formation of large FtsZ polymers, which could be pelleted by differential centrifugation. Interestingly, these polymers formed above a given FtsZ critical concentration. Since FtsZ polymerization induces its GTPase activity (26Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito Z. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which leads to depolymerization, the polymer stability was also monitored by light scattering under the same experimental conditions. FtsZ was incubated in assembly buffer, magnesium, and the nucleotide (1 mm GTP or 0.1 mm GMPCPP) were added, and the samples centrifuged; the incubation and centrifugation times (see “Experimental Procedures”) were adjusted for optimal recovery of pelletable polymer before disassembly by nucleotide consumption. The FtsZ concentrations from the pellet and in the supernatant were plotted against the initial concentration. Representative results are shown by Fig. 3, in which it can be appreciated that (i) FtsZ forms pelletable polymers only above a given critical total protein concentration and (ii) the slope of the polymerized versus total protein concentration plot is unitary, indicating that essentially all the protein excess above critical concentration had polymerized and had been efficiently sedimented. 3Typical values of the slope of the pellet versus total FtsZ concentration plot were 0.90-0.92, suggesting the presence of 8-10% of the protein incompetent to polymerize. This was confirmed by giving a cycle of polymerization to the protein before measurements, which resulted in slope values of 0.97 ± 0.02. These results (Fig. 3A) show that FtsZ from M. jannaschii cooperatively polymerizes following a nucleated condensation mechanism, similarly to other fiber-forming protein polymerization processes (35Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 36Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein.

Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10067-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For such a cooperative assembly the apparent equilibrium constant (K p) for the growth reaction (the addition of a monomer to the polymer) is in good approximation equal to the reciprocal critical concentration (36Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, London1975Google Scholar). The critical concentration for FtsZ assembly with 1 mm GTP and 10 mm MgCl2 was 50.6 ± 4.3 μg/ml (1.3 ± 0.11 μm, Table I), resulting in K p = (7.7 ± 0.7) × 105m-1, and an apparent free energy change of polymer growth ΔG 0g,app = -RTln(K p) = -8.84 ± 0.06 kcal mol-1 (55 °C). With the slowly hydrolyzable analogue GMPCPP (0.1 mm) the critical concentration was lower than with GTP and therefore the propagation constant increased: Cr = 11.3 ± 3.3 μg/ml (0.29 ± 0.08 μm, Table I), K p = (3.4 ± 0.1) × 106m-1, and ΔG 0g,app = -9.82 ± 0.20 kcal mol-1. This gives an advantage of ΔΔG 0g,app (GMPCPP-GTP) = -1.04 ± 0.15 kcal mol-1 favorable to elongation with GMPCPP (corrected to the same free Mg2+ concentration; see below).Table IEffects of nucleotide on the critical concentration, and nucleotide content of FtsZ polymers, in potassium- and sodium-containing assembly buffersNucleotide employedK+/pH 6.5K+/pH 6.0 CrNa+/pH 6.5Na+/pH 6.0 CrCrPolymer bound nucleotideaThe nucleotide which cosedimented with the polymer were extracted from the pellets and analyzed by HPLC: numbers in parenthesis are the corresponding values in the supernatant, which confirm an excess of GTP or GMPCPP.CrPolymer bound nucleotideaThe nucleotide which cosedimented with the polymer were extracted from the pellets and analyzed by HPLC: numbers in parenthesis are the corresponding values in the supernatant, which confirm an excess of GTP or GMPCPP.μ mμ mμ mμ mGMPCPPb0.1 mm GMPCPP or 1 mm GTP were added to the reaction mixture.0.29 ± 0.0825% GMPCPP (78%), 75% GMPCP (22%)0.16 ± 0.021.47 ± 0.0898% GMPCPP, 2% GMPCP0.91 ± 0.30GMPCPcFtsZ was previously assembled with GMPCPP which was let to hydrolyze, then equilibrated with 10 μm GMPCP and the reaction mixture was supplemented to 0.1 mm GMPCP (simple nucleotide addition was inefficient).10.6 ± 1.4080% GMPCP, 20% GMPCPP4.20 ± 0.338.00 ± 1.0285% GMPCP, 20% GMPCPP3.55 ± 0.30GTPb0.1 mm GMPCPP or 1 mm GTP were added to the reaction mixture.1.30 ± 0.1149% GTP (84%), 51% GDP (16%)0.60 ± 0.094.00 ± 0.6098% GTP, 2% GDP1.77 ± 0.40GDPdFtsZ was previously equilibrated with 10 μm GDP and supplemented to 1 mm GDP (similar results were obtained by GDP addition).17.50 ± 1.8098% GDP, 2% GTP12.50 ± 1.50ndend, not determined.nd8.73 ± 1.28a The nucleotide which cosedimented with the polymer were extracted from the pellets and analyzed by HPLC: numbers in parenthesis are the corresponding values in the supernatant, which confirm an excess of GTP or GMPCPP.b 0.1 mm GMPCPP or 1 mm GTP were added to the reaction mixture.c FtsZ was previously assembled with GMPCPP which was let to hydrolyze, then equilibrated with 10 μm GMPCP and the reaction mixture was supplemented to 0.1 mm GMPCP (simple nucleotide addition was inefficient).d FtsZ was previously equilibrated with 10 μm GDP and supplemented to 1 mm GDP (similar results were obtained by GDP addition).e nd, not determined. Open table in a new tab Since both GTP and GMPCPP are hydrolyzed during FtsZ assembly, and the kinetic mechanisms of assembly, nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange are essentially unknown, it can be argued that the system is not at equilibrium and that these apparent thermodynamic values may be somehow biased by the nucleotide hydrolysis. Therefore the same measurements were made in Na+-containing assembly buffer pH 6.5, in which the GTPase activity of FtsZ is inhibited and stable polymers are formed (26Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito Z. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). FtsZ assembly is slightly less favored with Na+, however, due to the absence of nucleotide hydrolysis the system becomes a rigorous chemical equilibrium. The results of these measurements, shown by Fig. 3B and Table I, indicate ΔG 0app (GTP) = -8.10 ± 0.10 kcal mol-1, ΔG 0app (GMPCPP) = -8.76 ± 0.04 kcal mol-1, and ΔΔG 0app(GMPCPP-GTP) = -0.66 ± 0.08 kcal mol-1 favorable to elongation with GMPCPP, which confirms the result in K+-buffer. The assembly elongation is enhanced in the K+-buffer by ΔΔG 0app(K+ minus Na+) = -0.74 ± 0.07(GTP) or -1.06 ± 0.14 (GMPCPP) kcal mol-1. Analyzing the polymer-bound nucleotide when FtsZ was assembled with 0.1 mm GMPCPP or 1 mm GTP indicated that under non-hydrolyzing conditions in Na+-containing buffer at pH 6.5, the nucleotide bound to the polymer was 98% GMPCPP or GTP, respectively (Table I). However, when FtsZ was assembled under hydrolyzing conditions in K+-containing buffer, the bound nucleotide was only 25% GMPCPP (75% GMPCP) or 49% GTP (51% GDP), respectively (Table I). Since polymerizing FtsZ repeatedly hydrolyzes GTP from the solution, at a rate of several GTP per minute under closely related conditions (26Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martin-Benito Z. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the nucleotide is exchanged by polymerizing FtsZ (that is, by the polymers or by rapidly exchanging monomers), possibly in a rate-limiting step comparable to the observed hydrolysis rate (otherwise the nucleotide in the polymer would be all GDP or all GTP). Since GTP hydrolysis continues during centrifugation but st"

T., Weigel, J. A., Saxena, A., and Weigel, P. H. (2003) Glycobiology 13, 339–349). The small rat and human HARE proteins are not encoded directly by mRNA but are derived from larger precursors. Here we characterize the specificity and function of the 175-kDa HARE, expressed in the absence of the 300-kDa species, in stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cells. The HARE cDNA was fused with a leader sequence to allow correct orientation of the membrane protein. The recombinant rHARE contained ∼25 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharides and, like the native protein, was able to bind HA in a ligand blot assay, even after de-N-glycosylation. SK-HARE cell lines demonstrated specific 125I-HA endocytosis, receptor recycling, and delivery of HA to lysosomes for degradation. The Kd for the binding of HA (number-average molecular mass ∼ 133 kDa) to the 175-kDa HARE at 4 °C was 4.1 nm with 160,000 to 220,000 HA-binding sites per cell. The 175-kDa rHARE binds HA, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates A, C, D, and E, but not chondroitin, heparin, heparan sulfate, or keratan sulfate. Surprisingly, recognition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) other than HA by native or recombinant HARE was temperature-dependent. Although competition was observed at 37 °C, none of the other GAGs competed for 125I-HA binding to SK-HARE cells at 4 °C. Anti-HARE monoclonal antibody-174 showed a similar temperature-dependence in its ability to block HA endocytosis. These data suggest that temperature-induced conformational changes may alter the GAG specificity of HARE. The results confirm that the 175-kDa rHARE does not require the larger HARE isoform to mediate endocytosis of multiple GAGs. Hyaluronan (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) clearance from lymph and blood in mammals is mediated by the HA receptor for endocytosis (HARE), which is present as two isoforms in rat and human (175/300 kDa and 190/315 kDa, respectively) in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (Zhou, B., McGary, C.

Fraser J.R.E. Henriksen J.H. Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 249-265Google Scholar). HA is a structural component in all vertebrate tissue matrices and plays key roles in cell proliferation and adhesion, morphogenesis, differentiation, inflammation, and wound healing (2Abatangelo G. Weigel P.H. (eds) New Frontiers in Medical Sciences: Redefining Hyaluronan. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam2000Google Scholar, 3Toole B.P. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 4Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 5Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E.

HA and other GAGs, in particular the various CSs, are synthesized and degraded continuously in tissues throughout the body. For example, the HA in skin has a metabolic half-life of only ∼1.5 days (7Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some turnover of extracellular CS likely occurs in a coordinated way and by a similar mechanism with HA turnover, because some CS chains are covalently attached to PGs, which in turn are bound to HA chains released from the ECM. Coordinated turnover of HA and some of the body's large CS pool makes sense physiologically, because HA, CS, and other GAGs in the ECM could be released simultaneously after the cleavage of HA. CS could also be released from different ECMs by other mechanisms, such as regulated proteolysis of various aggregating or nonaggregating PGs. In this case, the final turnover (i.e. uptake and degradation) of such fragments that enter the lymph or blood could be mediated either by HARE or other CS-recognizing receptors or by receptors specific for the PG protein. The present model for the high turnover of HA and CS in ECMs throughout the mammalian body is that very large native HA molecules (approaching 107 Da) are partially digested to produce large HA fragments (∼106 Da) that are then released from the matrix (8Fraser J.R. Appelgren L.E. Laurent T.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Fraser J.R. Kimpton W.G. Laurent T.C. Cahill R.N. Vakakis N. Biochem.

These released HA fragments could still be bound to Link proteins and aggregating PGs (i.e. aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican), which can contain covalently attached CS chains; all these components, therefore, would be released concurrently from ECM networks. These HA-PG fragments would also likely contain other proteins associated with particular PGs, such as growth factors. The released ECM fragments then enter lymphatic vessels and flow to regional lymph nodes, which are initial sites for the clearance and degradation of the HA and CS. Lymph nodes are the primary clearance sites, accounting for ∼85% of the HA turnover. The second clearance site is the liver, which accounts for ∼15% of the total body HA, and presumably CS, turnover. The HA/CS clearance and degradation in liver and lymph nodes is mediated by the same endocytic receptor (now designated HARE), which is expressed in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of these tissues (13Eriksson S. Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Smedsrod B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 144: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although humans turn over ∼5 g of HA per day, the two HA/CS clearance systems utilizing HARE in lymph node and liver maintain a very low steady-state concentration of HA in blood (i.e. 10–100 ng/ml). Presumably, the removal of HA from lymph fluid and blood is very important for normal health. In particular, if the concentration of high molecular mass HA increased, then the viscosity of these latter fluids could increase to dangerous levels. For example, the passage of blood cells through narrow microcapillary beds would be impaired if blood viscosity increased. Coagulation homeostasis could also be perturbed, because HA specifically binds to human fibrinogen (15LeBoeuf R.D. Raja R.H. Fuller G.M. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12586-12592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulates fibrin clot formation (16LeBoeuf R.D. Gregg R.R. Weigel P.H. Fuller G.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6052-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of serum HA occur in several diseases, including some cancers (17Thylen A. Wallin J. Martensson G. Cancer. 1999; 86: 2000-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), psoriasis (18Lundin A. Engstrom-Laurent A. Hallgren R. Michaelsson G. Br. J.

Dermatology. 1996; 192: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (20Manicourt D.H. Poilvache P. Nzeusseu A. van Egeren A. Devogelaer J.P. Lenz M.E. Thonar E.J.

Med. 1998; 131: 354-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hepatic clearance of HA is such an important function that elevated serum HA is often used as a diagnostic tool to detect or monitor liver failure (23Bramley P.N. Rathbone B.J. Forbes M.A. Cooper E.H. Losowsky M.S. J. Hepatol. 1991; 13: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we used a specific mAb and a ligand blot assay to purify two membrane-bound HA-binding proteins from rat LECs (24Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human spleen (25Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The rHARE isoforms are 175 and 300 kDa and the hHARE isoforms are 190 and ∼315 kDa. These HARE isoforms are expressed in the liver sinusoids, the venous sinuses of the red pulp in spleen, and the medullary sinuses of lymph nodes (25Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The small HARE isoforms contain a single subunit, whereas the large isoforms contain multiple disulfide-bonded subunits, e.g. the ∼315-kDa hHARE has two subunits (250 and 220 kDa) in a ratio of ∼3:1 (25Zhou B. McGary C.T. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although they are different sizes, all of the subunits in both HARE isoforms appear to be derived from the same large (2551-amino acid) precursor protein, which has also been called Stabilin 2 (27Politz O. Gratchev A. McCourt P.A. Schledzewski K. Guillot P. Johansson S. Svineng G. Franke P. Kannicht C. Kzhyshkowska J. Longati P. Velten F.W. Johansson S. Goerdt S. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). When expressed in SK-Hep-1 cells in the absence of the large isoform, the small rHARE isoform co-localized with clathrin as expected for a coated pit-coupled endocytic HA receptor (28Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The two HARE species, therefore, appear to be functionally independent isoreceptors for HA. In this study, we functionally characterized the 175-kDa rHARE in stable cell lines. Previous cellular studies have used rat LECs, which express both the 175- and ∼300-kDa HARE isoforms. This study is the first examination of the ligand specificity and endocytic activity of a single HARE isoform in the absence of the other. Materials and Buffers—Na125I was from Amersham Pharmacia Corp. 125I-HA was prepared as described previously (29Raja R.H. LeBoeuf R. Stone G. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using a hexylamine derivative of HA oligosaccharides (number-average molecular mass = 133,000 based on gel permeation chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering analysis), modified only at the reducing ends. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were from Charles River Laboratories. BSA Fraction V was from Intergen Co. Collagenase was from Roche Applied Science. The preparation and characterization of mouse mAbs against the rat HARE were described previously (26Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Tris, SDS, ammonium persulfate, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and SDS-PAGE standards were from Bio-Rad. Digitonin was from ACROS Organics. Unless noted otherwise, other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. All GAGs (with the exception of heparin, which came from Sigma) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Goat anti-mouse (polyvalent) IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was from Sigma. HBSS and PBS were formulated according to the Invitrogen catalog formulations. Medium 1 is Eagle's Basal Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 mg/liter succinic acid sodium salt, 75 mg/liter succinic acid, 2.4 g/liter HEPES, and 0.22 g/liter NaHCO3. Medium 1/BSA is Medium 1 supplemented with 0.1% BSA (w/v). TBS contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl. Preparation of LECs—Rat LECs were prepared by a collagenase liver perfusion procedure and purified by differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation as previously described (13Eriksson S. Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Smedsrod B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 144: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Contaminating Kupffer cells were allowed to adhere to a glass Petri dish, and nonadherent LECs were then collected, cultured on fibronectin-coated 24-well plates and used the same day. Selection of Stable Transfectants Expressing the 175-kDa HARE— SK-Hep-1 cells (from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were transfected with purified p175HARE-κ DNA using FuGENE 6 and subjected to selection using G418 as described by Zhou et al. (28Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the protein is not directly encoded by an mRNA species, the 4708-bp cDNA sequence in this construct contains, at the 5′-end, the membrane insertion (leader) sequence of the mouse immunoglobulin κ chain, so that the resulting protein is inserted in the plasma membrane in the correct orientation. The 46-amino acid κ chain sequence was derived from pSecTag2, and the final construct was assembled in pcDNA3.1 (both from Invitrogen). Cloning rings were used to isolate individual colonies of antibiotic-resistant transfected cells after 2–3 weeks. Cells were detached by treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, collected, and grown in 12-well plates to assess HARE protein expression and function by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and 125I-HA binding assays. Positive cultures were further purified by dilution cloning, and the final cloned cell lines were designated by numbers, e.g. SK-HARE-36. Western and Ligand Blot Assays—Cell lysates were mixed with equal volumes of a 2× SDS sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar), without reducing agent, to give final concentrations of 16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 0.01% bromphenol blue. After SDS-PAGE, the contents of the gel were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 10 V at 4 °C using 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS in a Genie blotter apparatus from Idea Scientific. For the ligand blot assay, the nitrocellulose membrane was treated first with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 2 h, or TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) overnight, and then incubated with 1–2 μg/ml 125I-HA in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mm EDTA without, or with, a 100- to 150-fold excess of nonlabeled HA (as competitor) to assess total and nonspecific binding, respectively (31Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was washed five times for 5 min each with TBST and dried at room temperature. The bound 125I-HA was detected by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS film exposed at –85 °C for 6–48 h. Nonspecific binding in this assay is typically <5%. For Western blot assays, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS at 4 °C overnight either after the ligand blot assay (the membranes were rewet with TBST first) or directly after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer. The membrane was then incubated with anti-rat HARE mAbs (e.g. 1 μg/ml IgG) at 22 °C for 1 h, washed three times for 5 min each with TBST, and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was washed five times for 5 min each with TBST and incubated with p-nitro blue tetrazolium and sodium 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine for color development (Bio-Rad), which was stopped by washing the membrane with distilled water. 125I-HA Binding or Endocytosis—Stably transfected SK-HARE cell lines were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum containing 0.4 mg/ml G418 in tissue culture multi-well dishes (usually 24-well plates). The cells were washed, incubated at 37 °C in fresh medium without serum for 1 h, the plates were then placed on ice, and the cells washed two times with HBSS prior to all experiments. Medium containing 1–2 μg/ml 125I-HA with or without the noted concentration of IgG or other GAG (as competitor) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated either on ice for 60 min to assess cell surface binding or at 37 °C to allow internalization of ligand. At the noted times the medium was aspirated, the cells were washed three times with HBSS and lysed in 0.3 n NaOH, and radioactivity and protein content were determined. All values were normalized for cell protein per well and are presented as cpm/μg of protein. Degradation of 125I-HA—Degradation of 125I-HA was measured by a cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation assay as described by McGary et al. (32McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 50-μl samples of medium were mixed with 250 μl of 1 mg/ml HA in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Alternatively, 100-μl samples of cell lysate (in 0.3 n NaOH) were mixed with 47 μl of 0.6 n HCl, 28 μl of distilled water, and 125 μl of 2 mg/ml HA. After mixing, 300 μl of 6% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in distilled water was added, and the tubes were mixed by vortexing. After 10 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 9000 rpm in an Eppendorf model 5417 microcentrifuge, using a swinging bucket rotor, at 22 °C for 5 min. A sample (300 μl) of the supernatant was taken for determination of radioactivity, and the remainder was removed by aspiration. The tip of the tube containing the precipitated pellet was cut off and put into a gamma counter tube, and radioactivity was determined. Degradation was measured as the time-dependent increase of nonprecipitable radioactivity. About 80% of the total radioactivity was precipitable at the beginning of each experiment. HA fragments that are smaller than ∼50 monomers do not precipitate with cetylpyridinium chloride (32McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and because radioautolysis continuously generates smaller fragments, the background in this cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation assay increases with age of the radioiodinated HA. General—Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217389) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described by Burnette (34Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5926) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (26Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). 125I radioactivity was measured using a Packard Auto-Gamma Counting system. Digital images were captured using an Alpha Innotech Fluorochem 8000 or a Molecular Dynamics Personal Model densitometer. Images were taken in Corel Photo Paint (version 9.0) as JPG files, cropped and processed identically and then transferred to Corel Draw (version 9.0) for annotation. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Molecular Biology Resource facility. Expression of the 175-kDa rHARE Protein in Stable Cell Lines—The 175-kDa rHARE protein is not directly encoded by a distinct mRNA, but rather is generated by proteolysis from a larger precursor (28Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, to create stable cell lines expressing only this HARE isoform, we used a synthetic cDNA coding for the 1431-amino acid protein fused at the N terminus to the leader sequence of the mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain. This leader sequence serves as a membrane insertion signal that allows correct orientation of the protein and trafficking to the cell surface. This vector was used to transfect SK-Hep-1 cells, after which multiple stable cell lines expressing HARE were cloned using antibiotic selection. The SK-Hep-1 cell line has been used by us and by others for similar studies, and it does not display specific 125I-HA binding or endocytosis activity. Additionally, it has no endogenous surface HA receptors and no cross-reactivity with the anti-HARE mAbs. Seven independent SK-HARE clones were obtained, all of which had similar characteristics with respect to 175-kDa rHARE expression and function. Based on Western analyses, all cell lines expressed comparable levels of HARE protein and showed similar HA-binding activity in ligand blots (Fig. 1). Each of the previously described anti-175-kDa rHARE mAbs that recognize the native nonreduced protein (26Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) also individually recognizes the recombinant rHARE in Western blots (not shown). Untransfected cells and SK-Hep-1 cells, transfected with the same vector containing an unrelated cDNA insert, displayed only a low level of nonspecific 125I-HA uptake at 37 °C and showed no bands in similar Western or ligand blots (not shown). In experiments examining multiple cell lines, the molecular mass of the recombinant 175-kDa HARE was 182 ± 3 kDa (n = 10), compared with 180 ± 4 kDa (n = 6) for the native rat LEC protein. Two bands were apparent in each SK-HARE clone (Fig. 1), a major larger protein and a minor smaller protein. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed multiple amino acids released at each cycle, indicating that neither protein contains a unique N terminus, but rather is a mixture of proteins with many different N termini. The sequence data for the smaller minor HARE band were consistent with at least two proteins, one starting at Asp80 (DL) and another at Gly121 (GVI). The latter HARE variant corresponds well to a minor sequence found in the native rat 175-kDa HARE that begins at Val122 (28Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sequence data for the major recombinant 175-kDa HARE band were consistent with cleavage of the signal peptide, followed by variable proteolysis within a region of ∼40 amino acids starting from this cleavage site at Ala–25 (AAQPA) to Ser16 (SIFR). The recombinant rHARE, therefore, is processed by SK-Hep-1 cells and LECs in a similar manner to yield a variety of proteolytic cleavage products. The native and recombinant rHARE proteins contained 20–25 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharides that could be released by treatment with endoglycosidase-F (Fig. 2). The size of the apparent HARE core protein from SK-HARE cells was ∼155 kDa; this is consistent with the predicted mass of the protein derived from the synthetic cDNA (minus the 21-residue signal peptide) and is essentially identical in size to the deglycosylated native rat liver protein. As with the native HARE, the deglycosylated recombinant 175-kDa HARE retained its HA-binding activity. Glycosylation of the protein is not required for its ability to bind ligand (Fig. 2, left panel). The binding of 125I-HA to SK-HARE cells at 4 °C showed a typical hyperbolic increase that plateaued after 1 h (Fig. 3A). 125I-HA binding curves in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled HA (Fig. 3B) were essentially identical among the SK-HARE cell lines. Based on the midpoint of these binding curves from multiple experiments with several SK-HARE clones, the apparent Kd for HA binding was 4.3 ± 1.1 nm (n = 6). Two independent equilibrium binding experiments (as in Fig. 3C), each using SK-HARE cell lines #26 and #36, were performed and analyzed by the method of Scatchard (35Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 61: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17809) Google Scholar). In each experiment, we observed a single class of binding sites with identical Kd values of 4.1 nm, as calculated by first order linear regression analyses (cc ≤ –0.95). B max values ranged from 160,000 to 220,000 HA-binding sites/cell, which is similar to the number of binding sites observed previously on rat LECs (36Raja R.H. McGary C.T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16661-16668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosis and Degradation of HA Mediated by the 175-kDa rHARE—All stable cell lines mediated the specific and continuous endocytosis of 125I-HA for many hours at 37 °C (Fig. 4). Specificity of HA endocytosis ranged from 67% to 79%, as assessed in the presence of excess unlabeled HA, and the cells internalized an average of 4.2-times their number of surface HA receptors within 3 h (Table I). Western analysis confirmed that HARE protein content was not decreased during this period, indicating that HARE was not delivered to lysosomes for degradation following internalization of HA-HARE complexes (not shown). The constant cellular HARE content despite the high ratio of HA molecules taken up per HARE indicates that the recombinant 175-kDa HARE is a recycling endocytic receptor, as expected based on earlier studies with rat LECs (14McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of 125I-HA mediated by HARE in these stable cell lines led to degradation of the internalized ligand (Fig. 4). Degradation products first accumulated intracellularly (presumably in lysosomes) and then, after a long lag time, appeared in the medium. We previously found in rat LECs (32McGary C.T. Yannariello-Brown J. Kim D.W. Stinson T.C. Weigel P.H. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that the HA-hexylamine derivative, which is modified at the reducing end to contain a hydroxyphenol group, behaves as a residualizing label in that degradation products first reach high levels in lysosomes before appearing in the medium (37Strobel J.L. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A"
https://openalex.org/W1991764722,"Thioredoxin, DsbA, the N-terminal active-site domain a and the non-active-site domain b of protein-disulfide isomerase are all monomeric with a thioredoxin fold, and each exhibits low or no isomerase and chaperone activity. We have linked the N terminus of the above four monomers, individually, to the C terminus of the N-terminal domain of DsbC via the flexible linker helix of the latter to produce four domain hybrids, DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb. These four hybrid proteins form homodimers, and except for DsbCn-PDIb they exhibit new or greatly elevated isomerase as well as chaperone activity. Three-dimensional structure prediction indicates that all the four domain hybrids adopt DsbC-like V-shaped structure with a broad uncharged cleft between the two arms for binding of non-native protein folding intermediates. The results provide strong evidence that dimerization creates chaperone and isomerase activity for monomeric thiol-protein oxidases or reductases, and suggesting a pathway for proteins to acquire new functions and/or higher biological efficiency during evolution.

Many proteins, such as secretory proteins (antibodies, some peptide hormones) and membrane proteins (receptors, channel proteins), contain disulfide bonds, which play an essential role in stabilizing the tertiary and quaternary structures of these molecules. The formation of native disulfide bonds (including disulfide isomerization) is a key step in protein folding and is usually catalyzed by thiol-protein oxidoreductases, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; Trx, thioredoxin; DsbCn, N-terminal domain with the hinged linker helix of DsbC (residues 1–77); DsbCc, C-terminal domain of DsbC (residues 78–216); PDIa, N-terminal active site domain of protein-disulfide isomerase; PDIb, N-terminal non-active site domain of protein-disulfide isomerase; GAPDH, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DTT, dithiothreitol. in eukaryotes, and Dsb proteins in prokaryotes. So far at least six members of the Dsb family, DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD, DsbE, and DsbG, have been identified. In recent years PDI (1Wang C.C. Tsou C.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and DsbG (6Shao F. Bader M.W. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13349-13352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have been characterized to exhibit both disulfide isomerase and chaperone activity. The thiol-protein oxidoreductases contain thioredoxin (Trx) fold with one or more motif(s) of -CXYC-as active site(s). PDI is a homodimeric molecule mainly located within the endoplasmic reticulum, and each subunit is composed of four successive Trx-fold domains (a-b-b′-a′-) and a C-terminal tail (7Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is known that a and a′ are homologous, and each has a -CGHC-motif as an active site. However, b and b′, without such an active site motif, are homologous with each other but not with the a domain. DsbC, located in the periplasm, is a prokaryotic counterpart of PDI and has been shown by crystal structure analysis (8McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) to be a V-shaped homodimer with each subunit forming an arm of the V. The N-terminal domain (1–61) of the subunit is linked via an α-helix-hinged linker (62–77) to the C-terminal Trx-domain (DsbCc, 78–216) with a -CGYC-motif as an active site. The N-terminal domain from each monomer forms the dimer interface at the base of the V through β-sheet hydrogen bonds. The broad uncharged cleft with a large hydrophobic surface within the V has been suggested to be the site for peptide binding and therefore it plays a role in both the chaperone and the foldase activity of DsbC (8McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Biochemical data (9Sun X.X. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22743-22749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reveal that deletion of the first 65 residues at the N terminus prevents the dimerization of the subunits and the gain of chaperone activity. These observations are consistent with crystal structural analysis. A point mutation at the conserved Gly-49 has been reported to cause DsbC to exist as a monomer instead of a dimer and to convert it from an isomerase to an oxidase (10Bader M.W. Hiniker A. Regeimbal J. Goldstone D. Haeble P.W. Riemer J. Metcalf P. Bardwell J.C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore the dimeric structure of DsbC appears to be a critical factor for achieving its multifunctional activities, namely functions as both isomerase and chaperone. Trx, DsbA, and the a domain of PDI are all monomeric proteins. They exhibit low or no isomerase and chaperone activity, even though they contain the Trx fold with -CXYC-motif. In this report we have expressed and purified four domain hybrids, namely, DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb. In these hybrids the N terminus of Trx, DsbA, the a and the b domain of PDI has been separately linked to the C terminus of the association domain by the flexible linker helix of DsbC (Scheme I). We investigated whether the hybrids could form a dimeric structure, and if they do, is there a gain of function for these four Trx promoters. The results reveal that hybridization has indeed produced homodimeric structure for the four hybrids and the hybrids which contain Trx, DsbA, and the a domain of PDI are endowed with chaperone and isomerase activity. Our findings reveal a strategy by which biological molecules could achieve new functions and gain higher efficiency through evolution process.

There are two extra amino acid residues, Val-Asp, resulting from the SalI site at the domain junctions. The full-length coding sequences of DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb with the ends of BamHI and HindIII were excised from their corresponding pUC plasmids and then subcloned into pQE-70 to construct corresponding pQE-DsbCn-Trx, pQE-DsbCn-DsbA, pQE-DsbCn-PDIa, and pQE-DsbCn-PDIb, respectively. The resulting constructs were identified by diagnostic PCR and DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Transformed M15[REP4] cells were grown in LB media with 100 μg/ml ampicilin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight-cultured seed cells were diluted 100-fold and incubated for another 4 h followed by overnight induction at 25 °C using isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 0.01 mm except 0.05 mm for DsbCn-PDIa. The expression and processing of target proteins were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (11Liu X.Q. Zhang S. Pan X.M. Wang C.C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Target proteins released from the periplasm of harvested cells by osmotic shock were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) for DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, and DsbCn-PDIb and 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for DsbCn-PDIa. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min the supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in the same buffer. The main peak was collected, desalted, and stored with 10% glycerol at –80 °C. The purified proteins showed one band on SDS-PAGE. Concentration and Spectrum Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the convenience of comparison, homotetrameric GAPDH, homodimeric DsbC, PDI, and all domain hybrids were taken as protomers in the calculation of molar ratios. CD spectra from 200 to 250 nm were determined with a Jasco 500 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C, and the amount of α-helix was calculated according to Pownall et al. (16Pownall H.J. Hsu F.J. Rosseneu M.

Assays of Enzyme and Chaperone Activities—Disulfide isomerase activity was assayed by the method of Lambert and Freedman (13Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem.

Thiol protein reductase activity was assayed by measuring the turbidity increase at 650 nm due to insulin reduction (17Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity is expressed as the ratio of the slope of a linear part of the turbidity curve to the lag time (18Martínez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Garcia-Alfonso C. López-Barea J. Barcena J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reactivation of GdnHCl-denatured GAPDH upon dilution in the presence of domain hybrids at difference concentrations was carried out according to Chen et al. (5Chen J. Song J.L. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D.F. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to determine chaperone activity of the hybrids. Three-dimensional Structure Prediction—Homologous sequence searching was performed throughout the two data bases, PDB (19Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27853) Google Scholar) and Swiss-Prot, using BLASTP (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60177) Google Scholar) and FASTA (21Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 2444-2448Crossref Scopus (9391) Google Scholar). Only sequences respectively homologous to the two domains in hybrids were found. The three-dimensional structures of DsbC (1EEJ), Trx (2TRX), DsbA (1DSB), PDIa (1MEK), and PDIb (1BJX) are all available in PDB. Therefore it is possible to predict the three-dimensional structures of the four hybrids by packing of the two component domains, respectively. Crystal structure analysis of DsbC (8McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) has shown that in each subunit the N-terminal domain is linked to DsbCc by a flexible hinged helix, which is packed to DsbCc. The three-dimensional structural alignment of Trx, DsbA, PDIa, and PDIb separately with DsbCc was carried out using TOPP program (22Lu G. Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter. 1996; 78: 10-11Google Scholar), and the results showed that the major subdomains, consisting of 4, 5, or 6 β-strands packed with α-helices at two sides, are structurally well aligned, ignoring minor subdomains consisting of varying number of α-helices. All the five domains show similar three-dimensional structures, and therefore the three-dimensional structure of DsbC was taken as a template for the four hybrids. By fitting the three-dimensional structures of Trx, DsbA, PDIa, and PDIb in the hybrids to DsbCc, the results show that each domain can pack to the linker helix in a similar way as that reported for DsbCc. However, the position of the N-terminal segment of Trx, DsbA, PDIa, and PDIb needed to be relocated, so that the hydrophobic core on one side of the β-sheet became opened and the linker helix was packed onto the core. Based on the above information, three-dimensional structures of the hybrids were constructed using MODELLER (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10618) Google Scholar). Expression and Processing of the Recombinant Domain Hybrids—Like DsbC, all four domain hybrids of DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb were overexpressed as 20–50% of the total cellular proteins and transported into the periplasm as soluble and correctly processed proteins with molecular mass of 20, 29, 22, and 19 kDa respectively as expected (Fig. 1). DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb Are Homodimers—As shown in Fig. 2, the data from size-exclusion chromatography revealed that DsbC, DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb was eluted as a single peak at position corresponding to apparent molecular mass of 40, 37, 60, 38, and 50 kDa, respectively, indicating that all four hybrids, like DsbC, are homodimers in accord with the theoretical molecular mass (Table II).Table IIMolecular mass and α-helix content of domain hybridsProteinMolecular massα-helix contentTheoreticalDeterminedaData from size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2) are expressed as mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Conformation of the Domain Hybrids—As shown in Fig. 3, the CD spectra of DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, and DsbCn-PDIa were similar to that of DsbC in both the shape and the ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm with α-helix content of 44, 45, and 42% respectively compared with 37% for DsbC. All the α-helix contents so determined are in reasonably agreement with the calculated values from the three-dimensional structural analysis (Table II). The CD spectrum of DsbCn-PDIb is somehow deviated from that of DsbC, but the α-helix content of 32% is also close to the calculated value. Isomerase and Chaperone Activity of the Domain Hybrids— Compared with monomeric Trx, DsbA, and PDIa, the hybrids with DsbCn show greatly elevated isomerase activity as shown in Table III. The Trx had little, if any, isomerase activity but DsbCn-Trx showed significant activity, about 33% of the DsbC activity. The DsbA is primarily an oxidase showing low isomerase activity of about 10% of that of DsbC, but when linked to DsbCn, the hybrid exhibits a 5-fold increase in isomerase activity. Isolated PDIa, although being one of the two active site domains of PDI, showed no isomerase activity (29Ruoppolo M. Orrù S. Talamo F. Ljung J. Pirneskoski A. Kivirikko K.I. Marino G. Koivunen P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 939-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, DsbCn-PDIa displayed an enormous increase in isomerase activity, about 1.7-fold higher than that of DsbC.Table IIIEnzymatic activities of domain hybridsProteinProtein-disulfide isomeraseThiol-protein reductaseaData for each monomer are expressed as mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 4 and Table III, dimerization does not alter significantly the reductase activity of the hybrids, which showed much lower reductase activity than that of either Trx or DsbC. Fig. 5 shows that Trx failed to assist the reactivation of denatured GAPDH even at a high molar ratio to GAPDH of 35, and DsbA possessed a relatively low capacity to assist the reactivation process. Nevertheless, the three hybrids, DsbCn-Trx, DsbCn-DsbA, and DsbCn-PDIa displayed a pronounced increase in chaperone activity in promoting the reactivation of denatured GAPDH. Compared with DsbC, which assisted the reactivation of GAPDH from 5 to 40% at a molar ratio to GAPDH of 20, DsbCn-DsbA and DsbCn-PDIa assisted the reactivation of GAPDH to a similar extent but at higher molar ratios, 30 for DsbCn-DsbA and 40 for DsbCn-PDIa. However, DsbCn-Trx showed even higher chaperone activity, it increases the reactivation of GAPDH to a maximum of 50% at a molar ratio of 30. The DsbCn-PDIb assisted the reactivation of GAPDH to a maximum of 18% at a molar ratio of 50, thus, it possesses rather low chaperone activity. Three-dimensional Structures of the Domain Hybrids— Three-dimensional structures of the four domain hybrids were predicted with satisfactory stereo-chemical qualities. The Ramachandran plot by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) displayed that more than 90% of the residues were distributed in the most favored region. Taking DsbCn-Trx as an example (see Fig. 6A), the superposition of the predicted structure of DsbCn-Trx on the crystal structure of DsbC is quite good. The hydrophobic residues on the linker helix, Leu-67, Leu-68, Leu-71, and Leu-74, make contacts with hydrophobic residues of Ile-23, Val-25, Phe-27, Leu-58, Leu-79, and Phe-81 on the β-sheet of Trx, and these interactions ensure the integrity of the whole structure. As the four hybrids have been characterized to be dimeric by biochemical methods, a DsbC-like V-shaped homodimer structure was suggested for all the hybrids with DsbCn-Trx as an example shown in Fig. 6B. By superposition of the two dimeric molecules of DsbC and DsbCn-Trx it was found that the surface of DsbCn-Trx is also dominated by a large cleft separating the active sites as in the DsbC molecule (Fig. 7). The dimension and the depth of the cleft are approximately the same as that found in DsbC, and the inner surface of DsbCn-Trx cleft is comprised of 49 hydrophobic or uncharged residues. It is noticed that the arginine residues found inside the cleft from each monomer were almost electrically neutral due to stereochemical characteristics. The broad uncharged cleft may account for peptide binding and chaperone activity, like that found in the DsbC molecule.Fig. 7Surface representation of DsbCn-Trx viewed down the molecular 2-fold axis. Electrostatic potential and molecular surface were calculated using GRASP (31Nicholls A. Bharadway R. Honing B. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 166-167Google Scholar).

The chaperone machinery functions through recognizing and binding to non-native conformational folding intermediates, protecting them from aggregation and promoting further folding, assembly, disassembly, and translocation, and mediating degradation of misfolded proteins. The structure of chaperones generally contains a peptide-binding site or surface, which is usually hydrophobic and very often located at an opening or inside of a cavity, like in GroEL molecule (32Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar); or on a depression, like in Sis1 (33Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Lee S. Fan C.Y. Younger J.M. Ren H.Y. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21675-21682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); or on a few patches enclosing a central space, like in palm-shaped prefoldin (35Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These structural characteristics provide chaperones with hydrophobic interactions with folding intermediates, and with a space to accommodate the intermediate. For chaperone DsbC, a broad cleft consisting largely of uncharged or hydrophobic residues between the two arms of the V-shaped molecule is believed to be the binding site for the unfolded peptide (8McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Monomerization of DsbC, by either removing the association domain (9Sun X.X. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22743-22749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or disrupting the dimerization interface resulted from a point mutation (10Bader M.W. Hiniker A. Regeimbal J. Goldstone D. Haeble P.W. Riemer J. Metcalf P. Bardwell J.C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), eliminates its chaperone activity as well as its isomerase activity. Thus, dimerization of DsbC appears to play a vital role for it to function as both a chaperone and an isomerase. Trx (a thiol protein reductase), DsbA (an oxidase), PDIa (the N-terminal active site domain of PDI) and PDIb (the N-terminal non-active site domain of PDI) are all monomers with Trx fold and show low or no isomerase and chaperone activity. We have now demonstrated that fusion of Trx, DsbA, and PDIa to the association domain of DsbC not only induces the hybrids to form a homodimer, but also confers tremendously increased chaperone activity and isomerase activity. These results provide strong evidence that dimerization creates chaperone activity and isomerase activity for monomeric thiol protein oxidases and reductases. As PDIb does not contain the -CXYC-motif the hybrid of DsbCn-PDIb is a dimeric molecule but possesses only new chaperone activity. The hybrid models constructed by three-dimensional structure prediction have provided structural bases to explain the experimental results obtained by biochemical methods in this report. Although the contacts between the linker helix and the C-terminal domain in hybrids are no longer identical with those in the DsbC molecule, the four hybrids, possessing a global packing with good superposition with DsbC molecule, all adopt very similar V-shaped structure as that of DsbC dimer under normal conditions. The size and the depth of the cleft between the two arms of the V shaped molecule in DsbCn-Trx is closely similar to that in native DsbC. There are 49 hydrophobic or uncharged residues on the inner surface of DsbCn-Trx cleft, which is similar to the 46 hydrophobic or uncharged residues found in the inner surface of the cleft of DsbC. In addition, the α-helix content determined by CD in each hybrid is in reasonable agreement with the calculated value from the three-dimensional structural analysis. These data indicate that hybridization has no significant effect on the secondary structure of the domains in hybrids. Another example is the yeast chaperone, Hsp40 protein Sis1, which also exists as a dimeric V- or U-shaped molecule. The crystal structure of Sis1-(171–352) showed that its C-terminal fragment remains as a dimer and has a U-shaped architecture with a large cleft formed between the two elongated monomers, and a large hydrophobic depression of 5 Å deep on the surface of the cleft. This hydrophobic depression has been proposed to be the peptide-binding site for Sis1 (33Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Lee S. Fan C.Y. Younger J.M. Ren H.Y. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21675-21682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and DsbCn-PDIb have also been predicted to have a similar V-shaped structure as DsbC, but with less reliability than that of DsbCn-Trx. Thus the packing between the two domains in DsbCn-DsbA, DsbCn-PDIa, and especially in DsbCn-PDIb, could be less compact so that the structure of the C-terminal part of DsbCn and the N-terminal part of the C-terminal domain could be disturbed by hybridization, even though the global three-dimensional structures of the two domains did not change much. In a loosely connected hybrid the linker helix would structurally be isolated. Thus, the structural relation of the two domains and the stability of the hybrid molecule would be further reduced. However, the hybrids of DsbCn-DsbA and DsbCn-PDIa are stable enough to be overexpressed as soluble dimeric molecules, exhibit similar CD spectra to that of DsbC, and have impressive isomerase activity and greatly elevated chaperone activity, which is only somewhat lower than that of DsbCn-Trx. The packing between the two domains in these hybrids should thus be compact enough to tolerate possible structural disturbance resulted from hybridization. Comparatively, the hybrid of Ds-bCn-PDIb shows a CD spectrum deviated in certain extent and significantly higher apparent molecular weight determined by exclusion chromatography possibly resulted from its structure being less compact. This is also consistent with the lower structure-prediction reliability and its rather low chaperone activity. In prokaryotes the majority of disulfide bond-containing proteins are located in the periplasm and the outer membrane or secreted to the extracellular medium, and the formation of disulfide bond occurs in the oxidizing periplasm but not in the reducing cytoplasm. The bacterial periplasm is separated from the environment by only the permeable outer membrane and is therefore liable to be affected by environmental fluctuation. However, no classical molecular chaperone was identified in the periplasm for a long time (36Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The Dsb family contains at least six members, which cooperate to stimulate the formation of correct disulfide bond(s). However, only few proteins in the periplasm, except alkaline phosphatase, contain multiple disulfide bonds (37Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 42: 1179-1185Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore it is not clear why E. coli has two disulfide isomerases, DsbC and DsbG, which are not only homologous with 30% identity and 49% homology but also both dimeric molecules with Trx fold (38Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We suggest that during evolution a thrifty and efficient way has evolved to make DsbC (and also possible DsbG) to function not only as an isomerase to catalyze the formation of correct disulfide bonds of multidisulfide-containing proteins (such as a number of virulence factors and toxins), but also as a chaperone by adding another domain to a Trx-fold molecule or a domain for dimerization in order to provide a space with hydrophobic surface for non-native folding intermediate binding. DsbC in prokaryotes may function as a chaperone more than an isomerase. At least in in vitro experiments DsbC showed only 20–30% of isomerase activity relative to that observed in the eukaryotic PDI, yet it exhibited more pronounced chaperone activity than PDI (5Chen J. Song J.L. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D.F. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our data have strongly suggested that to link a Trx-fold molecule or a domain to the association domain of DsbC as a structural base to create a new dimeric molecule, and thus bestow new activities to the molecule to fulfill the requirement of the living organism, is very likely an efficient way to create new functions. In this regards, it has been suggested that DsbC evolved from Trx, and through the dimerization of Trx-domains of DsbC, its active site is protected by DsbB-mediated oxidation so that the oxidative and reductive pathways can co-exist in E. coli periplasm (10Bader M.W. Hiniker A. Regeimbal J. Goldstone D. Haeble P.W. Riemer J. Metcalf P. Bardwell J.C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A recent report (39Katzen F. Deshmukh M. Daldal F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3960-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has added one more experimental approach to support the rationale that modular organization of proteins is a widely used strategy for protein evolution. An evolutionary fusion of a Trx-like thiol-redox active module (the γ domain of DsbD) and a non-Trx-like (immunoglobulin-fold) thiol-redox active module (α domain of DsbD) resulted in the expansion of the substrate specificity of a pre-existing transmembrane enzymatic core, CcdA or β domain of DsbD, bridging two seemingly unrelated thiol-redox pathways (39Katzen F. Deshmukh M. Daldal F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3960-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Trx fold has been used as a scaffold in many different proteins because it tolerates amino acid variability, additions, and insertions at a number of regions without affecting the overall fold (40Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The recently published DsbE structure has provided one more example for how the commonly occurring Trx fold can be modified quite simply to achieve a very specific function (41Edeling M.A. Guddat L.W. Fabianek R.A. Thöny-Meyer L. Martin J.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 973-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DsbE, a membrane-anchored member of the Dsb family, has a modified Trx fold with an unusually acidic active site and an adjacent groove formed from two inserts in the fold. These two unique structural features have been suggested to be necessary for a specific reducing activity in an oxidizing periplasm and a high fidelity of interaction required for c-type cytochrome maturation. A ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp 29 is composed of an N-terminal domain of P5-like PDIs and a C-terminal non-redox-active Trx-fold domain, which acts uniquely for dimerization, and may share the redox-independent chaperone activity of PDI using dimerization sites associated with the flexible linker region between the two domains as binding locus for unfolded polypeptides (42Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The report that isolated PDI a and a′ domains show very little isomerase activity has recently been confirmed (29Ruoppolo M. Orrù S. Talamo F. Ljung J. Pirneskoski A. Kivirikko K.I. Marino G. Koivunen P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 939-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), although they catalyze the oxidation of thiols. We have now shown that one DsbCn-PDIa subunit containing one active site exhibited 40% of isomerase activity of one PDI subunit containing two active sites, i.e. the a domain in the dimeric hybrid has retrieved almost all of its activity despite it being linked with the b domain in PDI molecule or with DsbCn in the hybrid DsbCn-PDIa molecule. Like DsbCn-PDIa, DsbCn-Trx and Ds-bCn-DsbA show a 5–10-fold increase in their isomerase activity relative to that observed in Trx and DsbA. To the best of our knowledge, the capacity to isomerize disulfide bonds has been reported only for multidomain proteins (29Ruoppolo M. Orrù S. Talamo F. Ljung J. Pirneskoski A. Kivirikko K.I. Marino G. Koivunen P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 939-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), such as Erp57, Erp72, and p5, besides PDI, DsbC, and DsbG discussed here, but not for monomeric Trx, DsbA, or isolated a and a′ domain of PDI. However, the isomerase activity depends on the sequence -XY-in the active site -CXYC- and the redox potential of the active-site motif (43Lundström J. Krause G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9047-9052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Chivers P.T. Laboissière M.C.A. Raines R.T.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), therefore the activities of DsbCn-Trx and DsbCn-DsbA are only about 25% of the activity of DsbCn-PDIa. The reductase activity of dimeric DsbCn-Trx is lower than that of monomeric Trx. This could be resulted from possible higher spatial accessibility and structural flexibility of the active site in the monomeric molecule. We sincerely thank Dr. R. Glockshuber for the generous gift of pDsbC, Prof. K. Kivirikko for pBR322-PDI, and Prof. S. L. Yang for pTrx and pUCBM21-DsbA. We are also grateful to Prof. C. L.

There are three different isoforms of mammalian PKG, which are termed Iα, Iβ, and II. PKG Iα and Iβ are products of alternative splicing and differ only in approximately the first 100 amino acids with only 36% identity in this region (3.Francis S.H. Woodford T.A. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D.

PKG II is a separate gene product, and the amino terminus has little overall similarity to the amino terminus of PKG I isoforms (7.Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

PKGs are chimeric proteins that comprise multiple functional domains; these are present in all three isoforms (9.Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of each polypeptide chain contains the catalytic domain that includes the ATP and protein substrate-binding sites, and this domain is the most highly conserved region among the PKGs. This domain catalyzes transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific serines or threonines in protein substrates. Immediately amino-terminal to the catalytic domain are two allosteric cGMP-binding sites (site A and site B) that are arranged in tandem. These two sites are homologous to each other, although they differ in cGMP-binding kinetics and cyclic nucleotide analog specificities (7.Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

Proteolysis just carboxyl-terminal of this domain produces a monomeric PKG with sequence that begins just amino-terminal of the autoinhibitory domain (16.Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L.

In vitro, the monomeric PKGs retain the salient properties of dimeric PKGs (autoinhibition, autophosphorylation, cGMP binding, and kinase activity). cGMP-dependent protein kinase(s) human PKG Iβ. In mammalian tissues, cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases are dimers, and dimerization primarily occurs through interaction at the amino terminus. The regulatory subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase are dimerized in an anti-parallel alignment, and the dimerization contacts occur through hydrophobic interactions near the amino terminus of these subunits (25.Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26.Leon D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that dimerization of PKG occurs through a leucine zipper motif near the amino terminus, and experimental work with a synthetic peptide based on residues 1–39 of PKG Iα supports this interpretation (27.Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the role and extent of the leucine zipper motif in dimerization of PKGs has not been experimentally established. All three mammalian PKG isoforms (Iα, Iβ, and II) contain a leucine zipper motif in this sequence, although the remainder of the residues in the sequence have limited sequence identity. Other eukaryotic PKGs such as the two Drosophila PKGs (28.Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the PKGs found in Caenorhabditis elegans (29.Stansberry J. Baude E.J. Taylor M.K. Chen P. Jin S. Ellis R.E. Uhler M.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1177-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Hydra oligactis, and Apis mellifera (30.Ben-Shahar Y. Robichon A. Sokolowski M.B. Robinson G.E. Science. 2002; 296: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) also contain a leucine zipper motif in this region (see Fig. 1). The number of heptad repeats in the leucine zipper motif of these proteins varies from five to eight. Lower eukaryotes have monomeric PKGs that lack the leucine zipper motif; PKG from Paramecium has been shown to be a monomer (31.Miglietta L.A.P. Nelson D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16096-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this kinase retains functional activities of PKG seen in PKGs of higher eukaryotes, although careful studies of cGMP binding and activation of this PKG compared with the mammalian isoforms are lacking. In addition to being the proposed mechanism of dimerization for PKG, the leucine zipper motif has also been shown to be involved in the interaction of PKG with a number of targeting proteins. PKG Iα specifically associates with skeletal muscle troponin T (32.Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), GKAP 42 in germ cells (33.Yuasa K. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol.

Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). PKG Iβ specifically binds to skeletal muscle troponin T and inositol 3-phosphate receptor-associated PKG substrate (35.Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Much of the interaction with the targeting proteins occurs through the region containing the dimerization domain, and mutations within the leucine zipper motif abolish most of these interactions. However, it has not been shown that these substitutions actually disrupt dimerization. PKG has also been shown to phosphorylate these targeting proteins, and localizing PKG to substrates through the leucine zipper motif provides for efficient phosphorylation. The leucine zipper motif was first characterized in the transcription factor field (36.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). It was shown to mediate the heterodimerization of transcription factors, Fos and Jun, and the homodimerization of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (37.Kouzarides T. Ziff E. Nature. 1989; 340: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The majority of leucine zipper motifs do not contain more than five heptad repeats. The leucine zipper motif of each of the mammalian PKGs contains several more heptad repeats than does the same motif in transcription factors. Mammalian PKGs contain six to nine heptad repeats, depending on isoform (six heptad repeats in PKG Iα, seven to eight repeats in PKG Iβ, and eight to nine repeats in PKG II), whereas transcription factors studied so far contain four to five heptad repeats. Because three to four heptad repeats are sufficient to mediate dimerization of these transcription factors (38.Van Heeckeren W.J. Sellers J.W. Struhl K.

In PKGs and other extended leucine zipper motif proteins, it is not known if the entire leucine zipper motif is required for dimerization or if three to four repeats are sufficient as is the case with transcription factors. This report examines the role of each of the residues within the mammalian PKG Iβ leucine zipper motif in the mechanism of dimerization of mammalian PKG Iβ. In addition, the influence of dimerization on enzyme functions has been determined. PKG Iβ Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human PKG Iβ (hcGKIβ) clone encodes a full-length human placental PKG Iβ. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to synthesize all site-directed mutations in the hcGKIβ clone in pKSII+ vector according to the protocol from Stratagene. The following mutants were made: PKG Iβ L17A, I24A, L3A/L10A, L17A/I24A, L31A/I38A, L3A/L10A/L17A/I24A, L31A/I38A/L45A/I52A, L3A/L10A/L45A/I52A, and L17A/I24A/L31A/I38A/L45A/I52A. The oligonucleotides used in mutagenesis are all listed in Table I. The point mutations for PKG Iβ L17A/I24A/L31A/ I38A/L45A/I52A were made in three steps. The first step mutated Leu-17 and Ile-24. The next step utilized PKG Iβ L17A/I24A as a template and mutated Leu-31 and Ile-38. PKG Iβ L17A/I24A/L31A/I38A was used as a template to mutate Leu-45 and Ile-52: The point mutations for PKG Iβ L3A/L10A/L17A/I24A, PKG Iβ L31A/I38A/L45A/I52A, and PKG Iβ L3A/L10A/L45A/I52A were made in two steps in the same manner as discussed for L17A/I24A/L31A/I38A/L45A/I52A. A 580-bp fragment containing the desired mutations was excised from hcGKIβ using EcoRI/NcoI (New England Biolabs) digestion, and subcloned in EcoRI/NcoI-digested wild type hcGKIβ clone in the pVL 1392 baculovirus expression vector.Table IOligonucleotide pairs utilized in site-directed mutagenesis of PKG IβPKG Iβ L17A/I24A/L31A/I38A/L45A/I52A Step 15′-CTCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGGCGAGGCAGCGGGATGCTCTCGCCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGTTG-3′5′-CAACTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGGCGAGAGCATCCCGCTGCCTCGCCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGAG-3′ Step 25′-GCCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGGCGGATCAGAAGGACGAACTGGCCCAGAAGCTGCAGAACGAGCTG-3′5′-CAGCTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTGGCCCAGTTCGTCCTTCTGATCCGCCTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGGC-3′ Step 35′-GCCCAGAAGCTGCAGAACGAGGCGGACAAGTACCGCTCGGTGGCCCGACCAGCCACCCAGCAGGCG-3′5′-CGCCTGCTGGGTGGCTGGTCGGGCCACCGAGCGGTACTTGTCCGCCTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTGGGC-3′PKG Iβ L3A/L10A/L17A/I24A Step 15′-GCCCGGAGGAGCATGGGCACCGCGCGGGATTTACAGTACGCGGCCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGCTG-3′5′-CAGCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGGCCGCGTACTGTAAATCCCGCGCGGTGCCCATGCTCCTCCGGGC-3′ Step 25′-GCCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGGCGAGGCAGCGGGATGCTFCTCGCCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGTTG-3′5′-CAACTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGGCGAGAGCATCCCGCTGCCTCGCCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGGC-3′PKG Iβ L31/I38A/L45A/I52A Step 15′-ATCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGGCGGATCAGAAGGACGAACTGGCCCAGAAGCTGCAGAACGAGCTG-3′5′-CAGCTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTGGCCCAGTTCGTCCTTCTGATCCGCCTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGAT-3′ tep 25′-GCCCAGAAGCTGCAGAACGAGGCGGACAAGTACCGCTCGGTGGCCCGACCAGCCACCCAGCAGGCG-3′5′-CGCCTGCTGGGTGGCTGGTCGGGCCACCGAGCGGTACTTGTCCGCCTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTGGGC-3′PKG Iβ L3A/L10A/L45A/I52A Step 15′-GCCCGGAGGAGCATGGGCACCGCGCGGGATTTACAGTACGCGGCCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGCTG-3′5′-CAGCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGGCCGCGTACTGTAAATCCCGCGCGGTGCCCATGCTCCTCCGGGC-3′ Step 25′-ATCCAGAAGCTGCAGAACGAGGCGGACAAGTACCGCTCGGTGGCCCGACCAGCCACCCAGCAGGCG-3′5′-CGCCTGCTGGGTGGCTGGTCGGGCCACCGAGCGGTACTTGTCCGCCTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTGGAT-3′PKG Iβ L3A/L10A5′-GCCCGGAGGAGCATGGGCACCGCGCGGGATTTACAGTACGCGGCCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGCTG-3′5′-CAGCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGGCCGCGTACTGTAAATCCCGCGCGGTGCCCATGCTCCTCCGGGC-3′PKG Iβ L17A/I24A5′-CTCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGGCGAGGCAGCGGGATGCTCTCGCCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGTTG-3′5′-CAACTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGGCGAGAGCATCCCGCTGCCTCGCCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGAG-3′PKG Iβ L31A/I38A5′-ATCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGGCGGATCAGAAGGACGAACTGGCCCAGAAGCTGCAGAACGAGCTG-3′5′-CAGCTCGTTCTGCAGCTTCTGGCCCAGTTCGTCCTTCTGATCCGCCTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGAT-3′PKG Iβ L17A5′-CTCCAGGAGAAGATCGAGGAGGCGAGGCAGCGGGATGCTCTCATC-3′5′-GATGAGAGCATCCCGCTGCCTCGCCTCCTCGATCTTCTCCTGGAG-3′PKG Iβ I24A5′-CTGAGGCAGCGGGATGCTCTCGCCGACGAGCTGGAGCTGGAGTTG-3′5′-CAACTCCAGCTCCAGCTCGTCGGCGAGAGCATCCCGCTGCCTCAG-3′ Open table in a new tab Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells were used for transformations with pKSII+, and E. coli DH5α were used for transformations with pVL 1392. DNA fragments were purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). DNA was purified from large scale vector preparations using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. All DNA segments subjected to mutagenesis and subcloning reactions were sequenced in their entirety to ensure the presence of the desired mutation and proper inframe subcloning. Mutagenesis of PKG Iβ (Δ1–52)—Full-length PKG Iβ cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI and SmaI unique sites of the baculovirus expression vector pVL 1392. A 1441-bp EcoRI/SacI fragment containing the regulatory domain of human PKG Iβ was ligated into pBluescript IIKS+ (Stratagene) for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis based on the method of Kunkel et al.

Δ1–52, 5′-TGGGTGGCTGGTCGCATATG-GAATTCGTACTTGTCCAGCTC-3′. pVL 1392-PKG Iβ (Δ1–52) vector was created by subcloning the EcoRI/SacI fragment for PKG Iβ (Δ1–52) into the large SacI/SmaI fragment of pVL 1392-PKG Iβ. pVL 1392 vectors and pBluescript IIKS+ were propagated in E. coli (DH5α and XL1 Blue, respectively). All plasmids were sequenced on an Automated Biosystems, Inc. DNA Sequencer 373A in the Cancer Center DNA Core facility of Vanderbilt University. Expression of Wild type and Mutant PKG Iβ—Sf9 cells (BD Pharmingen) were cotransfected with BaculoGold linear baculovirus DNA (BD Pharmingen) and one of the mutated hcGKIβ clones in the pVL 1392 baculovirus expression vector by calcium phosphate method according to the protocol from BD Pharmingen. At 5 days post-infection, the cotransfection supernatant was collected, amplified three times in Sf9 cells, and then used directly as virus stock for expression without additional purification of recombinant viruses. Sf9 cells grown at 27 °C in complete Grace's insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) in T-175 flasks (Corning) were typically infected with 10–100 μl of viral stock/flask. The optimum volume of viral stock used per T-175 flask was experimentally determined. The Sf9 cell pellet was harvested at 72–96 h post-infection. Purification of PKG Iβ—The Sf9 cell pellet for each T-175 flask (∼2 × 107 cells) was resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol (KPEM) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) of amount per volume recommended by manufacturer. Cell suspension was homogenized in 10- to 20-ml aliquots by 3 × 10-s bursts in an Ultra Turrex microhomogenizer with a 20-s recovery between bursts. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto an 8-aminohexylamino-cAMP-Sepharose (Sigma) column (1 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated with KPEM. The supernatant volume varied depending on number of T-175 flasks infected. The column was washed with 5 ml of KPEM with protease inhibitors followed by 10 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in KPEM with protease inhibitors. 10 mm cAMP in KPEM containing 1 m NaCl and protease inhibitors was added to the column and allowed to soak into the cAMP-Sepharose. The column was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C before six 0.3-ml elutions were collected. The column was incubated for 20 additional minutes at 4 °C, and six 0.3-ml fractions were collected a second time. Elutions containing kinase activity were pooled and concentrated on Centricon-30 (Amicon). The concentrated sample was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column (0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated in KPEM with protease inhibitors. This step removed cAMP from the affinity column elution. 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the Sephacryl S-200 column. For full-length PKG Iβ, fractions containing PKG Iβ were applied to a 2-ml DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange column equilibrated in KPEM with protease inhibitors. The column was washed with 20 ml of KPEM with protease inhibitors followed by 20 ml of 0.12 m NaCl in KPEM with protease inhibitors to remove any breakdown products. The column was eluted with 4 ml of 0.3 m NaCl in KPEM with protease inhibitors. All purification steps were done at 4 °C, and enzyme was flash-frozen in 0.3 m NaCl and 10% sucrose and stored at –70 °C until use. Four preparations of PKG Iβ (Δ1–52) and two preparations of wild type PKG Iβ and PKG Iβ L17A/I24A/L31A/I38A/L45A/I52A were expressed, purified, and used in the experiments described in this report. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot of PKG Iβ—PKG was boiled for 4 min in the presence of 10% SDS, 2 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For Western blot, gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Primary antibody was rabbit polyclonal anti-PKG, and secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (BioSource International). The blot was developed using ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). PKG Iβ Kinase Assay—The kinase activity of PKG Iβ was determined by measuring 32Pi incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into a synthetic heptapeptide substrate (Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-Ala-Glu, Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.) as previously described. Ten μl of enzyme was added to 10 μl of 100 μm cGMP and 50 μl of a reaction mixture, which contained 20 mm Tris at pH 7.4, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 200 μm ATP, 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 136 μg/ml heptapeptide, 5,000–20,000 cpm [γ-32P]ATP/μl, and 0.45 μm synthetic peptide inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.). The reaction was terminated by applying 50-μl aliquots to phosphocellulose papers (Whatman P-81, 1.5 × 2 cm) and washing with four changes of ∼500 ml 75 mm phosphoric acid and one ethanol change. The papers were dried and counted by Cerenkov method. cGMP dissociation—PKG Iβ (0.030–0.050 mg/ml) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with an equal volume of cGMP-binding mix (25 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA (pH 6.8), 2 m NaCl, 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.5 mg/ml histone IIAS (Sigma)) and 10 μl of [3H]cGMP (Amersham Biosciences) for a final concentration of 3 μm [3H]cGMP (∼5000 cpm/μl). An incubation time of 10 min at 30 °C was adequate for saturation of the cGMP-binding sites. After incubation, samples were cooled to 4 °C and aliquoted in 10-μl portions. The addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled cGMP at time 0 (Bo) initiated the dissociation (exchange) of bound [3H]cGMP. The cGMP exchange was stopped at various time points by the addition of 2 ml of cold aqueous saturated ammonium sulfate. The samples were filtered and washed as described previously (6.Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of the bound cGMP was determined by the method of Rannels and Corbin (51.Rannels S.R. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Determination of Stokes Radius—Purified PKG (∼7–10 μg) was combined with two internal standards, crystalline catalase (3 mg), and ovalbumin (4 mg), in a volume of 200 μl and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated in KPEM and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for PKG activity to determine the elution position of the enzyme. Catalase was located by absorbance at 280 nm and/or 400 nm, and ovalbumin was located by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was standardized with protein standards of known Stokes radii: cytochrome c (16.6 Å), ovalbumin (29 Å), bovine serum albumin (35 Å), and catalase (52 Å). The thyroglobulin elution volume was taken as the void volume. Elution positions of the protein standards were used to generate a standard curve of (–log Kav)1/2versus Stokes radius (52.Siegel L.M.

This type of AE1 inhibition is thought to represent reduced metabolic channeling of HCO3- to the intracellular HCO3- binding site of AE1. To test the hypothesis that CA2 binding might itself allosterically activate AE1 in Xenopus oocytes, we compared Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities of AE1 polypeptides with truncation and missense mutations in the C-terminal tail. The distal renal tubular acidosis-associated AE1 901X mutant exhibited both Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities. In contrast, AE1 896X, 891X, and AE1 missense mutants in the CA2 binding site were inactive as Cl-/HCO3- exchangers despite exhibiting normal Cl-/Cl- exchange activities. Co-expression of CA2 enhanced wild-type AE1-mediated Cl-/HCO3- exchange, but not Cl-/Cl- exchange. CA2 co-expression could not rescue Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity in AE1 mutants selectively impaired in Cl-/HCO3- exchange. However, co-expression of transport-incompetent AE1 mutants with intact CA2 binding sites completely rescued Cl-/HCO3- exchange by an AE1 missense mutant devoid of CA2 binding, with activity further enhanced by CA2 co-expression. The same transport-incompetent AE1 mutants failed to rescue Cl-/HCO3- exchange by the AE1 truncation mutant 896X, despite preservation of the latter's core CA2 binding site. These data increase the minimal extent of a functionally defined CA2 binding site in AE1. The inter-protomeric rescue of HCO3- transport within the AE1 dimer shows functional proximity of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of one protomer to the anion translocation pathway in the adjacent protomer within the AE1 heterodimer. The data strongly support the hypothesis that an intact transbilayer anion translocation pathway is completely contained within an AE1 monomer.

These gene products encode polypeptides of tripartite structure, comprising an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 400–700 aa, 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; wt, wild-type; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; ANOVA, analysis of variance; eAE1, erythroid AE1; kAE1, kidney AE1; CA2, carbonic anhydrase II; dRTA, distal renal tubular acidosis. a transmembrane domain of 500 aa traversing the lipid bilayer 12–14 times, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.

The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain also provides a scaffold for enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, and binds denatured hemoglobin in pathological settings (8Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The polytopic transmembrane domain (in the absence of nearly all the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain) suffices to mediate anion exchange by AE1 (1Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 899-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Alper S.L. Darman R.B. Chernova M.N. Dahl N.K. J. Nephrol. 2002; 15: S41-S53PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sterling D. Casey J.R.

Complete removal of the AE1 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail was shown some time ago to abolish AE1 function in Xenopus oocytes (11Chernova M.N. Humphreys B.D. Robinson D.H. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Garcia A.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but recent years have seen a major re-evaluation of the functional role of this C-terminal tail. Erythroid AE1 (eAE1) is phosphorylated in intact red cells at aa Tyr-904 (13Brunati A.M. Bordin L. Clari G. James P. Quadroni M. Baritono E. Pinna L.A. Donella-Deana A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1550-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and at other tyrosine residues, but with still unknown consequence to anion transport rate or cytoskeletal association. The AE1 C-terminal tail associates in a yeast two-hybrid assay with the PDZ domain proteins syntenin and PICK-1 (14Cowan C.A. Yokoyama N. Bianchi L.M. Henkemeyer M. Fritzsch B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 417-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the PMPV terminal sequence of AE1 has been proposed as a class II PDZ recognition sequence. However, p55, the only PDZ domain-containing protein of the red cell membrane identified to date, is thought to interact with AE1, if at all, indirectly via protein 4.1R (15Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The AE1 C-terminal tail also binds carbonic anhydrase II (CA2) (16Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Vince and Reithmeier (17Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) demonstrated that aa 886–890 of human eAE1 provided a core binding site for a positively charged region within the N-terminal 17 aa of CA2 (18Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Supuran et al. (19Scozzafava A. Supuran C.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that peptides containing this core CA2 binding sequence could enhance CA2 activity in vitro. The important experiments of Sterling et al. (20Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (315) Google Scholar) provided evidence that AE1 binding of functional CA2 is critical for AE1-mediated Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity transiently expressed in 293 cells, as well for activity of transfected AE2 and AE3. CA2 also binds to and appears to regulate activity of the SLC4A4 Na+-HCO3- cotransporter, NBCe1 (21Gross E. Pushkin A.M. Abuladze N. Fedotoff O. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, CA2 binding may play an important general role in the function of SLC4 bicarbonate transporters, as well as for other pH-regulatory ion transporters (22Li X. Alvarez B. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36085-36091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). AE1 is so far unique among the electroneutral SLC4 anion exchanger genes in its association with Mendelian human diseases. Mutations in the AE1 gene cause autosomal dominant spherocytic anemia and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, with no renal phenotype. A distinct set of mutations cause autosomal dominant or recessive forms of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) without an erythroid phenotype (1Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 899-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Alper S.L. Darman R.B. Chernova M.N. Dahl N.K. J. Nephrol. 2002; 15: S41-S53PubMed Google Scholar). The eAE1 and kidney AE1 polypeptides (kAE1, expressed exclusively in type A intercalated cells of collecting duct) differ in the absence in kAE1 of the N-terminal 65 aa present in eAE1. Whereas the mutations associated with erythroid dyscrasias are distributed throughout the coding sequence of AE1, those associated to date with dRTA are restricted to the C-terminal transmembrane domain and to the short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Two families with dominant forms of dRTA have been reported to express distinct truncation mutations in the AE1 C-terminal tail (23Karet F.E. Gainza F.J. Gyory A.Z. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J.

In contrast, kAE1 901X and the R589H mutants expressed in 293 cells failed to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (28Quilty J.A. Li J. Reithmeier R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F810-F820Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The intracellular retention phenotype of kAE1 901X exhibited dominant negative properties in 293 cells (29Quilty J.A. Cordat E. Riethmeier R.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 895-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these phenotypes differed in polarized epithelial cells (30Devonald M.A. Ihrke G. Smith A.N. Karet F.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 57AGoogle Scholar). 2S. L. Alper and D. Prabakaran, unpublished results. The CA2 binding site of the AE1 C-terminal tail lies close to the terminus of the truncated dRTA mutant AE1 R901X, but the consequence of this truncation to Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity has not been tested. The idea of a bicarbonate transport metabolon (31Reithmeier R.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is an important and attractive one, but the mechanism by which CA2 stimulates HCO3- transport by SLC4 anion transport proteins remains uncertain. Bound CA2 might enhance AE1 activity by channeling HCO3- to or away from the cytoplasmic anion translocation pathway binding site of AE1 (20Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Reithmeier R.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, another AE1-binding protein, glycophorin A, is thought to alter the conformational state of AE1 to accelerate its biosynthetic delivery to the cell surface (32Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and perhaps also to increase the anion transport rate of AE1 at the cell surface (33Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilaganathan B. Tanner M.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of a similar conformational role for CA2 binding on AE1 function has not been tested. Prompted by these and other considerations, we tested the hypothesis that CA2 binding mediates not only metabolic channeling of substrate, but also might allosterically up-regulate AE1 activity. To do so, we compared in Xenopus oocytes the consequences of various AE1 C-terminal tail mutations to kAE1-mediated Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities in the absence and presence of co-expressed CA2. The results of these experiments, although not supporting allosteric regulation of AE1 by CA2, enhance understanding of the role of CA2 activity in AE1 function and enlarge the extent of a functionally defined core CA2 binding site. In providing a new constraint on the molecular distance across which CA2 can activate AE1, the data also reveal a possible role for inter-protomeric interactions in AE1-mediated Cl-/HCO3- exchange. Finally, the data provide additional strong evidence that an AE1 monomer encompasses an intact transbilayer anion translocation pathway. cDNAs and Mutagenesis—cDNAs encoding human kAE1 (27Jarolim P.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the oocytes studied in the 36Cl- influx assay. 950 μl of medium was collected at 3-min intervals and replaced with fresh medium of desired composition. All assays included a final efflux period in the presence of the anion transport inhibitor, DIDS (200 μm). Oocytes exhibiting <50% inhibition of 36Cl- efflux by DIDS were considered leaky, and excluded from analysis. These comprised fewer than 2% of the total studied. All flux experiments were performed with oocytes from at least two frogs. Cl-/HCO3- Exchange Measurement—Oocytes previously injected with water or with kAE1 cRNA were loaded with 5 μm BCECF-AM for 30 min, and mounted in a 0.8-ml superfusion chamber on a microscope stage. Cl-/HCO3- exchange was measured by BCECF fluorescence ratio imaging of oocyte pHi changes during removal and restoration of perfusate Cl- (72 mm) in the presence of 5% CO2, 24 mmNaHCO3-, with gluconate as substituting anion (41Jiang L.W. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C191-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data acquisition in early experiments was with Image-1 FL and analysis with Image-1 (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA), but subsequent data acquisition and analysis used Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Initial rates of dpHi/dt following solution changes of superfusate were measured by least squares linear fit of initial slopes. Initial pHi in the presence of CO2/HCO3- was indistinguishable among all groups of oocytes reported this paper. Thus, dpHi/dt was proportional to proton equivalent flux. All experimental groups with >6 oocytes derived from at least two frogs. Groups of 6 oocytes were either from two frogs, or represented oocytes from one frog evaluated on two successive days. Immunoblot—Groups of 5–10 individually defolliculated oocytes, or an equal number of folliculated oocytes within a cluster resected from an ovarian fragment, were homogenized on ice in 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and immediately solubilized in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli SDS load buffer. Protein (normalized to starting oocyte number) was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit antibody to bovine erythroid carbonic anhydrase 2 or to human erythroid carbonic anhydrase 1 (both from Polysciences, Warrenton, PA), followed by peroxidase-coupled anti-Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and development by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Functional Effects of Sequential Truncation of the kAE1 C-terminal Cytoplasmic Tail—We exploited the ability to compare Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities in Xenopus oocytes to test two initial hypotheses. The first hypothesis proposed that the dRTA mutation 901X might impair selectively Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity while preserving Cl-/Cl- exchange activity. The second hypothesis proposed that CA2 binding might serve not only to provide a locally elevated concentration of transport substrate, but might also control anion transport rate by inducing or stabilizing an AE1 conformation favoring or required for transport. Such a conformational change might be evident in an effect of CA2 binding on kAE1-mediated Cl-/Cl- exchange. Fig. 1 depicts the truncated polypeptides examined in this study. Fig. 2 compares the effects on kAE1-mediated Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities of progressive truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of kAE1. Fig. 2A shows that the dRTA mutant 901X lacking the C-terminal 11 aa of kAE1 exhibits wt Cl- influx into Xenopus oocytes, as reported previously (25Toye A.M. Bruce L.J. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cl- influx mediated by kAE1 901X did not differ from wt whether 1, 5, or 10 ng of cRNA was injected, did not exhibit a dominant negative phenotype when co-expressed with wt AE1, and was normally stimulated by co-expressed glycophorin A (25Toye A.M. Bruce L.J. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Engineered truncations lacking 16 aa (kAE1 896X) and 21 aa (891X) also mediated wt rates of Cl- influx. However, truncation of 27 aa (885X) or of 30 aa (882X) abolished Cl- influx activity. kAE1 891X and 896X similarly displayed wt Cl-/Cl- exchange activity measured as 36Cl- efflux (Fig. 2B). The dRTA mutant kAE1 901X also preserved Cl-/Cl- exchange activity, although at reduced rates in these experiments. Cl-/HCO3- exchange mediated by kAE1 901X was only slightly (but statistically significantly) reduced compared with wt kAE1 (Fig. 2, C and D). However, further truncation of kAE1 abolished Cl-/HCO3- exchange. Thus, despite their wt rates of Cl-/Cl- exchange (Fig. 2, A and B), the kAE1 truncation mutants 896X and 891X were devoid of Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity (Fig. 2, C and D). This property was unexpected, because both of these truncation mutants preserve the in vitro defined LDAAA core AE1 binding site for CA2 comprising AE1 residues 886–890. The observed specific loss of Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity suggests that the CA2 binding site of AE1 as delimited by functional studies must be more extensive than the “LDADD” core site defined by CA2 binding to AE1 fusion protein (17Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The retention of Cl-/Cl- exchange activity by these two kAE1 mutants incapable of Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity does not support the hypothesis that CA2 binding changes AE1 conformation in a manner that can regulate transport rate of non-bicarbonate anion. CA2 Coexpression with kAE1 Stimulates Cl-/HCO3- but Not Cl - /Cl - Exchange—Co-expression of wild-type CA2 with eAE1 in 293 cells does not accelerate Cl-/HCO3- exchange rates (20Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Coexpression of CA2 with kAE1 in Xenopus oocytes offers the opportunity to compare effects of CA2 on kAE1-mediated Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities. Fig. 3A shows that CA2 does not itself increase 36Cl- influx into water-injected oocytes. Moreover, CA2 co-expression with kAE1 even at nominal 3–4-fold molar excess of cRNA (10 ng) did not enhance kAE1-mediated 36Cl- influx. kAE1-mediated 36Cl- efflux into 24 mmHCO3- and into ND-96 were compared in the same oocytes (Fig. 3B). Efflux required permeant extracellular anion (isethionate supported only minimal efflux) and was inhibited by DIDS. As shown in Fig. 3C, CA2 coexpression led to a slight but statistically significant reduction in 36Cl- efflux into extracellular Cl-, and inhibited by 50% 36Cl- efflux into Cl--free CO2/HCO3- medium. These results suggest increased generation of HCO3- by CA2 near the intracellular face of the plasma membrane, where it can compete for efflux by kAE1 with intracellular 36Cl-. In contrast, CA2 co-expression enhanced Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity mediated by wt kAE1 as well as that by the dRTA mutant kAE1 901X. However, CA2 co-expression with the more extensively truncated kAE1 mutants 896X and 891X did not lead to rescue of their Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity (Fig. 3D). kAE1 Missense Mutations Which Abrogate CA2 Binding Selectively Abolish Cl-/HCO3- Exchange but Maintain Cl - /Cl - Exchange—Selected missense mutations in the core CA2 binding site of the AE1 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail have been shown to abrogate binding of CA2 (17Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mutation of the core binding sequence LDAAA to ADADD or to LDAAA abolished CA2 binding to AE1 fusion protein, whereas conversion to LDPDD retained binding. Interestingly, all three of these missense mutant polypeptides retained wild-type rates of Cl-/Cl- exchange measured as 36Cl- influx (Fig. 4A). Cl-/Cl- exchange measured as 36Cl- efflux was also preserved in all these mutants, although not quite at wild-type levels (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities correlated with previously reported CA2 binding properties. Whereas the mutants LDAAA and ADADD exhibited no Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity and were unaffected by coexpression of CA2, the mutant LDPDD retained near-wt Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity, which was further increased by co-expression of CA2 (Fig. 4, C and D). A Transport-incompetent AE1 Mutant with an Intact CA2 Binding Site Rescues the Cl-/HCO3- Exchange Activity of a kAE1 Missense Mutant Deficient in CA2 Binding—The above experiments revealed that kAE1 required an intact “functional CA2 binding site” to respond to CA2 co-expression with enhanced Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. However, neither CA2 co-expression nor integrity of the CA2 binding"
https://openalex.org/W2044191832,"Abstract The C3stau2 exoenzyme from Staphylococcus aureus is a C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferase that ADP-ribosylates not only RhoA-C but also RhoE/Rnd3. In this study we have crystallized and determined the structure of C3stau2 in both its native form and in complex with NAD at 1.68- and 2.02-A resolutions, respectively. The topology of C3stau2 is similar to that of C3bot1 from Clostridium botulinum (with which it shares 35% amino acid sequence identity) with the addition of two extra helices after strand β1. The native structure also features a novel orientation of the catalytic ARTT loop, which approximates the conformation seen for the “NAD bound” form of C3bot1. C3stau2 orients NAD similarly to C3bot1, and on binding NAD, C3stau2 undergoes a clasping motion and a rearrangement of the phosphate-nicotinamide binding loop, enclosing the NAD in the binding site. Comparison of these structures with those of C3bot1 and related toxins reveals a degree of divergence in the interactions with the adenine moiety among the ADP-ribosylating toxins that contrasts with the more conserved interactions with the nicotinamide. Comparison with C3bot1 gives some insight into the different protein substrate specificities of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2108295405,"Osteoblast maturation is a multistep series of events characterized by an integrated cascade of gene expression that are accompanied by specific phenotypic alterations. To find new osteoblast-related genes we cloned differentially expressed cDNAs characteristic of specific differentiation stages in the mouse osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells by a differential display method. We identified a novel cDNA encoding a putative glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, GDE3, which specifically was expressed at the stage of matrix maturation. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence contains 539 amino acids including seven putative transmembrane domains and a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase region in one of the extracellular loops. Northern blot analysis revealed that GDE3 was also expressed in spleen as well as primary calvarial osteoblasts and femur. We next transfected HEK293T cells with GDE3 with green fluorescent protein fused to the C terminus. The green fluorescent protein-fused protein accumulated at the cell periphery, and the transfected cells overexpressing the protein changed from a spread form to rounded form with disappearance of actin filaments. Immunofluorescence staining with GDE3 antibody and phalloidin in MC3T3-E1 cells indicated that endogenous GDE3 might be co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton. To identify a role for GDE3 in osteoblast differentiation, MC3T3-E1 cells stably expressing the full-length protein were constructed. Expression of GDE3 showed morphological changes, resulting in dramatic increases in alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposit. These results suggest that GDE3 might be a novel seven-transmembrane protein with a GP-PDE-like extracellular motif expressed during the osteoblast differentiation that dramatically accelerates the program of osteoblast differentiation and is involved in the morphological change of cells.

The osteoblasts are mesenchymal cells derived from bone marrow stromal cells, periosteum, or undifferentiated stem cells in connective tissue. Based on morphological and histological studies, osteoblast cells develop in a presumed linear sequence progressing from osteoprogenitors to preosteoblasts, osteoblasts, and lining cells or osteocytes (1Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The process also has been subdivided into three developmental time stages: proliferation, extracellular matrix development, and mineralization. Numerous investigations have been directed at elucidating factors that regulate osteoblast differentiation, and have shown many genes encoding either transcription factors or growth factors essential for bone formation (3Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 4Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar). It was well known that the transcription factor, core-binding factor-α1 (Cbfa1), 1The abbreviations used are: Cbfa1, core-binding factor α1; GP-PDE, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PTH, parathyroid hormone; GDE3, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 3; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. which belongs to the runt domain gene family, regulates the expression of multiple genes in the osteoblasts, is involved in osteoblast differentiation (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar, 6Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3651) Google Scholar). In fact, Cbfa1 is reported to have a direct causal relationship with cleidocranial syslpasia syndrome (7Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Although Cbfa1 expression is a pivotal event in endochondral bone formation (but it alones is not sufficient), the identification of genes induced prior to and after Cbfa1 will be essential to elucidate other factors, the interaction of which is required for normal skeletal differentiation. When primary or clonal osteoblast cells, such as MC3T3-E1 cells derived from newborn mice calvaria, are cultured with β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid, the cells undergo a differentiation process and eventually accumulated calcium contents (8Sudo H. Kodama H. Amagi Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In the current study, we employed the differential display method to isolate the components involved in osteoblast differentiation using MC3T3-E1 cells. We identified a novel protein, GDE3, which shares significant homology with bacterial glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-PDEs or GlpQs). Bacterial GP-PDEs are previously reported to play important roles in hydrolysis of deacylated phospholipid glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphocholine and glycerophosphoethanolamine, to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly-3-P), which is a major carbon and phosphate source (9Kasahara M. Makino K. Amemura M. Nakata A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Tommassen J. Eiglmeier K. Cole S.T. Overduin P. Larson T.J. Boos W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This reaction also generates the corresponding alcohols such as choline and ethanolamine that act as essential growth factors for bacteria. Previously, a mammalian homolog, GDE1/MIR16, which interacts with RGS16, was identified and characterized to localize on the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane (11Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Very recent study has shown that GP-PDE activity of GDE1/MIR16 is regulated by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (12Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions of mammalian GP-PDEs remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that transiently overexpressed GDE3 in HEK293T cells induced cell rounding accompanied with disappearance of actin filaments, and that stable transfection of GDE3 to MC3T3-E1 cells dramatically stimulated both osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, suggesting that GDE3 exerts its simulative effect on osteoblast differentiation via rearrangement of actin filaments. Materials—Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). Mouse monoclonal preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and HEK293T cells were obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, α-modification of Eagle's medium, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Invitrogen. Ascorbic acid was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Japan). β-Glycerol phosphate was from Nacalai tesque (Japan). [α-32P]dCTP and Hybond-N+ were products of Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid pEFneoI was a generous gift from Dr. Jinno (University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan). R-PE-conjugated rabbit IgG (H+L) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories, Inc. Cell Cultures and Osteogenic Treatment—The murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was cultured in a growth medium, α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. For studies examining the sequence of osteoblast differentiation, cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates (for alkaline phosphatase and calcium content assays) or 100-mm dishes (for RNA isolation). Four days after MC3T3-E1 cells reached confluence (day 0), the medium was replaced with osteogenic medium, growth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate. The medium was replaced every 3–4 days. The cells were grown in osteogenic medium for periods ranging from 7 to 28 days. A population of osteoblast cells was isolated from calvariae of newborn Wistar rats as previously reported (13Hagiwara H. Inoue A. Yamaguchi A. Yokose S. Furuya M. Tanaka S. Hirose S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1311-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in osteogenic medium. During subculture, the medium was replaced every 3 or 4 days. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Differential Display—Total RNA was isolated from MC3T3-E1 cells at 0 and 11 days, and the differential display was performed as previously described (14Tsuda M. Imaizumi K. Katayama T. Kitagawa K. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Takagi T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6678-6684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (3 μg) was converted to cDNA with Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Subsequently, each pool of cDNA was amplified by PCR with 104 different arbitrary primers. After separation by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cDNA bands that appeared to be up-regulated after 11 days were recovered and reamplified with the corresponding primer. Reamplified cDNA fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The cDNA inserts from true positive clones were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination methods using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer and a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems). Screening of cDNA Library—To isolate the complete cDNA of GDE3, library screening was performed according to the standard procedure (15Yuasa K. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4897-4905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a 390-base pair fragment (nucleotides 1119–1508) of GDE3 cDNA as a probe and the MC3T3-E1 cDNA library. The pBluescript II SK(–) plasmid containing an insert DNA was isolated from a positive plaque by in vivo excision method (Stratagene), and nucleotide sequence of the insert DNA was determined. To isolate the complete cDNA of human GDE3, library screening was performed using full-length mouse GDE3 cDNA as a probe and the human spleen cDNA library. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by searching the GenBank™ data bank with BLAST. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), and poly(A)+ RNAs purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography using an mRNA separator kit (Clontech) were fractionated in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and 0.02 m MOPS (pH 7.0). Fractionated RNAs were transferred onto a nylon filter by capillary blotting and then cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was obtained from Clontech. 32P-Labeled cDNA fragments encoding mouse GDE3, mouse osteopontin, mouse osteocalcin, mouse osteonectin, mouse collagen I, and mouse cbfa1 were used for Northern blotting hybridization as probes. Hybridization was performed in 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 16 h with the probe. The membrane was washed finally with 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. Northern blots with poly(A)+ RNAs from mouse tissues including bone tissues were exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C for 2 days. Stable Transfection—1.7 kilobases of the GDE3 cDNA were subcloned into the expression vector pEF/neoI (16Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) containing the EF1α promoter (17Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) and the neomycin selectable marker gene, to yield pEF-GDE3. For stable transfection of MC3T3-E1 cells, the cells were electroporated at 0.25 kV and 950 microfarads using 10 μg of pEF-GDE3 or vector pEF/neoI (control). After replating, the cells were treated with 500 μg/ml G418 for 14 days. G418-resistant colonies were identified, and independent colonies were re-seeded at 5,000 cells/cm2 in growth medium, respectively. After 3 days, the medium was replaced with osteogenic medium, growth medium supplemented with 5 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (day 0). Transfected MC3T3-E1 cells were subjected to alkaline phosphatase assays at day 7, and to calcium content assays at day 14. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Transfected MC3T3-E1 cells from individual wells of a 24-well plate (1.9 cm2/well) were washed twice with PBS, scraped in alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100), and then sonicated on ice by a handy sonic (TOMY Seiko, Japan). Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed by the phosphatase substrate system for EIA (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) using the supernatant of the cell lysate. Aliquots of supernatants were subjected to protein assay with a Bio-Rad kit (Bio-Rad). Activity was corrected for protein concentration. Statistical significance was determined by the unpaired Student's t test. Mineralization Assay—Transfected MC3T3-E1 clones cultured in osteogenic medium for 14 days were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with saline solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 0.2% Triton X-100. An aliquot was removed for protein determination using a Bradford assay. Thereafter, 0.5 ml of 0.5 n HCl was added to the lysates and the mineralized materials were dissolved with overnight gentle shaking. The calcium content in the sample was quantitated by the o-cresolphthalein complexone method with Calcium C-Test (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Results are expressed as calcium per protein. Transient Expression and Immunofluorescence Microscopy— HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the full-length GDE3 cDNA in the expression vector pCMV-EGFPN1(pGFP-GDE3) by LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in 0.2 m NaPO4 (pH 7.2), for 30 min and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were treated with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. MC3T3-E1 cells grown on glass coverslips were directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in 0.2 m NaPO4 (pH 7.2) for 30 min and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-GDE3 antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 h at 4 °C. The primary antibody was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (BD Biosciences). Preparation of Recombinant GDE3 Protein and Antibody—A cDNA encoding part of GDE3 (amino acids 210–332) was subcloned into the site of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) expression vector pMAL-c (New England Biolabs), generating pMAL-GDE3. The MBP fusion protein construct pMAL-GDE3 was introduced into the bacterial strain JM109 (TOYOBO, Japan). An overnight culture in LB medium was diluted 1:100 into 100 ml of fresh LB medium and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 2 h. After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, the culture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed once with ice-cold soluble buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold soluble buffer containing 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After freezing and thawing, suspended cells were sonicated on ice in short bursts. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were settled by centrifugation at 700 × g, washed five times with ice-cold soluble buffer, and incubated with 10 mm maltose for 10 min at 4 °C to elute MBP-GDE3 fusion protein from the beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against PBS. Polyclonal antibody raised against GDE3 was obtained by injecting rabbits with MBP-GDE3 fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant. Antibody was affinity purified by using an antigen-coupled Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot—The expression plasmid pGFP-GDE3 was transfected into HEK293T cells by LipofectAMINE PLUS. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell suspension was disrupted by a handy sonic for 15 s (three times with 1-min intervals), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Ten μg of the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. MC3T3-E1 cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS, harvested in the homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), sonicated for 20 s, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was rehomogenized in the homogenizing buffer. The solubilized membrane proteins (30 μg/lane) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Stably transfected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer. After the cell suspension was disrupted by a handy sonic, 10 μg of the homogenates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to an Immobilon P filter (Millipore). The blots were blocked for 18 h at 4 °C by soaking in 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with anti-GDE3 antibody (diluted 1:1,000). Signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence systems (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Antibody dilutions were performed in PBS plus 2% FCS. HEK293T cells were washed with PBS plus 2% FCS, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-GDE3 antibody (1 μg/ml) or normal rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml), and followed by incubation with R-PE-conjugated rabbit IgG (H+L). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACS Caliber (BD Biosciences). Results are expressed as percentage of cells staining above background. Identification of Novel Osteoblast Differentiation Specific cDNA by Differential Display—To identify new genes that are differentially expressed or regulated in differentiating preosteoblasts, we employed an RNA differential display procedure. Total RNA was prepared from undifferentiated (day 0) and differentiated (day 11) MC3T3-E1 cells conditioned with β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid. cDNAs derived from the RNAs were subsequently assayed for differential display PCR reaction in the presence of different sets of primers arbitrary in sequence. We focused on a cDNA fragment, termed fragment No. 45 found to be only amplified to a greater degree from the differentiated MC3T3-E1 RNA pool. The No. 45 fragment was excised, reamplified, and subcloned into a TA cloning vector, pGEM-T. Northern blots, probed with this subcloned cDNA, detected a single mRNA transcript of 2.4 kb, which was induced after 11 days of treatment with β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid. Molecular Cloning of the Entire Coding Sequence of GDE3 and Deduced Amino Acid Sequence—The full-length cDNA of fragment No. 45 was obtained by screening a λ-phage cDNA library from differentiated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts by a conventional hybridization method with the differential display-derived cDNA fragment. Complete nucleotide sequence of the resulting cDNA was composed of 1617 nucleotides that encodes a polypeptide of 539 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 61 kDa (the DNA sequence data is available from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data bases under accession number AB048364). We also cloned the full-length cDNA of the human homolog from a human spleen cDNA library (accession number AB048363) (Fig. 1A). GDE3 Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Comparisons—At the amino terminus of the predicted protein, there is no apparent signal peptide sequence. As determined by hydropathy analysis by the SOSUI program and motif analysis by the Genetyx™ program, the peptide consists of three regions: a large extracellular domain of 225 amino acids, a 7-transmembrane region of 161 amino acids, an intracellular cytoplasmic tail of 40 amino acids, and a short extracellular cytoplasmic tail of 24 amino acids (Fig. 1A) (18Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). There are predicted N-linked glycosylation sites present in the extracellular domains. A search of the GenBank™ data bank using the nucleotide and protein sequence revealed that no identical proteins have been reported. However, very interestingly, one of the predicted extracellular regions between amino acid residues 218 and 442 shares significant similarity with bacterial GP-PDEs from Escherichia coli (9Kasahara M. Makino K. Amemura M. Nakata A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Tommassen J. Eiglmeier K. Cole S.T. Overduin P. Larson T.J. Boos W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Haemophilus influenzae (19Munson Jr., R.S. Sasaki K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4569-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Bacillus subtilis. It was recently reported that GDE1/MIR16, the membrane interacting protein of RGS16, has significant homology with bacterial GP-PDEs and one membrane-spanning region (11Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the GDE3 protein contains 7 transmembrane-spanning regions. Expression of GDE3 in Comparison to Other Osteoblast mRNAs in Differentiating MC3T3-E1 Cells—Next, we characterized the expression pattern of GDE3 mRNA in comparison to other osteoblast marker mRNAs in MC3T3-E1 development (Fig. 2A). Total RNA was extracted from MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid for 0, 4, 7, 11, and 15 days. This conditioned culture induced differentiation as indicated by increased osteopontin, osteocalcin, type I collagen, and cbfa1 mRNA, standard markers of mature osteoblasts. The GDE3 transcript was first detectable at day 4 and peaked at day 7. Additionally, a very weak hybridization signal was also observed at days 11 and 15. Because osteopontin and osteocalcin mRNAs, considered mature osteoblast markers, were increased at days 11 and 15, GDE3 mRNA was specifically expressed in premature stages of MC3T3-E1 development. Pattern of GDE3 mRNA Expression in Various Mouse Tissues—To investigate whether the expression of this transcript was specific to bone or not, Northern blot analysis was performed using poly(A)+ RNA derived from various mouse tissues and the GDE3 cDNA fragment as a probe (Fig. 2, C and D). The mRNA corresponding to GDE3 was expressed in femur and calvaria. As noted also, a strong hybridization signal was observed in spleen. Furthermore, we determined that GDE3 mRNA was also expressed in the rat fetal calvaria cells (Fig. 2E). Preparation of Anti-GDE3 Antibody and Detection of Endogenous GDE3 Protein in MC3T3-E1 Cells—Next, we prepared a polyclonal antibody against a putative GP-PDE domain in a large putative extracellular loop of mouse GDE3 using a bacterially synthesized MBP-fused fragment corresponding to amino acids 219–332. The specificity of the purified anti-GDE3 antibody was tested by Western blot analysis of total proteins from HEK293T cells transfected with an expression vector encoding GFP-tagged GDE3(GFP-GDE3). Although no signal was observed in the mock-transfected HEK293T cells, a specific band was detected in the cells transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-GDE3 using either anti-GDE3 (Fig. 2B, left panel) or anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). Next, to determine whether the GDE3 mRNA detected in osteoblasts is indeed translated into a protein, Western blot analysis was performed with membrane protein from MC3T3-E1 cells. The anti-GDE3 antibody recognized an immunoreactive polypeptide of 65 kDa in the membrane fraction of MC3T3-E1 cells, and that the GDE3 protein level was up-regulated at day 7 (Fig. 2B, right panel), paralleled with the increase in GDE3 mRNA level. Morphological Changes by Transiently Overexpressed GDE3 Proteins in HEK293T Cells—To examine the physiological role of cellular localization of GDE3, we next transfected the GDE3 overexpressing plasmid GFP-GDE3 into HEK293T cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that wild-type GFP was distributed evenly over the entire cytoplasm in HEK293T cells when transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the wild-type GFP (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, GDE3-fused GFP was concentrated at the cell periphery and also at lamellipodial extension (Fig. 3D). Surprisingly, significant changes of HEK293T morphology were observed: transient overexpression of GDE3 resulted in the cells rounding up (Fig. 3B), which correlates with disappearance of actin filaments as visualized with rhodamine phalloidin at the cell periphery (Fig. 3E). Whereas the wild type HEK293T cells were spread and squamous (Fig. 3A). These findings strongly suggested that GDE3 is involved in osteoblast differentiation by rearrangement of actin filaments and by resulting morphological changes of osteoblasts. In addition, FACS analysis showed that the purified anti-GDE3 antibody strongly binds to living HEK293T cells expressing GDE3 compared with normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 4), indicating that the putative GP-PDE domain faces lumen/extracellular space.Fig. 4Fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis. GDE3 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and recognition of the protein by purified anti-GDE3 antibody was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter. Cells were incubated either with anti-GDE3 antibody against GP-PDE domain (black) or with normal rabbit IgG (dotted), and followed by incubation with R-PE-conjugated rabbit IgG (H+L). The shift of cell counts to higher fluorescence intensities was observed when using anti-GDE3 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cellular Localization of GDE3 in MC3T3-E1 Cells—To determine the cellular localization of GDE3 in osteoblastic cells, MC3T3-E1 cells were immunostained with the anti-GDE3 antibody described above. Much brighter staining was seen along with the plasma membrane and cytoskeletal filaments indicating co-localization of the GDE3 protein with actin fibers. To know whether GDE3 interacts with actin, we immunostained MC3T3-E1 cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to visualize F-actin filaments. Resulting double staining showed that most endogenous GDE3 products were co-localized with the F-actin cytoskeleton in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 5C). Constitutive Expression of GDE3 Dramatically Promoted MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Differentiation—Because both GDE3 mRNA and protein were expressed during ascorbate- and β-glycerophosphate-induced differentiation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, we investigated whether this novel gene expression could alter the program of osteoblast differentiation. These cells were stably transfected with the full-length coding region of GDE3 (MC3T3-E1 overexpression) or with the empty vector (MC3T3-E1 control) and selected markers of osteoblast"

Much of trypanosome antigenic variation uses homologous recombination of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)-encoding genes into specialized transcription sites, but little is known about the processes that regulate it. Here we describe the effects on VSG switching when two central mismatch repair genes, MSH2 and MLH1, are mutated. We show that disruption of the parasite mismatch repair system causes an increased frequency of homologous recombination, both between perfectly matched DNA molecules and between DNA molecules with divergent sequences. Mismatch repair therefore provides an important regulatory role in homologous recombination in this ancient eukaryote. Despite this, the mismatch repair system has no detectable role in regulating antigenic variation, meaning that VSG switching is either immune to mismatch selection or that mismatch repair acts in a subtle manner, undetectable by current assays.

African trypanosomes are protistan parasites that infect mammals and are considered to have diverged early in eukaryotic evolution (1Sogin M.L. Elwood H.J. Gunderson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), prior to the radiation of animals, plants, and fungi. In the mammal Trypanosoma brucei resides in the blood-stream and tissue fluids, where it is subject to immune attack. To evade immune killing, it undergoes antigenic variation, a strategy for changing surface coats found in a diverse range of microbes (2Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Adv. Parasitol. 2001; 49: 1-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Donelson J.E. Acta Trop. 2003; 85: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The surface coat of T. brucei is composed of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; ES, expression sites; MMR, mismatch repair; MEPS, minimal efficient processing segments.1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; ES, expression sites; MMR, mismatch repair; MEPS, minimal efficient processing segments. (4Cross G.A. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). VSG genes are expressed from telomeric transcription units, called expression sites (ES), of which ∼20 can be used while the parasite is present in the mammalian host. Only one ES is expressed at a given time from a specific sub-nuclear domain (5Navarro M. Gull K. Nature. 2001; 414: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but coordinated transcriptional switches (termed in situ switches) can activate a silent ES and inactivate the transcribed site (6Cross G.A.

T. brucei also contains hundreds of silent VSG genes, both in multigene arrays in the megabase chromosomes and at the telomeres of minichromosomes. This silent reservoir is activated by recombination reactions that move the genes into the ES, normally by a gene conversion process (13Borst P. Cross G.A. Cell. 1982; 29: 291-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 14Pays E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1985; 32: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Robinson N.P. Burman N. Melville S.E. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5839-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that recombinational VSG switching occurs by homologous recombination. No specific sequence has been shown to be essential in activating VSG gene conversion, but instead the reactions use variable amounts of flanking sequence homologies (2Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Adv. Parasitol. 2001; 49: 1-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of a gene encoding a major enzyme of eukaryotic homologous recombination, RAD51, impairs VSG switching (16McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistent with this genetic analysis, inactivation of KU70 or KU80, which catalyze a non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA repair in other organisms (17Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R759-R761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Barnes D.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R455-R457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), does not affect VSG switching (19Conway C. McCulloch R. Ginger M.L. Robinson N.P. Browitt A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21269-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of MRE11 also does not affect VSG switching (20Robinson N.P. McCulloch R. Conway C. Browitt A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26185-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), despite this gene encoding an enzyme that has been proposed to have many roles in homologous and non-homologous recombination (21D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Mismatch repair (MMR) plays a critical role in maintaining genetic stability, in part by correcting base mismatches that can arise through replication errors or chemical damage (reviewed in Refs. 22Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 23Yang W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24De Wind N. Hays J.B.

In most bacteria, a homodimer of MutS binds mismatched DNA and is then recognized by a homodimer of MutL, which is thought to recruit downstream factors that catalyze the repair reaction. Eukaryotic MMR is catalyzed by MutS and MutL homologues, but here the proteins act as heterodimers. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are two MutS-related heterodimers. One is composed of MSH2 and MSH6 and recognizes base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops, whereas the second is composed of MSH2 and MSH3 and binds a larger range of insertion/deletion loops. Two MutL heterodimers, composed of MLH1 and either PMS1 or MLH3, have been well characterized in S. cerevisiae, and a third (MLH1–MLH2) has recently come to light (26Durant S.T. Morris M.M. Illand M.

Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Essentially the same MutS- and MutL-related proteins are found in most eukaryotes, although there is some variation in the numbers that different organisms contain (28Eisen J.A.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 414-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have shown that T. brucei contains orthologues of five such proteins and that at least two of them function in MMR. 2J. S. Bell, T. I. Harvey, A.-M. Sims, and R. McCulloch, submitted for publication.2J. S. Bell, T. I. Harvey, A.-M. Sims, and R. McCulloch, submitted for publication. An MSH2-related gene has also been characterized in Trypanosoma cruzi (31Augusto-Pinto L. Bartholomeu D.C. Teixeira S.M. Pena S.D. Machado C.R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Augusto-Pinto L. Teixeira S.M. Pena S.D. Machado C.R. Genetics. 2003; 164: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar). Mismatches can also arise during the DNA strand exchange step of recombination between non-identical DNA substrates. These are recognized by the MMR machinery, which either triggers mismatch correction, resulting in gene conversion, or recombination abortion (reviewed in Refs. 33Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar and 34Evans E. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7839-7844Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). MMR anti-recombination activity has been described in bacteria, yeast, and mammals (35Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3304-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which the MMR machinery aborts homologous recombination is not yet clear, but destruction of DNA strand exchange heteroduplexes by MMR-catalyzed nicking and non-destructive reversal or rejection of the heteroduplexes has been suggested (33Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 34Evans E. Alani E. Mol. Cell.

In T. brucei, transformed DNA appears to integrate into the genome almost exclusively by homologous recombination (43Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that, as in yeast, homologous recombination is the major DNA double strand break repair pathway. Indirect evidence from such transformation experiments has suggested that MMR influences homologous recombination in both T. brucei (44Blundell P.A. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the related parasite Leishmania (45Papadopoulou B. Dumas C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given that T. brucei antigenic variation is heavily dependent on homologous recombination, mismatch repair might be envisaged to be an important regulatory component of the immune evasion process. Here we test the contribution that MMR makes to antigenic variation, and we quantify the constraint that MMR places upon homologous recombination in this parasite. T. brucei Strains and Growth—T. brucei Lister 427 bloodstream cells were used and grown at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium (46Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). MSH2 and MLH1 mutants for assaying VSG switching were made in strain 3174,2 a derivative of MITat1.2a (47McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Determination of VSG switching frequency and pattern has been described previously (16McCulloch R.

To assay the effect of base mismatches on recombination, MITat1.2a cells were transformed with the construct pTHT (43Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 44Blundell P.A. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Biochem.

The constructs used to create MSH2 and MLH1 mutants will be described elsewhere, as will the approaches to confirm the mutations.2 Generation of HYG Targeting Constructs—Constructs to target HYG in the HTUB cell line were made by PCR on 2 ng of plasmid pTHT (43Conway C.

Reactions were performed at 94 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min; the 914-bp products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Herculase polymerase (Stratagene) was used to make flanks homologous to HYG; sequencing revealed no base changes relative to HYG in pTHT. Two rounds of PCR with Taq polymerase (Advanced Biotechnologies) were used to make HYG mismatched flanks. The first round reaction contained, in addition to standard dNTPs, dPTP and 8-oxo-dGTP (Amersham Biosciences; 100 μm). After cycles 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, a 1-μl sample was removed for template in a second TaqPCR with a standard set of nucleotides. A number of products from the 6-second round amplifications were sequenced, and clones were chosen for their percent sequence divergence (to the nearest integer) relative to HYG in pTHT. All mutations were base changes and the majority were transitions. In all but the 1% divergent clone, the mismatches were spread throughout the PCR product (Fig. 3B). To generate targeting constructs from each recombination flank, a bleomycin resistance cassette (BLE) was cloned into a central NdeI site, generating the plasmids HYGwt::BLE, HYG01::BLE, HYG02::BLE, etc. BLE contains a bleomycin resistance protein open reading frame flanked upstream and downstream by intergenic sequence from the actin and calmodulin loci, respectively (47McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); these provide processing signals to make mature mRNA and are unlinked in the T. brucei genome, so homologous recombination can only occur via the HYG targeting flanks. Determination of Transformation Frequency—Transformation of the HYG targeting constructs was performed as described previously (43Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but with modifications to provide reproducibility. T. brucei were grown maximally to 3 × 106 cells·ml–1 and minimally to 1.5 × 106 cells·ml–1, prior to transformation. 2.5 × 107 cells were used in each transformation, harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at room temperature, resuspended in 0.5 ml of ZMG buffer (43Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) pre-warmed to 37 °C, and electroporated with 3 μg of linearized DNA with a single pulse of 1.4 kV, 25 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. The cells were recovered for 18 h in 10 ml of HMI-9, harvested as before, then resuspended in HMI-9 containing 2.5 μg·ml–1 phleomycin (Cayla), and spread in 1.0-ml aliquots over a 24-well dish. To ensure clonal growth as far as possible, between 1 × 106 and 7.5 × 106 cells were plated out in this way. At least three selection plates were used in each transformation, and each construct was transformed into each cell line at least three times. Transformation efficiency was measured as the number of wells containing phleomycin-resistant cells after 8 days of growth. DNA constructs were AscI-digested prior to transformation and purified as before (43Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The DNA concentration of each linear construct was determined by electrophoretic separation of serial dilutions relative to a 1.0-kbp size ladder (Invitrogen), and adjusted to 1 μg·μl–1. The length of the minimal efficient processing segment (MEPS) in MMR+ and MMR– cells was calculated using the formula described by Datta et al. (48Datta A. Hendrix M. Lipsitch M. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9757-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar): L(1 – ea). In this equation, MEPS are calculated according to the slope a of a regression plot of ln (recombination frequency) versus the number of mismatches, where L is the length of the substrate. For L, we have assumed that each linear end of the constructs is used as a separate substrate, in that each end will search for homology independently, and therefore L is 450 bp, the size of each HYG recombination flank. Mutation of T. brucei MSH2 Does Not Affect VSG Switching—To examine the role of MMR in VSG switching, we first made mutants of MSH2 in the T. brucei strain 3174. This strain has been described before (47McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and contains copies of genes encoding resistance to the antibiotics hygromycin B and G418 in the actively transcribed ES (see Fig. 2A), allowing the frequency of VSG switching to be calculated and the types of switching events that occur to be assessed. Three independent MSH2 heterozygotic (+/–) and homozygotic (–/–) mutants were created by sequential transformation of the constructs ΔMSH2::BSD and ΔMSH2::PUR.2 In addition, an intact copy of MSH2 was re-integrated into the disrupted allele in one MSH2–/– cell line, re-expressing the gene (MSH2–/–/+). Southern analysis confirmed that the MSH2 open reading frame had been precisely deleted in the mutants, and reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that no intact MSH2 transcript was generated in the –/– cell lines (data not shown). Mutation of MSH2 had no discernible effect on the growth of T. brucei in vitro, but the –/– mutants displayed increased tolerance to the alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and increased frequencies of size changes at a number of microsatellite repeat loci,2 both phenotypes consistent with impaired MMR. The estimated VSG switching frequencies of the 3 MSH2+/– and MSH2–/– cells lines are shown in Fig. 1, compared with the wild type cells and the homozygotic mutant re-expressing MSH2. There is considerable variation in the VSG switching frequencies measured by this assay (16McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 47McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), due almost certainly to fluctuations in the timing of individual VSG switching events during population growth, reflecting the randomness of this process in T. brucei. Nevertheless, statistical examination of the data revealed no significant difference in VSG switching frequency in any of the MSH2 cell lines, indicating that MSH2 mutation does not detectably influence the overall frequency. VSG switching is a combination of in situ transcriptional switching events, which are not believed to involve recombination, and recombination events. Because it is possible that a high frequency of in situ switching might obscure an alteration in a relatively lower frequency of VSG recombinational switching resulting from MSH2 deletion, we characterized the switching events in a number of clonal switched variants. By using the antibiotic markers in the active ES, we can distinguish three types of switching reaction: in situ switches; gene conversions that remove the VSG gene and both upstream antibiotic markers (we term this ES gene conversion); and more localized gene conversions that remove just the VSG gene and proximal G418 resistance marker (VSG gene conversion). Again, we found considerable fluctuation in these data (Fig. 2). Comparing the wild type, MSH2+/–, and MSH2 re-expressing cell lines showed that, in this T. brucei strain, VSG gene conversion is the rarest event (0–37%) and in situ switching and ES gene conversion are more frequent (5–50% and 35–78% respectively), with the latter slightly predominating. The same general pattern was true in the MSH2–/– cell lines. Inactivation of MMR would most likely be expected to increase recombination rates, but we found that neither recombinational VSG switching event became predominant or, alternatively, was reduced. MSH2 mutation does not appear to detectably alter the profile of VSG switching. Mutation of T. brucei MLH1 Does Not Affect VSG Switching—Although MSH2 acts to suppress recombination, in S. cerevisiae it also functions, paradoxically, to promote homologous recombination in some circumstances. MSH2 and MSH3 cooperate with the nucleotide excision repair proteins RAD1 and RAD10 (49Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 50Saparbaev M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetics. 1996; 142: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Sugawara N. Paques F.

Cell. 2000; 5: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to remove non-homologous 3′ tails during the strand invasion step of homologous recombination and in another homology-dependent DNA repair pathway termed single strand annealing (reviewed in Ref. 53Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No other yeast MMR proteins are involved in this tail removal (51Sugawara N. Paques F. Colaiacovo M. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), but all appear to contribute to the suppression of recombination between non-identical DNA substrates (54Nicholson A. Hendrix M. Jinks-Robertson S. Crouse G.F. Genetics. 2000; 154: 133-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We do not yet know the detailed molecular mechanisms of VSG switching, and therefore one potential explanation for the lack of altered VSG switching in the MSH2 mutants is that the enzyme both promotes the process, by processing 3′ tails, and suppresses it by selecting against insufficiently matched recombining sequences. To address this, we examined the influence of MLH1 on VSG switching. Although MLH1 promotes meiotic recombination in at least some organisms (55Wang T.F. Kleckner N. Hunter N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13914-13919Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 56Lipkin S.M. Moens P.B. Wang V. Lenzi M. Shanmugarajah D. Gilgeous A. Thomas J. Cheng J. Touchman J.W. Green E.D. Schwartzberg P. Collins F.S. Cohen P.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), it appears only to suppress mitotic recombination events, and T. brucei VSG switching occurs in dividing bloodstream stage cells that do not undergo meiosis. MLH1 mutants were created in T. brucei strain 3174, again precisely deleting the open reading frame by two rounds of transformation (with the constructs ΔMLH1::BSD and ΔMLH1::PUR).2 Two independent MLH1+/– and MLH1–/– mutants were confirmed by Southern and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis and, as for MSH2, caused no detectable growth alteration in vitro, and led to the same MMR-associated phenotypes described above. Deletion of MLH1 had no statistically significant effect on the calculated VSG switching frequencies (Fig. 1) and caused no discernible alteration to the profile of VSG switching reactions used to generate switched variants (Fig. 2). This suggests that MMR in general, rather than MSH2 alone, plays little or no role in regulating this process. Mismatch Repair Regulates Homologous Recombination in T. brucei—Although previous work has suggested indirectly that MMR influences recombination of transformed DNA constructs in T. brucei (44Blundell P.A. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the apparent lack of involvement in VSG switching made it important to test this genetically. To do this, we integrated a copy of the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG) into the tubulin array of the T. brucei genome (Fig. 3A), creating a unique sequence for recombination of transformed DNA (see below). Two independent MSH2 mutants were created in the HYG transformant strain, each by two rounds of transformation with the constructs ΔMSH2:: BSD and ΔMSH2::PUR. Southern analysis confirmed that HYG was retained in the +/– and –/– cells lines and that the MSH2 open reading frames had been deleted as expected; in addition, reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated that intact MSH2 transcript was no longer expressed in the –/– cells (data not shown). To assess the impact of MMR on homologous recombination, we created a series of DNA constructs designed to integrate into the HYG marker following transformation of wild type, +/–, and –/– cells (Fig. 3, A and B). All the constructs contained a bleomycin resistance cassette (BLE) to provide selection for recombination into the T. brucei genome. The resistance cassette was flanked upstream and downstream, respectively, by 445 and 449 bp of sequence derived from HYG, providing substrates for homologous recombination. The constructs in the series differed from each other in that the overall sequence identity between the HYG targeting flanks and the genomic HYG marker reduced progressively from 100 to 89% (Fig. 3B). The consequences of increasing sequence divergence for homologous recombination was compared in MSH2wt and mutant cells by assaying the efficiency with which stable transformants arose following transformation of a fixed amount of each linear DNA construct. This is a valid measurement of homologous recombination efficiency because in RAD51wt T. brucei essentially all stable transformants integrate linear DNA by homologous recombination rather than by non-homologous reactions (43Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the formation of extrachromosomal replicons to yield antibiotic resistant T. brucei following the transformation of small, linear constructs has never been described (57Alsford N.S. Navarro M. Jamnadass H.R. Dunbar H. Ackroyd M. Murphy N.B. Gull K. Ersfeld K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results of this analysis are graphed in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of recombination frequenciesTable ISummary of recombination frequencies In the wild type and MSH2+/– (MMR+) cells there was a 2.8-fold decrease in transformation efficiency with construct HYG01 (1% sequence divergence) compared with HYGwt (100% sequence identity), showing that even a small number of mismatches affect homologous recombination. This was true also in the MSH2–/– cells, where a small"

Double substitution mutation of these juxtaposed residues from positive to neutral charged species resulted in complete reversal of transmembrane orientation of pro-SP-C and total abrogation of post-translational processing.

SP-C is synthesized exclusively in alveolar type II cells as a 21-kDa bitopic propeptide (pro-SP-C) with a type II orientation (Ncytosol/Clumen) and a 24° average angle of orientation with respect to the phospholipid bilayer (1Pastrana B.

SP-C represents a unique entity with respect to its biosynthesis and secretion. It undergoes extensive post-translational processing as it is trafficked through the biosynthetic pathway from the Golgi complex via small vesicles and multivesicular bodies to lamellar bodies where the mature form is stored prior to secretion to the alveolar lumen (2Beers M. Rooney S.A. Lung Surfactant: Cellular and Molecular Processing. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1998: 93-124Google Scholar). As with other integral membrane proteins, its proper post-translational processing requires coordinated processes including targeting of the nascent protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, insertion of the transmembrane domains in the correct orientation, proper conformation of tertiary and quaternary structures, and accurate trafficking of the protein to subcellular compartments. To date, SP-C is the only peptide known to be synthesized as an integral membrane protein and secreted via a regulated pathway as a luminal protein (2Beers M. Rooney S.A. Lung Surfactant: Cellular and Molecular Processing. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1998: 93-124Google Scholar). This contrasts with other membrane-associated precursor proteins that remain limiting membrane-bound until their incorporation into the plasma membrane where they are proteolytically cleaved and released (2Beers M. Rooney S.A. Lung Surfactant: Cellular and Molecular Processing. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1998: 93-124Google Scholar, 3Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. Soc.

Diverse human disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, cystic fibrosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and Parkinson disease have been shown to arise from protein misfolding and are now grouped together under the category of conformational diseases (4Carrell R.W.

Recent reports have identified more than 12 mutations in the gene encoding SP-C in association with various interstitial lung diseases (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar III, A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A.

Altered conformation as a result of one of these mutations has been shown to result in aggresome formation (ubiquitin/proteasome-bound perinuclear protein aggregates) and imparts a dominant negative effect on wild type protein processing (6Wang W.J. Mulugeta S. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast to conformational factors, direct experimental evidence of the effects of topology on protein processing is lacking. The specific transmembrane orientation of the protein allows for cytosol- or lumen-specific modification(s) and target signal interactions. The topologic and targeting properties of a protein are primarily directed by specific signal domain(s) bordering hydrophobic transmembrane sequences of the protein (11Ott C.M. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Seidah N.G.

Studies suggest that N-terminal membrane-flanking positively charged residues play an essential role in influencing membrane topology (14Parks G.D. Lamb R.A.

Within the mature portion of pro-SP-C (Phe24–Leu58), a functional signal anchor domain mediates translocation of the nascent polypeptide to the ER, whereas the N-terminal domain contains a signal motif (10MESPPDYSA18) (see Fig. 1) that directs targeting to distal subcellular compartments (18Johnson A.L.

In some models, the N-terminal and mature SP-C domains are sufficient for SP-C secretion (19Conkright J.J. Bridges J.P. Na C.L. Voorhout W.F. Trapnell B. Glasser S.W. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14658-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, mutations producing structural or conformational alterations of the C-terminal domain of pro-SP-C result in abnormal trafficking of the peptide (6Wang W.J. Mulugeta S. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Kabore A.F. Wang W.J. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 35-amino acid sequence located N-terminal relative to the transmembrane domain of both rat and human pro-SP-C contains two adjacent post-translationally palmitoylated cysteine residues (Cys28 and Cys29) (Fig. 1, upper inset) and two contiguous juxtamembrane positively charged residues (Lys34 and Arg35) (Fig. 1, lower inset). Substitution of these residues with uncharged glutamine residues results in significantly reduced palmitoylation (21ten Brinke A. Batenburg J.J. Gadella B.M. Haagsman H.P. Vaandrager A.B. van Golde L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the mutant isoform appeared to be retained in the ER. The study suggested that the lysine and arginine residues influence transport of pro-SP-C to compartments distal to the ER. However, the possibility that the orientation of pro-SP-C is altered by the mutation of lysine and arginine was not examined. We report that the juxtamembrane positively charged lysine and arginine play an essential role in the determination of pro-SP-C transmembrane topology. Alteration of these residues by substitution mutation with neutrally charged residues resulted in profound changes of transmembrane orientation, trafficking, and processing of the protein. Moreover mutations from positive to negative charges of these residues resulted in perinuclear aggregates of the proprotein with ubiquitin co-localization, a characteristic similar to aggresome formation. Epitope-specific Primary Antibodies—Antisera raised against specific domains of rat and human pro-SP-C were described previously (22Solarin K.O. Ballard P.L. Guttentag S.H. Lomax C.A. Beers M.F. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum raised against the Met10–Glu23 domain of rat pro-SP-C recognizes N-terminal flanking peptides of both human and rat pro-SP-Cs. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the rat (Ser149–Ser166) and human (Gly162–Gly174) domains recognize the C-terminal proprotein of rat and human pro-SP-C, respectively. SP-C cDNA Expression—Wild type pro-SP-C expression of human (1–197 amino acids) and rat (1–194 amino acids) in pEGFPC1 and pcDNA3 vectors has been described previously (6Wang W.J. Mulugeta S.

For creation of mutant proteins, single or double substitution mutation was achieved by overlap extension PCR with a two-round, four-primer technique as previously published (24Russo S.J. Wang W. Lomax C.A. Beers M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1034-L1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using wild type pro-SP-C cDNAs as templates. The first round involves the amplification of two overlapping PCR products, products A and B. Product A ranges from the 5′ start site to the lysine- and arginine-encoding region, while product B comprises nucleotides from the lysine- and arginine-encoding region to the 3′ untranslated poly(A) tail. The second round (splicing by overlap extension reaction) joined these two overlapping products together to produce cDNAs encoding mutant SP-C proproteins. A total of 20 primers were used. Six of the oligonucleotides (containing restriction sites for insertion into vectors) used for the 5′ (product A) and 3′ (product B) ends of human and rat pro-SP-C have been described previously (6Wang W.J.

Forward oligonucleotides that were used to generate type B products are as follows, and their complement sequences were used as reverse primers to make type A products: for human: pro-SP-CK34A,R35A, 5′-CCAGTGCACCTGGCTGCTCTTCTTATCGTG-3′; pro-SP-CK34A, 5′-CCAGTGCACCTGGCTCGCCTTCTTATCGTG-3′; pro-SP-CR35A, 5′-CCAGTGCACCTGAAAGCTCTTCTTATCGTG-3′; pro-SP-CK34E,R35E, 5′-CCAGTGCACCTGGAGGAGCTTCTTATCGTG-3′; for rat: pro-SP-CK34A,R35A, 5′-CCCGTGCATCTCGCTGCTCTTCTCATCGTG-3′; pro-SP-CK34A, 5′CCCGTGCATCTCGCTCGCCTTCTCATCGTG-3′; pro-SP-CR35A,5′-CCCGTGCATCTCAAAGCTCTTCTCATCGTG-3′. Transient transfection of lung epithelial A549 cells has been described previously (24Russo S.J. Wang W. Lomax C.A. Beers M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1034-L1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown to 70% confluence on glass coverslips in 35-mm plastic dishes were transiently transfected with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)·pro-SP-C constructs (10 μg/dish) by CaPO4 precipitation. The medium was replaced at 24 h. Cells were maintained for up to 48 h after introduction of plasmid DNA. Immunocytochemistry—Co-localization studies were performed by immunostaining plated cells that were fixed by immersion of coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following permeabilization, cells were immunolabeled with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature at the following dilutions: anti-calnexin (Stressgene, Victoria, Canada), 1:200; anti-CD63 (Immunotech, Marseilles, France), 1:100; anti-ubiquitin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), 1:100. Texas Red-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal or secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:200 dilution were used for visualization. Fluorescence images of air-dried and Mowiol-mounted slides were viewed on an Olympus I-70 inverted fluorescent microscope. Fluorescence and phase images were captured using a Hamanatsu 12-bit coupled-charged device camera. Image processing and overlay analysis were performed using IMAGE 1 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Isolation of Integral Membrane Proteins: Carbonate Method—Integral membrane proteins were separated from peripherally associated membrane proteins as described previously (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) with modifications. Pellets collected by scraping cells from 35-mm dishes and centrifuged at 300 × g were resuspended with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated on ice three times with 20-s bursts at 50 watts. The sonicate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 s to remove nuclei. The nuclei-free suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g to separate cytosolic (supernatant) from integral/peripheral membrane (pellet) proteins. Following removal of the supernatant the pellet was resuspended with 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, incubated at 0 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g to separate the integral (pellet) from the peripherally associated membrane proteins. Samples were prepared for immunoblotting by resuspending pellets in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors or by precipitating supernatants with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice, pelleting by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 × g, washing twice with acetone, drying with N2, and dissolving in lysis buffer. Immunoblotting—Samples in lysis buffer were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was done using successive incubations with primary polyclonal GFP antiserum (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:5000) for 1 h and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence images were produced either by exposure to film or by direct acquisition using the Kodak 440 Imaging System. Membrane Orientation Analysis—In vitro transcription/translation of wild type and mutant pro-SP-C were done using the TnT coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). These reactions were performed in the presence of a [35S]cysteine/methionine translabel (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions at 30 °C for 1 h in the absence or presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega). Determination of membrane orientation of translated products in microsome vesicles was performed at least three times using each of two different techniques. Protease Protection Assay—Protection of membrane protein by microsomes from proteinase K digestion was performed after in vitro translation of pro-SP-C (in pcDNA3 plasmid) in the presence of microsomes. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml followed by incubation at 0 °C for 60 min as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 4 mm to stop the digestion. For subsequent immunoprecipitation, sample volume was adjusted to 500 μl using ice-cold lysis buffer followed by the addition of 10 μl of primary antibody and incubation overnight at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation. 50 μl of magnetic protein A-microbeads (Multenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) were added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation to magnetically label the immune complex. The mixtures were loaded onto microcolumns of the μMACS magnetic separator and washed four times with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer. Finally samples were eluted with 50 μl of preheated 95 °C SDS loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for autoradiography. Autoradiography was performed using both x-ray films and a PhosphorImager using Quantity One computer software (Bio-Rad). Epitope-specific Pull-down Assay—Immunobinding of microsome-inserted proteins to evaluate orientation was performed after in vitro translation of pro-SP-C in the presence of microsomes. Following translation, sample volumes were adjusted to 500 μl with ice-cold PBS followed by the addition of 10 μl of primary antibody and incubation of the samples overnight at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation. To separate microsome vesicles from the lysate (containing non-inserted protein· antibody complexes and unbound antibodies), samples were loaded on a cushion of 1 ml of dibutylphthalate (Sigma) on top of 1.5 ml of 0.50 m sucrose and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g using a swinging bucket rotor. Isolated microsomes recovered from the pellet were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer, and antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with 50 μl of magnetic protein A-microbeads for 3 h at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation. The mixtures were loaded into microcolumns on the μMACS magnetic separator, washed, prepared for electrophoresis, and autoradiographically processed as described above. Control analyses consisted of in vitro translation of pro-SP-C in the absence of microsomes utilizing lysis buffer instead of PBS during the primary antibody binding procedure and omitting the centrifugation step. To define the mechanism underlying the influence of juxtamembrane residues on SP-C biosynthesis, human and rat pro-SP-C cDNA clones were systematically altered by site-directed mutagenesis with juxtamembrane positively charged lysine (Lys34) and/or arginine (Arg35) residues substituted with either neutrally charged alanine (Ala) or negatively charged glutamate (Glu) residues to yield pro-SP-CK34A,R35A, pro-SP-CK34A, pro-SP-CR35A, or pro-SP-CK34E,R35E mutant constructs. The clones were inserted into either a pcDNA3 vector to evaluate topological orientation using an in vitro system or fused with an EGFP expression vector to characterize biosynthesis (trafficking, subcellular compartmentalization, and processing) in an alveolar epithelial cell line (A549 cells). Experiments were conducted in parallel with both human and rat mutant isoforms unless otherwise indicated. All data obtained with the human isoforms were identical to those of the rat; therefore, only data using human SP-C are shown. Differential Trafficking of Wild Type and Mutant Proteins— Transient transfection of EGFP plasmid alone (control) in A549 cells showed a diffuse fluorescence distribution throughout the cell indicative of non-targeted protein expression (Fig. 2a). Wild type EGFP·SP-C was sorted to punctate ring-like cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 2b), which has been shown previously to be a characteristic of successful membrane protein trafficking to late secretory compartments (6Wang W.J. Mulugeta S. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Wild type EGFP·SP-C also co-localized with CD63 (data not shown), a marker antigen associated with lamellar bodies and multivesicular bodies of alveolar type II cells. In contrast, the double mutant form where neutral amino acids were substituted for basic residues (pro-SP-CK34A,R35A) displayed a reticular expression pattern (Fig. 2c) consistent with ER localization. Calnexin, an ER-specific marker, strongly co-localized with the EGFP-tagged mutant isoform confirming that pro-SP-CK34A,R35A was retained in the ER (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3EGFP·pro-SP-CK34A,R35A mutant proteins are retained in the ER and are not post-translationally processed.A, fluorescence images of A549 cells transfected with EGFP·pro-SP-CK34A,R35A (left), immunostained with calnexin (middle), and merged picture (right) showing co-localization of the mutant form of SP-C and calnexin. B, anti-GFP immunoblots of membrane fractions from A549 cells transfected with EGFP alone (lanes 1–4), EGFP·pro-SP-CWT (lanes 5–8), and EGFP·pro-SP-CK34A,R35A (lanes 9–12). Blots of whole cell lysate (lanes 1, 5, and 9), postcentrifuge supernatant before (lanes 2, 6, and 10) and after (lanes 3, 7, and 11) sodium carbonate treatment of initial pellet, and postcentrifuge pellet (lanes 4, 8, and 12) products are shown. The primary product of EGFP protein alone migrates to 27 kDa, while primary products of pro-SP-CWT and mutant EGFP fusion proteins migrate to 48 kDa. Processed (lower doublet) and palmitoylated (upper band of top doublet) pro-SP-CWT products (lanes 5 and 8) are apparent. Plasmid and/or constructs used for each transfection are shown at the top of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When only one of the two positively charged juxtamembrane residues was mutated to alanine, a mixed pattern of expression was observed. As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of EGFP·pro-SP-CK34A resulted in the retention of some mutant protein in the calnexin-positive ER compartment (left panel) with another fraction accumulating in CD63-positive cytoplasmic vesicles (right panel) comparable to the wild type isoform (6Wang W.J. Mulugeta S. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using an EGFP·pro-SP-CR35A plasmid (data not shown). In contrast to the above findings, when both residues were substituted to negatively charged glutamate (EGFP·pro-SP-CK34E,R35E), expression resulted in formation of perinuclear-restricted, ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies (Fig. 4B). This result is consistent with recent reports of the characteristics of proteins directed to ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathways and aggresome formation (6Wang W.J. Mulugeta S. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Kabore A.F. Wang W.J. Russo S.J. Beers M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proprotein Mutation Results in the Abrogation of Post-translational Processing—Immunoblotting of the membrane fractions of transfected cells with anti-GFP revealed processing of wild type SP-C as shown by bands (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 8) corresponding to the predicted Mr of the primary translation product of the fusion protein (48,000), palmitoylated product (upper band of top doublet), and smaller intermediate cleaved products as previously reported (28ten Brinke A.

Ridder A.N. van Golde L.M. Batenburg J.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 663-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, EGFP·pro-SP-CK34A,R35A was not processed to either cleaved intermediates or palmitoylated product as demonstrated by the single band at Mr of 48,000 (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 12). In membrane association assays, no translation product was detected in a post-100,000 × g centrifuged cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 10). In addition, Na2CO3 treatment of the membrane fraction did not release any peripherally associated products (Fig. 3B, lane 11) indicating that EGFP·pro-SP-CK34A,R35A remains an integral membrane protein and that lysine and arginine residues do not function as stop transfer signals that participate in the anchoring of pro-SP-C to the ER membrane. Effect of Juxtamembrane Amino Acid Residues on Transmembrane Protein Topology—The role of juxtamembrane amino acid residues in determining transmembrane topology was examined using an in vitro protease protection assay. After in vitro transcription/translation of wild type or mutant [35S]cysteine/methionine-translabeled SP-C proproteins in the presence or absence of microsomes (to allow for insertion of the proprotein into microsomal membranes), samples were tested for resistance to proteolytic cleavage with proteinase K. Immunoprecipitation of samples with an antibody recognizing the pro-SP-C C terminus (C-term) revealed that a portion of wild type pro-SP-C (pro-SP-CWT) was protected from proteolysis inside the microsome vesicle producing a band at the predicted size of 17 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 5, arrow). This result indicates that proper membrane insertion of pro-SP-CWT is not altered by the in vitro transcription/translation method. In contrast, the 17-kDa portion of pro-SP-CK34A,R35A was not protected by the microsomes as observed by the absence of an identifiable band in the N-terminal (NPro) (Fig. 5, lane 9) or C-term (Fig. 5, lane 11) antibody-precipitated products. If topology for the mutant protein had been reversed, the predicted protected size would be 6.2 kDa recognized by NPro. This was below the resolvable power of electrophoresis due to the relatively la"
https://openalex.org/W1989042174,"Two types of polyclonal antibodies were generated from (a) a decapeptide sequence that includes the active site serine of acetylcholinesterase (anti-AChE10S) and (b) the identical decapeptide sequence phosphorylated at the active site serine of acetylcholinesterase (anti-AChE10SP). The anti-AChE10S antiserum was found to specifically recognize native, control, and vehicle-treated recombinant mouse AChE (rMoAChE) but did not recognize rMoAChE that was phosphorylated by the four organophosphate (OP) compounds tested. Conversely the anti-AChE10SP antiserum recognized phosphoserine rMoAChE that resulted from reaction with phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3) but did not recognize native or vehicle-treated rMoAChE. Anti-AChE10SP also did not recognize OP-AChE conjugates that resulted from the reaction of rMoAChE with other OP compounds that afford neutral or monoanionic phosphoserine groups thereby indicating a high specificity for a precise OP conjugate. Antisera recognition correlated well with the rates of enzyme inhibition, aging, and oxime-induced reactivation indicating these antisera can both quantify the extent and type of inhibition and also differentiate between select mechanisms of inhibition. The ability to discern mechanistic differences between native AChE and OP-AChE conjugates suggests that these antisera can be used to identify biomarkers of OP exposure in a mechanism-based approach.

Organophosphate esters 1 (OPs) 1The abbreviations used are: OP, organophosphate; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; mAChE, mouse acetylcholinesterase; 2-PAM, pralidoxime; rMoAChE, recombinant mouse acetylcholinesterase; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate. are a diverse class of compounds (Fig. 1 and Table I) with the most well known applications as insecticides (e.g. malathion and parathion), as protease inhibitors (e.g. diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)), in glaucoma treatment (e.g. echothiophate), and as chemical warfare agents (e.g. sarin and VX). The acute toxic effects of OP compounds correlate well with their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by reaction with an essential serine hydroxyl to form a relatively stable phosphoserine ester bond or an OP-AChE conjugate (Fig. 1 and Table I, 2) (1Quinn D. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-979Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 2Jarv J. Bioorg. Chem. 1984; 12: 259-278Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). AChE inactivation results in an accumulation of acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses and, depending on the OP structure and persistence of the OP-AChE conjugate, excessive stimulation of acetylcholine receptors. Excess acetylcholine leads to hyperstimulation of skeletal muscle endplates, smooth muscle, and secretory glands as well as altered central nervous system and cardiac activity, which can result in cardiovascular and respiratory compromise and, in extreme cases, death (3Reigart J.R. Roberts J.R. Recognition and Management of Pesticide Poisonings, Publication No. 735-R-98–003. United States Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D. C.1999Google Scholar).Table IOP structures, OP-AChE conjugates, and aged OP-AChE conjutatesOP (1)XYZOP-AChE (2)Aged OP-AChE (3, X = O-)POCl3ClClClX = Cl(O-)Y = O-Y = ClSarinOiPrMeFX = OiPrY = MeY = MeIsomalathionS-CH-CH2Et|CH2CO2EtOMeSMeX=S-CH-CH2Et|CH2CO2EtY = OMeY = OMeParaoxonOEtOEtOPhNO2X = OEtY = OEtY = OEtDFPOiPrOiPrFX = OiPrY = OiPrY = OiPr Open table in a new tab The biochemical mechanism of OP inactivation of AChE is a widely accepted process and initiated by precursory phosphorylation at the catalytic serine residue (Fig. 1) (4Fukuto T.R. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 87: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of AChE by an OP is synchronous with the ejection of a leaving group (Z) to yield a stable, covalent phosphoserine ester bond (Fig. 1 and Table I, 2). The phosphorylated AChE can usually undergo two possible postinhibition fates: (a) reactivation, which is cleavage of the phosphoester-serine bond either spontaneously (water) or mediated by oxime antidotes or (b) “aging,” in which a phosphoester bond other than the phosphoserine is cleaved to produce a phosphate oxyanion (Fig. 1 and Table I, 3). An “aged” OP-AChE conjugate is considered irreversible inhibition and typically unable to regain enzymic activity. The inhibition and postinhibition rates and mechanisms are dependent on the structure and reactivity of the phosphorus ester ligands (4Fukuto T.R. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 87: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 5Wilson B.W. Hooper M.J. Hansen M.E. Nieberg P.S. Chambers J.E. Levi P.E. Organophosphates: Chemistry, Fate, and Effects. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 107-137Google Scholar). For example, OP-AChE conjugates that contain branched dimethyl esters generally reactivate readily, whereas OP-AChE conjugates that contain larger or branched alkyl groups (e.g. isopropyl, isobutyl, etc.) are more prone to undergo an aging mechanism. Overall OP compounds react with AChE to afford structurally precise phosphoserine esters suggesting that these products can serve as selective indicators of mechanism and possibly a direct correlation with the original OP structure. Human exposure to OPs is assessed clinically by measuring the depression in serum or erythrocyte cholinesterase activity utilizing a colorimetric assay (6Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21510) Google Scholar). The colorimetric assay is considered rapid and capable of high throughput analysis, however, several limitations to this method exist: (a) control levels of cholinesterase activity must be obtained prior to analysis of OP exposure, (b) cholinesterase activity and exposure level are not directly correlated, and most importantly (c) this assay does not identify the structure of the OP-AChE conjugates. As indicated, different OP structures can form distinct OP-AChE conjugates that can yield different toxic outcomes, and therefore the need to determine the structure of the OP-AChE conjugate is essential to understand the reactivation and/or aging profile for a given OP (3Reigart J.R. Roberts J.R. Recognition and Management of Pesticide Poisonings, Publication No. 735-R-98–003. United States Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D. C.1999Google Scholar, 7Wilson B.W.

In this study, we sought to utilize the exquisite selectivity of antibody-antigen interactions to differentiate between AChE and AChE modified by reactive phosphorus compounds. These mechanism-based antibodies can then serve as probes of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process and possible indicators of enzyme reaction rate. And since the resultant OP conjugate typically correlates directly with the OP structure, an antibody-based analysis could improve upon the current, end point-based colorimetric method. To test the hypothesis that OP-AChE conjugates can be distinguished from native, uninhibited AChE, polyclonal antiserum (anti-AChE10S) was raised against a linear decapeptide corresponding to the native mouse and human AChE sequence (Fig. 1, 4a) that includes the catalytic serine residue. To represent OP-modified AChE and to serve as an antigen distinct from native protein, a phosphoserine (Ser-OPO32-) decapeptide (Fig. 1, 4b) was used to generate a second polyclonal antiserum (anti-AChE10SP). The selection of decapeptide serine phosphate as an antigen is consistent with the proposed inhibition of AChE by phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) (10Quistad G.B. Zhang N. Sparks S.E. Casida J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The initial OP-AChE conjugate resulting from reaction of POCl3 with AChE is a chlorophosphoryl oxyanion (Fig. 1 and Table I, 2: X = Cl, Y = O–) leading to a putative phosphate group (Fig. 1 and Table I, 3: Y = O–). Anti-AChE10SP was hypothesized to better react with aged AChE than did anti-AChE10S, and overall, the two antisera should differentiate between native, inhibited, and aged AChE. A critical aspect of biomolecular recognition of the catalytic serine of AChE is its location in the protein. The catalytic serine is located at the base of a deep 18-Å gorge within the protein (11Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) and is largely inaccessible to many traditional forms of analysis unless the protein is denatured. The experiments described here involve reacting the intact, catalytically active enzyme with OP, measuring the activity of the enzyme, and then denaturing the enzyme to expose the active site to antibodies. This approach permits the study of an “inaccessible” catalytic peptide sequence as well as the corresponding covalent phosphorylation by OP that will enable the determination of mechanism and reaction progress. Reagents—Recombinant mouse AChE (rMoAChE) was purified as described previously (12Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electric eel AChE (Type V-S) and horse butyrylcholinesterase were used as purchased (Sigma). Anti-mAChE antiserum is an affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum raised against monomeric rMoAChE enzyme. POCl3 and DFP were purchased from Aldrich, and paraoxon was purchased from Chem Service Inc. (West Chester, PA). The S,S-stereoisomer of isomalathion was synthesized as described previously (13Berkman C.E. Quinn D.A. Thompson C.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reagents for immunoaffinity purification were purchased from Bio-Rad. Polyclonal Antisera Generation and Purification—Anti-AChE10S and anti-AChE10SP antisera were generated by conjugating peptides AChE10S 4a and AChE10SP 4b (Fig. 1) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbits were immunized using standard procedures (SynPep Corp., Dublin, CA). Antisera were equilibrated into TSSA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3) with Econopac 10DG columns. Contaminants were removed by chromatography over a DEAE Affi-Gel Blue column. Peptides 4a and 4b were conjugated to Affi-Gel 15 beads in anhydrous isopropanol for 72 h at 4 °C. Antisera were purified over the peptide-conjugated column by eluting less specific antisera with 1 m NaSCN. Peptide-specific antisera were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 1.8) and immediately buffered to pH 8.0. All eluted fractions were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for recognition of keyhole limpet hemocyanin, AChE10S, and AChE10SP to ensure high specific recognition (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 471-510Google Scholar). Reaction of Organophosphates with rMoAChE—rMoAChE was diluted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) (final concentration, 110 nm) prior to OP addition. OP compounds were diluted in appropriate vehicle, and either vehicle or OP were added. Final concentrations of OP and their respective vehicles used in experiments were as follows: DFP (136 μm in isopropanol), POCl3 (3 mm in tetrahydrofuran), isomalathion (526 μm in ethanol), and paraoxon (750 μm in acetone). All vehicles were added to <5% final volume and had no significant effect on rMoAChE activity or reactivity with anti-mAChE antiserum (data not shown). Western Immunoblot Assays—Western immunoblot assays were performed as described (15George K.M. Montgomery M.A. Sandoval L.E. Thompson C.M. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 126: 99-105Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20). Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer. Densitometric measurements were performed using a Bio-Rad GS800 densitometer and Quantity One software. AChE Activity Assays—rMoAChE activity was measured colorimetrically as described previously (6Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21510) Google Scholar, 15George K.M. Montgomery M.A. Sandoval L.E. Thompson C.M. Toxicol.

Kinetic activity assays were performed by incubation of AChE samples with 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (final concentration, 0.32 mm) and initiated with acetylthiocholine iodide (final concentration, 0.75 mm). Changes in absorbance were measured at A 412 nm in 10-s intervals over a 3-min period using a Softmax Pro microplate reader. Competition Experiment with DFP and POCl3 to Test Specificity of Anti-AChE10SP—rMoAChE was treated with DFP or POCl3 at final concentrations of 500 μm and 2.7 mm, respectively, and allowed to incubate for 5 days at 4 °C when AChE activity was measured. Aliquots of samples were treated with pralidoxime (2-PAM) (final concentration, 1.4 mm) for 15 min to reactivate any available rMoAChE and to determine the percentage of aging. Aliquots of POCl3-treated and DFP-treated rMoAChE were subjected to a second exposure of the other OP or vehicle overnight at 4 °C. These samples were analyzed in duplicate by immunoblot and probed with anti-AChE10SP. Reactivation Assays—rMoAChE was inhibited with 5 μm paraoxon for 12 min, and the AChE activity was measured. Inhibited rMoAChE was aliquoted into different final concentrations of 2-PAM, and the percent reactivation was measured (in triplicate) for various time points (17Worek F. Diepold C. Eyer P. Arch. Toxicol. 1999; 73: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Thompson C.M. Ryu S. Berkman C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10710-10715Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Immediately after reactivation was measured, the reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli SDS-PAGE dye, and the samples were boiled. Immunoblots were performed in quadruplicate, bands were quantitated on a densitometer, and the data points shown represent the average of quadruplicate immunoblots with standard deviations. After detection with anti-AChE10S, the membrane was stripped with 10 mm glycine-HCl (pH 3) and reprobed with anti-mAChE antiserum to confirm that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded. Control samples were treated with acetone (vehicle for paraoxon) followed by 2-PAM at the highest concentration. Percent reactivation was measured as 100 – ((EC – S)/(EC – EI) × 100), where EC is the control enzyme (no OP), EI is the inhibited enzyme (fully inhibited, no 2-PAM added), and S is the sample being measured. Statistics—t test (paired) analyses were performed on data in Fig. 4 using Microsoft Excel software. Regression parameters, including the slope, 95% confidence interval, and correlation coefficient (R 2) were determined for Fig. 5 using SigmaPlot Version 4.01 software.Fig. 5Linear regression analysis correlating rMoAChE reactivation with anti-AChE10S recognition.

The decapeptide used as the antigen to generate anti-AChE10S is 100% homologous with rMoAChE and horse butyrylcholinesterase (Fig. 1, 4a) and differs from electric eel AChE by one amino acid (Leu → Ile). Anti-AChE10S recognized rMoAChE, electric eel AChE, and horse butyrylcholinesterase (Fig. 2A), and the molecular mass of the band in the rMoAChE sample was ∼60 kDa, which corresponds with the correct molecular mass due to truncation at the carboxyl terminus of the cDNA at amino acid 548 (12Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Anti-AChE10S detected two bands in the electric eel AChE sample. One band at ∼65 kDa corresponds to the correct mass for intact protein (19Simon S. Massoulie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33045-33055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, the major band recognized by anti-AChE10S migrates at ∼43 kDa. This has been observed by our laboratory in other antibody analyses of eel AChE (15George K.M. Montgomery M.A. Sandoval L.E. Thompson C.M. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 126: 99-105Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and presumably corresponds to partially degraded enzyme. The band detected in the horse butyrylcholinesterase samples migrates at ∼65 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted size (20Wierdl M. Morton C.L. Danks M.K. Potter P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anti-AChE10S Antiserum Recognition of Native, Uninhibited rMoAChE and Anti-AChE10SP Recognition of POCl3-treated rMoAChE—To characterize the specificity of the antisera, rMoAChE was first treated with POCl3 to reduce the AChE activity to less than 5% of control activity (Table II). The inhibited rMoAChE samples were then analyzed by immunoblot. Anti-AChE10S clearly recognized native and vehicle-treated rMoAChE but only weakly recognized the inactive, POCl3-treated rMoAChE (Fig. 2B, top panel), the latter recognition likely due to partially reversible or incomplete interaction of POCl3 with rMoAChE. This result demonstrated that anti-AChE10S recognized the native active site and that phosphorylation of the active site serine is sufficient to disrupt anti-AChE10S recognition. Anti-AChE10SP recognized only POCl3-treated rMoAChE (Fig. 2B, bottom panel), which indicates that the phosphorylation of serine is required for anti-AChE10SP recognition.Table IIMeasurement of AChE activityTreatmentAChE activity (percentage of control)%Paraoxon<1S,S-Isomalathion2.45DFP<1POCl31.37 Open table in a new tab Anti-AChE10SP Recognition Is Specific for POCl3-treated rMoAChE—To further characterize the specificity of anti-AChE10SP, OP-AChE conjugates were generated from the reaction of rMoAChE with three additional OP compounds, and the recognition was tested. rMoAChE was reacted with isomalathion, paraoxon, or DFP, and rMoAChE activity was determined to be less than 5% of control (Table II). Inhibited rMoAChE samples were analyzed for antibody recognition by immunoblot analysis. Anti-AChE10S again recognized the vehicle-treated rMoAChE but did not recognize any of the OP-AChE conjugate samples (Fig. 2C, top panel), although it slightly recognized rMoAChE treated with POCl3 (as indicated previously). These results demonstrate that regardless of the OP ester ligands, the covalently OP-modified active sites of rMoAChE disrupted anti-AChE10S recognition. Anti-AChE10SP recognized the rMoAChE treated with POCl3 (Fig. 2C, middle panel) but not native rMoAChE or rMoAChE inhibited by the other OPs. As a positive control to determine the relative protein amount and integrity, immunoblots were probed with a polyclonal anti-mAChE antiserum (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). The anti-mAChE antiserum showed equivalent recognition of all samples and also supports the conclusion that OP treatment did not affect the integrity of the enzyme. Anti-AChE10SP Recognition Is Specific for the Phosphorylated (Dianionic) Active Site of rMoAChE—Because POCl3 can act as a non-selective phosphorylating agent and potentially react with AChE at multiple residues (21Frank A.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 51-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the possibility existed that anti-AChE10SP recognized phosphorylated residues other than the catalytic serine. To address this, a competition experiment was conducted in which rMoAChE was reacted first with DFP, which phosphorylates only the catalytic serine (22Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Ariel N. Segall Y. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11953-11962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Segall Y. Waysbort D. Barak D. Ariel N. Doctor B.P. Grunwald J. Ashani Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13441-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Next POCl3 was added to the DFP-inhibited rMoAChE to phosphorylate any other reactive residues. If anti-AChE10SP is capable of recognizing phosphoserine residues other than the active site, recognition of this sample preparation should occur. Conversely rMoAChE was reacted stepwise with POCl3 and then DFP to form the expected phosphoserine group at the active site. For DFP to fully protect the active site serine from POCl3, it was necessary to allow the diisopropyl phosphorylated rMoAChE, the DFP-AChE conjugate, to age (4Fukuto T.R. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 87: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 5Wilson B.W. Hooper M.J. Hansen M.E. Nieberg P.S. Chambers J.E. Levi P.E. Organophosphates: Chemistry, Fate, and Effects. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 107-137Google Scholar). Therefore, the length of time of the pretreatment was increased to allow a maximum amount of DFP-AChE conjugates to age as determined colorimetrically. After the initial exposure, DFP and POCl3 inhibited rMoAChE activity to less than 5% of either control (data not shown). After reactivation of the remaining DFP-AChE population with 2-PAM, the DFP-treated rMoAChE reactivated slightly (<5%), and the POCl3-treated rMoAChE did not reactivate, indicating maximum aging (data not shown). Immunoblots of these pairwise competition experiments showed that anti-AChE10SP recognized both rMoAChE treated with POCl3 followed by vehicle and rMoAChE treated with POCl3 followed by DFP (Fig. 3). However, anti-AChE10SP did not recognize rMoAChE treated with DFP followed by vehicle or, more importantly, rMoAChE treated with DFP followed by POCl3 (Fig. 3). This result supports our hypothesis that anti-AChE10SP is specific for the phosphoserine (3, Y = O–) in the active site and not a random phosphoserine or other phosphorylated group resulting from reaction with POCl3. Anti-AChE10S Recognition of Oxime-reactivated rMoAChE— When possible, OP-AChE conjugates can reactivate, a process resulting in restored AChE activity. Reactivation occurs via scission of the phosphoserine ester bond either spontaneously or promoted chemically and kinetically with oxime antidotes (e.g. 2-PAM). Since anti-AChE10S antibody specifically recognizes uninhibited rMoAChE and not OP-modified rMoAChE, it was of interest to determine whether reactivated enzymatic activity could be correlated with anti-AChE10S recognition. To study the reactivation of OP-AChE conjugates, rMoAChE was treated with paraoxon, and the inhibition-reactivation processes were monitored versus time using the anti-AChE10S antibody. Paraoxon was used for this experiment instead of POCl3 because the reactivation of paraoxon-inhibited AChE is known and the postinhibitory rate of aging for paraoxon-inhibited AChE is slow (t ½ = 24 h) compared with POCl3 (t ½ = 2.5 min) (5Wilson B.W. Hooper M.J. Hansen M.E. Nieberg P.S. Chambers J.E. Levi P.E. Organophosphates: Chemistry, Fate, and Effects. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 107-137Google Scholar, 10Quistad G.B. Zhang N. Sparks S.E. Casida J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Carr R.L. Chambers J.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 139: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To achieve the maximum reactivation of the paraoxon-AChE conjugate and test the specificity of anti-AChE10S, rMoAChE was inhibited to less than 5% of the original activity with paraoxon (as described previously) and treated with increasing concentrations (100–400 μm) of 2-PAM versus time. The addition of 2-PAM at 100 μm showed only a slight effect on reactivating paraoxon-inhibited AChE, whereas the addition of 2-PAM at 200–400 μm concentrations afforded proportionally greater percent reactivation to a maximum of 70% of the original activity. The time course of the paraoxon-AChE conjugate reactivation shows a large initial reactivation within 10 min that accounts for about 75% of the reactivation and another modest increase after 70 min (Fig. 4). The return of over 70% of the original activity at 90 min shows that a significant population of uninhibited rMoAChE can be regenerated following near complete inhibition of the enzyme. Although the addition of 100 μm 2-PAM did not restore much reactivity, the possibility exists that 2-PAM removed the OP group from the OP-AChE conjugate but did not return the enzyme to its native active form due to denaturation or other consequence of the experiment. Therefore, in these experiments a small percentage of rMoAChE may be inactive yet contain the native sequence that is recognized by anti-AChE10S. To test the hypothesis that anti-AChE10S is capable of quantifying total populations of active and reactivated AChE enzyme, rMoAChE was inhibited by paraoxon, and the reactivation process was monitored at 15 and 90 min kinetically via the colorimetric assay and probed mechanistically via recognition with anti-AChE10S. After inhibition with paraoxon, samples were reactivated with 2-PAM (100–300 μm) for 15 min and simultaneously measured for AChE activity and recognition by anti-AChE10S. The relative band density as recognized by anti-AChE10S was plotted against the percent reactivation and, as evaluated by linear regression, showed an excellent correlation (R 2 = 0.902) with slope = 2.12. (Fig. 5A). The paraoxon-inhibited rMoAChE samples reactivated to 8–24% of control activity when treated with 2-PAM, but without 2-PAM no reactivation occurred. Recognition by anti-AChE10S of these same samples increased from near zero for inhibited rMoAChE (no 2-PAM treatment) to 21–52% of control when treated with 2-PAM. Analysis of the samples with anti-mAChE was conducted to ensure equal sample loading (Fig. 5A). The correlation between the colorimetric assay and anti-AChE10S was next examined after a 90-min reactivation period anticipating an increase in percent reactivation and a corresponding correlation with anti-AChE10S recognition. rMoAChE was inhibited with paraoxon and treated with 2-PAM (100–350 μm), and the reactivation was allowed to proceed for 90 min whereupon the percent reactivation increased to 56–103% of control. Recognition by anti-AChE10S also increased to 49–158% of control (Fig. 5B). Similar to the 15-min reactivation data, a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.819) with slope = 2.10 was found linking the kinetic data and anti-AChE10S recognition. In this report, we describe the rationale for and characterization of two polyclonal antisera raised against native and phosphate-modified active sites of AChE. As presented previously, OPs can vary in chemical composition leading to a panel of possible OP-inhibited AChE structures. Moreover each individual OP compound can lead to more than one OP-AChE conjugate structure by virtue of aging or other postinhibitory processes. On this basis, a number of possible OP-AChE structures are possible, yet little work has been done to develop methods or tools capable of measuring or differentiating between native AChE and the OP-AChE conjugate structures. Critical questions in this study were whether or not antibodies could be generated against a catalytic active site sequence of an enzyme, whether these antibodies would differentiate between native and modified enzyme, and finally would analysis on a denaturing gel allow for investigation of active site modifications that are buried deep within a protein structure. In sum, the development of these mechanism-based antibodies was envisioned to help identify OP-AChE conjugate structures, differentiate OP-AChE conjugates, and monitor reaction (inhibition/reactivation) progress. Antibodies raised against native and OP-inhibited AChE have been used to probe biochemical properties of AChE including (a) the three-dimensional structure of AChE (25Ogert R.A. Gentry M.K.

Neurochem. 1990; 55: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), (b) allosteric influences over catalytic activity (26Gentry M.K. Saxena A. Ashani Y. Doctor B.P. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1993; 87: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 27Gentry M.K. Moorad D.R. Hur R.S. Saxena A. Ashani Y. Doctor B.P. J.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2456-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and (c) structural characteristics between isoforms of AChE (29Wasserman L. Doctor B.P. Gentry M.K. Taylor P. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2124-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 30Chatel J.M. Grassi J. Frobert Y. Massoulie J. Vallette F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In one of these studies, antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the active site sequence of Torpedo californica AChE for the purpose of determining whether the active site was present on external or internal domains of the enzyme (25Ogert R.A. Gentry M.K. Richardson E.C. Deal C.D. Abramson S.N. Alving C.R. Taylor P. Doctor B.P. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anti-AChE10S antiserum was found to differentiate between native, uninhibited rMoAChE and rMoAChE that had been reacted with several types of OP compounds. The only “nonspecific” interaction noted was in the modest recognition of POCl3-treated rMoAChE by anti-AChE10S. Among the many reasons for this nonspecific interaction, one possibility is that the phosphate group may have been ejected, thereby reactivating the AChE and allowing recognition by anti-AChE10S. Alternatively the phosphoserine group could have been eliminated to form a dehydroalanine, which may allow recognition by anti-AChE10S. In support of the latter outcome, anti-AChE10S recognition of peptide 4a was compared with a decapeptide that has the identical sequence of 4a except that it contains an alanine substitution for the serine residue (4aS/A ). By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, anti-AChE10S was capable of significant recognition of 4aS/A , albeit less than the recognition of 4a (data not shown). This indicates that anti-AChE10S may be capable of recognizing AChE with a dehydroalanine in the active site. Anti-AChE10S is also capable of recognizing rMoAChE that has been previously inhibited and reactivated with an oxime. Importantly the restoration of enzyme function and anti-AChE10S recognition of the reactivated enzyme correlated very well. The slopes of both linear regression plots (Fig. 4) are greater than 1, suggesting that the antibody-based analysis better evaluates the molecular state of the active site than the colorimetric activity assays measure. This may be due to the fact that although scission of the phosphoryl group from the active site serine (reactivation) affords the correct epitope for antibody recognition, removal of the phosphoryl group may not necessarily restore the enzyme activity due to protein denaturation or other disruptive pathway. These results demonstrate that a strong correlation can be achieved between AChE activity and antibody recognition and also that antibodies generated to modified active site sequences can complement colorimetric enzyme assays in understanding the nature and extent of the inhibition process. Although the colorimetric assay used to evaluate OP exposure provides rapid and reliable data on cholinesterase activity, it fails to identify the structure of the insulting OP agent. Further the colorimetric assay is not routinely used to ascertain the reactivation potential of the enzyme-OP complex although it can be used to evaluate reactivation rate. The reactivation of OP-AChE conjugates (Fig. 1) is significant because this time-dependent process varies greatly with both OP structure and stereochemistry (5Wilson B.W. Hooper M.J. Hansen M.E. Nieberg P.S. Chambers J.E. Levi P.E. Organophosphates: Chemistry, Fate, and Effects. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 107-137Google Scholar, 31Berkman C.E. Ryu S. Quinn D.A. Thompson C.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antibody assays that can discriminate between populations of native, inhibited, or reactivated AChE molecules have the potential to provide more specific mechanistic evidence that the reactivation event occurred in part or in full. Further the ability of the antisera to recognize AChE that had previously been inhibited provides structural information of the reactivated enzyme active site. The anti-AChE10SP antiserum specifically recognized rMoAChE that had been inhibited to yield a dianion phosphoserine in the active site but not rMoAChE that had been inhibited with other OP compounds including those that age to afford monoionic phosphoryl groups (DFP and isomalathion). This result originally surprised us because we had hypothesized that anti-AChE10SP would recognize rMoAChE containing any phosphate ion group at the catalytic serine even though the antibody was generated against the phosphate dianion. We hypothesize that the differences in charge on the phosphate and/or presence of an alkyl ester group may negate anti-AChE10SP recognition. Based on this result, it is anticipated that antibodies can be raised to specifically recognize individual OP-AChE conjugates based on the precise chemical modification imposed by a specific reactive OP compound (Table I). The anti-AChE10S and anti-AChE10SP antibodies generated for this study aided the measurement of active and inactive (covalent modification by OPs) rMoAChE. Moreover these antibodies were helpful in identifying the structure of the OP group attached to the active site serine of rMoAChE. This level of structural analysis and mechanistic detail is essential to understanding the direction and extent of postinhibitory processes, namely, reactivation and/or aging. For example, the presence of a charged phosphate group at the catalytic serine of AChE is far less likely to reactivate than an active site serine bearing a neutral phosphorus ester group. Such key mechanistic information could be useful in the clinical setting in which the identity of the OP-AChE conjugate is needed to evaluate therapeutic choices including the probability of oxime efficacy. Our results establish native and modified enzyme active sites of AChE as differential epitopes for antibody recognition. Even subtle differences in the OP modifying group conferred clear differences in the selectivity and specificity of these mechanism-based antibodies toward native and modified rMoAChE. Antibody recognition also correlated well with existing methods of enzyme analysis (colorimetric assay of activity) thereby allowing for a more powerful combined approach to better understand the mechanism of action of OP compounds.

A structurally competent Streptomyces griseus CYP105D1 was expressed as an engineered, exportable form in aerobically grown E. coli. Its progressive induction in the presence of 5-aminolevulinic acid-supplemented medium was accompanied by an accumulation of a greater than 100-fold higher amount of uroporphyrin I in the periplasm relative to cells lacking CYP105D1. Expression of a cytoplasm-resident engineered CYP105D1 at a comparative level to the secreted form was far less effective in promoting porphyrin accumulation in the periplasm. Expression at a 10-fold molar excess over the exported CYP105D1 of another periplasmically exported hemoprotein, the globular core of cytochrome b 5, did not substitute the role of the periplasmically localized CYP105D1 in promoting porphyrin production. This, therefore, eliminated the possibility that uroporphyrin accumulation is merely a result of increased hemoprotein synthesis. Moreover, in the strain that secreted CYP105D1, uroporphyrin production was considerably reduced by azole-based P450 inhibitors. Production of both holo-CYP105D1 and uroporphyrin was dependent upon 5-aminolevulinic acid, except that at higher concentrations this resulted in a decrease in uroporphyrin. This study suggests that the exported CYP105D1 oxidatively catalyzes periplasmic conversion of uroporphyrinogen I to uroporphyrin I in E. coli.

Nebert D.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been suggested to be the cause of the sporadic form of the diseases. Of the many possible URO isomers, only types I and III occur in nature. Both isomers arise from spontaneous oxidation of the heme metabolic intermediates, uroporphyrinogens (UROgens) I and III. UROgen III synthase catalyzes the conversion of hydroxymethylbilane to UROgen III, which involves rearrangement of the propionate and acetate groups of ring IV of the tetrapyrrole, whereas UROgen I is formed nonenzymatically. UROgens I and III can be further metabolized by UROgen decarboxylase to yield coproporphyrinogens I and III, respectively, which can also undergo spontaneous oxidation to coproporphyrins I and III. Uroporphyric-like states that lead to a significant build-up of URO have been experimentally induced in eukaryotic cells exposed to CYP inducers such as chlorinated biphenyls (10Franklin M.R. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and methylcholanthrene (11Sinclair P. Lambrecht R. Sinclair J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1324-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since such xenobiotics are classic inducers of CYP (12Rendic S. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 83-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), a link has been suggested between susceptibility to uroporphyria (porphyrias characterized by URO and UROgen overload) and CYP-mediated oxidization of heme intermediates. The in vitro observation of CYP-catalyzed conversion of UROgen to URO (13Sinclair P.R. Gorman N. Tsyrlov I.B. Fuhr U. Walton H.S. Sinclair J.F. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1019-1025PubMed Google Scholar) has been suggested as a major potential factor in the initiation of uroporphyria. Although there is strong, but indirect, evidence for the participation of a variety of CYPs in the etiology of uroporphyrias including the CYP1A subfamily (14Gorman N. Walton H.S. Sinclair J.F. Sinclair P.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1998; 121: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), CYP1A2, and particularly CYP3A (10Franklin M.R. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the metabolic contribution of the hemoprotein in vivo has not been firmly established. Most recently, the soluble CYP105D1 of Streptomyces griseus has been successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as an exportable form that was efficiently localized to the periplasm (15Kaderbhai M.A. Ugochukwu C.C. Kelly S.L. Lamb D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2136-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Expression of the periplasmic CYP105D1 was coupled with generation of a highly fluorescent compound identified as URO I. We now show that the uroporphyric state induced in the engineered E. coli, which has a requirement for ALA to be present, is associated in vivo with the exported, catalytically active CYP105D1 and arises from URO I accumulation. The formation of such products has not been observed before in prokaryotic cells heterologously expressing CYP and has in turn important implications in the ontogenesis of the related diseases in human disorders.

Heterologous Expression, Quantification, and Isolation of CYPs—In the present study, we employed E. coli TB1 (F, araΔ (lac-proAB)rps ϕ 80d lacZΔ M15hsdR17 (rk+mk+)) strain harboring pLi-CYP105D1 encoding the secretory form of CYP105D1, pAA-CYT coding for the secretory form of mammalian cytochrome b 5 (16Karim A. Kaderbhai N. Evans A. Harding V. Kaderbhai M.A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Harding V. Karim A. Kaderbhai N. Jones A. Evans A.

Lamb D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2136-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Plasmid pIN-CYP105D1 is a derivative of pLi-CYP105D1 and lacks the signal sequence. The vector was constructed by an inverse PCR strategy using pLi-CYP105D1 as the template and the following primers: 5′-ATGACGGAATCCACGACGG and 5′-TTTATTTTCTCCATGTACAAATAC. The amplified DNA duplex was circularized by T4 DNA ligase and introduced into E. coli TB1. For induction of recombinant proteins, a 2% (v/v) inoculum of Luria-Bertani broth-grown, saturated culture was added to a phosphate-limited (0.1 mm) MOPS medium (16Karim A. Kaderbhai N. Evans A. Harding V. Kaderbhai M.A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was batch-cultivated at 35 °C with orbital agitation at 125 rpm for periods specified elsewhere. Unless stated otherwise, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) at 1 mm was routinely included in the MOPS growth medium. All media used for subcellular fractionation or isolation of URO contained 5 mm ascorbic acid in order to reduce adventitious auto-oxidative generation of porphyrin. Periplasm extracts were isolated as described previously (15Kaderbhai M.A. Ugochukwu C.C. Kelly S.L. Lamb D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2136-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To verify that authentic isolation of the periplasm had occurred, marker enzymes known to be specific for each of the subcellular fraction were routinely assayed as described (16Karim A. Kaderbhai N. Evans A. Harding V. Kaderbhai M.A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CYP content in biological samples was estimated according to the procedure described by Omura and Sato (18Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an absorption coefficient of 91 mm-1 cm-1. The oxidized cytochrome b 5 was quantified from the Soret absorption peak at 413 nm using the absorption coefficient of 115 mm-1 cm-1 (19Estabrook R.W. Werringloer J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Protein content was estimated employing the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard (20Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The CYP105D1 enzyme was purified from the periplasmic extract of E. coli CYP105D1 (1 liter of culture) cultivated for 24 h at 28 °C with 1 mm ALA supplementation. Following 2-fold dilution of the periplasmic extract with 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 8) buffer (TA) containing 1 mm EDTA, the sample was applied twice through a TA-pre-equilibrated column of DEAE CL-6B-Sepharose (5-ml bed volume). The column was successively washed with 5 ml of (i) TA, (ii) 0.1 m NaCl in TA, and (iii) 0.3 m NaCl in TA. The enzyme was eluted with 25 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in TA. The solution was concentrated by pressure filtration to 2.5 ml, and the CYP105D1 was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography by passage through a Superose column (1.5 × 65 cm) with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. CYP105D1-enriched fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation and Estimation of URO—Periplasmic and cytoplasmic extracts were derived from E. coli cultured in 100 ml of MOPS medium supplemented with ALA and 75 μg/ml ampicillin. Each extract, finally recovered in 5 ml of TA, was acidified with HCl to 0.2 m final concentration (pH <2) and left on ice for 5 min. The deproteinated supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min. URO amounts in the supernatant fractions after appropriate dilution were estimated spectroscopically from absorbance at 406 nm using the absorption coefficient 541 mm-1 cm-1 (21Rimington C. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 620-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The values were standardized to nmol/liter of culture. For estimation of URO in the “spent” growth medium, 20 ml of the growth medium was applied onto a DEAE CL-6B-Sepharose column (1-ml bed volume). After washing the column with 5 ml of 0.3 m NaCl in TA, the pigments were eluted with 2 ml of 1 m NaCl in TA, acidified, and spectroscopically quantified as described above. For the analysis and estimation of URO by HPLC (22Lim C.K. Peters T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 123: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the periplasmic fraction (5-ml volume recovered from 100-ml culture) was first deproteinated with 0.2 m HCl as described above. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.5 by titration with Trizma base. Following 5-fold dilution with distilled water, the solution was applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1-ml bed volume). After washing the column with 5 ml of TA, the pigments were eluted with 1 ml of 1 m NaCl in TA. HPLC was performed on an ODS2 column (250 × 4.6 mm; 5-μm article size) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with an acetonitrile-1 m ammonium acetate (pH 5.16) (14.3:85.7 (v/v)) as the mobile phase. The amounts of porphyrins in each peak were calculated by comparison with the standard curve derived from known amounts of URO I and III. Compounds were detected by measuring the absorbance at 406 nm in a continuous flow cell, and the data were processed by Thermochrom II software (LDC Analytical). Heme Solution—A 10 mm heme solution was prepared as follows. Bovine hemin, after dissolving in one-twentieth of the final volume of freshly prepared 1 m NaOH, was sequentially mixed with an equal volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7) and an eight-tenths final volume of ethylene glycol. The pH was adjusted to 8.2 with 1 m HCl. The solution was made up to the final volume with distilled water, filter-sterilized by passage through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored at 4 °C. To test the ability of the E. coli TB1 strain to utilize exogenous heme, the stock heme solution was applied in the MOPS medium at 5-fold increasing concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 μm. A Fluorescent Compound Generated during Periplasmic Expression of CYP105D1 Is a URO—We recently reported that an E. coli strain harboring an engineered pLi-CYP105D1 plasmid expressed an exportable form of the Streptomyces griseus CYP105D1 under the transcriptional control of the tightly regulated phoA promoter (23Kikuchi Y. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. Tamura G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The periplasmic localization of CYP105D1 was facilitated by N-terminal appendage of a bacterial secretory signal that utilizes the sec-dependent translocon export pathway (24Kim J. Kendall D.A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The pre-CYP105D1 was correctly processed, folded, and heme-assembled to yield substantial quantities of the functional recombinant hemoprotein in the periplasm. E. coli pLi-CYP105D1 cultured in the MOPS medium in the presence of 1 mm ALA for periods ranging from 12 to 36 h displayed a strong brown hue in contrast to comparably cultured control cells containing the progenitor plasmid pLi-Q lacking cyp105D1. The color was partly attributed to the presence of significant quantities of the holo-CYP105D1 that had accrued in the periplasm. Interestingly, UV illumination of E. coli pLi-CYP105D1 but not E. coli pLi-Q cells exhibited an intense red fluorescence emission. Preliminary subfractionation studies indicated that the fluorescent agent(s) was particularly concentrated in the periplasmic extract. In order to isolate and characterize the fluorescent compound(s), the periplasmic extract from E. coli pLi-CYP105D1 was subjected to anion exchange separation by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Following sequential washes with 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 m NaCl in TA, an intense dark brown layer remained firmly bound to the column. A further wash with 0.5 m NaCl in TA eluted a light brown-colored fraction containing the CYP105D1 protein together with a pigment that showed predominant absorption peaks between 486 and 492 nm. A final wash with 1 m NaCl in TA displaced a rose-colored fraction that gave an intense red fluorescence upon UV light illumination. Spectrofluorometric analysis of the isolated compound(s) upon excitation at 398 nm displayed a major emission peak at 615 nm together with smaller peaks 642 and 678 nm (Fig. 1). Absorption spectroscopy in the visible region gave a major peak at 398 nm (Fig. 2A) with four smaller peaks at 502, 538, 560, and 612 nm (Fig. 2B); the spectrum matched well with that of authentic URO I (25Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1987: 213-232Google Scholar). The etio-nature of the UV-visible spectrum suggested that the potential URO was in a metal-free state (26Hans-Peter K. Fat-soluble Pigments. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988Google Scholar). Acidification of the solution with HCl (0.2 m final concentration) shifted the Soret absorption peak to 406 nm (Fig. 3A) and yielded two additional minor peaks at 550 and 592 nm (Fig. 3B). Further analysis of the pigment(s) by electrospray ionization spectrometry revealed a major, stable predominant species with a relative molecular mass of 831 (Fig. 4) that was not detectable in the E. coli pLi-Q extract. The spectral characteristics and the mass of the bacterially produced fluorescent compound were identical to a commercially obtained authentic URO I (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This could be indicative of URO I, but notably URO III, the counterpart physiological isomer, also has identical spectral characteristics. However, further comparison of the unknown pigment with the two authentic pigments by HPLC analysis (22Lim C.K. Peters T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 123: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) identified type I isomer as the major species, constituting about 85%. Identification was further confirmed by thin layer chromatography (27Henderson M.J. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereby the relative mobility of the bacterial pigment matched with the authentic URO I. Under the present conditions of analysis, other intermediates of the pathway such as hepta-, hexa-, penta-, and tetracarboxylporphyrins were not detected.Fig. 2Absorption spectra of the putative porphyric pigment isolated from E. coli periplasm compared with authentic URO I. The spectra were recorded in TA buffer (pH 8).

In both strains, the periplasmic URO accrued with the duration of culturing. However, the control pLi-Q strain showed only a 5-fold increase, ranging from 2 nmol/liter of culture at 12 h to about 10 nmol of URO/liter of culture at 36 h compared with an ∼100-fold increase in URO in the recombinant strain. The latter produced 800 nmol of URO/liter by 36 h. In the pLi-Q strain, the URO profile followed a similar pattern to that seen in its periplasm. In contrast, the cytoplasmic level of URO in pLi-CYP105D1 increased substantially by nearly 10-fold, reaching 25 nmol of URO/liter of culture following 36 h of culturing. Given the high accumulation of URO in the periplasm, we cannot discount the likelihood that URO in the cytoplasmic fraction could be, at least partly, derived from contamination during cellular fractionation or in vivo leakage from the periplasm. In contrast, the URO found in the growth medium in the control and pLi-CYP105D1-expressing strains was negligible (Table I).Table IURO amounts in isolated periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions and in the growth medium of E. coli strains containing derivatives of pLiQ expressing secreted CYP105D1 (pLi-CYP105D1), secreted cytochrome b 5 (pAA-CYT), and cytoplasmic-resident CYP105D1 (pIN-CYP105D1) The values as nmol of URO/liter of culture or pmol of URO /mg of protein (in parentheses) are presented as means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.

P, phoA promoter, SD, Shine-Dalgarno sequence; SS, signal sequence of alkaline phosphatase; b5, globular core of cytochrome b5. We considered the possibility that overexpression and export of the apo-CYP105D1 may have induced synthesis and periplasmic export of heme. This possibility was explored by measuring the periplasmic and cytoplasmic pools of URO in an E. coli TB1 strain pAA-CYT that efficiently exports a mammalian recombinant cytochrome b 5 under expression conditions comparable with CYP105DI (16Karim A. Kaderbhai N. Evans A. Harding V. Kaderbhai M.A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although cytochrome b 5 is produced at about a 10-fold molar (24 h) excess over CYP105 (Table II), the periplasmic, cytoplasmic, and medium URO levels in this strain are similar to those in the control pLi-Q strain throughout the duration of culturing (Table I).Table IIHolo forms of CYP105D1 and cytochrome b5 in E. coli extracts as a function of culture duration The estimations of hemoproteins were performed in the isolated periplasmic extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.Holo hemoprotein contentE. coli pCYP105D1 (periplasm)E. coli pAA-CYT (periplasm)E. coli pIN-CYP105D1 (cytoplasm)12 h24 h36 h12 h24 h36 h12 h24 h36 hnmol of hemoprotein/liter of culture12 ± 1.787 ± 1077 ± 11437 ± 35850 ± 93410 ± 3716 ± 0.895 ± 9123 ± 11nmol of hemoprotein/mg of protein0.4 ± 0.12 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.420 ± 629 ± 713 ± 20.7 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab To investigate whether URO production was an event specifically coupled with expression of the periplasmic form of CYP105D1, we constructed a cell line that expressed a nonsecreted, cytoplasmic CYP105D1. The cytoplasmic CYP105D1 was expressed more efficiently than the secretory form (Table II) and supported URO formation, although to a significantly lesser extent than that catalyzed by the periplasmic catalyst (Table I). Identities of the URO accumulated in the periplasmic fractions of the control and recombinant strain was confirmed by subjecting deproteinated extracts to HPLC analysis. Using the standard conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” UROs (I and III) were clearly resolved, and URO I was the dominant species. The overall pattern and yields of URO detected by HPLC were similar to that monitored spectroscopically in the periplasmic extracts. URO Production Requires Exogenous ALA and Co-expression of Holo-CYP105D1—In view of the long periods (>12 h) required to generate significant URO production, it was of interest to explore whether this phenomenon was related to synthesis and/or assembly of CYP105D1 in the periplasm. Hence, this necessitated an investigation of ALA dependence on production of holo- and apo-CYP105D1 (Fig. 5). The periplasmically recovered soluble CYP105D1 was separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The apo and holo forms were detected and distinguished by a combination of heme staining and Western blotting using anti-CYP105D1. Apo- but not holo-CYP105D1 was detectable in the E. coli cultured for 12 h without ALA. By 24 h of culturing in the absence of ALA, apo-CYP105D1 almost doubled, of which approximately 6% was converted to the holo form. With supplementation of increasing ALA concentrations in the medium, conversion of the apo form to holo-CYP105D1 accrued hyperbolically and was saturated at 2 mm ALA. Substitution of ALA with heme in the medium did not enhance the production of holo-CYP105D1. Moreover, significant synthesis of URO in the periplasm of E. coli pLi-CYP105D1 occurred only in the presence of exogenously supplemented ALA (Fig. 6). Peak production of URO was reached at 0.25 mm ALA, and at higher doses inhibition was imposed. Interestingly, supplementation of the cultures with additional ALA at 12 h slightly enhanced the productivity of URO, but beyond 0.2 mm ALA a more drastic inhibition of URO was imposed (Fig. 6). In contrast, the formation of holo-CYP105D1 was more directly proportional to ALA concentration up to 0.8 mm such that at the highest tested concentration of 2 mm ALA, a 20-fold increase in holo-hemoprotein was reached (Figs. 5 and 6). These findings suggest that formation of both holo-CYP105D1 and URO production were clearly dependent upon ALA supplemented in the medium, except that in the latter case a higher concentration of ALA caused a decrease in URO accumulation for reasons that are not clear.Fig. 6Effects of supplementing ALA in the growth medium on the periplasmic formations of URO I (A) and expression of CYP105D1 (B). E. coli pLi-CYP105D1 were cultured for 24 h, and ALA was supplemented either at the start (0 h, pretreated) or both at the start and again at 12 h (pre- and post-treated) of cultivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Selective Fungicides Inhibit URO Production—We investigated the effects of the fungal P450 inhibitors, clotrimazole, miconazole, and triadmefon, which interfere with the sterol biosynthesis (28Lamb D.

Standard batch cultures were incubated with the inhibitors at concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.5 mm, and the periplasmic URO was monitored after 24 h of culturing (Fig. 7).
