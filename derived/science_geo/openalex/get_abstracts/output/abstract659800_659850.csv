https://openalex.org/W3087347658,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is initiated by virus binding to the ACE2 cell-surface receptors1-4, followed by fusion of the virus and cell membranes to release the virus genome into the cell. Both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities are mediated by the virus spike glycoprotein5-7. As with other class-I membrane-fusion proteins, the spike protein is post-translationally cleaved, in this case by furin, into the S1 and S2 components that remain associated after cleavage8-10. Fusion activation after receptor binding is proposed to involve the exposure of a second proteolytic site (S2'), cleavage of which is required for the release of the fusion peptide11,12. Here we analyse the binding of ACE2 to the furin-cleaved form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. We classify ten different molecular species, including the unbound, closed spike trimer, the fully open ACE2-bound trimer and dissociated monomeric S1 bound to ACE2. The ten structures describe ACE2-binding events that destabilize the spike trimer, progressively opening up, and out, the individual S1 components. The opening process reduces S1 contacts and unshields the trimeric S2 core, priming the protein for fusion activation and dissociation of ACE2-bound S1 monomers. The structures also reveal refolding of an S1 subdomain after ACE2 binding that disrupts interactions with S2, which involves Asp61413-15 and leads to the destabilization of the structure of S2 proximal to the secondary (S2') cleavage site."

The phase III ACTIVATE trial assessed whether BCG has similar effects in the elderly. In this double-blind, randomized trial, elderly patients (n = 198) received BCG or placebo vaccine at hospital discharge and were followed for 12 months for new infections. At interim analysis, BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection (median 16 weeks compared to 11 weeks after placebo). The incidence of new infections was 42.3% (95% CIs 31.9%–53.4%) after placebo vaccination and 25.0% (95% CIs 16.4%–36.1%) after BCG vaccination; most of the protection was against respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin (hazard ratio 0.21, p = 0.013). No difference in the frequency of adverse effects was found. Data show that BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections. Larger studies are needed to assess protection against respiratory infections, including COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03296423)."
https://openalex.org/W3087139986,"The MTOC is “speck”-tacular Inflammasome complexes are formed in response to pathogen-associated molecules. They initiate both the maturation of inflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death. One notable feature for inflammasome activation is the formation of a single supramolecular punctum (or “speck”) in each affected cell. However, the location and mechanism of speck formation is poorly understood. Magupalli et al. report that for NLRP3- and pyrin-mediated inflammasomes, their assembly and downstream functions occur at the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). This process requires the dynein adaptor HDAC6, which is also a central player in aggresome formation and autophagosomal degradation at the MTOC. This work links several important cellular processes and provides clues for how inflammasomes are efficiently regulated. Science , this issue p. eaas8995"

In low-phosphate conditions, roots make more root hairs, which makes them better able to take up what little phosphate can be found. Wendrich et al. performed single-cell transcriptomics on the developing Arabidopsis root and queried the resulting gene-expression atlas for responses related to vascular development. The authors found that signals regulating root hair development began in the inner vasculature of the root with transcription factors that drove the production of the hormone cytokinin. Response cascades identified through the transcriptome database pointed to genes in epidermal cells that regulate root hair development. Science , this issue p. eaay4970"
https://openalex.org/W3082024221,"Novel COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. We generated a phage-displayed human antibody VH domain library from which we identified a high-affinity VH binder ab8. Bivalent VH, VH-Fc ab8, bound with high avidity to membrane-associated S glycoprotein and to mutants found in patients. It potently neutralized mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild-type mice at a dose as low as 2 mg/kg and exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly enhanced by its relatively small size. Electron microscopy combined with scanning mutagenesis identified ab8 interactions with all three S protomers and showed how ab8 neutralized the virus by directly interfering with ACE2 binding. VH-Fc ab8 did not aggregate and did not bind to 5,300 human membrane-associated proteins. The potent neutralization activity of VH-Fc ab8 combined with good developability properties and cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 mutants provide a strong rationale for its evaluation as a COVID-19 therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W3086973446,"Metazoan organisms rely on conserved stress response pathways to alleviate adverse conditions and preserve cellular integrity. Stress responses are particularly important in stem cells that provide lifetime support for tissue formation and repair, but how these protective systems are integrated into developmental programs is poorly understood. Here we used myoblast differentiation to identify the E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B and its substrate FNIP1 as core components of the reductive stress response. Reductive stress, as caused by prolonged antioxidant signaling or mitochondrial inactivity, reverts the oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1 and allows CUL2FEM1B to recognize its target. The ensuing proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 restores mitochondrial activity to preserve redox homeostasis and stem cell integrity. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial activity to redox needs and implicates metabolic control in coordination of stress and developmental signaling."

https://openalex.org/W3087384602,"Contaminated poultry meat is considered to be the main source of human infection with Campylobacter spp., a pathogen that asymptomatically colonizes broiler chickens during fattening and contaminates carcasses during slaughter. To prevent or reduce the colonization of broiler flocks with Campylobacter spp., applying different organic acids, especially in combinations, via feed or drinking water seems to be a promising approach. However, only very few combinations of organic acids have been tested for their antibacterial efficacy against Campylobacter spp. Therefore, the in vitro susceptibility of 30 Campylobacter spp. isolates (20 C. jejuni and ten C. coli) to ten organic acids and ten combinations was determined. The testing of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values was performed at pH 6.0 and 7.3 by using the broth microdilution method and included the following organic acids: Caprylic acid, sorbic acid, caproic acid, benzoic acid, ascorbic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid and tartaric acid and combinations thereof. The lowest MIC values were seen for caprylic acid (MIC range at pH 7.3: 0.5-2 mmol/L) and sorbic acid (MIC range at pH 7.3: 1-4 mmol/L). One to two dilution steps lower MIC values were determined at the lower pH value of 6.0. Furthermore, ten combinations consisting of three to five organic acids were developed. In addition to the tested antibacterial activity, other criteria were included such as approval as feed additives, reported synergistic effects and chemical properties. For nine of ten combinations, the MIC90 values of the organic acids decreased 1.25- to 241.5-fold compared to the MIC90 values for the individual substances. Furthermore, nine of ten combinations exhibited synergistic activities against two or more of the tested C. jejuni and C. coli isolates. A combination of caprylic acid, sorbic acid and caproic acid exhibited synergistic activities against the largest number of Campylobacter spp. isolates (six C. jejuni and four C. coli) with fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices (∑FIC) ranging from 0.33 to 1.42. This study shows in vitro synergistic activities of different organic acids in combinations against the major Campylobacter species and could therefore be a promising basis for reducing Campylobacter spp. in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3087694323,"Nature of the molecule-surface encounter Adsorption is an important initial step in all heterogeneous chemical processes. However, detailed adsorption dynamics are complex and challenging to follow experimentally. Using the fact that vibrationally excited carbon monoxide molecules can be trapped on the Au(111) surface with all degrees of freedom being equilibrated except the vibrational ones, Borodin et al. show that the vibrational relaxation time can serve as an internal clock to follow the microscopic pathways of adsorption and equilibration on the surface. On the basis of molecular beam experiments and theoretical modeling of this prototypical system, the authors reveal the intricate interplay between physisorption and chemisorption states. These observed characteristics are relevant to many other heterogeneous systems. Science , this issue p. 1461"
https://openalex.org/W3087140507,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are increasing serious menaces to human health in the recent years. Despite exhibiting different clinical phenotypes and selective neuronal loss, there are certain common features in these disorders, suggesting the presence of commonly dysregulated pathways. Identifying causal genes and dysregulated pathways can be helpful in providing effective treatment in these diseases. Interestingly, in spite of the considerable researches on NDDs, to the best of our knowledge, no dysregulated genes and/or pathways were reported in common across all the major NDDs so far. In this study, for the first time, we have applied the three-way interaction model, as an approach to unravel sophisticated gene interactions, to trace switch genes and significant pathways that are involved in six major NDDs. Subsequently, a gene regulatory network was constructed to investigate the regulatory communication of statistically significant triplets. Finally, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was applied to find possible common pathways. Because of the central role of neuroinflammation and immune system responses in both pathogenic and protective mechanisms in the NDDs, we focused on immune genes in this study. Our results suggest that ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" pathway is enriched in all of the studied NDDs, while ""osteoclast differentiation"" and ""natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity"" pathways are enriched in five of the NDDs each. The results of this study indicate that three pathways that include ""osteoclast differentiation"", ""natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity"" and ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" are common in five, five and six NDDs, respectively. Additionally, our analysis showed that Rps27a as a switch gene, together with the gene pair {Il-18, Cx3cl1} form a statistically significant and biologically relevant triplet in the major NDDs. More specifically, we suggested that Cx3cl1 might act as a potential upstream regulator of Il-18 in microglia activation, and in turn, might be controlled with Rps27a in triggering NDDs."
https://openalex.org/W3087358010,"Objective To date, the association between sleep duration or sleep quality and hyperuricemia has remained unclear. In addition, sleep duration and quality were not considered concomitantly in previous studies. Thus, this study was aimed toward an examination of the association of sleep duration and quality with uric acid level in a Taiwanese population. Methods A total of 4,555 patients aged ≥18 years were enrolled in this study. The sleep duration was classified into three groups: short (<7 h), normal (7–9 h), and long (≥9 h). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality, and poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score of >5. Results Poor sleepers were younger and had lower body mass index, blood pressure, uric acid, blood sugar, cholesterol, creatinine level, shorter sleep duration, and engaged in less exercise but had a higher white blood cell count and prevalence of smoking as compared to good sleepers. There were also differences in body mass index, blood pressure, uric acid, blood sugar, lipid profiles, and sleep quality among subjects with different sleep durations. After adjusting for other variables, poor sleep quality was associated with lower uric acid levels. In addition, short sleep duration was positively associated with higher uric acid levels. Conclusions Poor sleep quality was related to lower uric acid levels, whereas short sleep duration was associated with higher uric acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W3087152897,"Rice domestication/adaptation is a good model for studies of the development and spread of this important crop. Mutations that caused morphological and physiological change, followed by human selection/expansion, finally led to the improvement of phenotypes suitable for different kinds of environments. We used the sequence information for Heading date 1 (Hd1) gene to reveal the association between sequence changes and flowering phenotypes of rice in different regions. Seven loss-of-function hd1 haplotypes had been reported. By data-mining the genome sequencing information in the public domain, we discovered 3 other types. These loss-of-function allele haplotypes are present in subtropical and tropical regions, which indicates human selection. Some of these haplotypes are present locally. However, types 7 and 13 are present in more than one-third of the world’s rice accessions, including landraces and modern varieties. In the present study, phylogenetic, allele network and selection pressure analyses revealed that these two haplotypes might have occurred early in Southeastern Asia and then were introgressed in many local landraces in nearby regions. We also demonstrate that these haplotypes are present in weedy rice populations, which again indicates that these alleles were present in rice cultivation for long time. In comparing the wild rice sequence information, these loss-of-function haplotypes occurred in agro but were not from wild rice."
https://openalex.org/W3087209167,"Objectives Sexual violence can have a destructive impact on the lives of people. It is more common in unstable conditions such as during displacement or migration of people. On the Greek island of Lesvos, Médecins Sans Frontières provided medical care to survivors of sexual violence among the population of asylum seekers. This study describes the patterns of sexual violence reported by migrants and asylum seekers and the clinical care provided to them. Methods This is a descriptive study, using routine program data. The study population consisted of migrants and asylum seekers treated for conditions related to sexual violence at the Médecins Sans Frontières clinic on Lesvos Island (September 2017-January 2018). Results There were 215 survivors of sexual violence who presented for care, of whom 60 (28%) were male. The majority of incidents reported (94%) were cases of rape; 174 (81%) of survivors were from Africa and 185 (86%) of the incidents occurred over a month before presentation. Half the incidents (118) occurred in transit, mainly in Turkey, and 76 (35%) in the country of origin; 10 cases (5%) occurred on Lesvos. The perpetrator was known to the survivor in 23% of the cases. The need for mental health care exceeded the capacity of available mental care services. Conclusion Even though the majority of cases delayed seeking medical care after the incident, it is crucial that access to mental health services is guaranteed for those in need. Such access and security measures for people in transit need to be put in place along migration routes, including in countries nominally considered safe, and secure routes need to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3087296896,"Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted in medical fields to predict various outcomes. In particular, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is problematic because it often progresses to end-stage kidney disease. However, the trajectories of kidney function depend on individual patients. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based model to predict the rapid decline in kidney function among CKD patients by using a big hospital database constructed from the information of 118,584 patients derived from the electronic medical records system. The database included the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of each patient, recorded at least twice over a period of 90 days. The data of 19,894 patients (16.8%) were observed to satisfy the CKD criteria. We characterized the rapid decline of kidney function by a decline of 30% or more in the eGFR within a period of two years and classified the available patients into two groups-those exhibiting rapid eGFR decline and those exhibiting non-rapid eGFR decline. Following this, we constructed predictive models based on two machine learning algorithms. Longitudinal laboratory data including urine protein, blood pressure, and hemoglobin were used as covariates. We used longitudinal statistics with a baseline corresponding to 90-, 180-, and 360-day windows prior to the baseline point. The longitudinal statistics included the exponentially smoothed average (ESA), where the weight was defined to be 0.9*(t/b), where t denotes the number of days prior to the baseline point and b denotes the decay parameter. In this study, b was taken to be 7 (7-day ESA). We used logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) algorithms based on Python code with scikit-learn library (https://scikit-learn.org/) for model creation. The areas under the curve for LR and RF were 0.71 and 0.73, respectively. The 7-day ESA of urine protein ranked within the first two places in terms of importance according to both models. Further, other features related to urine protein were likely to rank higher than the rest. The LR and RF models revealed that the degree of urine protein, especially if it exhibited an increasing tendency, served as a prominent risk factor associated with rapid eGFR decline."
https://openalex.org/W3087690743,"Purpose Diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer can generate many challenges which impact on adjustment, so understanding the psychosocial factors which contribute to individual vulnerability to poor adaptation warrants further investigation. This study investigates stress and masculine identity threat as predictors of quality of life and emotional adjustment in men with localized prostate cancer and the role of resilience as a potential protective psychological factor. Methods Participants were invited to complete a survey study via online prostate cancer forums. Participants were 204 men ranging in age from 44–88 years (M = 65.24±7.51) and who were diagnosed with early localized prostate cancer within the previous five years. Measures used included the Perceived Stress Scale, Cancer-Related Masculine Threat Scale and the Conor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Using a cross-sectional online survey design, the extent to which perceived stress, masculine threat and psychological resilience are associated with quality of life, positive and negative affect and distress was assessed. Results Hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that perceived stress accounted for 26%-44% of variance on quality of life and adjustment indices, with high stress associated with low mood and poor quality of life. Low masculine threat and high resilience predicted better quality of life and emotional adjustment accounting for between 1–7% of the variance. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and distress and mediated the association between masculine threat and distress and negative affect. Conclusion Perceived stress was the most powerful predictor in the model and findings suggest it contributes significantly to functional and affective status in survivors of prostate cancer. Psychological resilience is a protective factor which buffers the negative effect of stress and masculine identity threat on emotional adjustment. Findings indicate that men should be screened as part of the diagnostic and treatment process for high perceived stress and low resilience to identify those at risk for poor adjustment during survivorship."
https://openalex.org/W3087314196,"Background Early childhood is a critical period for the development of obesity, with new approaches to prevent obesity in this age group needed. We designed and piloted the 3 Pillars Study (3PS), a healthy lifestyle programme informed by attachment theory for parents of preschool-aged children. Methods A 2-arm, randomised controlled pilot study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of 3PS, a 6-week programme involving a half-day workshop plus 6-week access to a study website. The programme was designed to promote routines around healthy lifestyle behaviours, including sleep, limited screen use, and family meals, within the context of positive, reciprocal parent-child interactions. Parents (n = 54) of children aged 2–4 years who regularly exceeded screen use recommendations (≥1 hour per day), were randomised to the 3PS programme (n = 27) or a wait-list control group (n = 27). Child screen time at 6 weeks was the primary endpoint. Frequency of family meals, parent feeding practices, diet quality, sleep, Child Routine Inventory (to assess predictability of commonly occurring routines), and household chaos were also assessed. Study data were collected online at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks via REDCap. Results No group differences were observed for changes from baseline in screen time (primary endpoint), feeding behaviour scores, Child Routine Inventory scores, or total night time sleep duration at 6 and 12 weeks, although all measures improved in the hypothesised direction in the 3PS group. Compared with controls, the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements from baseline in household chaos scores (i.e. a reduction in chaos) and a number of measures of sleep outcomes, indicating improved sleep continuity. The programme was highly acceptable to parents. Conclusions and recommendations A relational approach appears promising as a novel way to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours associated with the prevention of childhood obesity in children aged 2–4 years. A larger study is warranted."

Collaboratively, the Community Program staff of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) created a metric to describe, monitor, and evaluate one component of GPP, recruitment practices, in two HIV monoclonal Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) clinical trials, HVTN 703/HPTN 081 and HVTN 704/HPTN 085. Through consultation with community representatives from each clinical research site (hereafter ""site(s)""), who made up the study Community Working Groups, recruitment strategy descriptors were developed for both trials to characterize responses to ""How did you hear about the AMP study?"" The Community Working Groups also helped to define and establish time points that were selected to allow comparisons across sites. Data were collected by 43 of 46 clinical research sites from January 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018. All 43 sites used multiple recruitment strategies successfully, but strategies varied by region. Globally, referrals was the most efficient and effective recruitment strategy as evidenced by the screening: enrollment ratio of 2.2:1 in Africa, and 2.1:1 in the Americas/Switzerland. Print materials were also valuable globally (3:1 Africa, 4.2:1 Americas/Switzerland). In Africa, in-person outreach was also quite effective (2.3:1) and led to the most enrollments (748 of 1186, 63%). In the Americas/Switzerland, outreach was also effective (2.6:1), but internet use resulted in the most screens (1893 of 4275, 44%) and enrollments (677 of 1531, 44%), compared to 12 of 2887 (0.4%) and 2 of 1204 (0.1%) in Africa, respectively. Standardized metrics and data collection aid meaningful comparisons of optimal community engagement methods for trial enrollment. Internet strategies had better success in the Americas/Switzerland than in sub-Saharan African countries. Data are essential in outreach staff efforts to improve screening-to-enrollment ratios. Because the effectiveness of recruitment strategies varies by region, it is critical that clinical research sites tailor community engagement and recruitment strategies to their local environment, and that they are supported with resources enabling use of a range of approaches."

Patient's expectations regarding his/her esthetics are important and should be assessed ahead of any planning of esthetic treatment. The aim of this study was to explore the differences in perception of orofacial appearance by laypersons with different social and demographic status.Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 400 subjects. The questionnaire comprised three parts; the first part addressed the demographic variables. The second part queried about dental prosthesis, orthognathic or plastic surgery, and/or ongoing or previous orthodontic treatment. The third part included the Arabic version of the-8-item Orofacial Esthetic Scale (OES-Ar) whose responses were scored in the 5-point Likert scale. These scores were compared by different grouping factors (age, gender, marital status, and education) using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Willis tests with 95% confidence interval (α > 0.05).A total of 268 questionnaires were eligible for analysis, representing 67% response rate. The satisfaction with facial profile appearance was the highest (4.0±1.1) followed by facial appearance (3.9±1.1), while the color of teeth was the least satisfying item (3.1±1.3). No significant differences were found between age groups for the mean summary score as well as for each item independently. No significant difference was found between both sexes except for the last item ""overall impression"". Married subjects rated one item (alignment of teeth) better than their counterparts. Positive perception of orofacial appearance increased significantly with the increase of education level, the perception of the oral health status, and the perception of the general health status.Good oral health and/or high education level are significant determinants of more positive perception of orofacial esthetic appearance. Patients with these characteristics might be more concerned about their orofacial appearance, and this should be taken into consideration before planning any esthetic restorative dental treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3087665095,"Background Postoperative stroke is a rare but potentially devastating complication following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of the current study was to determine the incidence, independent risk factors, and timing of stroke following THA and TKA utilizing the National Surgical Quality Improvement (NSQIP) database. Methods Patients who underwent elective primary THA and TKA were identified in the 2005–2016 NSQIP database. Thirty-day postoperative strokes were identified, timing was characterized, and an incidence curve was created. Multivariate analyses determined the independent predictors of these strokes. Results Of 333,117 patients identified, 286 (0.09%) experienced a stroke. Given that THA vs TKA was not a univariate predictor of stroke, the two procedures were considered together. The majority (65%) of strokes occurred before discharge. Of the strokes observed, 25% occurred by postoperative day one, 50% by postoperative day two, and 75% by postoperative day nine. Independent risk factors for postoperative stroke were: age (60–69 years old odds ratio [OR] = 4.2; 70–79 years old OR = 8.1; ≤80 years old OR = 16.1), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (ASA≥3 OR = 1.7), and smoking [OR = 1.6). Conclusion The incidence of stroke after THA/TKA was low at 0.09%, with the majority occurring prior to discharge and half occurring by postoperative day two. Patients who were older, sicker, or who were smokers were at greater risk of postoperative stroke. These findings can be used to council patients and to optimize patient care.

https://openalex.org/W3087315760,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. ZIKV predominantly enters cells using the TAM-family protein tyrosine kinase receptor AXL, which is expressed on a range of cell types, including neural progenitor cells, keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and osteoblasts. ZIKV infections have been associated with fetal brain damage, which prompted the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency in 2016. ZIKV infection has also been linked to birth defects in other organs. Several studies have reported congenital heart defects (CHD) in ZIKV infected infants and cardiovascular complications in adults infected with ZIKV. To develop a better understanding of potential causes for these pathologies at a cellular level, we characterized ZIKV infection of human fetal cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells (fcMSCs), a cell type that is known to contribute to both embryological development as well as adult cardiac physiology. Total RNA, supernatants, and/or cells were collected at various time points post-infection to evaluate ZIKV replication, cell death, and antiviral responses. We found that ZIKV productively infected fcMSCs with peak (~70%) viral mRNA detected at 48 h. Use of an antibody blocking the AXL receptor decreased ZIKV infection (by ~50%), indicating that the receptor is responsible to a large extent for viral entry into the cell. ZIKV also altered protein expression of several mesenchymal cell markers, which suggests that ZIKV could affect fcMSCs’ differentiation process. Gene expression analysis of fcMSCs exposed to ZIKV at 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection revealed up-regulation of genes/pathways associated with interferon-stimulated antiviral responses. Stimulation of TLR3 (using poly I:C) or TLR7 (using Imiquimod) prior to ZIKV infection suppressed viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, fcMSCs can be a target for ZIKV infection, potentially resulting in CHD during embryological development and/or cardiovascular issues in ZIKV infected adults."
https://openalex.org/W3087348193,"The estrogen-signalling pathway is critical for normal follicular development; however, little is known about its importance during in vitro maturation (IVM) in large animals, particularly yaks (Bos grunniens). Through the present study, we aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying estrogen involvement in cumulus expansion and the subsequent development of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). COCs were cultured in the maturation medium supplemented with different concentrations (10−6–10−3 mM) of 17β-estradiol (E2) or its receptor antagonist, fulvestrant, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot were performed to determine the expression of cumulus-expansion related factors and oocyte-secreted factors (OSFs). The cumulus expansion of COCs was observed using an inverted microscope, and COCs developmental ability were judged by the evaluation of cleavage and blastulation rates per inseminated oocytes by IVF, and the number of cells in the blastocyst. Cumulus expansion increased with 10−6–10−3 mM E2, but decreased with fulvestrant. HAS2, PTGS2, PTX3 and OSFs expression increased in the 10−6–10−3 mM E2 groups. Significantly higher cleavage and blastocyst rates were observed in the 10−4 mM E2 group than in the fulvestrant and 0 mM E2 groups. Moreover, in the 10−4 mM group, blastocysts at 7 days had higher cell counts than the other groups. In conclusion, the increase in cumulus expansion and subsequent oocyte development after the addition of E2 to IVM medium may have resulted from increased cumulus-expansion-related factor expression and OSF levels."
https://openalex.org/W3087367927,"The mismatch between students' anthropometric measures and school furniture dimensions have been investigated in many countries. In Iran, collegians spend at least a quarter of the day hours at university in the sitting position, so it is essential to evaluate furniture mismatch among university students. In Iranian universities, the use of chairs with an attached table is widespread, while the study of mismatches in these chairs among the collegian community is rare. This study was aimed to compare and rank different classroom furniture types based on the mismatch between collegians' anthropometric measures and the dimensions of classroom furniture among Industrial Engineering students by developing a Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach in an integrated Methodology. The sample consisted of 111 participants (71 males, 40 females). Ten anthropometric measures were gathered, together with eight furniture dimensions for four types of chairs. Mismatch analyses were carried out using mismatch equations, and the Simple Additive Weighting method was used as a base method to solve the decision-making problem. The results indicated that Underneath Desk Height and Seat to Desk Clearance showed the highest levels of the match, while Seat Width presents the highest levels of low mismatch. According to the results, Type 1 and Type 3 were the best current classroom furniture. The Sensitivity Analysis was performed in two ways: changing the weights of criteria in nine scenarios and comparing the results with five other MCDM methods. The proposed MCDM approach can be used widely in furniture procurement processes and educational environments."

Subjects and methods We previously determined four FMS patient clusters labelled “maladaptive”, “adaptive”, “vulnerable”, and “resilient”. Here, we cluster-wise assessed relative gene expression of miR103a-3p, miR107, miR130a-3p, and miR125a-5p in white blood cell (WBC) RNA of 31 FMS patients and 16 healthy controls. Sum scores of pain-, stress-, and resilience-related questionnaires were correlated with miRNA relative gene expression. A cluster-specific speculative model of a miRNA-mediated regulatory cycle was proposed, and its potential targets verified by the online tool “target scan human”. Results One-way ANOVA revealed lower gene expression of miR103a-3p, miR107, and miR130a-3p in FMS patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). Follow-up post-hoc tests indicated the highest peak of gene expression of miR103a-3p for the adaptive cluster (p < 0.05), i.e. in patients with low disability in all symptom categories. Gene expression of miR103a-3p correlated with FMS related disability and miR107 with the score “physical abuse” of the trauma questionnaire (p < 0.05). Target scan identified sucrose non-fermentable serine/threonine protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa-b, cyclin dependent kinase, and toll-like receptor 4 as genetic targets of the miR103a/107 miRNA family. Conclusion We show an association between upregulated gene expression of miR103a, tendentially of miR107, and adaptive coping in FMS patients. Validation of this pair of miRNA may enable to identify a somatic resilience factor in FMS."
https://openalex.org/W3087012106,"Messages to promote health behavior are essential when considering health promotion, disease prevention, and healthy life expectancy. The present study aimed to examine whether (1) positive and negative goal-framing messages affect message memory and behavioral intention differently in younger, middle-aged, and older adults, (2) framing effects are mediated by interest in health (health promotion and disease prevention) and emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and (3) mediation effects differ between positive and negative frames. Participants (N = 1248) aged 20 to 70 years were divided into positive and negative frame conditions. Framing demonstrated interactive effects on message memory; all age groups showed higher recognition accuracy in the positive than the negative frame. The accuracy of younger adults was higher than that of older adults in the negative frame, while older adults showed higher accuracy than younger adults in the positive frame. Additionally, recognition accuracy was higher in the positive frame, as participants had higher interest in health promotion and used cognitive reappraisal more frequently. Contrariwise, emotion regulation and interest in health promotion did not have significant effects on memory in negative frames. Moreover, regardless of the message valence, age did not influence behavioral intention directly but was mediated by interest in health and emotion regulation, while the older the participants were, the higher their interest in health, resulting in higher intention. For emotion regulation, intention increased with higher reappraisal scores and decreased with increasing suppression. Our results suggest that interest in health and emotion regulation should be considered when examining the relationship between age and goal-framing for health messages."
https://openalex.org/W3087614433,"A vectorcardiography approach to electrocardiology contributes to the non-invasive assessment of electrical heterogeneity in the ventricles of the heart and to risk stratification for cardiac events including sudden cardiac death. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic method that identifies a representative QRST complex (QRSonset to Tend) from a Frank vectorcardiogram (VCG). This method should provide reliable measurements of morphological VCG parameters and signal when such measurements required manual scrutiny.Frank VCG was recorded in a population-based sample of 1094 participants (550 women) 50-65 years old as part of the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) pilot. Standardized supine rest allowing heart rate stabilization and adaptation of ventricular repolarization preceded a recording period lasting ≥5 minutes. In the Frank VCG a recording segment during steady-state conditions and with good signal quality was selected based on QRST variability. In this segment a representative signal-averaged QRST complex from cardiac cycles during 10s was selected. Twenty-eight morphological parameters were calculated including both conventional conduction intervals and VCG-derived parameters. The reliability and reproducibility of these parameters were evaluated when using completely automatic and automatic but manually edited annotation points.In 1080 participants (98.7%) our automatic method reliably selected a representative QRST complex where its instability measure effectively identified signal variability due to both external disturbances (""noise"") and physiologic and pathophysiologic variability, such as e.g. sinus arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation. There were significant sex-related differences in 24 of 28 VCG parameters. Some VCG parameters were insensitive to the instability value, while others were moderately sensitive.We developed an automatic process for identification of a signal-averaged QRST complex suitable for morphologic measurements which worked reliably in 99% of participants. This process is applicable for all non-invasive analyses of cardiac electrophysiology including risk stratification for cardiac death based on such measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3087745033,"The Howiesons Poort (HP) of southern Africa plays an important role in models on the early behavioral evolution of Homo sapiens. The HP is often portrayed as a coherent MSA industry characterized by early complex material culture. Recent work has emphasized parallel technological change through time across southern Africa potentially driven by ecological adaptations or demographic change. Here we examine patterns of diachronic variation within the HP and evaluate potential causal factors behind these changes. We test previous temporal assessments of the technocomplex at the local and regional level based on high-resolution quantitative data on HP lithic assemblages from Sibudu (KwaZulu-Natal) and comparisons with other southern African sites. At Sibudu, consistent unidirectional change in lithic technology characterizes the HP sequence. The results show a gradual reduction in typical HP markers such as the proportion of blades, backed pieces, and HP cores, as well as declining size of blades and backed artifacts. Quantitative comparisons with seven HP sites in South Africa suggest that lithic technology varies between regions over time instead of following similar changes. Concerning hypotheses of causal drivers, directional changes in lithic technology at Sibudu covary with shifting hunting patterns towards larger-sized bovids and a gradual opening of the vegetation. In contrast, variation in lithic technology shows little association with site use, mobility patterns or demographic expansions. Unlike at Sibudu, diachronic changes at other HP sites such as Diepkloof, Klasies River and Klipdrift appear to be associated with aspects of mobility, technological organization and site use. The regional diachronic patterns in the HP partly follow paleoclimatic zones, which could imply different ecological adaptations and distinct connection networks over time. Divergent and at times decoupled changes in lithic traits across sites precludes monocausal explanations for the entire HP, supporting more complex models for the observed technological trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W3087621141,"To evaluate the kinetic patterns of benign and malignant breast lesions using contrast-enhanced digital mammogram (CEDM).Women with suspicious breast lesions on mammography or ultrasound were enrolled. Single-view mediolateral oblique (MLO) CEDM of an affected breast was acquired at 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 min after injection of contrast agent. Three readers visually and semi-quantitatively analyzed the enhancement of suspicious lesions. The kinetic pattern of each lesion was classified as persistent, plateau, or washout over two time intervals, 2-4 min and 2-10 min, by comparing the signal intensity at the first time interval with that at the second.There were 73 malignant and 75 benign lesions in 148 patients (mean age: 52 years). Benign and malignant breast lesions showed the highest signal intensity at 3 min and 2 min, respectively. Average areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for diagnostic accuracy based on lesion enhancement at different time points were 0.73 at 2 min, 0.72 at 3 min, 0.69 at 4 min, 0.67 at 7 min, and 0.64 at 10 min. Diagnostic performance was significantly better at 2, 3, and 4 min than at 7 and 10 min (all p < 0.05). A washout kinetic pattern was significantly associated with malignant lesions at 2-4 min and 2-10 min frames according to two of the three readers' interpretations (all p ≤ 0.001).Applications of optimal time intervals and kinetic patterns show promise in differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions on CEDM."

https://openalex.org/W3087038654,"Brachycephalic airway syndrome (BAS) is a well-established cause of respiratory distress in dogs. BAS without surgical correction results in eventual laryngeal collapse. Arytenoid lateralization has been used to treat severe laryngeal collapse with some highly variable results. Chondromalacia and decreased stiffness of the arytenoid cartilage has been postulated a source of failure after arytenoid lateralization but no report of the histological characteristics and mechanical strength of arytenoid cartilage in brachycephalic dogs has been reported. Here we report histological and mechanical features in arytenoid cartilage of brachycephalic dogs. We identified the arytenoid cartilage in brachycephalic dogs presented degenerative histological characteristics and decreased load to failure and stiffness compared to that in non-brachycephalic dogs. Together, these observations suggest that degenerative condition of arytenoid cartilage in brachycephalic dogs could contribute to chondromalacia and mechanical weakness of arytenoid cartilage and result in cause of failure after arytenoid lateralization."
https://openalex.org/W3087121817,"Cell released microvesicles specifically, exosomes, play an important role in mediating immunologic escape, treatment resistance, and disease persistence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Reports on the molecular compositions of exosomes released by cells under diverse conditions, especially during viral infections, suggest that their cargo contents are not randomly loaded. However, the precise molecular mechanisms directing the selective cargo sorting and loading inside infectious viral exosomes remains elusive.To decipher the role of Reticulon 3 (RTN3) in the selective molecular cargo sorting and loading inside infectious viral exosomes during HCV infection.We used Huh7 cells-JFH1 HCV infection and HCV Full-Length (FL) replicon systems. Additionally, we analyzed human liver and serum exosome samples from healthy and treatment naïve HCV infected individuals. Our experiments made use of molecular biology and immunology techniques.HCV infection (JFH1-Huh7 or HCV-FL replicon cells) was associated with increased RTN3L&S isoforms expression in cells and cell released exosomes. Accordingly, increased expression of RTN3L&S was observed in liver and serum exosome samples of HCV infected individuals compared to healthy controls. RNA-ChIP analysis revealed that RTN3L&S interacted with dsHCV RNA. Lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown (KD) of RTN3 and plasmid overexpression (OE) of wild type, C- and N-terminal deletion mutants of RTN3L&S in HCV- infected Huh7 cells differentially impacted the cellular release of infectious viral exosomes. RTN3L&S KD significantly decreased, while RTN3S OE significantly increased the number of Huh7 cell-released infectious exosomes. The C-terminal domain of RTN3 interacted with and modulated the loading of dsHCV RNA inside infectious exosomes. Antiviral treatment of HCV infected Huh7 cells reduced virus-induced RTN3L&S expression and attenuated the release of infectious exosomes.RTN3 constitutes a novel regulator and a potential therapeutic target that mediates the specific loading of infectious viral exosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3087328507,"Introduction Rapidly increasing population old age dependency ratios create a growing economic imperative for people to work to older ages. However, rates of older worker employment are only increasing slowly. Amongst a cohort of contemporary older workers, we investigated risk factors for health-related job loss (HRJL) over 2 years of follow-up. Methods HEAF is a population based cohort study of adults in England (aged 50–64 years at baseline) who provided information about socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and work at baseline and annual follow-ups. Exits from paid work were mapped and risk factors for HRJL explored in a multiple-record survival dataset by Cox proportional hazards models. Results 2475 (75%) men and 2668 (66%) women were employed; 115 (4.6%) men and 182 (6.8%) women reported HRJL. Employment as road transport drivers/in vehicle trades (men), or as teaching/education/nursing/midwifery professionals or in caring personal services (women), was more frequent among people exiting work for health-related versus non-health-related reasons. Principal socio-demographic and lifestyle risk factors for HRJL were: struggling financially (men and women); low physical activity (men); being overweight or obese, and current smoking (women). Mutually adjusted work-related risk factors for HRJL were job dissatisfaction, and not coping with the physical (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: men 5.34[3.40,8.39]; women 3.73[2.48,5.60]) or mental demands (women only, 2.02[1.38,2.96]) of work. Conclusions Employment characteristics of contemporary older workers differ by sex. Job satisfaction and perceived ability to cope with the physical and mental demands of work are key determinants of HRJL which employers could potentially influence to enable work to older ages."
https://openalex.org/W3087431067,"In studies assessing tick abundance, the use of live traps to capture and euthanize rodent hosts is a commonly used method to determine their burden. However, captive animals can experience debilitating or fatal capture stress as a result prior to collection. An alternative method is the use of lethal traps, but this can potentially lead to tick drop-off between the time of capture and collection. In this study, in order to determine whether subjecting animals to capture stress is inevitable, we tested the difference in sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus) larval burdens between bank voles (Myodes glareolus) captured alive and euthanized, and lethally trapped bank voles. During 2017 and 2018, 1318 bank voles were captured using live (Ugglan Special no. 2) and lethal (Rapp2 Mousetrap) traps during two consecutive years over three seasons in two locations in Norway. Voles captured alive would remain captive until euthanized, while lethally trapped voles were killed instantly upon capture. Log-linear models, accounting for overdispersion, were used to determine whether trap type was influencing observed tick burden. Bank voles captured in lethal traps carried 5.7% more larvae compared to euthanized voles captured in live traps, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.420). Males were overall captured 2.7 times more frequently than females, and the sex ratio was equal in both trap types. This study shows that the use of lethal traps to determine tick burden of rodents is sufficiently reliable, without having to subject animals to potentially lethal stress, hereby reducing some ethical concerns of animal suffering and the results thereof, without compromising accuracy. Lethal trapping is also often more economical and practical, further favoring this collection method."
https://openalex.org/W3087533507,"Purpose Lobar lymph node metastases in non-primary tumor-bearing lobes (NTBL) are rarely reported. This study examined the risk factors of lobar lymph node metastasis in NTBL. Methods We retrospectively studied 301 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent surgical pulmonary resection with systematic lymph node dissection plus extended lobar lymph node dissection of NTBL. Patients were classified into positive and negative NTBL groups. Unconditional logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors for lobar lymph node metastasis in NTBL. Results NTBL lobar lymph nodes were identified in 38 patients (12.6%). A higher proportion of adenocarcinomas occurred in the positive NTBL group compared to the negative NTBL group (73.7% vs. 46.4%, P = 0.01). Risk of NTBL lobar lymph node metastases was significantly elevated in the lower lobe of primary site compared to the upper lobe (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.26–5.75, P = 0.01), and with adenocarcinomas compared to squamous cell carcinomas (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.09–7.65, P = 0.04). No differences were observed when comparing left and right lobes. NTBL lobar lymph node metastasis was most often observed among patients with larger tumor size, N1/N2 nodal involvement, with lymph vascular invasion (LVI), and visceral pleural invasion (VPI). Conclusion NTBL lobar lymph node metastases occurred more often in patients with a primary NSCLC tumor in the lower lobe, with adenocarcinomas, larger tumor size, N1/N2 nodal involvement, LVI or VPI. Extended lymphadenectomy including NTBL nodes may be clinically advantageous when these risk factors are present."

Additionally, it can be used to identify drivers of chemical or ecological water quality, to inform related management actions, and to forecast future conditions under land use and global change scenarios. Measurements from sites along the same stream may not be statistically independent, and the R package SSN provides a way to describe spatial autocorrelation when modelling relationships between measured variables and potential drivers. However, SSN requires the user to provide the stream network and sampling locations in a certain format. Likewise, other applications require catchment delineation and intersection of different spatial data. We developed the R package openSTARS that provides the functionality to derive stream networks from a digital elevation model, delineate stream catchments and intersect them with land use or other GIS data as potential predictors. Additionally, locations for model predictions can be generated automatically along the stream network. We present an example workflow of all data preparation steps. In a case study using data from water monitoring sites in Southern Germany, the resulting stream network and derived site characteristics matched those constructed using STARS, an ArcGIS custom toolbox. An advantage of openSTARS is that it relies on free and open-source GRASS GIS and R functions, unlike the original STARS toolbox which depends on proprietary ArcGIS. openSTARS also comes without a graphical user interface, to enhance reproducibility and reusability of the workflow, thereby harmonizing and simplifying the data pre-processing prior to statistical modelling. Overall, openSTARS facilitates the use of spatial regression and other applications on stream networks and contributes to reproducible science with applications in hydrology, environmental sciences and ecology."
https://openalex.org/W3087740606,"Purpose This study aims to investigate correlation between metabolic risk factors and optic disc cupping and the development of glaucoma. Methods This study is a retrospective, cross-sectional study with over 20-year-old patients that underwent health screening examinations. Intraocular pressure (IOP), fundus photographs, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), serum triglycerides, serum HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and serum HbA1c were obtained to analyse correlation between metabolic risk factors and glaucoma. Eye with glaucomatous optic neuropathy(GON) was defined as having an optic disc with either vertical cup-to-disc ratio(VCDR) ≥ 0.7 or a VCDR difference ≥ 0.2 between the right and left eyes by measuring VCDR with deep learning approach. Results The study comprised 15,585 subjects and 877 subjects were diagnosed as GON. In univariate analyses, age, BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, WC, triglyceride, LDL-C, HbA1c, and IOP were significantly and positively correlated with VCDR in the optic nerve head. In linear regression analysis as independent variables, stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that age, BMI, systolic BP, HbA1c, and IOP showed positive correlation with VCDR. In multivariate logistic analyses of risk factors and GON, higher age (odds ratio [OR], 1.054; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.046–1.063), male gender (OR, 0.730; 95% CI, 0.609–0.876), more obese (OR, 1.267; 95% CI, 1.065–1.507), and diabetes (OR, 1.575; 95% CI, 1.214–2.043) remained statistically significant correlation with GON. Conclusions Among the metabolic risk factors, obesity and diabetes as well as older age and male gender are risk factors of developing GON. The glaucoma screening examinations should be considered in the populations with these indicated risk factors."

The workplace is a prioritized setting for health promotion to reach widely within a population. Body age can be used as a health-risk estimate and as a motivational tool to change health behavior. In this study we investigate body age-based intervention including motivational interview and its effect on health, when applied to real life workplace health promotion.Body age-based intervention was performed in 90 companies on 9851 Danish employees from 2011-2017. Metabolic risk factors were assessed, body age score was determined and an individualized motivational interview was conducted at baseline and follow-up. Change in body age score, single risk factors, smoking habits and metabolic syndrome were analyzed. The body age score is a composite score comprising 11 weighted variables. A body age score ≤ 0 is preferred, as this elicit a younger/healthier or equal body age compared to chronological age.At 1.3 year follow-up the unhealthiest employees were less likely to participate. Within follow-up participants (39%, n = 3843) body age had improved by a decline in mean body age score of -0.6 and -0.7 years for men and women, respectively (p<0.001). Number of employees with metabolic syndrome had decreased from 646 at baseline to 557 at follow-up (p = 0.005) and 42% of smokers had quit smoking (p<0.001).On the basis of this study, we suggest that body age assessment motivates to participate in workplace health promotion, affect high risk behavior such as smoking thus have potential in public health promotion."

The unique data that allow examining these questions were compiled from billions of web hits by geo-located devices. These data are combined with both detailed establishment level data with reliable information on the innovation and design orientation of firms, and a longitudinal census of all establishments with a formal credit relationship in the U.S. The findings confirm that businesses located in areas with a high propensity to visit design and arts avocation websites are more likely to pursue more far ranging innovation and are more likely to integrate design into their innovation processes. Firm birth rates are higher in areas with a high propensity to visit websites of interest to entrepreneurs, and the existence of high growth firms is strongly associated with demonstrated interest in design and arts avocation websites. The possible uses of these nontraditional measures as indicators of economic dynamism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W3087162384,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in ulcerative colitis (UC) when the majority of colon epithelial cells may be exposed to inflammation-associated mutagenesis. In addition to mutagenesis generated by oxidative stress, inflammation can induce activation-induced cytidine deaminase (Aicda), a mutator enzyme in the APOBEC family, within colon epithelial cells. This study tested the hypothesis that deletion of the Aicda gene could protect against the development of inflammation-associated colorectal cancers, using a model of UC-like colitis in ""T/I"" mice deficient in TNF and IL10. Results showed that T/I mice that were additionally Aicda-deficient (""TIA"" mice) spontaneously developed moderate to severe UC-like colitis soon after weaning, with histologic features and colon inflammation severity scores similar those in T/I mice. Although the mean survival of TIA mice was decreased compared to T/I mice, multivariable analysis that adjusted for age when neoplasia was ascertained showed a decreased numbers of neoplastic colorectal lesions in TIA mice, with a trend toward decreased incidence of neoplasia. Aicda deficiency increased serum IL1α and slightly decreased IL12p40 and M-CSF, as compared with T/I mice, and led to undetectable levels of IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3. Taken together, these studies show that Aicda deficiency can decrease the number of neoplastic lesions but is not sufficient to prevent the risk of inflammation-associated colorectal neoplasia in the setting of severe UC-like inflammation. The TIA model may also be useful for assessing the roles of antibody class-switch recombination deficiency and somatic hypermutation on regulation of microbiota and inflammation in the small intestine and colon, as well as the pathogenesis of colitis associated with hyper-IgM syndrome in humans. Further studies will be required to determine the mechanisms that drive early mortality in TIA mice."
https://openalex.org/W3087175747,"Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy is now widely accepted as standard of care for AIDS-related lymphomas (ARLs) of B-cell origin. However, the clinical impact of rituximab in resource limited settings remains unknown. Different settings and patient heterogeneity may affect the effect of any given treatment. The study objectives were to determine if rituximab use was associated with improved 18-month overall survival (OS) of patients with ARLs and to identify correlates of 18-month OS.A retrospective review of medical records of adult HIV infected patients treated for high-grade large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with chemotherapy +/- rituximab between 2015-2017 was conducted. Vital status and disease progression/relapse at 18 months were determined. Survival functions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Equality of survival functions were assessed using Log-rank tests and Cox regression analysis to identify risk factors for mortality.One hundred and twenty-four eligible medical records were identified. This was a cohort of black Africans with a median age of 42 (IQR: 33-47) and a 57% male gender distribution. Overall survival at 6, 12 and 18 months for the population was 75.9%, 44.0% and 30.6% respectively. Over the study period, 72.6% of patients were diagnosed with disease progression/ relapse. There was a higher rate of rituximab use in patients who were treated at a private institution and those with medical insurance. Rituximab use was not associated with a reduction in 18-month mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)1.28, (95% CI 0.63-2.60)]. Risk factors for 18-month mortality were male gender [aHR 1.89, (95% CI 1.04-3.43)], age 40+ years [aHR 2.49, (1.33-4.67)], receipt of <3 chemotherapy cycles [aHR 2.48, (95% CI 1.33-4.60)] and low socioeconomic status [aHR 2.44, (95% CI 1.28-4.67)].Predictors of mortality were male gender, older age, low socioeconomic status and receipt of a less than half of the recommended number of chemotherapy cycles. Rituximab use was not associated with an improvement in 18-month OS in Zimbabwean patients with ARLs."

The technology known as “artificial photosynthesis” converts CO2 emissions into a variety of intermediates that serve as precursors to high-value products. CO2, light, water, and electricity were used as feedstock. An electrochemical reactor was also studied for the regeneration of active NADH operating at constant electrode potential. Initially, a batch electrochemical reactor containing 80 mL of 0.2 mM NAD+ in Tris-buffer (pH 7.40) was used to evaluate the electrode material operating at normal temperature and pressure. The results showed that the cathode is highly electrocatalytically efficient and selective to regenerate 97.45±0.8% of NADH from NAD+ at electrode potential of -2.3 V vs. mercury standard electrode (MSE). The NADH regeneration system was then integrated with ATP regeneration system and bioreactor containing Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). NADH was regenerated successfully during the process electrochemically and then was used by the enzymatic reaction to produce triose phosphate and 3-Phosphoglycerate (3GPA)."
https://openalex.org/W3087642152,"Melanocyte survival is mediated by diverse signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms they use and molecules that they target are incompletely understood. Here, we show that melanocyte survival is mediated by diverse, nonredundant signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, AKT, PKA, and PKC. Each of these pathways is exerting prosurvival effects by phosphorylating the BAD. While Ser112-BAD phosphorylation is regulated by pERK, pPKA and pPKC, Ser136 and Ser155 phosphorylation are exclusively controlled by pAKT and pPKA, respectively. Inhibition of these pathways individually resulted in only modest apoptosis; however, most significant apoptosis, as a result of BAD dephosphorylation, was seen when all pathways were inhibited concurrently. BAD phosphorylation was essential for survival of melanocytes as cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient BAD were not rescued by any of the identified pathway. Furthermore, melanocytes became insensitive to kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis when BAD expression was knocked down by BAD-shRNA. Overexpression of BAD in melanocytes stimulated faster apoptosis in response to kinase inhibitors. Taken together, our results show that BAD is acting as a convergence point for diverse survival pathways in melanocytes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of melanocyte survival provides fundamental new insights into physiological mechanisms involved in the development of various melanocyte pathologies such as melanoma and vitiligo."
https://openalex.org/W3082026724,"Objective Brief interventions based on personalized feedback have shown promising results in reducing risky alcohol use among university students. We investigated the effects of activating deliberative (predecisional) or implemental (postdecisional) mindsets on the effectiveness of a standardized brief intervention, the ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention. This intervention comprises a personalized feedback and a decisional balance exercise. We hypothesized that participants in a deliberative mindset should show better outcomes related to risk perception and behavior than participants in an implemental mindset. Methods A sample of 257 students provided baseline measures on risk perception, readiness to change, and alcohol use. Of those, 64 students with risky alcohol use were randomly allocated to one of two mindset induction conditions–deliberative or implemental mindset. Thereafter, they received the ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention and completed self-report questionnaires on changes in risk perception, alcohol use, and readiness to change at post-intervention and four-week follow-up. Results In contrast to our hypotheses, the four-weeks follow-up revealed that participants in the implemental mindset consumed significantly less alcohol than participants in a deliberative mindset did. The former decreased and the latter increased their alcohol intake; resistance to the brief intervention was stronger in the latter condition. However, neither deliberative nor implemental mindset participants showed any changes in risk perceptions or in their readiness to change alcohol consumption. Conclusions These findings suggest that mindset induction is a powerful moderator of the effects of the ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention. We argue that systematic research on mindset effects on brief intervention techniques aimed to reduce risky alcohol use is highly needed in order to identify the processes involved with commitment and resistance being the main candidates."
https://openalex.org/W3087073614,"Quokkas (Setonix brachyurus) are small macropodid marsupials from Western Australia, which are identified as of conservation concern. Studies on their blood analytes exist but involve small sample sizes and are associated with very little information concerning the health of the animals. Blood was collected from free-ranging quokkas from Rottnest Island (n = 113) and mainland (n = 37) Western Australia, between September 2010 and December 2011, to establish haematology and blood chemistry reference intervals. Differences in haematology and blood chemistry between sites (Rottnest Island v mainland) were significant for haematology (HMT, p = 0.003), blood chemistry (BLC, p = 0.001) and peripheral blood cell morphology (PBCM, p = 0.001). Except for alkaline phosphatase, all blood chemistry analytes were higher in mainland animals. There were also differences with time of year in HMT (p = 0.001), BLC (p = 0.001) and PBCM (p = 0.001) for Rottnest Island quokkas. A small sample of captive animals (n = 8) were opportunistically sampled for plasma concentrations of vitamin E and were found to be deficient compared with wild-caught animals. Fifty-eight of the 150 quokkas were also tested for the presence of Salmonella, microfilariae, Macropodid herpesvirus-6, Theileria spp., Babesia spp., trypanosomes, Cryptococcus spp. and other saprophytic fungi. All eight infectious agents were detected in this study. Infectious agents were detected in 24 of these 58 quokkas (41%), with more than one infectious agent detected for all 24 individuals. Salmonella were detected concurrently with microfilariae in 8 of these 24 quokkas, and this mixed infection was associated with lower values across all haematological analytes, with Salmonella having the greater involvement in the decreased haematological values (p < 0.05). There was no evidence for an effect of sex on HMT, BLC and PBCM. Our data provide important haematological and blood chemistry reference intervals for free-ranging quokkas. We applied novel methods of analyses to HMT and BLC that can be used more broadly, aiding identification of potential disease in wildlife."

Some authors consider that the boundary is marked by the northern limit of tree growth in the northernmost Norwegian mainland. In this study we have collected air and soil temperature data from 37 heath stands from northern Finnmark (71°N), the northernmost part of the Norwegian mainland, through Bear Island (74°N) in the Barents sea, to Adventsdalen (78)°N (in Spitsbergen) in Svalbard archipelago. In Finnmark, plots both south and north of the treeline were investigated. Vegetation and soil chemistry analyses were performed on the plots in Finnmark and Svalbard. Significant decreasing south-north trends in air and soil temperatures were observed from Finnmark to Spitsbergen. Soils in Finnmark were acidic and rich in organic matter, while those on Adventsdalen were basic and poor in organic matter. Vegetational analysis identified five communities: three in Finnmark and two on Adventsdalen. The communities in Finnmark had marked mutual similarities but were very different from those on Adventsdalen. No significant ecological differences between heaths south and north of the treeline in Finnmark were observed. Air and soil temperature variables in Finnmark were outside the recognized range for the arctic biome and inconsistent with the presence of permafrost both south and north of the treeline. A major difference between Finnmark and Spitsbergen was amount of soil frost and length of the growing season. Our results suggest that the boreal biome extends all the way to the north coast of mainland Norway; and previously used division of heaths in Finnmark into boreal, alpine and arctic biomes is not justified."
