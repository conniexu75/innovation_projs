https://openalex.org/W2079786653,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex disease caused by genetic and environmental factors, including genetic variants in complement components and smoking. Smoke exposure leads to oxidative stress, complement activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and lipid dysregulation, which have all been proposed to be associated with AMD pathogenesis. Here we examine the effects of smoke exposure on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke or filtered air for 6 months. RPE cells grown as stable monolayers were exposed to 5% cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Effects of smoke were determined by biochemical, molecular, and histological measures. Effects of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement and complement C3a anaphylatoxin receptor signaling were analyzed using knock-out mice or specific inhibitors. ER stress markers were elevated after smoke exposure in RPE of intact mice, which was eliminated in AP-deficient mice. To examine this relationship further, RPE monolayers were exposed to CSE. Short term smoke exposure resulted in production and release of complement C3, the generation of C3a, oxidative stress, complement activation on the cell membrane, and ER stress. Long term exposure to CSE resulted in lipid accumulation, and secretion. All measures were reversed by blocking C3a complement receptor (C3aR), alternative complement pathway signaling, and antioxidant therapy. Taken together, our results provide clear evidence that smoke exposure results in oxidative stress and complement activation via the AP, resulting in ER stress-mediated lipid accumulation, and further suggesting that oxidative stress and complement act synergistically in the pathogenesis of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2002738268,"Coffee contains various bioactives implicated with human health and disease risk. To accurately assess the effects of overall consumption upon health and disease, individual intake must be measured in large epidemiological studies. Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful approach to discover biomarkers of intake for a large range of foods. Here we report the profiling of the urinary metabolome of cohort study subjects to search for new biomarkers of coffee intake. Using repeated 24-hour dietary records and a food frequency questionnaire, 20 high coffee consumers (183-540 mL/d) and 19 low consumers were selected from the French SU.VI.MAX2 cohort. Morning spot urine samples from each subject were profiled by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Partial least-square discriminant analysis of multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data clearly distinguished high consumers from low via 132 significant (p-value<0.05) discriminating features. Ion clusters whose intensities were most elevated in the high consumers were annotated using online and in-house databases and their identities checked using commercial standards and MS-MS fragmentation. The best discriminants, and thus potential markers of coffee consumption, were the glucuronide of the diterpenoid atractyligenin, the diketopiperazine cyclo(isoleucyl-prolyl), and the alkaloid trigonelline. Some caffeine metabolites, such as 1-methylxanthine, were also among the discriminants, however caffeine may be consumed from other sources and its metabolism is subject to inter-individual variation. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that the biomarkers identified could be used effectively in combination for increased sensitivity and specificity. Once validated in other cohorts or intervention studies, these specific single or combined biomarkers will become a valuable alternative to assessment of coffee intake by dietary survey and finally lead to a better understanding of the health implications of coffee consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2015789827,"Drug combinations may exhibit synergistic or antagonistic effects. Rational design of synergistic drug combinations remains a challenge despite active experimental and computational efforts. Because drugs manifest their action via their targets, the effects of drug combinations should depend on the interaction of their targets in a network manner. We therefore modeled the effects of drug combinations along with their targets interacting in a network, trying to elucidate the relationships between the network topology involving drug targets and drug combination effects. We used three-node enzymatic networks with various topologies and parameters to study two-drug combinations. These networks can be simplifications of more complex networks involving drug targets, or closely connected target networks themselves. We found that the effects of most of the combinations were not sensitive to parameter variation, indicating that drug combinational effects largely depend on network topology. We then identified and analyzed consistent synergistic or antagonistic drug combination motifs. Synergistic motifs encompass a diverse range of patterns, including both serial and parallel combinations, while antagonistic combinations are relatively less common and homogenous, mostly composed of a positive feedback loop and a downstream link. Overall our study indicated that designing novel synergistic drug combinations based on network topology could be promising, and the motifs we identified could be a useful catalog for rational drug combination design in enzymatic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1993624267,"Background The measurement of adrenal and ovarian androgens in women with PCOS has been difficult based on poor specificity and sensitivity of assays in the female range. Methods Women with PCOS (NIH criteria; n = 52) and control subjects with 25–35 day menstrual cycles, no evidence of hyperandrogenism and matched for BMI (n = 42) underwent morning blood sampling. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to simultaneously measure 13 steroids from a single blood sample to measure adrenal and ovarian steroids. Androgen and progesterone results were compared in the same samples using RIA. Results Testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone and 17OH progesterone levels were higher when measured using RIA compared to LC-MS/MS, although the testosterone RIA demonstrated the best agreement with the LC-MS/MS using a Bland-Altman analysis. Results using LC-MS/MS demonstrated that the concentration of androgens and their precursors were higher in women with PCOS than controls [median (2.5, 97.5th %ile); 1607 (638, 3085) vs. 1143 (511, 4784) ng/dL; p = 0.03]. Women with PCOS had higher testosterone [49 (16, 125) vs. 24 (10, 59) ng/dL], androstenedione [203 (98, 476) vs. 106 (69, 223) ng/dL] and 17OH progesterone levels [80 (17, 176) vs. 44 (17, 142) ng/dL] compared to controls (all P<0.02), but no differences in serum concentrations of the adrenal steroids DHEAS, cortisol, corticosterone and their 11 deoxy precursors. Women with PCOS also had an increase in the product:precursor ratio for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [22% (6, 92) vs. 20% (4, 43); p = 0.009]. Conclusion LC-MS/MS was superior to RIA in measuring androstenedione, progesterone and 17OH progesterone levels, while testosterone measurements were better matched in the two assays. Androgen levels were higher in women with PCOS in the absence of a difference in adrenal-predominant steroids. These data support previous findings that the ovary is an important source for the androgen excess in women with PCOS."

We demonstrate that the enzymes responsible for the addition or removal of the O-GlcNAc modification, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively, are critical regulators of mitochondrial function. Using a SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture)-based proteomics screen, we quantified the changes in mitochondrial protein expression in OGT- and OGA-overexpressing cells. Strikingly, overexpression of OGT or OGA showed significant decreases in mitochondria-localized proteins involved in the respiratory chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore, mitochondrial morphology was altered in these cells. Both cellular respiration and glycolysis were reduced in OGT/OGA-overexpressing cells. These data demonstrate that alterations in O-GlcNAc cycling profoundly affect energy and metabolite production.

In the past several years, multiple groups have demonstrated links between metabolic disorders and O-GlcNAcylation. For example, several proteins involved in insulin signaling, including insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), are modified by O-GlcNAc. OGT localizes to the plasma membrane shortly after insulin binding to the insulin receptor, suggesting that relocation of OGT to the membrane suppresses insulin signaling by O-GlcNAcylating IRS1 (4Ball L.E.

Furthermore, chronic hyperglycemia causes an increase in O-GlcNAcylation of CRTC2 (cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein 2), thereby promoting increased gluconeogenesis through interactions with the CREB transcription factor (9Dentin R.

Concomitantly, the transcription factor FOXO1 is O-GlcNAcylated, which increases the transcription of gluconeogenesis genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (10Housley M.P. Rodgers J.T. Udeshi N.D. Kelly T.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Puigserver P. Hart G.W. O-GlcNAc regulates FoxO activation in response to glucose.J. Biol.

Mitochondrial function is also regulated by O-GlcNAc. Several respiratory chain proteins are modified by O-GlcNAc, and increased O-GlcNAcylation impairs respiration (11Hu Y. Suarez J. Fricovsky E.

Recently, several studies suggest that chronic hypoglycemia increases O-GlcNAcylation and promotes metabolic disease by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction (16Bennett C.E. Johnsen V.L. Shearer J.

For example, changes in cellular glucose levels in cardiac myocytes are linked to altered O-GlcNAcylation, which in turn lead to changes in mitochondrial function (11Hu Y. Suarez J. Fricovsky E.

Rats selected for low running capacity had increased mitochondrial O-GlcNAcylation, suggesting that increased mitochondrial O-GlcNAc impairs respiration (19Johnsen V.L. Belke D.D. Hughey C.C.

Genomics. 2013; 45: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for O-GlcNAcylation in the regulation of mitochondrial function. To address more fully how alterations in O-GlcNAc-processing enzymes affect mitochondrial function, we performed a proteomics-based study in a neuronal cell line in which we quantified changes in mitochondrial protein expression after overexpression of OGT or OGA. Overexpression of either enzyme caused a alterations in the expression of proteins involved in the respiratory chain as well as a reduction in several TCA cycle proteins. Mitochondrial morphology was greatly altered, and cellular respiration and glycolysis rates were significantly reduced. Together, our data demonstrate that both O-GlcNAc-processing enzymes regulate mitochondrial and cytosolic bioenergetic fluxes and infrastructure. Our data imply that mitochondrial function is sensitive to O-GlcNAc cycling. All antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution for immunoblotting unless otherwise noted. COX IV antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (A21348). The following antibodies were purchased from Abcam: Metaxin-1 (AB104966), ACADM (AB92461), NDUFA5 (AB183706), and NDUFA9 (AB14713). Actin (A2066) and GFP (G6539) were from Sigma. Antibodies for OGT (AL-28, Al-35), OGA (341), and O-GlcNAc (110.6) were a kind gift from the laboratory of Gerald Hart in the department of Biological Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For stable isotope labeling of amino acids on cell culture (SILAC), SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM (Cambridge Isotope, DMEM-500) supplemented with unlabeled arginine, lysine, and tyrosine (Sigma; A8094, L5501, and T8566), DMEM supplemented with 13C6-arginine, 4,4,5,5-D4-lysine, and tyrosine (Cambridge Isotope CLM-2265 and DLM-2640), or DMEM supplemented with 13C6-15N4-arginine, 13C6-15N2-lysine, and tyrosine (Cambridge Isotope CNLM-539 and CNLM-291). All SILAC media were supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Gemini 100-108) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were passaged at least five times in labeled media before performing an experiment. Cells were infected with OGT, OGA, or GFP virus at a multiplicity of infection of 75. Cells were then harvested for either MS analysis or respiration analysis 48 or 24 h after infection, respectively. All mitochondria were isolated using the modified nitrogen cavitation method described by Gottlieb and Adachi (20Gottlieb R.A. Adachi S. Nitrogen cavitation for cell disruption to obtain mitochondria from cultured cells.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 2 × 108 cells were used. The cells were digested off the plate with trypsin, washed twice with prechilled PBS, and resuspended into 3 ml of the isolation medium (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C). The cell suspension was collected into a prechilled cavitation chamber (nitrogen bomb; Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL) and was subjected to 900 p.s.i. for a 15-min period. The collected cell suspension from the cavitation chamber was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 3 min to pellet the cell debris (heavy particles or fractions of cells). The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet (crude mitochondrial fraction) was washed three times with 500 μl of isolation medium. The final pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 40 mm GlcNAc, and 1% Nonidet P-40, all reagents from Sigma) and lysed on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing. All electrophoresis was performed with 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Criterion Gels; Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were mixed with protein solubility mixture (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, 8% SDS, 50% sucrose, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.08% Pyronin-Y; Sigma) and separated at 120 volts, followed by transfer to PVDF membrane at 0.4 amps (Immobilon, Millipore). All antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution for immunoblotting (21Slawson C. Zachara N.E. Vosseller K. Cheung W.D. Lane M.D. Hart G.W.

Blots were developed using HRP-conjugated secondary (anti-rabbit HRP 170-6515 and anti-mouse HRP 170-6516, Bio-Rad; anti-IgM HRP A8786 and anti-IgY HRP A9046; Sigma) and chemiluminescent substrate (HyGlo E2400; Denville Scientific). Blots were stripped in 100 mm glycine (Sigma), pH 2.5, for 1 h, washed, and then treated as before (21Slawson C. Zachara N.E. Vosseller K. Cheung W.D. Lane M.D. Hart G.W.

Mitochondrial preparations were combined according to equal protein amounts and run on a 4–15% gradient gel. Following Coomassie Blue staining, each lane was cut into 19 consecutive strips and subjected to in-gel digestion. Briefly, gel bands were washed twice with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and vacuum-dried. Then, gel pieces were rehydrated in 25 μl of digestion buffer (10 ng/μl trypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3) for 10 min at 4 °C. The digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were extracted twice with 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. Extracted peptides were vacuum-dried to a final volume of 20 μl in 0.1% formic acid. The digested peptides were analyzed in duplicate by nanoflow reversed phase chromatography and mass spectrometry using an Eksigent 2D high performance liquid chromatography system (AB SCIEX, Dublin, CA) equipped with a FAMOS auto sampler. Peptides were loaded onto a C18 reversed phase peptide trap (100-μm inner diameter fused silica packed in-house with 2 cm of 100 Å, 5-μm, Magic C18 particles; Michrom Bioresources). Following a wash with 0.1% formic acid for 15 min at 0.5 μl/min, the peptide trap was connected to a reversed phase C18 resolving column (75-μm inner diameter, packed with 10 cm of the same material) that was mounted on the electrospray stage of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (LTQ FT; ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min over a 120-min period using a gradient of 5–60% acetonitrile (buffer A = 0.1% formic acid; buffer B = acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The source was operated at 1.9 kV, with the ion transfer temperature set to 250 °C. LC MS data were obtained in a hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS equipped with a 7-tesla magnet. The MS was controlled using the Xcalibur software package to continuously perform mass scan analysis on the Fourier transform, followed by tandem MS scans on the ion trap for the six most intense ions, with a dynamic exclusion of two repeat scans (30-s repeat duration and 90-s exclusion duration) of the same ion. Normalized collision energy for tandem MS was set to 35%. Peaks Studio (version 7.0; BSI, Waterloo, ON, Canada) was used to analyze the mass spectra. The following criteria were used for the searches: data refinement was performed with no merged scans, with precursor charge correction and with no filtering. De novo sequencing was performed with a mass tolerance of 25 ppm for the parent and 0.4 for the fragment ion, using trypsin as enzyme specificity, carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification, and variable modifications of oxidation (Met), deamidation (Asn, Gln), pyroGlu from Gln. Because proteins were isotopically labeled, variable modification for Lys (+4.03 and +8.01 for medium and heavy label, respectively) and Arg (+6.02 and 10.02 for medium and heavy label, respectively) was also considered. A maximum of three variable modifications and two missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. The resulting peptide sequences were searched against a human IPI protein database (version 3.87). Estimation of the false discovery rate was conducted by searching all spectra against a decoy-fusion (inverted) database. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at a false discovery rate <1%. For protein identification, proteins were accepted if they could be established at a Peaks protein probability score (−10lgP) better than 20 with a minimum of two unique peptides per protein. Proteins that contain similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on tandem MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principle of parsimony; only the top ranked protein sequence is reported under “Results.” For protein quantitation the Peaks Q module included in the Peaks Studio (Peaks Studio v7.0) was used. For precursor ion quantification the mass tolerance was set up to 0.2 Da and a retention time tolerance of 1 min, using an upper bound charge state of 4. For each experimental data set, protein ratios were calculated relative to the control (GFP cells) and were calculated on the average of total peaks intensities of the top three unique peptides identified per protein group. For each protein group, the data of at least two experimental data sets from all searches were combined and averaged. Only proteins that showed a 1.5-fold expression change were considered noteworthy. SY5Y cells were cultured on Thermanox® coverslips and infected with a 75 multiplicity of infection of GFP, OGT, or OGA adenovirus 24 h prior to fixation. Cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide/0.3% potassium ferricyanide. The cells were then dehydrated in a graded series of 50, 70, 80, 95, and 100% ethanol. Cells on coverslips were embedded in 100% epoxy resin, and the resin was cured overnight at 60 °C. Thin sections of 70–90 nm were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S (Reichert Technologies, Buffalo, NY) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were captured at 80 kV with JEOL JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA) equipped with a Lab6 gun at the University of Kansas Medical Center EM Core Laboratory. To measure cellular respiration and glycolysis, we used an XF24 flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). All cellular respiration and glycolysis assays were performed in a Seahorse 24-well cell culture plate in conjunction with an XF24 sensor cartridge on at least three separate occasions. SY5Y cells were seeded as a monolayer with a density of 65,000 cells/well and were infected with OGT, OGA, or GFP virus for 24 h prior to experimental assays. For respiration assays, cells were incubated in unbuffered DMEM (DMEM, 8.3 g/liter, Sigma D5030–1L pH 7.4), 25 mm glucose, phenol red (15 mg/liter, Sigma P-5530), 200 mm GlutaMax-1, NaCl (1.85 g/liter), at 37 °C in a CO2-free incubator for 1 h prior to loading the plate in the XF24 to allow temperature and pH equilibrium. The oxygen consumption rate was measured over a period of 100 min over which time oligomycin (0.5 μm), FCCP (0.3 μm), and both antimycin A (0.2 μm) and rotenone (0.1 μm) were sequentially added to each well at specified time points. For glycolysis assays, cells were incubated in glycolysis stress test base glucose-free medium (DMEM, 8.3 g/liter, pH 7.4) containing 40 μm phenol red (Sigma P-5530), 2 mm l-glutamine, and NaCl (1.85 g/liter) at 37 °C in a CO2-free incubator for 1 h prior to loading the plate in the XF24 to allow temperature and pH equilibrium. The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured over a period of 100 min. Glucose (25 mm), oligomycin (1 μm), and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (100 mm) were added to each well sequentially at specified time points during the assay. For comparisons of data containing three groups, we used one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc tests to compare mean differences of groups at a significance threshold of p < 0.05. To determine how changes in O-GlcNAc cycling affect mitochondria protein expression, we overexpressed either OGT or OGA through adenoviral-mediated infection. Importantly, we choose to use the full-length OGT over the mitochondrial form of OGT because we wanted to determine how changes in O-GlcNAc cycling would affect expression of both nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and subsequently any mitochondrial-encoded genes. Because neuronal function is highly dependent on oxidative metabolism, we used as a model cell line SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We selected this line because of its rapid expansion, its ease of overexpression, its neuronal background (OGT and OGA expression is robust in brain) and because SY5Y cells are relatively sensitive to changes in mitochondrial function (22Swerdlow R.H. Mitochondria in cybrids containing mtDNA from persons with mitochondriopathies.J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 3416-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After overexpression we isolated a heavy membrane preparation enriched for mitochondria and measured O-GlcNAcylation levels. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a control for adenoviral infection. GFP-expressing control mitochondria contained numerous O-GlcNAcylated proteins. Both OGT and OGA expression robustly increased in the respectively transfected cells. Overexpressing the nuclear-cytoplasmic form of OGT dramatically increased O-GlcNAc levels whereas OGA overexpression profoundly reduced O-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 1). Next, we generated SILAC-labeled SY5Y cells to determine how OGT/OGA overexpression changes the expression of mitochondrial proteins. Labeled cells expressing GFP (grown in light isotopic medium), OGT (grown in medium isotopic medium), or OGA (grown in heavy isotopic medium) were lysed, mitochondria were purified, and equal amounts of mitochondrial proteins were combined and separated via gel electrophoresis. In-gel digestion of stained proteins was performed, followed by a cleanup step using a protein trap and reverse phase HPLC separation. Separated proteins were then injected into a high mass accuracy ThermoFinnigan FT-LTQ mass spectrometer. Both sequence composition and quantitative information were collected in a single scan. Peptide and protein identifications below a false discovery rate of 1% are reported. PEAKS Software suite was used for identification and quantification analysis (Fig. 2A). We repeated this experiment two more times but switched SILAC labels for the cells expressing GFP, medium media, OGT, heavy media, or OGA, light media, for example. From each experimental set, we were able to identify numerous proteins from each in-gel digested bands (Fig. 2B). Reported in supplemental Table 1 are the identified proteins accession number, identified peptides, peptide sequence, isotopic quantitation, and statistics. In the first experiment, we determined a total of 507 protein identifications in the crude mitochondrial preparation, experiment 2 yielded 350 protein identifications, and experiment 3 yielded 768 protein identifications (Fig. 3A). 152 of the identified proteins were found in all experimental replicates (supplemental Table 1). We identified a total of 234, 146, and 242 mitochondrial proteins, respectively, from the three experimental replicates (Fig. 3B). We grouped the identified mitochondria proteins into classes according to function (Fig. 4). Of the 345 unique mitochondrial proteins identified, the most abundant class included those that mediate mitochondrial protein translation whereas proteins involved in cellular respiration were the next largest class of proteins identified.FIGURE 4Functional class distribution of identified mitochondrial proteins. Identified proteins were distributed into biological functional class. Components of mitochondrial protein expression and cellular respiration were the two largest identified classes of proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we quantified the differences in protein expression of the OGT- or OGA-overexpressing cells compared with the GFP-expressing control cells. Including nonmitochondrial proteins, from the combined replicates we were able to quantify 1102 total proteins (supplemental Table 1). We considered proteins whose expression changed >1.5-fold to be noteworthy, with 571 proteins showing large expression changes in the total extract (Fig. 5A) whereas 107 proteins changed in the mitochondrial extract (Fig. 5B). In most cases the increase or decrease in protein expression of OGT or OGA expressing cells was similar (Fig. 5, A and B). The reminder of the study is focused on the mitochondria, but all relevant information on these nonmitochondrial proteins is found in the supplemental tables. OGA- and OGT-overexpressing cells demonstrated similar patterns of mitochondrial protein change. Almost all of the mitochondrial protein functional categories demonstrated a decrease in protein expression although some transport and apoptosis proteins were increased in the overexpressing cells (Fig. 6 and supplemental Table 3). Next, we performed orthogonal validation on several mitochondrial proteins whose expression changed in the proteomic study via Western blotting. Again, we enriched mitochondria from SY5Y cells, but we included the cytosolic fraction as well on the gels. By including the cytosolic fraction, we can determine whether protein transport into the mitochondria was altered and potentially a mechanism for changes in protein expression. We then blotted for a variety of proteins. We determined no change in COX IV (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4) according to the proteomics; therefore, we used COX IV as a mitochondrial protein load control (Fig. 7). The complex 1 protein NDUFA9 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1α subcomplex) was decreased in the OGA overexpression proteomics and validated via Western blotting. However, complex 1 protein NDUFA5 was increased in OGT-overexpressing cells but decreased in the OGA-overexpressing cells. Showing expression decreases in both OGT/OGA-overexpressing cells was the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Metaxin-1 (MTX1). The β-oxidation protein ACADM (medium chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) was decreased in OGT-overexpressing cells and increased in the OGA-overexpressing cells, agreeing with the proteomics data (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Orthogonal validation of mitochondrial protein expression. Mitochondria and cytosolic fractions were prepared from SY5Y cells. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and probed for specific proteins. COX IV is used as a mitochondria load control whereas actin was a cytoplasmic load control. ACADM, NDUFA9, NDUFA5, and MTX1 expression mirrored the expression changes in the proteomic studies.

This molecule is activated in response to ER stress during chondrogenesis. The activated BBF2H7 accelerates cartilage matrix protein secretion through the up-regulation of Sec23a, which is responsible for protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and is a target of BBF2H7. In the present study, we elucidated the mechanisms of the transcriptional activation of Bbf2h7 in chondrocytes. The transcription of Bbf2h7 is regulated by Sex determining region Y-related high-mobility group box 9 (Sox9), a critical factor for chondrocyte differentiation that facilitates the expression of one of the major cartilage matrix proteins Type II collagen (Col2), through binding to the Sox DNA-binding motif in the Bbf2h7 promoter. BBF2H7 is activated as a transcription factor in response to physiological ER stress caused by abundant synthesis of cartilage matrix proteins, and consequently regulates the secretion of cartilage matrix proteins. Taken together, our findings demonstrate novel regulatory mechanisms of Sox9 for controlling the secretion of cartilage matrix proteins through the activation of BBF2H7-Sec23a signaling during chondrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016054826,"Synthesis of biogenic membranes requires transbilayer movement of lipid-linked sugar molecules. This biological process, which is fundamental in prokaryotic cells, remains as yet not clearly understood. In order to obtain insights into the molecular basis of its mode of action, we analyzed the structure-function relationship between Lipid II, the important building block of the bacterial cell wall, and its inner membrane-localized transporter FtsW. Here, we show that the predicted transmembrane helix 4 of Escherichia coli FtsW (this protein consists of 10 predicted transmembrane segments) is required for the transport activity of the protein. We have identified two charged residues (Arg(145) and Lys(153)) within this segment that are specifically involved in the flipping of Lipid II. Mutating these two amino acids to uncharged ones affected the transport activity of FtsW. This was consistent with loss of in vivo activity of the mutants, as manifested by their inability to complement a temperature-sensitive strain of FtsW. The transport activity of FtsW could be inhibited with a Lipid II variant having an additional size of 420 Da. Reducing the size of this analog by about 274 Da resulted in the resumption of the transport activity of FtsW. This suggests that the integral membrane protein FtsW forms a size-restricted porelike structure, which accommodates Lipid II during transport across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane."

Tibetans bear a genetic signature in the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2/EGLN1) gene, which encodes for the central oxygen sensor of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Recent studies have focused attention on two nonsynonymous coding region substitutions, D4E and C127S, both of which are markedly enriched in the Tibetan population. These amino acids reside in a region of PHD2 that harbors a zinc finger, which we have previously discovered binds to a Pro-Xaa-Leu-Glu (PXLE) motif in the HSP90 cochaperone p23, thereby recruiting PHD2 to the HSP90 pathway to facilitate HIF-α hydroxylation. We herein report that the Tibetan PHD2 haplotype (D4E/C127S) strikingly diminishes the interaction of PHD2 with p23, resulting in impaired PHD2 down-regulation of the HIF pathway. The defective binding to p23 depends on both the D4E and C127S substitutions. We also identify a PXLE motif in HSP90 itself that can mediate binding to PHD2 but find that this interaction is maintained with the D4E/C127S PHD2 haplotype.

Approximately 25,000 years ago, humans colonized the Tibetan plateau, which has an altitude of ∼14,000 feet. Tibetan adaptation to the extreme conditions of this plateau, particularly the marked hypoxia at this altitude (oxygen concentration is 60% of that at sea level), has provided one of the most striking examples of human adaptation (1Scheinfeldt L.B.

PHD2 and HIF2A are compelling candidate genes in this population because of the key positions that they occupy in the HIF pathway, which is the central pathway for transducing changes in oxygen tension to changes in gene expression (11Semenza G.L.

Under normoxic conditions, PHD2 site-specifically prolyl hydroxylates the α subunit of HIF (of which there are three paralogues: HIF1-α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α). In HIF-1α, the primary site of hydroxylation is Pro-564; in HIF-2α, it is Pro-531 (14Lee F.S. Percy M.J. The HIF pathway and erythrocytosis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2011; 6: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification allows recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that then targets HIF-α for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylation is attenuated, leading to the stabilization of HIF-α, its dimerization with HIF-β, and activation of HIF target genes. These genes participate in a broad range of processes that promote systemic and cellular adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1α and HIF-2α have overlapping as well as distinct gene targets. For example, HIF-1α activates many of the genes that encode for glycolytic enzymes, whereas HIF-2α is the principal regulator of the ERYTHROPOIETIN (EPO) gene (13Majmundar A.J. Wong W.J. Simon M.C.

The HIF pathway and erythrocytosis.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2011; 6: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The current challenge is to identify the molecular basis for how Tibetan-associated haplotypes in the PHD2 and HIF2A genes promote adaptation to high altitude. With regard to the PHD2 gene, resequencing of this gene in 46 Tibetan individuals ruled out a classic de novo mutation sweep (15Xiang K. Ouzhuluobu Peng Y. Yang Z. Zhang X. Cui C. Zhang H. Li M.

Evol. 2013; 30: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Instead, this study reported on selection from standing variation. In particular, there is significant enrichment in the Tibetan population of two nonsynonymous coding region single-nucleotide polymorphisms, originally identified by others (16Lorenzo, F. R., Simonson, T. S., Yang, Y., Ge, R., Prchal, J. T., (2010) American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, Dec 4–7, 2010, Orlando, FL (The American Society of Hematology, Washington, D. C.), Abstract 2602Google Scholar), that reside in exon 1 of the PHD2 gene: rs186996510 and rs12097901. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms are predicted to produce D4E and C127S amino acid substitutions, respectively, in the PHD2 protein. Amino acid residues that are essential for the catalytic activity of PHD2 are encoded for largely by exons 2–5 of the PHD2 gene. Exon 1 (amino acids 1–297), in contrast, is most notable for a zinc finger of the MYND (myloid, Nervy, DEAF-1) type, which encompasses amino acids 21–58. This zinc finger shows strong phylogenetic conservation (17Loenarz C. Coleman M.L. Boleininger A. Schierwater B. Holland P.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J.

The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor pathway regulates oxygen sensing in the simplest animal, Trichoplax adhaerens.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered that the function of this zinc finger is to couple PHD2 to the HSP90 pathway (19Song D. Li L.S. Heaton-Johnson K.J. Arsenault P.R. Master S.R. Lee F.S. Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) binds a Pro-Xaa-Leu-Glu motif, linking it to the heat shock protein 90 pathway.J. Biol.

Specifically, it binds to a Pro-Xaa-Leu-Glu (PXLE) motif that is present in select HSP90 cochaperones such as p23, and this allows recruitment of PHD2 to HSP90 to facilitate prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α, which itself is an HSP90 client protein (20Isaacs J.S.

The presence of the Tibetan-associated rs186996510 (D4E) and rs12097901 (C127S) single-nucleotide polymorphisms in exon 1 of the PHD2 gene led us to explore the possibility that this haplotype might affect PHD2 function, potentially through its zinc finger. Here, we provide evidence that the Tibetan D4E/C127S haplotype impairs PHD2 function and that mechanistically, it leads to a dramatically decreased ability of the PHD2 zinc finger to associate with the HSP90 cochaperone p23. Remarkably, this impairment depends on both the D4E and C127S amino acid substitutions. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the Tibetan PHD2 D4E/C127S haplotype leads to a loss of function (hypomorphic) PHD2 allele, and we propose that this is a key mechanism by which the HIF pathway has been reconfigured for adaptation to chronic hypoxia in this population. pcDNA3-HA-PHD2 (1–131) was constructed by subcloning the 0.4-kb BamHI/NotI (partial digest) fragment encoding residues 1–131 of pcDNA3-HA-PHD2 (1–196) (19Song D.

https://openalex.org/W2091364853,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a superimmunoglobulin receptor expressed on myeloid cells that plays an important role in the amplification of inflammation. Recent studies suggest a role for TREM-1 in tumor-associated macrophages with relationship to tumor growth and progression. Whether the effects of TREM-1 on inflammation and tumor growth are mediated by an alteration in cell survival signaling is not known. In these studies, we show that TREM-1 knock-out macrophages exhibit an increase in apoptosis of cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) suggesting a role for TREM-1 in macrophage survival. Specific ligation of TREM-1 with monoclonal TREM-1 (mTREM-1) or overexpression of TREM-1 with adeno-TREM-1 induced B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) with depletion of the key executioner caspase-3 prevents the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. TREM-1 knock-out cells showed lack of induction of Bcl2 with an increase in caspase-3 activation in response to lipopolysaccharide. In addition overexpression of TREM-1 with adeno-TREM-1 led to an increase in mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2) and knockdown of TREM-1 decreased the expression of mitofusins suggesting that TREM-1 contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity favoring cell survival. Investigations into potential mechanisms by which TREM-1 alters cell survival showed that TREM-1-induced Bcl-2 in an Egr2-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data shows that expression of Egr2 in response to specific ligation of TREM-1 is ERK mediated. These data for the first time provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of TREM-1 as an anti-apoptotic protein that prolongs macrophage survival."

Bisdichloroacetyldiamines strongly inhibit spermatogenesis. We reported previously that one of these compounds, WIN 18,446, potently inhibited spermatogenesis in rabbits by inhibiting retinoic acid synthesis. To understand how WIN 18,446 inhibits retinoic acid synthesis, we characterized its effects on human retinal dehydrogenase ALDH1A2 in vitro as well as its effects on retinoid metabolism in vivo using mice. WIN 18,446 strongly and irreversibly inhibited ALDH1A2 in vitro. In vivo, WIN 18,446 treatment completely abolished spermatogenesis after 4 weeks of treatment and modestly reduced adiposity in mice fed a chow diet. Effects of WIN 18,446 on retinoid concentrations were tissue-dependent. Although lung and liver retinyl ester concentrations were lower in WIN 18,446-treated animals, adipose retinyl ester levels were increased following the treatment. Interestingly, animals treated with WIN 18,446 had significantly higher circulating retinol concentrations compared with control mice. The effect on spermatogenesis by WIN 18,446 was not prevented by simultaneous treatment with retinoic acid, whereas effects on other tissues were partially or completely reversed. Cessation of WIN 18,446 treatment for 4 weeks reversed most retinoid-related phenotypes except for inhibition of spermatogenesis. Our data suggest that WIN 18,446 may be a useful model of systemic acquired retinoic acid deficiency. Given the effects observed in our study, inhibition of retinoic acid biosynthesis may have relevance for the treatment of obesity and in the development of novel male contraceptives.

These proteins are thought to fall into two classes that couple substrate efflux to the influx of either Na(+) or H(+). We studied the energetics of drug extrusion by NorM from Vibrio cholerae in proteoliposomes in which purified NorM protein was functionally reconstituted in an inside-out orientation. We establish that NorM simultaneously couples to the sodium-motive force and proton-motive force, and biochemically identify protein regions and residues that play important roles in Na(+) or H(+) binding. As the positions of protons are not available in current medium and high-resolution crystal structures of multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters, our findings add a previously unrecognized parameter to mechanistic models based of these structures."
https://openalex.org/W2054856526,"Neurogranin (Ng) is a member of the IQ motif class of calmodulin (CaM)-binding proteins, and interactions with CaM are its only known biological function. In this report we demonstrate that the binding affinity of Ng for CaM is weakened by Ca2+ but to a lesser extent (2–3-fold) than that previously suggested from qualitative observations. We also show that Ng induced a >10-fold decrease in the affinity of Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal domain of CaM with an associated increase in the Ca2+ dissociation rate. We also discovered a modest, but potentially important, increase in the cooperativity in Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe of CaM in the presence of Ng, thus sharpening the threshold for the C-domain to become Ca2+-saturated. Domain mapping using synthetic peptides indicated that the IQ motif of Ng is a poor mimetic of the intact protein and that the acidic sequence just N-terminal to the IQ motif plays an important role in reproducing Ng-mediated decreases in the Ca2+ binding affinity of CaM. Using NMR, full-length Ng was shown to make contacts largely with residues in the C-domain of CaM, although contacts were also detected in residues in the N-terminal domain. Together, our results can be consolidated into a model where Ng contacts residues in the N- and C-lobes of both apo- and Ca2+-bound CaM and that although Ca2+ binding weakens Ng interactions with CaM, the most dramatic biochemical effect is the impact of Ng on Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM.

During the rising phase of intracellular Ca2+, the N-domain would fill before the C-domain but would also be the first to release Ca2+ if not bound to targets. This leads to the idea that binding of Ca2+ to the C-domain is the rate-limiting step in the activation of CaM-target proteins that bind to Ca2+-saturated CaM (12Peersen O.B. Madsen T.S. Falke J.J.

Following the principle of detailed balance, when target proteins bind CaM, there is a reciprocal impact on the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. In this way the binding of target proteins can increase or decrease the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM and, if the target binds preferentially to the N- or C-domain, can selectively affect the Ca2+ sensitivity and or kinetics of the individual domains (11Gaertner T.R.

Quantifying the reciprocal interactions between Ca2+, CaM, and individual targets is, therefore, essential in understanding how CaM achieves target selectivity in the face of Ca2+ signals that fluctuate in frequency and amplitude. It is also plausible that intracellular mechanisms exist to minimize inappropriate activation of CaM in the face of basal or spontaneous fluctuations that routinely occur in intracellular Ca2+, thereby providing a proofreading mechanism for ensuring CaM activation only under appropriate signaling situations. In fact, there is a class of proteins whose only identified role appears to be to control the level and activation state of CaM (14Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N.

The best-characterized members of this class are Purkinje cell protein 4 (PEP-19), neuromodulin (Nm also called GAP-43), and neurogranin (Ng also called RC3). All three of these abundant proteins have similar CaM binding regions that fall into the IQ motif class, bind both apo- and Ca2+/CaM, and where evaluated, impact the kinetics and/or binding affinity of CaM for Ca2+ (11Gaertner T.R.

These properties make them uniquely suited to provide roles in “buffering” the levels of available CaM and to reduce the probability that CaM will become Ca2+-activated (supplying the proofreading function). Nm and Ng are further subject to protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of a specific Ser residue located in the middle of the CaM binding domain (23Baudier J. Deloulme J.C.

Phosphorylation significantly weakens the binding of CaM to these proteins, freeing CaM to interact with other CaM-dependent targets. These three IQ motif proteins are all highly expressed in nervous tissue but have distinct anatomical localizations. Nm is largely a presynaptic protein, enriched in nerve terminals responsible for neurotransmitter release and is found widespread across the nervous system (27Basi G.S. Jacobson R.D. Virág I.

PEP-19 and Ng are also found widespread in the nervous system but are largely postsynaptic and are rarely, if ever, found to be co-expressed in the same neuron (23Baudier J. Deloulme J.C.

This leads to the hypothesis that Ng and PEP-19 may serve analogous roles in the postsynaptic cell but that they might possess unique properties (like cross-talk with the PKC pathway) that permits cell type-specific tuning of their impact on the Ca2+/CaM signaling pathway. We focus in this report on a quantitative understanding of the biochemical properties of Ng and its interactions with CaM, and we contrast these findings with published information on the related protein PEP-19 (14Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. A new role for IQ motif proteins in regulating calmodulin function.J. Biol.

Intrinsically disordered PEP-19 confers unique dynamic properties to apo and calcium calmodulin.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 10287-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ng (∼7.8 kDa) and PEP-19 (∼6.8 kDa) are small intrinsically disordered proteins that both contain an IQ motif (34Kumar V. Chichili V.P. Zhong L. Tang X. Velazquez-Campoy A. Sheu F.S. Seetharaman J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 7455-7464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) preceded by an acidic region composed largely of Asp or Glu residues. The most significant sequence difference between these two proteins is in the region C-terminal to the IQ motif. The primary sequence of PEP-19 extends only 3 amino acids C-terminal to the IQ motif, whereas Ng has a 32-amino acid extension that is highly enriched in Gly and Pro residues. PEP-19 was previously shown to interact primarily with the C-terminal domain of CaM, and binding leads to a significant increase in both the Ca2+ association and dissociation rates from the C-terminal domain, with little impact on the overall Kd (14Putkey J.A. Kleerekoper Q. Gaertner T.R. Waxham M.N. A new role for IQ motif proteins in regulating calmodulin function.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49667-49670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effects of full-length PEP-19 on the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM could only be mimicked by a peptide that encompassed both the IQ motif and the adjacent acidic sequence, whereas a peptide representing the IQ motif had little effect on the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM (21Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. Gaertner T.R. Brewer K.J. Goldsmith M. Kubota Y. Kleerekoper Q.K. Acidic/IQ motif regulator of calmodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1401-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of the goals of the present study was to investigate whether the analogous IQ and acidic regions in Ng provide similar functions in modifying Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. In the present report we used NMR to identify contacts between apoCaM and Ca2+/CaM with Ng, a peptide representing its IQ motif, and a peptide representing the IQ motif peptide that includes the acidic region. These structural studies were complemented with an analysis of the binding affinity of Ng and Ng peptides for both apoCaM and Ca2+/CaM, along with a quantitative assessment of their impact on Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. These studies revealed that, similar to PEP-19, the IQ motif peptide does not serve as a good mimetic of the intact Ng protein. The IQ motif peptide of Ng increased the Ca2+ binding affinity of CaM by decreasing the Ca2+ dissociation rate, whereas intact Ng decreased Ca2+ binding affinity by increasing the Ca2+ dissociation rate. Interestingly, the IQ peptide with the acidic region could largely, but not completely mimic the effects of Ng on Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. For example, we found that there was a modest but reproducible increase in the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding to CaM in the presence of Ng, but this effect was not reproduced by either the IQ motif peptide or the IQ motif peptide that included the acidic sequence. The recently published crystal structure of the IQ motif peptide of Ng with Ca2+/CaM reveals that the peptide makes contacts exclusively with the C-terminal domain of CaM (34Kumar V. Chichili V.P. Zhong L. Tang X. Velazquez-Campoy A. Sheu F.S. Seetharaman J. Gerges N.Z. Sivaraman J. Structural basis for the interaction of unstructured neuron specific substrates neuromodulin and neurogranin with calmodulin.Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, our NMR results show that although Ng has extensive interactions with residues in the C-domain, it also makes significant contacts with the N-domain of CaM. Based on unique NMR signatures of the peptides versus the intact protein, we suggest that the C-terminal glycine-rich region of Ng likely makes contacts with the N-terminal domain of CaM. Together, our results can be consolidated into a model where Ng contacts residues in the N- and C-domains of both apo- and Ca2+-bound CaM. The binding affinity of Ng for CaM is weakened by Ca2+ consistent with previous results and supporting the hypotheses that Ng can serve to sequester (and concentrate) CaM in the basal state. In turn, CaM becomes available for target binding through Ca2+-dependent dissociation (36Gerendasy D.D. Herron S.R. Watson J.B. Sutcliffe J.G.

Sutcliffe J.G. RC3/neurogranin, a postsynaptic calpacitin for setting the response threshold to calcium influxes.Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 131-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrate a modest, but potentially important, increase in the cooperativity in Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe of CaM in the presence of Ng, sharpening the threshold for the C-domain to become Ca2+ saturated. Finally, we show that Ng greatly decreases the affinity of Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of C-domain of CaM and that an acidic sequence just N-terminal to the IQ domain is essential for Ng ability to modulate Ca2+ binding to CaM. These results reinforce that Ng plays a critical role in controlling the Ca2+/CaM signaling pathway and, when the Ca2+-buffering capacity of CaM is considered, also plays a role in establishing free Ca2+ levels inside cells (4Kubota Y. Putkey J.A. Shouval H.Z. Waxham M.N. IQ-motif proteins influence intracellular free Ca2+ in hippocampal neurons through their interactions with calmodulin.J.

Given these properties, it is not surprising that Ng has been documented as a key molecule regulating the induction of Ca2+-dependent plasticity (38Zhong L. Gerges N.Z.

Circulating mononuclear cells isolated from diabetic (n = 69) and nondiabetic (n = 46) individuals were used to grow endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC), early endothelial progenitor cells (eEPCs) and isolate CD34+ cells. ECFCs and eEPCs were established from only 15% of the diabetic individuals tested thus directing our main effort toward examination of CD34+ cells. CD34+ cells were plated in basal medium to obtain cell-free conditioned medium (CM). In CM derived from CD34+ cells of diabetic individuals (diabetic-CM), the levels of stem cell factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and thrombopoietin were lower, and IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) levels were higher than CM derived from nondiabetic individuals (nondiabetic-CM). Hypoxia did not upregulate HIF1α in CD34+ cells of diabetic origin. Migration and proliferation of nondiabetic CD34+ cells toward diabetic-CM were lower compared to nondiabetic-CM. Attenuation of pressure-induced constriction, potentiation of bradykinin relaxation, and generation of cGMP and cAMP in arterioles were observed with nondiabetic-CM, but not with diabetic-CM. Diabetic-CM failed to induce endothelial tube formation from vascular tissue. These results suggest that diabetic subjects with microvascular complications exhibit severely limited capacity to generate ex-vivo expanded endothelial progenitor populations and that the vasoreparative dysfunction observed in diabetic CD34+ cells is due to impaired autocrine/paracrine function and reduced sensitivity to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2052504307,"Adducin is a protein organizing the cortical actin cytoskeleton and a target of RhoA and PKC signaling. However, the role for intercellular cohesion is unknown. We found that adducin silencing induced disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, reduced intercellular adhesion of human keratinocytes, and decreased the levels of the desmosomal adhesion molecule desmoglein (Dsg)3 by reducing its membrane incorporation. Because loss of cell cohesion and Dsg3 depletion is observed in the autoantibody-mediated blistering skin disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV), we applied antibody fractions of PV patients. A rapid phosphorylation of adducin at serine 726 was detected in response to these autoantibodies. To mechanistically link autoantibody binding and adducin phosphorylation, we evaluated the role of several disease-relevant signaling molecules. Adducin phosphorylation at serine 726 was dependent on Ca(2+) influx and PKC but occurred independent of p38 MAPK and PKA. Adducin phosphorylation is protective, because phosphorylation-deficient mutants resulted in loss of cell cohesion and Dsg3 fragmentation. Thus, PKC elicits both positive and negative effects on cell adhesion, since its contribution to cell dissociation in pemphigus is well established. We additionally evaluated the effect of RhoA on adducin phosphorylation because RhoA activation was shown to block pemphigus autoantibody-induced cell dissociation. Our data demonstrate that the protective effect of RhoA activation was dependent on the presence of adducin and its phosphorylation at serine 726. These experiments provide novel mechanisms for regulation of desmosomal adhesion by RhoA- and PKC-mediated adducin phosphorylation in keratinocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2135100602,"WNT1 encodes a multifunctional signaling glycoprotein that is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. Patients with Wnt1-positive cancer are usually related to advanced metastasis. Here, we found that a stretch of G-rich sequences located at the WNT1 promoter region is capable of forming G-quadruplex structures. The addition of G-quadruplex structure stabilizers, BMVC and BMVC4, raises the melting temperature of the oligonucleotide formed by the WNT1 promoter G-rich sequences. Significantly, the expression of WNT1 was repressed by BMVC or BMVC4 in a G-quadruplex-dependent manner, suggesting that they can be used to modulate WNT1 expression. The role of G-quadruplex stabilizers on Wnt1-mediated cancer migration and invasion was further analyzed. The protein levels of β-catenin, a mediator of the Wnt-mediated signaling pathway, and the downstream targets MMP7 and survivin were down-regulated upon BMVC or BMVC4 treatments. Moreover, the migration and invasion activities of cancer cells were inhibited by BMVC and BMVC4, and the inhibitory effects can be reversed by WNT1-overexpression. Thus the Wnt1 expression and its downstream signaling pathways can be regulated through the G-quadruplex sequences located at its promoter region. These findings provide a novel approach for future drug development to inhibit migration and invasion of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039207244,"Chikungunya virus-like particles (VLPs) have potential to be used as a prophylactic vaccine based on testing in multiple animal models and are currently being evaluated for human use in a Phase I clinical trial. The current method for producing these enveloped alphavirus VLPs by transient gene expression in mammalian cells presents challenges for scalable and robust industrial manufacturing, so the insect cell baculovirus expression vector system was evaluated as an alternative expression technology. Subsequent to recombinant baculovirus infection of Sf21 cells in standard culture media (pH 6.2-6.4), properly processed Chikungunya structural proteins were detected and assembled capsids were observed. However, an increase in culture pH to 6.6-6.8 was necessary to produce detectable concentrations of assembled VLPs. Since this elevated production pH exceeds the optimum for growth medium stability and Sf21 culture, medium modifications were made and a novel insect cell variant (SfBasic) was derived by exposure of Sf21 to elevated culture pH for a prolonged period of time. The high-pH adapted SfBasic insect cell line described herein is capable of maintaining normal cell growth into the typical mammalian cell culture pH range of 7.0-7.2 and produces 11-fold higher Chikungunya VLP yields relative to the parental Sf21 cell line. After scale-up into stirred tank bioreactors, SfBasic derived VLPs were chromatographically purified and shown to be similar in size and structure to a VLP standard derived from transient gene expression in HEK293 cells. Total serum anti-Chikungunya IgG and neutralizing titers from guinea pigs vaccinated with SfBasic derived VLPs or HEK293 derived VLPs were not significantly different with respect to production method, suggesting that this adapted insect cell line and production process could be useful for manufacturing Chikungunya VLPs for use as a vaccine. The adaptation of Sf21 to produce high levels of recombinant protein and VLPs in an elevated pH range may also have applications for other pH-sensitive protein or VLP targets."
https://openalex.org/W2042886356,"The activation of endothelial cells (ECs) by monomeric C-reactive protein (mCRP) has been implicated in contributing to atherogenesis. However, the potent proinflammatory actions of mCRP on ECs in vitro appear to be incompatible with the atheroprotective effects of mCRP in a mouse model. Because mCRP is primarily generated within inflamed tissues and is rapidly cleared from the circulation, we tested whether these discrepancies can be explained by topological differences in response to mCRP within blood vessels. In a Transwell culture model, the addition of mCRP to apical (luminal), but not basolateral (abluminal), surfaces of intact human coronary artery EC monolayers evoked a significant up-regulation of MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-6. Such polarized stimulation of mCRP was observed consistently regardless of EC type or experimental conditions (e.g. culture of ECs on filters or extracellular matrix-coated surfaces). Accordingly, we detected enriched lipid raft microdomains, the major surface sensors for mCRP on ECs, in apical membranes, leading to the preferential apical binding of mCRP and activation of ECs through the polarized induction of the phospholipase C, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Furthermore, LPS and IL-1β induction of EC activation also exhibited topological dependence, whereas TNF-α did not. Together, these results indicate that tissue-associated mCRP likely contributes little to EC activation. Hence, topological localization is an important, but often overlooked, factor that determines the contribution of mCRP and other proinflammatory mediators to chronic vascular inflammation."

The most likely candidate gene in this region leading to the predisposition for dissection is MYH11, which encodes smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC). The effects of increased expression of MYH11 on smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes were explored using mouse aortic SMCs with transgenic overexpression of one isoform of SM-MHC. We found that these cells show increased expression of Myh11 and myosin filament-associated contractile genes at the message level when compared with control SMCs, but not at the protein level due to increased protein degradation. Increased expression of Myh11 resulted in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in SMCs, which led to a paradoxical decrease of protein levels through increased autophagic degradation. An additional consequence of ER stress in SMCs was increased intracellular calcium ion concentration, resulting in increased contractile signaling and contraction. The increased signals for contraction further promote transcription of contractile genes, leading to a feedback loop of metabolic abnormalities in these SMCs.

Although the size of the duplication can vary, nine genes are commonly duplicated in all TAAD patients, including MYH11. This gene encodes the smooth muscle (SM)-specific myosin heavy chain (MHC) and is the most likely candidate gene for the predisposition to TAAD associated with the 16p13.1 duplication because heterozygous mutations in MYH11 cause a dominantly inherited predisposition to TAAD (4Zhu L.

Myosin heavy chain molecules require a specific molecular chaperone to ensure proper protein folding. Folding of myosin is critical as monomers of myosin interact with each other as well as the regulatory and essential light chains to form first hexamers containing two of each molecule, and then filaments. Increased expression of myosin heavy chain due to three copies of the gene could reduce access of individual myosin molecules to the required chaperone protein, potentially resulting in misfolded monomers that could disrupt proper myosin filament formation. Unc45 is a myosin heavy chain-specific chaperone that was first described in the nematode Caenhorabditis elegans (6Barral J.M. Hutagalung A.H. Brinker A. Hartl F.U. Epstein H.F. Role of the myosin assembly protein UNC-45 as a molecular chaperone for myosin.Science. 2002; 295: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mammals have two Unc45 genes, encoding two distinct isoforms of the chaperone called Unc45a and Unc45b (7Price M.G. Landsverk M.L. Barral J.M. Epstein H.F. Two mammalian UNC-45 isoforms are related to distinct cytoskeletal and muscle-specific functions.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4013-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unc45b is specifically expressed in striated muscle and acts as the chaperone for cardiac and skeletal muscle myosins. Unc45a is ubiquitously expressed, and is the canonical chaperone for nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosins. Early work performed on this chaperone in the C. elegans model indicates that the ratio of myosin heavy chain protein levels to Unc45 is critical for proper muscle function. Worms either over- or underexpressing Unc45 show accelerated degradation of myosin heavy chains via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, supporting the hypothesis that the correct ratio between myosin heavy chain and its chaperone is important for stable myosin filament formation (8Landsverk M.L. Li S. Hutagalung A.H. Najafov A. Hoppe T. Barral J.M. Epstein H.F. The UNC-45 chaperone mediates sarcomere assembly through myosin degradation in Caenorhabditis elegans.J.

Both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy have also been implicated in degradation of contractile proteins in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells during muscular atrophy (9Bhatnagar S. Mittal A. Gupta S.K. Kumar A. TWEAK causes myotube atrophy through coordinated activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, and caspases.J. Cell.

However, thus far no studies have examined turnover of contractile proteins in mammalian smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Unlike striated muscle cells, SMCs are not terminally differentiated and can de-differentiate and decrease cellular contractile protein levels in response to environmental cues, such as platelet-derived growth factor. Due to the more dynamic nature of SMC contractile structures compared with those in cardiac or skeletal muscle cells, the pathways leading to degradation in SMCs may differ from other muscle cells. The MYH11 gene encodes four distinct transcripts leading to four isoforms of the SM-MHC protein, two of which are expressed in the aorta (12Babu G.J. Warshaw D.M. Periasamy M. Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms and their role in muscle physiology.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transgenic mouse models overexpressing each of those two isoforms were previously generated and characterized. Despite evidence of successful transgene expression using a tag on the myosin protein, neither transgenic expression of SM1 nor SM2 altered the ratio between the two isoforms in aortic tissue (13Martin A.F. Bhatti S. Pyne-Geithman G.J. Farjah M. Manaves V. Walker L. Franks R. Strauch A.R. Paul R.J. Expression and function of COOH-terminal myosin heavy chain isoforms in mouse smooth muscle.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C238-C245Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results suggest that overexpression of myosin leads to selective degradation that normalizes the total amount and isoform ratio of myosin in the cell. In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of the SM1 isoform of Myh11 in SMCs leads to autophagic turnover of contractile proteins. Surprisingly, autophagy in these cells is not associated with decreased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, but rather is driven by signaling downstream of the unfolded protein response. To isolate primary mouse aortic SMCs, the thoracic descending aorta from the left subclavian branch to the diaphragm was removed under sterile conditions from nontransgenic (NTG) and transgenic (SM1) mice. Cells were explanted and maintained as previously described (14Cao J. Gong L. Guo D.C. Mietzsch U. Kuang S.Q. Kwartler C.S. Safi H. Estrera A. Gambello M.J. Milewicz D.M. Thoracic aortic disease in tuberous sclerosis complex: molecular pathogenesis and potential therapies in Tsc2+/− mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 1908-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The identity of these cells as SMCs was verified by mRNA expression of Myh11 and staining for smooth muscle α-actin (mouse monoclonal antibody; Sigma) at each passage (95% of cells stained positive for smooth muscle α-actin). All studies were performed on SMCs at passage 4 or earlier. For all experiments, cells were serum starved in 1% FBS for 24 h prior to the start of the experiment. Where indicated, cell cultures were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma), bortezomib (Selleck Chemicals), bafilomycin (Sigma), and 4-phenylbutyric acid (Sigma). Frozen aortic tissue sections from patients or cultured cells were homogenized and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein (5 μg) for each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with antibodies. Immunoblots were quantitated with ImageJ. After reaching confluence, cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-well plates with the density of 13.15 cells/mm2 for 24 h prior to serum starvation. After 24 h of culture in serum-free SMC medium, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β1 for 72 h. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (15Guo D.C. Pannu H. Tran-Fadulu V.

Genet. 2007; 39: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). All analyses of immunofluorescent images were performed using the Nikon NIS Elements software. Individual focal adhesion size was calculated for at least 30 adhesions per cell on at least 10 cells per genotype. For MRTF-A analysis, green fluorescent intensity was calculated for nuclear areas (as defined by DAPI staining) compared with cytoplasmic areas. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue sections or cultured SMCs and measured by two-step quantitative RT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate. GAPDH was used as the endogenous control. Confluent cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes (100,000 cells per dish) and allowed to attach overnight. Media was changed to 1% serum containing medium for 24 h before being switched to pulse media (1% serum containing media plus 0.1 μCi/ml of 14C-labeled phenylalanine). At specified time points throughout the pulse period, media was removed, and cells were lysed in 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and stored at 4 °C until the end of the experiment. At the end of the pulse period (48 h), the media was changed on the remaining plates to chase media (1% serum containing media plus excess unlabeled phenylalanine, 2 mm). At specified time points during the chase period, a 500-μl aliquot of media was removed and combined with 500 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. These aliquots were also stored at 4 °C until the end of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, all lysates were combined with scintillation fluid and analyzed on a 1900TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instruments). Protein synthesis rates were calculated using the incorporation of 14C into cellular protein over the pulse period, whereas protein degradation rates were calculated using the rate of 14C release into the media over the chase period. Cells were seeded and serum starved as for other immunofluorescence protocols, then treated with 1% serum containing media supplemented with 1 μl/ml (8 μg/ml) of Polybrene and viral titers at a multiplicity of infection of 5, determined through initial dose-dependent experiments, with or without 4-phenyl butyric acid (1 mg/ml). After 72 h of incubation with the virus, cells were fixed in 4%, and coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting media with a DAPI counterstain. Cells were separated into 250,000 cell aliquots and seeded within a matrix of type I collagen from rat tail (BD Biosciences). The collagen mixture was prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml of collagen. Gels were allowed to polymerize at room temperature for at least 1 h, then immediately treated with 1% serum containing media with or without the addition of Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (Calbiolchem) or myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-7 (Calbiolchem). Gels were allowed to incubate for 5 days to accumulate tension, and then released from attachment to the cell culture plastic to induce contraction. Gels were photographed 10 min after release, and measurements were performed using ImageJ software. Cells were seeded onto 15-mm coverslips at a density of 5,000 cells per coverslip and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then incubated in 1% serum media with or without the addition of 1 mg/ml of 4-phenylbutyric acid for 24 h. Coverslips were pre-treated with 4 μm Fura-2AM (Teflabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with standard extracellular buffer (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl2 (pH 7.4 with NaOH) and then transferred to calcium-free buffer (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 0.2 EGTA (pH 7.4 with NaOH), at room temperature for the remainder of the experiment. Coverslips were mounted for viewing on a Nikon TE200 microscope, and imaging was performed with Incytim2 software (Intracellular Imaging, Inc.). Measurements were taken using excitation wavelengths of 343/380 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. Baseline measurements were taken for 1 min, followed by treatment with 1 μm thapsigargin. Measurements of cytoplasmic calcium continued for 6 min to allow maximum endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release from slow responding cells. RhoA and Rac1 activation were quantified using G-LISA (Cytoskeleton) performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, cells were serum-starved in 1% FBS for 24 h, then treated with or without lypophosphatidic acid (Sigma) for 15 min. Cells were lysed in the provided lysis buffer and lysates were snap frozen. Protein (0.5 μg) was loaded per well of the provided ELISA plate, and activated Rac1 and RhoA were quantified by ELISA. Polymerization of actin was assayed using an F/G-actin assay (Cytoskeleton) performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, after serum starvation cells were lysed and homogenized in the provided lysis buffer. Samples were pelleted in an ultracentrifuge (Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge, Rotor TLA-110, Beckman Coulter) at 55,000 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C. Pellets and supernatant fractions were separately processed and processed by SDS-PAGE for subsequent immunoblot analysis. Each experiment included in this article was performed at least four independent times. For quantitative PCR, data from three replicates generated from one set of experiments are included in the figures. For all other quantitative experiments, including densitometry quantitation of immunoblot results, pooled data across all replicates is shown. Where applicable, statistical analysis comparing two groups was performed by Student's t test, and analysis comparing four groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant, and are denoted with asterisks (*) in the figures. Time courses shown in Fig. 1, G and H, were analyzed by linear regression analysis, and the p values are reported in the text. All other time courses were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. SMCs were explanted from the thoracic descending aorta of NTG and SM1 transgenic mice to assess the effects of smooth muscle myosin overexpression on SMC phenotype. Initial characterization of the transgenic SM1 mouse SMCs (termed SM1) revealed a significant increase in mRNA expression of MYH11 relative to nontransgenic cells. Surprisingly, there was a similar increase in the expression of other contractile genes (Acta2 and Cnn1) (Fig. 1A). However, there was no concomitant increase in SM-MHC, SM-actin, or calponin cellular protein levels (Fig. 1B). These results suggested either decreased translation or increased degradation of these contractile proteins. A specific chaperone called Unc45a helps to fold the smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain isoforms. In SM1 cells, mRNA expression of Unc45a was significantly decreased compared with control cells, and protein accumulation also appears lower (Fig. 1, C and D). However, expression of Unc45b mRNA, typically seen only in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, was increased compared with expression in NTG cells (Fig. 1C). Unfortunately, an Unc45b-specific antibody is not available so we were unable to assess levels of Unc45b protein in the cells. The increased expression of contractile genes at the message level but not the protein level suggested increased protein turnover. Cycloheximide, a protein translation inhibitor that is well tolerated by SMCs and does not cause cell death (17Croons V. Martinet W. Herman A.G. Timmermans J.P. De Meyer G.R.

In NTG cells, the contractile proteins remain highly stable for up to 48 h of exposure to cycloheximide (Fig. 1, E and F), which is consistent with the previously reported extended half-lives of contractile proteins in muscle cells (19Martin A.F. Rabinowitz M. Blough R. Prior G. Zak R. Measurements of half-life of rat cardiac myosin heavy chain with leucyl-tRNA used as precursor pool.J. Biol.

However, in SM1 SMCs, the levels of several contractile proteins including SM-MHC, calponin, myosin light chain (MLC), and SM22 begin to decay significantly as early as 12 h after exposure to cyclohexamide (Fig. 1, E and F). However, SM-actin was not similarly degraded in the SM1 cells (no significant p values). Because cycloheximide can also disrupt protein translation, increased protein degradation in the SM1 SMCs was confirmed using a pulse-chase assay to assess global total protein synthesis and degradation. Labeled [14C]phenylalanine, which is readily incorporated into cellular proteins and not metabolized by muscle (21Katsanos C.S. Chinkes D.L. Sheffield-Moore M. Aarsland A. Kobayashi H. Wolfe R.R.

Metab. 2005; 289: E1064-E1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was introduced into the culture media. Protein synthesis was assessed by the accumulation of 14C in the cellular protein lysates, whereas protein degradation was assessed by the release of 14C into the media during the chase period (16Baskin K.K. Taegtmeyer H. AMP-activated protein kinase regulates E3 ligases in rodent heart.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There was increased protein synthesis (p = 0.007) and degradation (p < 0.001) in SM1 cells when compared with the NTG cells, thus supporting the conclusion that contractile protein turnover was significantly increased in SM1 cells (Fig. 1, G and H). To assess the contribution of the proteasome to contractile protein turnover in SM1 cells, SM1 and NTG SMCs were treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Treatment with bortezomib did not lead to increased accumulation of contractile proteins in SM1 SMCs (Fig. 2, A and B). To confirm that the unchanged protein levels were due to changes in protein degradation rather than changes in mRNA expression, we assessed gene expression of contractile genes during bortezomib treatment. Six hours after the initiation of bortezomib treatment, expression of Acta2, Cnn1, and Myh11 all decreased significantly in NTG cells (Fig. 2C). Despite this decrease in expression, there was no significant change in the protein level of SM-MHC, SM-actin, or calponin (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the proteasome may be responsible for regulating contractile protein turnover in NTG cells. By contrast, in SM1 cells expression of contractile genes actually increased at early time points of bortezomib treatment, and expression of Myh11 and Cnn1 did not decrease for up to 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the lack of increase in protein levels suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is not responsible for degrading contractile proteins in SM1 cells. We next assessed whether autophagy was responsible for the degradation of contractile proteins in SM1 cells by using treatment with bafilomycin to block autophagy. Unlike the results with bortezomib, bafilomycin lead to a significant accumulation of contractile proteins in SM1 SMCs over 48 h of treatment, but not in NTG SMCs, supporting the notion that autophagy is involved in the degradation of these proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). As with cycloheximide, SM-actin was an exception to the trend of increased contractile protein levels after bafilomycin treatment in SM1 SMCs (no significant difference, p > 0.05). The corresponding transcript levels for Myh11 and Cnn1 significantly decreased by 12 h after initiation of treatment with the lysosomal inhibitors in both genotypes, indicating that stabilization of the protein levels was not due to increased transcript levels (Fig. 3C). To further assess whether autophagy is increased in SM1 cells, we performed immunoblot analysis to determine whether the LC3 II to LC3 I ratio, a marker of autophagic activity, was increased. The LC3 II to LC3 I ratio was significantly increased in SM1 compared with NTG cells (p = 0.015) (Fig. 3D). Likewise, p62 levels (decreased levels are associated with increased rates of autophagy) were lower in the SM1 SMCs than in NTG cells, suggesting increased autophagy in the transgenic SMCs (Fig. 3D) (22Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Pankiv S. Øvervatn A. Brech A. Johansen T. Monitoring autophagic degradation of p62/SQSTM1.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Last, we used an RFP-GFP-LC3 expressing lentivirus to assess autophagic flux in the cells. At early stages of autophagy, LC3 is tagged with both RFP and GFP. During initial autophagosome formation, LC3 staining becomes punctate and the dots appear yellow. As the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to form an autolysosome, the pH of the compartment decreases and GFP is destabilized, leaving only RFP expression, changing the LC3 fluorescence to red (23Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar). Based on quantitation of yellow and red puncta in fixed cells, SM1 cells have significantly more autophagosomes and autolysosomes than NTG cells, suggesting an increase in autophagic flux in the SM1 SMCs (Fig. 3E). We sought to identify the cellular signaling pathway driving increased autophagy in the SM1 cells. The canonical signaling pathway leading to increased autophagy is decreased mTOR signaling (24Jung C.H. Ro S.H. Cao J. Otto N.M. Kim D.H. mTOR regulation of autophagy.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Current data indicate that AMP-associated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR are the primary regulators of autophagy initiation, with AMPK activating the process and mTOR inhibiting it (25Egan D. Kim J. Shaw R.J. Guan K.L. The autophagy initiating kinase ULK1 is regulated via opposing phosphorylation by AMPK and mTOR.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 643-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). AMPK and mTOR play opposing roles in regulating cellular metabolism, and AMPK can directly inhibit mTOR activation during cellular stress (26Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. TSC2 mediates cellular energy response to control cell growth and survival.Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal conditions, when nutrient levels are high, AMPK is not activated, and mTOR remains active to drive protein synthesis. Under conditions of starvation or cellular stress, AMPK is activated, mTOR gets turned off, protein synthesis decreases, and autophagy increases in an effort to conserve energy. There is a moderate increase in SM1 cells in phosphorylation of ACC, the downstream target of AMPK (Fig. 4A). However, SM1 cells also exhibit increased rates of protein synthesis. Markers of increased mTOR signaling, phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and its downstream target the ribosomal protein S6, were increased in SM1 cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, increased autophagy in the SM1 cells was not due to decreased mTOR signaling. Another cellular process linked with autophagy is the induction of ER stress pathways (27Ciechomska I.A. Gabrusiewicz K. Szczepankiewicz A.A. Kaminska B.

Venom peptide toxins have been used extensively to characterize ion channels in the nervous system and platelet aggregation in haemostatic systems. A significant hurdle in characterizing disulfide-rich peptide toxins from venomous animals is obtaining significant quantities needed for sequence and structural analyses. Presented here is a strategy for the structural characterization of venom peptide toxins from sample limited (4 ng) specimens via direct mass spectrometry sequencing, chemical synthesis and NMR structure elucidation. Using this integrated approach, venom peptide Tv1 from Terebra variegata was discovered. Tv1 displays a unique fold not witnessed in prior snail neuropeptides. The novel structural features found for Tv1 suggest that the terebrid pool of peptide toxins may target different neuronal agents with varying specificities compared to previously characterized snail neuropeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1977226910,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease of progressively increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, associated with mutations of the type 2 receptor for the BMP pathway, BMPR2. The canonical signaling pathway for BMPR2 is through the SMAD family of transcription factors. BMPR2 is expressed in every cell type, but the impact of BMPR2 mutations affecting SMAD signaling, such as Bmpr2delx4+, had only previously been investigated in smooth muscle and endothelium. In the present study, we created a mouse with universal doxycycline-inducible expression of Bmpr2delx4+ in order to determine if broader expression had an impact relevant to the development of PAH. We found that the most obvious phenotype was a dramatic, but patchy, increase in pulmonary inflammation. We crossed these double transgenic mice onto an NF-κB reporter strain, and by luciferase assays on live mice, individual organs and isolated macrophages, we narrowed down the origin of the inflammatory phenotype to constitutive activation of tissue macrophages. Study of bone marrow-derived macrophages from mutant and wild-type mice suggested a baseline difference in differentiation state in Bmpr2 mutants. When activated with LPS, both mutant and wild-type macrophages secrete BMP pathway inhibitors sufficient to suppress BMP pathway activity in smooth muscle cells (SMC) treated with conditioned media. Functionally, co-culture with macrophages results in a BMP signaling-dependent increase in scratch closure in cultured SMC. We conclude that SMAD signaling through BMP is responsible, in part, for preventing macrophage activation in both live animals and in cells in culture, and that activated macrophages secrete BMP inhibitors in sufficient quantity to cause paracrine effect on vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2046475975,"Small-molecule, ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors are generally thought to be rapidly desensitized within a period of minutes through receptor phosphorylation and internalization after repeated or prolonged stimulation. This transient G protein-coupled receptor activation remains at odds with many observed long-lasting cellular and physiological responses. Here, using live cell imaging of cAMP with a FRET-based biosensor and myocyte contraction assay, we show that the catecholamine-activated β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR) continuously stimulates second messenger cAMP synthesis in primary cardiac myocytes and neurons, which lasts for more than 8 h (a decay t½ of 3.9 h) in cardiac myocytes. However, the β1AR-induced cAMP signal is counterbalanced and masked by the receptor-bound phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D8-dependent cAMP hydrolysis. Inhibition of PDE4 activity recovers the receptor-induced cAMP signal and promotes contractile response in mouse hearts during extended periods of agonist stimulation. β1AR associates with PDE4D8 through the receptor C-terminal PDZ motif-dependent binding to synaptic-associated protein 97 (SAP97). Knockdown of SAP97 or mutation of the β1AR PDZ motif disrupts the complex and promotes sustained agonist-induced cAMP activity, PKA phosphorylation, and cardiac myocyte contraction response. Together, these findings unveil a long lasting adrenergic signal in neurons and myocytes under prolonged stimulation and an underappreciated role of PDE that is essential in classic receptor signaling desensitization and in maintaining a long lasting cAMP equilibrium for ligand-induced physiological response."
https://openalex.org/W2058739341,"Trehalases hydrolyze the non-reducing disaccharide trehalose amassed by cells as a universal protectant and storage carbohydrate. Recently, it has been shown that the activity of neutral trehalase Nth1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by the 14-3-3 protein binding that modulates the structure of both the catalytic domain and the region containing the EF-hand-like motif, whose role in the activation of Nth1 is unclear. In this work, the structure of the Nth1·14-3-3 complex and the importance of the EF-hand-like motif were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry, chemical cross-linking, and small angle x-ray scattering. The low resolution structural views of Nth1 alone and the Nth1·14-3-3 complex show that the 14-3-3 protein binding induces a significant structural rearrangement of the whole Nth1 molecule. The EF-hand-like motif-containing region forms a separate domain that interacts with both the 14-3-3 protein and the catalytic trehalase domain. The structural integrity of the EF-hand like motif is essential for the 14-3-3 protein-mediated activation of Nth1, and calcium binding, although not required for the activation, facilitates this process by affecting its structure. Our data suggest that the EF-hand like motif-containing domain functions as the intermediary through which the 14-3-3 protein modulates the function of the catalytic domain of Nth1."
https://openalex.org/W2043416269,"Background Trichoderma brevicompactum is the Trichoderma species producing simple trichothecenes-trichodermin, a potential antifungal antibiotic and a protein synthesis inhibitor. However, the biosynthetic pathway of trichodermin in Trichoderma is not completely clarified. Therefore, transcriptome and gene expression profiling data for this species are needed as an important resource to better understand the mechanism of the trichodermin biosynthesis and provide a blueprint for further study of T. brevicompactum. Results In this study, de novo assembly of the T. brevicompactum transcriptome using the short-read sequencing technology (Illumina) was performed. In addition, two digital gene expression (DGE) libraries of T. brevicompactum under the trichodermin-producing and trichodermin-nonproducing culture conditions, respectively, were constructed to identify the differences in gene expression. A total of 23,351 unique transcripts with a mean length of 856 bp were obtained by a new Trinity de novo assembler. The variations of the gene expression under different culture conditions were also identified. The expression profiling data revealed that 3,282 unique transcripts had a significantly differential expression under the trichodermin-producing condition, as compared to the trichodermin-nonproducing condition. This study provides a large amount of transcript sequence data that will contribute to the study of the trichodermin biosynthesis in T. brevicompactum. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was found to be useful to confirm the differential expression of the unique transcripts. Conclusion Our study provides considerable gene expression information of T. brevicompactum at the transcriptional level,which will help accelerate the research on the trichodermin biosynthesis. Additionally, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using the Illumina sequencing based DGE system for gene expression profiling, and have shed new light on functional studies of the genes involved in T. brevicompactum biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1969133751,"It has been hypothesized that a single mutation at a highly conserved amino acid site (HCS) can be severely deleterious to HIV in most if not all isolate-specific genetic backgrounds. Consequently, potentially universal HIV-1 vaccines exclusively targeting highly conserved regions of the viral proteome have been proposed. To test this hypothesis, we examined the impact of 10 Gag-p24 and 9 Env-gp120 HCS single mutations on viral fitness. In the original founder sequence of the subject in whom these mutations were identified, all Gag-p24 HCS mutations significantly reduced viral replication fitness, including 7 that were lethal. Similar results were obtained at 9/10 sites when the same mutations were introduced into the founder sequences of two epidemiologically unlinked subjects. In contrast, none of the 9 Env-gp120 HCS mutations were lethal in the original founder sequence, and four had no fitness cost. Hence, HCS mutations in Gag-p24 are likely to be severely deleterious in different HIV-1 subtype B backgrounds; however, some HCS mutations in both Gag-p24 and Env-gp120 fragments can be well tolerated. Therefore, when designing HIV-1 immunogens that are intended to force the virus to nonviable escape pathways, the fitness constraints on the HIV segments included should be considered beyond their conservation level."
https://openalex.org/W2005845695,"The mechanisms that control phasic and tonic contractions of lymphatic vessels are poorly understood. We hypothesized that rho kinase ROCK, previously shown to increase calcium (Ca2+) sensitivity in vascular smooth muscle, enhances lymphatic contractile activity in a similar fashion. Contractions of isolated rat mesenteric lymphatic vessels were observed at a luminal pressure of 2 cm H2O in a 37°C bath. The expression of ROCK in isolated rat mesenteric lymphatic vessels was assessed by Western blotting and confocal microscopy. The role of ROCK in contractile function was tested using two specific yet structurally distinct inhibitors: H1152 (0.1–10 μM) and Y-27632 (0.5–50 μM). In addition, lymphatics were transfected with constitutively active (ca)-ROCK protein (2 μg/ml) to assess gain of contractile function. Vessel diameter and the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were simultaneously measured in a subset of isolated lymphatics loaded with the Ca2+-sensing dye fura-2. The results show expression of both the ROCK1 and ROCK2 isoforms in lymphatic vessels. Inhibition of ROCK increased lymphatic end diastolic diameter and end systolic diameter in a concentration-dependent manner. Significant reductions in lymphatic tone and contraction amplitude were observed after treatment 1–10 μM H1152 or 25–50 μM Y-27632. H1152 (10 μM) also significantly reduced contraction frequency. Transient increases in [Ca2+]i preceded each phasic contraction, however this pattern was disrupted by either 10 μM H1152 or 50 μM Y-27632 in the majority of lymphatics studied. The significant decrease in tone caused by H1152 or Y-27632 was not associated with a significant change in the basal [Ca2+]i between transients. Transfection with ca-ROCK protein enhanced lymphatic tone, but was not associated with a significant change in basal [Ca2+]i. Our data suggest that ROCK mediates normal tonic constriction and influences phasic contractions in lymphatics. We propose that ROCK modulates Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile proteins in lymphatics."

In contrast, the overexpression of Rad51, which works conjointly with Rad52 in canonical homologous recombination, failed to suppress the growth defect of the dna2-K1080E mutation, indicating that Rad52 plays a unique and distinct role in Okazaki fragment metabolism. We found that the recombination-defective Rad52-QDDD/AAAA mutant did not rescue dna2-K1080E, suggesting that Rad52-mediated recombination is important for suppression.

The most sensitive species, the mussel, was affected to the same extent as in previous single species studies, while the effects on the amphipod and alga were smaller or even positive compared to experiments performed in less complex test systems. The observed cascade of beneficial effects was a result of inter-specific species interactions that buffered for more severe effects. The poor condition of the mussel led to a feeding shift from alga to mussel by the amphipods. The better food quality, due to the dietary shift, counteracted the effects of the exposure. Less amphipod grazing, together with increased levels of nutrients in the water was favourable for the alga, despite the negative effects of propranolol. This microcosm study showed effects on organisms on different organizational levels as well as interactions among the different components resulting in indirect exposure effects of both functional and structural nature. The combination of both direct and indirect effects would not have been detected using simpler single- or even two-species study designs. The observed structural changes would in the natural environment have a long-term influence on ecosystem function, especially in a low-biodiversity ecosystem like the Baltic Sea."

The abdominal aortas of thirty-six male New Zealand rabbits were damaged by balloon expansion and the animals were then fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks. Twenty-seven plaques on the near aortic wall were detected using conventional ultrasound examination. The maximum thickness of each plaque was recorded. CEUS was performed on these 27 plaques and the time-intensity curves (TICs) were analyzed offline. Using the quantitative ACQ software, features such as the arrival time (AT), time to peak (TTP), baseline intensity (BI), peak intensity (PI) and enhanced intensity (EI) (EI = PI-BI) were assessed. Inter- and intra-observer agreement of EI were assessed using the Bland-Altman test. After CEUS examination, the rabbits were sacrificed for pathological examination and CD34 monoclonal antibody immunohistochemical detection. Microvessel density (MVD) was counted under the microscope. The relationship between indexes of CEUS and the level of MVD was analyzed. There was a good positive linear correlation between EI and MVD (γ = 0. 854, P<0. 001), the intraclass correlations for inter- and intra-observer agreement for EI were 0.73 and 0.82 respectively, suggesting that EI may be act as a useful index for plaque risk stratification in animal models."

Physical therapy (PT) is one of the supportive therapies available for DMD, however, motor PT approaches have controversial recommendations and there is no consensus regarding the type and intensity of physical therapy. In this study we investigated the effect of physical therapy on gait biomechanics and muscular collagen deposition types I and III in dystrophin-deficient dogs. Two dystrophic dogs (treated dogs-TD) underwent a PT protocol of active walking exercise, 3×/week, 40 minutes/day, 12 weeks. Two dystrophic control dogs (CD) maintained their routine of activities of daily living. At t0 (pre) and t1 (post-physical therapy), collagen type I and III were assessed by immunohistochemistry and gait biomechanics were analyzed. Angular displacement of shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle and tarsal joint and vertical (Fy), mediolateral (Fz) and craniocaudal (Fx) ground reaction forces (GRF) were assessed. Wilcoxon test was used to verify the difference of biomechanical variables between t0 and t1, considering p<.05. Type I collagen of endomysium suffered the influence of PT, as well as gait speed that had decreased from t0 to t1 (p<.000).

To find out, to which degree the structural properties of DNA lesions determine the extent of transcription arrest in human CS cells, we performed quantitative host cell reactivation analyses of expression vectors containing various synthetic adducts. We found that a single 3-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene adduct (dG(N2)-AAF) constitutes an unsurmountable obstacle to transcription in both CS-A and CS-B cells and is removed exclusively by the CSA- and CSB-dependent pathway. In contrast, contribution of the CS proteins to the removal of two other transcription-blocking DNA lesions – N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (dG(C8)-AAF) and cyclobutane thymine-thymine (TT) dimer – is only minor (TT dimer) or none (dG(C8)-AAF).

https://openalex.org/W2122417936,"The HOP2 protein is required for efficient double-strand break repair which ensures the proper synapsis of homologous chromosomes and normal meiotic progression. We previously showed that in vitro HOP2 shows two distinctive activities: when it is incorporated into a HOP2-MND1 heterodimer, it stimulates DMC1 and RAD51 recombination activities, and the purified HOP2 alone is proficient in promoting strand invasion. The structural and biochemical basis of HOP2 action in recombination are poorly understood; therefore, they are the focus of this work. Herein, we present the solution structure of the amino-terminal portion of mouse HOP2, which contains a typical winged helix DNA-binding domain. Together with NMR spectral changes in the presence of double-stranded DNA, protein docking on DNA, and mutation analysis to identify the amino acids involved in DNA coordination, our results on the three-dimensional structure of HOP2 provide key information on the fundamental structural and biochemical requirements directing the interaction of HOP2 with DNA. These results, in combination with mutational experiments showing the role of a coiled-coil structural feature involved in HOP2 self-association, allow us to explain important aspects of the function of HOP2 in recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1981108327,"Actin networks in migrating cells exist as several interdependent structures: sheet-like networks of branched actin filaments in lamellipodia; arrays of bundled actin filaments co-assembled with myosin II in lamellae; and actin filaments that engage focal adhesions. How these dynamic networks are integrated and coordinated to maintain a coherent actin cytoskeleton in migrating cells is not known. We show that the large GTPase dynamin2 is enriched in the distal lamellipod where it regulates lamellipodial actin networks as they form and flow in U2-OS cells. Within lamellipodia, dynamin2 regulated the spatiotemporal distributions of α-actinin and cortactin, two actin-binding proteins that specify actin network architecture. Dynamin2's action on lamellipodial F-actin influenced the formation and retrograde flow of lamellar actomyosin via direct and indirect interactions with actin filaments and a finely tuned GTP hydrolysis activity. Expression in dynamin2-depleted cells of a mutant dynamin2 protein that restores endocytic activity, but not activities that remodel actin filaments, demonstrated that actin filament remodeling by dynamin2 did not depend of its functions in endocytosis. Thus, dynamin2 acts within lamellipodia to organize actin filaments and regulate assembly and flow of lamellar actomyosin. We hypothesize that through its actions on lamellipodial F-actin, dynamin2 generates F-actin structures that give rise to lamellar actomyosin and for efficient coupling of F-actin at focal adhesions. In this way, dynamin2 orchestrates the global actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2039978572,"Protein glycosylation may contribute to the evolution of mammalian brain complexity by adapting excitatory neurotransmission in response to environmental and social cues. Balanced excitatory synaptic transmission is primarily mediated by glutamatergic neurotransmission. Previous studies have found that subunits of the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptor are N-glycosylated, which may play a critical role in AMPA receptor trafficking and function at the cell membrane. Studies have predominantly used rodent models to address altered glycosylation in human pathological conditions. Given the rate of mammalian brain evolution and the predicted rate of change in the brain-specific glycoproteome, we asked if there are species-specific changes in glycoprotein expression, focusing on the AMPA receptor. N-glycosylation of AMPA receptor subunits was investigated in rat (Rattus norvegicus), tree shrew (Tupaia glis belangeri), macaque (Macaca nemestrina), and human frontal cortex tissue using a combination of enzymatic deglycosylation and Western blot analysis, as well as lectin binding assays. We found that two AMPA receptor subunits, GluA2 and GluA4, are sensitive to deglycosylation with Endo H and PNGase F. When we enriched for glycosylated proteins using lectin binding assays, we found that all four AMPA receptor subunits are glycosylated, and were predominantly recognized by lectins that bind to glucose or mannose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), or 1-6αfucose. We found differences in glycosylation between different subunits, as well as modest differences in glycosylation of homologous subunits between different species."
https://openalex.org/W2164081486,"To prospectively evaluate quantitative airway wall measurements of thin-section CT for the diagnosis of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) following lung transplantation.In 141 CT examinations, bronchial wall thickness (WT), the wall area percentage (WA%) calculated as the ratio of the bronchial wall area and the total area (sum of bronchial wall area and bronchial lumen area) and the difference of the WT on inspiration and expiration (WTdiff) were automatically measured in different bronchial generations. The measurements were correlated with the lung function parameters. WT and WA% in CT examinations of patients with (n = 25) and without (n = 116) BOS, were compared using the unpaired t-test and univariate analysis of variance, while also considering the differing lung volumes.Measurements could be performed in 2,978 bronchial generations. WT, WA%, and WTdiff did not correlate with the lung function parameters (r<0.5). The WA% on inspiration was significantly greater in patients with BOS than in patients without BOS, even when considering the dependency of the lung volume on the measurements. WT on inspiration and expiration and WA% on expiration did not show significant differences between the groups.WA% on inspiration was significantly greater in patients with than in those without BOS. However, WA% measurements were significantly dependent on lung volume and showed a high variability, thus not allowing the sole use of bronchial wall measurements to differentiate patients with from those without BOS."
https://openalex.org/W2028433336,"Objective The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent different social network mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin-resistance. Design We used nonparametric and parametric regression models to analyse whether individual BMI and HOMA-IR are determined by social network characteristics. Subjects and Methods A total of 677 probands (EGO) and 3033 social network partners (ALTER) were included in the study. Data gathered from the probands include anthropometric measures, HOMA-IR index, health attitudes, behavioural and socio-economic variables and social network data. Results We found significant treatment effects for ALTERs frequent dieting (p<0.001) and ALTERs health oriented nutritional attitudes (p<0.001) on EGO's BMI, establishing a significant indirect network effect also on EGO's insulin resistance. Most importantly, we also found significant direct social network effects on EGO's insulin resistance, evidenced by an effect of ALTERs frequent dieting (p = 0.033) and ALTERs sport activities (p = 0.041) to decrease EGO's HOMA-IR index independently of EGO's BMI. Conclusions Social network phenomena appear not only to be relevant for the spread of obesity, but also for the spread of insulin resistance as the basis for type 2 diabetes. Attitudes and behaviour of peer groups influence EGO's health status not only via social mechanisms, but also via socio-biological mechanisms, i.e. higher brain areas might be influenced not only by biological signals from the own organism, but also by behaviour and knowledge from different human individuals. Our approach allows the identification of peer group influence controlling for potential homophily even when using cross-sectional observational data."
https://openalex.org/W2047166231,"Brachydactyly type A2 (BDA2, MIM 112600) is characterized by the deviation and shortening of the middle phalange of the index finger and the second toe. Using genome-wide linkage analysis in a Chinese BDA2 family, we mapped the maximum candidate interval of BDA2 to a ∼1.5 Mb region between D20S194 and D20S115 within chromosome 20p12.3 and found that the pairwise logarithm of the odds score was highest for marker D20S156 (Zmax = 6.09 at θ = 0). Based on functional and positional perspectives, the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene was identified as the causal gene for BDA2 in this region, even though no point mutation was detected in BMP2. Through further investigation, we identified a 4,671 bp (Chr20: 6,809,218-6,813,888) genomic duplication downstream of BMP2. This duplication was located within the linked region, co-segregated with the BDA2 phenotype in this family, and was not found in the unaffected family members and the unrelated control individuals. Compared with the previously reported duplications, the duplication in this family has a different breakpoint flanked by the microhomologous sequence GATCA and a slightly different length. Some other microhomologous nucleotides were also found in the duplicated region. In summary, our findings support the conclusions that BMP2 is the causing gene for BDA2, that the genomic location corresponding to the duplication region is prone to structural changes associated with malformation of the digits, and that this tendency is probably caused by the abundance of microhomologous sequences in the region."
https://openalex.org/W1974599538,"Extrinsic and intrinsic regulators are responsible for the tight control of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which differentiate into all blood cell lineages. To understand the fundamental basis of HSC biology, we focused on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in long-term and short-term HSCs, which are closely related in terms of cell development but substantially differ in their stem cell capacity. To analyze the transcriptional regulation of the DEGs identified in the novel transcriptome profiles obtained by our RNA-seq analysis, we developed a computational method to model the linear relationship between gene expression and the features of putative regulatory elements. The transcriptional regulation modes characterized here suggest the importance of transcription factors (TFs) that are expressed at steady state or at low levels. Remarkably, we found that 24 differentially expressed TFs targeting 21 putative TF-binding sites contributed significantly to transcriptional regulation. These TFs tended to be modulated by other nondifferentially expressed TFs, suggesting that HSCs can achieve flexible and rapid responses via the control of nondifferentially expressed TFs through a highly complex regulatory network. Our novel transcriptome profiles and new method are powerful tools for studying the mechanistic basis of cell fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2057000207,"Neurological glutamate receptors bind a variety of artificial ligands, both agonistic and antagonistic, in addition to glutamate. Studying their small molecule binding properties increases our understanding of the central nervous system and a variety of associated pathologies. The large, oligomeric multidomain membrane protein contains a large and flexible ligand binding domains which undergoes large conformational changes upon binding different ligands. A recent application of glutamate receptors is their activation or inhibition via photo-switchable ligands, making them key systems in the emerging field of optochemical genetics. In this work, we present a theoretical study on the binding mode and complex stability of a novel photo-switchable ligand, ATA-3, which reversibly binds to glutamate receptors ligand binding domains (LBDs). We propose two possible binding modes for this ligand based on flexible ligand docking calculations and show one of them to be analogues to the binding mode of a similar ligand, 2-BnTetAMPA. In long MD simulations, it was observed that transitions between both binding poses involve breaking and reforming the T686-E402 protein hydrogen bond. Simulating the ligand photo-isomerization process shows that the two possible configurations of the ligand azo-group have markedly different complex stabilities and equilibrium binding modes. A strong but slow protein response is observed after ligand configuration changes. This provides a microscopic foundation for the observed difference in ligand activity upon light-switching."
https://openalex.org/W1976101254,"Recently it was proposed that the primary feathers of Archaeopteryx lithographica (HMN1880) were overlaid by long covert feathers, and that a multilayered feathered wing was a feature of early fossils with feathered forelimbs. The proposed long covert feathers of Archaeopteryx were previously interpreted as dorsally displaced remiges or a second set of impressions made by the wing. The following study shows that the qualitative arguments forwarded in support of the elongated covert hypothesis are neither robust nor supported quantitatively. The idea that the extant bird wing with its single layer of overlapping primaries evolved from an earlier multilayered heavily coveted feathered forelimb as seen in Anchiornis huxleyi is reasonable. At this juncture, however, it is premature to conclude unequivocally that the wing of Archaeopteryx consisted of primary feathers overlaid with elongated coverts."
https://openalex.org/W2063085129,"The emergence of novel viral pathogens can lead to devastating consequences in the infected population. However, on occasion, rare hyper-responsive elite controllers are able to mount a protective primary response to infection and clear the new pathogen. Factors distinguishing elite controllers from other members of the population are not completely understood. We have been using Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis as a model of primary infection in mice and clearance of the virus is limited to one MHC genotype capable of generating a protective response to a single viral peptide VP2121-130. The genetics of host susceptibility to TMEV, a natural mouse pathogen, has been studied extensively and non-protective CD8 responses to other peptides have been documented, however, little is known why the protective response to infection focuses on the VP2121-130 peptide. To study this question, we have generated TMEV mutants that encode for mutations within the VP2121-130 peptide. We find that very few of mutants are able to assemble and infect in vitro. These mutations are not related to virus RNA structure since non-coding mutations do not interfere with assembly. In the rare event when functional VP2121-130 mutant viruses did emerge, they were attenuated to some level or retained the ability to develop an immune response to the wild-type VP2121-130 sequence, demonstrating that the virus is incapable of escaping the protective response. These findings advance our understanding of how characteristics of the host immune response and an infectious agent can interact to lead to the appearance of rare super controllers in a population. Furthermore, the immutable nature of the viral antigen highlights the importance of choosing appropriate vaccine antigens and has implications for the development of agents that are able to generate protective CD8 T-cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W1981919195,"To investigate the added diagnostic value of 3.0 Tesla breast MRI over conventional breast imaging in the diagnosis of in situ and invasive breast cancer and to explore the role of routine versus expert reading.We evaluated MRI scans of patients with nonpalpable BI-RADS 3-5 lesions who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced 3.0 Tesla breast MRI. Initially, MRI scans were read by radiologists in a routine clinical setting. All histologically confirmed index lesions were re-evaluated by two dedicated breast radiologists. Sensitivity and specificity for the three MRI readings were determined, and the diagnostic value of breast MRI in addition to conventional imaging was assessed. Interobserver reliability between the three readings was evaluated.MRI examinations of 207 patients were analyzed. Seventy-eight of 207 (37.7%) patients had a malignant lesion, of which 33 (42.3%) patients had pure DCIS and 45 (57.7%) invasive breast cancer. Sensitivity of breast MRI was 66.7% during routine, and 89.3% and 94.7% during expert reading. Specificity was 77.5% in the routine setting, and 61.0% and 33.3% during expert reading. In the routine setting, MRI provided additional diagnostic information over clinical information and conventional imaging, as the Area Under the ROC Curve increased from 0.76 to 0.81. Expert MRI reading was associated with a stronger improvement of the AUC to 0.87. Interobserver reliability between the three MRI readings was fair and moderate.3.0 T breast MRI of nonpalpable breast lesions is of added diagnostic value for the diagnosis of in situ and invasive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2116791469,"Inner medulla collecting duct (IMCD) cells are the key part for urinary concentration. Hypotonic stress may trigger apoptosis of IMCD cells and induce renal injury. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) play an important role in anti-apoptosis, but their roles in hypotonic-induced apoptosis of IMCD cells are still unclear. Here we found increasing exogenous 11, 12-EET or endogenous EETs with Ad-CMV-CYP2C23-EGFP transfection decreased apoptosis of IMCD cells induced by hypotonic stress. Moreover, up-regulation of γ-ENaC induced by hypotonic stress was abolished by elevation of exogenous or endogenous EETs. Collectively, this study illustrated that EETs attenuated hypotonic-induced apoptosis of IMCD cells, and that regulation of γ-ENAC may be a possible mechanism contributing to the anti-apoptotic effect of EETs in response to hypotonic stress."
