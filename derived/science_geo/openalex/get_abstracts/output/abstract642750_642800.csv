https://openalex.org/W2983004186,"Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) is an H+-coupled symporter highly expressed in metastatic tumors and at inflammatory sites undergoing hypoxia or the Warburg effect. At these sites, extracellular lactate contributes to malignancy and immune response evasion. Intriguingly, at 30-40 mm, the reported Km of MCT4 for lactate is more than 1 order of magnitude higher than physiological or even pathological lactate levels. MCT4 is not thought to transport pyruvate. Here we have characterized cell lactate and pyruvate dynamics using the FRET sensors Laconic and Pyronic. Dominant MCT4 permeability was demonstrated in various cell types by pharmacological means and by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion. Respective Km values for lactate uptake were 1.7, 1.2, and 0.7 mm in MDA-MB-231 cells, macrophages, and HEK293 cells expressing recombinant MCT4. In MDA-MB-231 cells MCT4 exhibited a Km for pyruvate of 4.2 mm, as opposed to >150 mm reported previously. Parallel assays with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) indicated that previous Km estimates based on substrate-induced acidification were severely biased by confounding pH-regulatory mechanisms. Numerical simulation using revised kinetic parameters revealed that MCT4, but not the related transporters MCT1 and MCT2, endows cells with the ability to export lactate in high-lactate microenvironments. In conclusion, MCT4 is a high-affinity lactate transporter with physiologically relevant affinity for pyruvate."

https://openalex.org/W2982760504,"Fog computing (FC) is an evolving computing technology that operates in a distributed environment. FC aims to bring cloud computing features close to edge devices. The approach is expected to fulfill the minimum latency requirement for healthcare Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Healthcare IoT devices generate various volumes of healthcare data. This large volume of data results in high data traffic that causes network congestion and high latency. An increase in round-trip time delay owing to large data transmission and large hop counts between IoTs and cloud servers render healthcare data meaningless and inadequate for end-users. Time-sensitive healthcare applications require real-time data. Traditional cloud servers cannot fulfill the minimum latency demands of healthcare IoT devices and end-users. Therefore, communication latency, computation latency, and network latency must be reduced for IoT data transmission. FC affords the storage, processing, and analysis of data from cloud computing to a network edge to reduce high latency. A novel solution for the abovementioned problem is proposed herein. It includes an analytical model and a hybrid fuzzy-based reinforcement learning algorithm in an FC environment. The aim is to reduce high latency among healthcare IoTs, end-users, and cloud servers. The proposed intelligent FC analytical model and algorithm use a fuzzy inference system combined with reinforcement learning and neural network evolution strategies for data packet allocation and selection in an IoT–FC environment. The approach is tested on simulators iFogSim (Net-Beans) and Spyder (Python). The obtained results indicated the better performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods."

In the present study, the effects of the probiotic formulation, UB0316 (L. salivarius UBLS22, L. casei UBLC42, L. plantarum UBLP40, L. acidophilus UBLA34, B. breve UBBr01, B. coagulans Unique IS2, 5 billion CFU each and fructo-oligosaccharides, 100 mg) in patients with T2DM were assessed.A total of 79 eligible subjects (18-65 years, on stable metformin therapy) were randomly assigned to receive UB0316 or placebo, twice-a-day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), secondary were assessment of blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), insulin, body weight, and blood lipids. Quality of life, vital signs, physical investigations, safety and Physician/Subject's Global assessment were also evaluated.Twelve week multi-strain probiotic (UB0316) supplementation significantly reduced HbA1c (7.70 ± 0.79%; p = 0.0023) and weight (67.00 ± 8.82 kg; p < 0.001) as compared to placebo (HbA1c: 8.30 ± 1.35%; weight: 67.60 ± 9.46 kg). The changes recorded in fasting blood glucose (FBG), HOMA-IR, insulin, TC, TG, HDL, and LDL levels were however not significantly altered as compared to placebo. No severe adverse events, abnormal vital and physical signs were reported. The quality of life of T2DM was significantly improved.UB0316 significantly improved glycemic control as indicated by the decrease in HbA1c levels. There was also a significant decrease in weight in the probiotic treated subjects as compared to placebo."

We identified chronic disease multimorbidity patterns in Koreans 50 years of age or older, and explored whether such patterns were associated with particular sociodemographic factors and health-related quality-of-life.The multimorbidity patterns of 10 chronic diseases (hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, tuberculosis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease) were identified via latent class analysis of data on 8,370 Korean adults aged 50+ years who participated in the sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2015). The associations between multimorbidity patterns, and sociodemographic factors and health-related quality of life, were subjected to regression analysis.Three patterns of multimorbidity were identified: 1) a relatively healthy group (60.4% of the population); 2) a 'cardiometabolic conditions' group (27.8%); and, 3) an 'arthritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease' group (11.8%). The female (compared to male) gender was associated with an increased likelihood of membership of the cardiometabolic conditions group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.51) and (to a much greater extent) the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 3.30-5.66). Low socioeconomic status was associated with membership of the two multimorbidity classes. Membership of the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group was associated with a significantly poorer health-related quality-of-life than was membership of the other two groups.The co-occurrence of chronic diseases was not attributable to chance. Multimorbidity patterns were associated with sociodemographic factors and quality-of-life. Our results suggest that targeted, integrated public health and clinical strategies dealing with chronic diseases should be based on an understanding of multimorbidity patterns; this would improve the quality-of-life of vulnerable multimorbid adults."
https://openalex.org/W2986829891,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs) are directed against lysosomal components of neutrophils. ANCAs directed to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in particular are associated with distinct forms of small vessel vasculitides. MPO is an abundant neutrophil-derived heme protein that is part of the antimicrobial defense system. The protein is typically present in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, but a large portion may also enter the extracellular space. It remains unclear why MPO is frequently the target of antibody-mediated autoimmune responses. MPO is a homodimeric glycoprotein, posttranslationally modified with complex sugars at specific sites. Glycosylation can strongly influence protein function, affecting its folding, receptor interaction, and backbone accessibility. MPO potentially can be heavily modified as it harbors 5 putative N-glycosylation sites (10 in the mature dimer). Although considered important for MPO structure and function, the full scope and relative abundance of the glycans attached to MPO is unknown. Here, combining bottom-up glycoproteomics and native MS approaches, we structurally characterized MPO from neutrophils of healthy human donors. We quantified the relative occupancy levels of the glycans at each of the five sites and observed complex heterogeneity and site-specific glycosylation. In particular, we detected glycosylation phenotypes uncommon for glycoproteins in the extracellular space, such as a high abundance of phosphorylated high-mannose species and severely truncated small glycans having the size of paucimannose or smaller. We hypothesize that the atypical glycosylation pattern found on MPO might contribute to its specific processing and presentation as a self-antigen by antigen-presenting cells.

In AAV, the presence and antigen-specificity of ANCA can assist in diagnosis and disease stratification (3Cornec D. Cornec-Le Gall E. Fervenza F.C. Specks U.

MPO, one of the most common ANCA autoantigens, is an important and abundant enzyme within the host defense system (4van der Veen B.S. de Winther M.P. Heeringa P.

It catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxidase and chloride anions into hypochlorous acid, a toxin with bactericidal properties (5Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C.

The protein is abundantly present in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, and is released into the phagosome to assist in the degradation of opsonized pathogens; ∼30% may be released into the extracellular space upon degranulation (6Parker H.

Mature MPO exists as a cysteine-linked homodimer, with each monomer comprising a light and heavy chain linked by disulfide bridges, a covalently linked heme group, and five N-linked glycosylation sites per heavy chain (7Teng N.

Importantly, the glycosylation of MPO has been indicated to affect the interaction with ANCA as well (9Wang J. Li J.N. Cui Z. Zhao M.H.

Because of its importance, the N-glycosylation of MPO has been studied previously either at the released glycan level (8Van Antwerpen P. Slomianny M.C. Boudjeltia K.Z. Delporte C. Faid V. Calay D.

Presently, it is not yet known what the relative abundance of the glycoforms is for each of the five MPO sites, and therefore, which species are dominantly expressed. In addition, there is strong evidence that not all relevant glycosylation characteristics of MPO have yet been charted. For instance, a recent glycoproteomics study on pathogen-infected sputum, which also detected three of the MPO glycosylation sites, showed abundant paucimannose species on these sites (12Thaysen-Andersen M. Venkatakrishnan V. Loke I. Laurini C. Diestel S. Parker B.L. Packer N.H. Human neutrophils secrete bioactive paucimannosidic proteins from azurophilic granules into pathogen-infected sputum.J. Biol.

Similarly, reports indicate that MPO likely carries mannose-6-phosphate residues (M6P) (13Cieutat A.M. Lobel P. August J.T. Kjeldsen L. Sengeløv H. Borregaard N. Bainton D.F. Azurophilic granules of human neutrophilic leukocytes are deficient in lysosome-associated membrane proteins but retain the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker.Blood. 1998; 91 (9446668): 1044-105810.1182/blood.V91.3.1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yogalingam G.

However, these M6P residues were not reported in these recent glycoproteomics efforts, and it remains therefore unclear how abundant the glyco-modifications are and where on the MPO molecule they reside. To expand insight into the posttranslational modifications of MPO, we performed a comprehensive glycosylation analysis of MPO derived from neutrophils of healthy human donors, from which we obtained relative glycan occupancies for each independent glycosylation site. To achieve this, we combined contemporary mass spectrometric approaches, namely, high-end bottom-up glycoproteomics and native MS (15Yang Y. Wang G. Song T. Lebrilla C.B. Heck A.J.R. Resolving the micro-heterogeneity and structural integrity of monoclonal antibodies by hybrid mass spectrometric approaches.MAbs. 2017; 9 (28281873): 638-64510.1080/19420862.2017.1290033Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Reiding K.R.

Importantly, recent innovations in MS and bioinformatics have allowed us to better chart M6P residues as well, which so far were often missed (17Čaval T. Zhu J. Tian W. Remmelzwaal S. Yang Z. Clausen H. Heck A.J.R. Targeted analysis of lysosomal directed proteins and their sites of mannose-6-phosphate modification.Mol.

In all, we find that on MPO from healthy human donors Asn-355 and Asn-391 mostly harbor high-mannose–type glycans, whereas Asn-483 is the dominant site to display complex-type species. All sites contain a fraction of paucimannose species (and smaller than that), which on Asn-729 are the only species present. Importantly, we demonstrate that M6P is indeed abundantly present on the molecule, predominantly at Asn-323 (Fig. 1). We applied native MS and bottom-up glycoproteomics to achieve a comprehensive characterization of MPO glycosylation (Fig. 2). To this end, MPO was purified from healthy donors as described before (18Nauseef W.M. Root R.K. Malech H.L. Biochemical and immunologic analysis of hereditary myeloperoxidase deficiency.J. Clin.

We obtained two pools of MPO, both purified from buffy coats from five healthy individuals, namely 1) a high purity discovery pool for native MS, bottom-up proteomics, and glycan quantification and 2) an independent validation pool of approximate 50% purity to confirm the glycan quantification. Purified MPO was proteolytically digested with both GluC and trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC)-MS2. To improve glycopeptide characterization we applied three fragmentation methods for the analysis of the glycopeptides: 1) higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), 2) HCD-product–dependent stepping HCD, and 3) HCD-product–dependent electron-transfer and higher-energy collisional dissociation (EThcD) (16Reiding K.R.

The spectra were searched with Byonic for the presence of glycopeptides.

Inspection of the MS2 scans did not reveal evidence of antennary fucosylation (m/z 350.145 or 512.197 [M+H]+), suggesting the absence of Lewis-type structures. Because of this, the glycan compositions were chosen to carry one fucose residue at most. Similarly, no signals were detected that suggested the presence of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (m/z 290.087 or 308.098 [M+H]+), therefore, sialylation was presumed to only occur in the N-acetylneuraminic acid variant (m/z 274.092 and 292.103). MS2 did show strong indication of phosphohexose residues (m/z 243.026 and 405.079 [M+H]+) (Fig. 3), leading to the inclusion of 34 compositions that adhered to the lysosomal pathway of degradation (e.g. HexNAc2Hex5P1 and HexNAc4Hex9P2) (Table S2) (20Grishkovskaya I.

Using Byonic, we achieved a high sequence coverage, namely an MPO light chain coverage of 86.9% (S.D. ± 0.0%; the S.D., calculated from triplicate LC-MS2 runs) and a heavy chain coverage of 96.9% (S.D. ± 0.8%). Glycopeptides were matched with a Byonic score cutoff of 150 (22Lee L.Y. Moh E.S. Parker B.L. Bern M. Packer N.H. Thaysen-Andersen M. Toward automated N-glycopeptide identification in glycoproteomics.J.

Following the curation, no (glyco)peptides were matched that could correspond to the prepeptide or propeptide of MPO, suggesting MPO was exclusively present in its mature form. The relative glycosylation of each peptide was obtained by use of Skyline, which allowed us to assess the areas within the retention time window of each peptide (Figs. 3A and 4A). MS1 traces were manually inspected and annotated to ensure no complimentary glycan species were excluded from the analysis (Figs. 3B and 4B). Additionally, MS2 scans were manually verified for each main signal to ensure the correct interpretation of the major glycosylation features, which included phosphorylated glycans (Fig. 3, C and D) and paucimannosidic glycans (Fig. 4, C and D), as well as to position the fucose on the core-GlcNAc (Fig. 4, C and D). The glycopeptide areas resulting from the process of curation and integration were normalized to the sum of intensities for each site. To confirm the biological reproducibility of our observations, we repeated this whole analysis on a second independent batch of partially purified MPO. To inform on the co-purified proteins present in this validation pool, we used Byonic to search the bottom-up proteomics data against a human proteome database. The main co-purified proteins turned out to be lactotransferrin, bactericidal permeability-increasing protein, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and several other proteins that are known to be abundant in neutrophil granules (Table S4). We could find no evidence for the presence of glycosidases or glycosyltransferases in this sample. MPO was buffer exchanged to 150 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) and analyzed by MS under native conditions. To achieve this, ∼3 μm protein was injected by direct infusion into a Q-Tof TOF-MS system, tuned to provide optimal signal intensity without displaying fragmentation or denaturation. The highly complex heterogeneity in the MPO glycosylation prevented the acquisition of high-resolution native spectra. Still, we were able to record a charge state–resolved MS spectrum, which allowed us to determine the average molecular weight. MPO was detected as a single ion series with at least five different charge states, ranging from [M+22H]22+ to [M+26H]26+ (Fig. 5), from which we could obtain an average molecular weight of 144,180 Da (S.D. ± 39 Da). By adding the theoretical average glycan mass, as calculated from our bottom-up experiments, to the theoretical mass of the MPO peptide backbone, we arrived at a total molecular weight of 144,171 Da for dimeric MPO. This matched, within the error margins, the mass observed by native MS (Fig. 5). The congruence between observed and theoretical molecular weights provided high confidence that MPO was predominantly present in its mature dimeric form (without propeptide and prepeptide segments) and validated our glycan assignment in the bottom-up data. No monomeric and other oligomeric states of MPO were detected. The glycosylation sites of MPO showed remarkably high diversity in occupying glycan species (Fig. 6). Unlike other sites, Asn-323 proved to have 29.0% (S.D. ± 0.4%) occupancy of phosphorylated glycans, in the second pool replicated to be 21.7% (S.D. ± 0.2%). Fragmentation analysis clearly showed the phosphate residues to be associated to hexose residues, apparent from the [M+H]+ oxonium ions of Hex1P1 (m/z 243.026), Hex2P1 (m/z 405.079), and Hex3P1 (m/z 567.132) (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, this strongly suggests the presence of M6P residues on MPO. In contrast, we did not find any evidence for phosphorylation on the peptide at either Ser, Thr, Tyr, or His residues (23Potel C.M. Lin M.H. Prust N. van den Toorn H.W.P. Heck A.J.R. Lemeer S.

The other major glycosylation feature for Asn-323 was the abundant presence of paucimannose glycans (here defined as having fewer hexoses than five and at most two N-acetylhexosamines, e.g. HexNAc2Hex3dHex1), with a relative abundance of 48.5% (S.D. ± 0.3%) and 59.4% (S.D. ± 0.5%) for the replication pool. Of note was that the paucimannose species were core-fucosylated, unlike the high-mannose glycans, suggesting they may have been formed from truncation of a hybrid or complex N-glycan lineage (24Nairn A.V. York W.S. Harris K. Hall E.M. Pierce J.M. Moremen K.W. Regulation of glycan structures in animal tissues: Transcript profiling of glycan-related genes.J. Biol.

Both Asn-355 and Asn-391 primarily displayed high-mannose or paucimannose glycans without core-fucosylation. Of interest, the glycan species on Asn-391 proved comparable in size between the discovery and replication MPO (the highest signals belonging to HexNAc2Hex5 (28.6% S.D. ± 0.0%, replicated as 38.36% S.D. ± 1.3%) and HexNAc2Hex6 (30.1% S.D. ± 0.2%, replicated as 24.7% S.D. ± 0.8%). The occupancy on Asn-355, on the other hand, differed considerably between the two measured MPO samples, the main species in the discovery MPO being HexNAc2Hex5 (32.1% S.D. ± 0.2%) and HexNAc2Hex6 (47.5% S.D. ± 0.6%), whereas in the biological replicate the major signals corresponded to HexNAc2Hex1 (38.1% S.D. ± 0.9%) and HexNAc2Hex2 (26.4% S.D. ± 0.9%). Asn-483 was the only site to show abundant signals of sialylated complex glycans, including HexNAc3Hex4dHex1Neu5Ac1 (11.5% S.D. ± 0.3%, and 11.2% S.D. ± 0.4% in replicate) and HexNAc4Hex4dHex1Neu5Ac1 (15.0% S.D. ± 0.2% and 12.0% S.D. ± 1.2%) as major species. With this, the total of sialylated species comprised 32.3% (S.D. ± 0.8%, and 26.0% S.D. ± 1.1%). The other dominant species to occupy Asn-483 appeared to be truncated variants of these glycans, namely HexNAc2Hex2dHex1 (35.7% S.D. ± 1.3%, and 30.4% S.D. ± 1.3%) and HexNAc3Hex3dHex1 (20.4% S.D. ± 1.5%, and 18.4% S.D. ± 0.5%). Notably, the vast majority of species on Asn-483 was core-fucosylated, the relative areas hereof summing up to 97.7% (S.D. ± 0.1%, and 81.9% S.D. ± 2.7%). Finally, core-fucosylation was also high on site Asn-729 (60.1% S.D. ± 1.7% and 56.0% S.D. ± 1.7%), although a high degree of nonfucosylated glycans was also found (27.2% S.D. ± 0.5% and 42.7% S.D. ± 1.7%). The most abundant features of Asn-729 turned out to be HexNAc2Hex2 (13.7% S.D. ± 0.4%) and HexNAc2Hex2dHex1 (42.6% S.D. ± 1.2%); it also showed the presence of even smaller glycans in the form of HexNAc1 (13.5% S.D. ± 0.5% and"
https://openalex.org/W2986427075,"Introduction There has been an increasing focus on disseminating research findings, but less about practices specific to disseminating and engaging non-researchers. The present project sought to describe dissemination practices and engagement of stakeholders among dissemination & implementation (D&I) scientists. Methods Methods to disseminate to and engage non-research stakeholders were assessed using an online survey sent to a broad, diverse sample of D&I scientists. Results Surveys were received from 210 participants. The majority of respondents were from university or research settings in the United States. (69%) or Canada (13%), representing a mix of clinical (28%) and community settings (34%). 26% had received formal training in D&I. Respondents indicated routinely engaging in a variety of dissemination-related activities, with academic journal publications (88%), conference presentations (86%), and reports to funders (74%) being the most frequent. Journal publication was identified as the most impactful on respondents’ careers (94%), but face-to-face meetings with stakeholders were rated as most impactful on practice or policy (40%). Stakeholder involvement in research was common, with clinical and community-based researchers engaging stakeholder groups in broadly similar ways, but with critical differences noted between researchers with greater seniority, those with more D&I training, those based in the United States vs. Canada, and those in community vs. clinical research settings. Conclusions There have been increases in stakeholder engagement, but few other practices since the 2012 survey, and some differences across subgroups. Methods to engage different stakeholders deserve more in-depth investigation. D&I researchers report substantial misalignment of incentives and behaviors related to dissemination to non-research audiences."
https://openalex.org/W2984615507,"Cancer cell migration is influenced by cellular phenotype and behavior as well as by the mechanical and chemical properties of the environment. Furthermore, many cancer cells show plasticity of their phenotype and adapt it to the properties of the environment. Here, we study the influence of fiber stiffness, confinement, and adhesion properties on cancer cell migration in porous collagen gels. Collagen gels with soft fibers abrogate migration and promote a round, non-invasive phenotype. Stiffer collagen fibers are inherently more adhesive and lead to the existence of an adhesive phenotype and in general confined migration due to adhesion. Addition of TGF-β lowers adhesion, eliminates the adhesive phenotype and increases the amount of highly motile amoeboid phenotypes. Highest migration speeds and longest displacements are achieved in stiff collagen fibers in pores of about cell size by amoeboid phenotypes. This elucidates the influence of the mechanical properties of collagen gels on phenotype and subsequently migration and shows that stiff fibers, cell sized pores, and low adhesion, are optimal conditions for an amoeboid phenotype and efficient migration."

As filter-feeders that are constantly exposed to new microbial inoculants, mussels represent an ideal system to investigate the effects of species or the environment on gut microbiome composition. In this study, we examined if host species or site exerts a greater influence on microbiome composition. Individuals of four co-occurring freshwater mussel species, Cyclonaias asperata, Fusconaia cerina, Lampsilis ornata, and Obovaria unicolor were collected from six sites along a 50 km stretch of the Sipsey River in Alabama, USA. High throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that mussel gut bacterial microbiota were distinct from bacteria on seston suspended in the water column, and that the composition of the gut microbiota was influenced by both host species and site. Despite species and environmental variation, the most frequently detected sequences within the mussel microbiota were identified as members of the Clostridiales. Sequences identified as the nitrogen-fixing taxon Methylocystis sp. were also abundant in all mussel species, and sequences of both bacterial taxa were more abundant in mussels than in water. Site physicochemical conditions explained almost 45% of variation in seston bacterial communities but less than 8% of variation in the mussel bacterial microbiome. Together, these findings suggest selective retention of bacterial taxa by the freshwater mussel host, and that both species and the environment are important in determining mussel gut microbiome composition."
https://openalex.org/W2985930587,"The increasing perception that public communication in science and technology is an important tool to create a knowledge society is encouraging numerous public engagement activities. However, too little is known about scientists’ opinions of and attitudes towards the public with whom they interact during these activities, especially in southern European countries such as Spain. If we want to establish an effective dialogue between science and society, we need to be aware of the opinions and perceptions that both parties have of each other. In this study, we address this issue by focusing on 1022 responses to a survey conducted among scientists in Spain to discover their views of the public, and we then compare these responses with data from other national surveys on the public’s understanding of science. The results show that approximately 75% of Spanish scientists think that the general public has a serious lack of knowledge and understanding of scientific reasoning, although scientists do recognize that science interests the public (73%). Scientists believe that the public values the scientific profession to a lesser extent than suggested by public surveys: on a scale of 1–5, survey respondents rate their valuation of the scientific profession at 4.22, whereas scientists rate the public's valuation of the profession at 3.12, on average. Significant differences were detected between scientists’ perceptions of how citizens are informed about science and what citizens report in surveys. The challenge for the future is to narrow this gap in order to help scientists gain a better understanding of the public and their interests and to make public engagement activities more effective."

Household occupants often deviate from thermostat programs, perhaps due to differing thermal comfort preferences, which are strong drivers of residential energy use and vary across genders. This study aims to develop an initial typology of interpersonal interactions around thermal comfort, explore the role of gender in such interactions, and examine the impacts of interactions on thermostat adjustments. Using n = 1568 diary observations collected from 112 participants, we identify three interaction types: conflicts, compromises, and agreements. Fixed effects analyses find that women are marginally more likely to report engaging in conflicts, whereas men are significantly more likely to report engaging in agreements and compromises, both of which are associated with greater likelihood of adjusting thermostats within a given day. This work represents an early step in investigating the multiply determined nature of household energy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2988886076,"This study aimed at assessing developmental trajectories of risk behaviors from adolescence into young adulthood and their associations with outcomes in young adulthood (i.e. education, employment). Data of the TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) including 2,149 participants (mean age = 13.6, SD = 0.5, 51% girls) were used to examine the development of alcohol, cannabis, smoking, and externalizing behavior. The results showed that the associations between these risk behaviors varied with age, and revealed varying developmental patterns throughout adolescence. Most notably alcohol use did not covary strongly with the other risk behaviors. The often assumed peak in risk behavior in adolescence was only found in a small group, and only for alcohol (7.4%) and cannabis use (3.4%), but not for smoking or externalizing behavior. Most adolescents revealed only low involvement in risk behavior, with the largest differences between low and high trajectories emerging in late adolescence (> 19 years). Clustering of risk behavior throughout adolescence is rather the exception than the rule and depends on age and type of risk behavior. Differences in risk behavior between individuals become the largest in late adolescence, possibly influencing successful transition into adulthood visible in educational attainment and employment."
https://openalex.org/W2985580063,"Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) plays a critical role in the maintenance of blood vessel homeostasis. Recent findings suggest that cytoskeletal dynamics play an essential role in regulating eNOS expression and activation. Here, we sought to test whether modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics through pharmacological regulation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-mediated tubulin deacetylation affects eNOS expression and endothelial function in vitro and in vivo. We found that tubulin acetylation inducer (tubacin), a compound that appears to selectively inhibit HDAC6 activity, dramatically increased eNOS expression in several different endothelial cell lines, as determined by both immunoblotting and NO production assays. Mechanistically, we found that these effects were not mediated by tubacin’s inhibitory effect on HDAC6 activity, but rather were due to its ability to stabilize eNOS mRNA transcripts. Consistent with these findings, tubacin also inhibited proinflammatory cytokine-induced degradation of eNOS transcripts and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation in the mouse aorta. Furthermore, we found that tubacin-induced up-regulation in eNOS expression in vivo is associated with improved endothelial function in diabetic db/db mice and with a marked attenuation of ischemic brain injury in a murine stroke model. Our findings indicate that tubacin exhibits potent eNOS-inducing effects and suggest that this compound might be useful for the prevention or management of endothelial dysfunction–associated cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2987920494,"Stripe rust (incited by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) is airborne wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) disease with dynamic virulence evolution. Thus, anticipatory and continued screening in hotspot regions is crucial to identify new pathotypes and integrate new resistance resources to prevent potential disease epidemics. A global wheat panel consisting of 882 landraces and 912 improved accessions was evaluated in two locations in Egypt during 2016 and 2017. Five prevalent and aggressive pathotypes of stripe rust were used to inoculate the accessions during the two growing seasons and two locations under field conditions. The objectives were to evaluate the panel for stripe rust resistance at the adult plant stage, identify potentially novel QTLs associated with stripe rust resistance, and validate previously reported stripe rust QTLs under the Egyptian conditions. The results indicated that 42 landraces and 140 improved accessions were resistant to stripe rust. Moreover, 24 SNPs were associated with stripe rust resistance and were within 18 wheat functional genes. Four of these genes were involved in several plant defense mechanisms. The number of favorable alleles, based upon the associated SNPs, was significant and negatively correlated with stripe rust resistance score, i.e., as the number of resistances alleles increased the observed resistance increased. In conclusion, generating new stripe rust phenotypic information on this panel while using the publicly available molecular marker data, contributed to identifying potentially novel QTLs associated with stripe rust and validated 17 of the previously reported QTLs in one of the global hotspots for stripe rust."

In response to multiple country requests for open-access, basic emergency care training materials, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM), undertook development of a course for health care providers—Basic Emergency Care: Approach to the acutely ill and injured (BEC). As part of course development, pilots were performed in Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Zambia to evaluate course feasibility and appropriateness. Here we describe participant and facilitator feedback and pre- and post-course exam performance. Methods A mixed methods research design incorporated pre- and post-course surveys as well as participant examination results to assess the feasibility and utility of the course, and knowledge transfer. Quantitative data were analyzed using Stata, and simple descriptive statistics were used to describe participant demographics. Survey data were coded and grouped by themes and analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Results Post-course test scores showed significant improvement (p-value < 0.05) as compared to pre-course. Pre- and post-course questionnaires demonstrated significantly increased confidence in managing emergency conditions. Participant-reported course strengths included course appropriateness, structure, language level and delivery methods. Suggested changes included expanding the 4-day duration of the course. Conclusion This pilot demonstrates that a low-fidelity, open-access course taught by local instructors can be successful in knowledge transfer. The BEC course was well-received and deemed context-relevant by pilot facilitators and participants in three East African countries. Further studies are needed to evaluate this course’s impact on clinical practice and patient outcomes."

Hemocyanins also interact with glycan-recognizing innate immune receptors on antigen-presenting cells, such as the C-type lectin immune receptors mannose receptor (MR), macrophage galactose lectin (MGL), and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), stimulating proinflammatory cytokine secretion. However, the role of N-linked oligosaccharides on the structural and immunological properties of hemocyanin is unclear. Mollusk hemocyanins, such as Concholepas concholepas (CCH), Fissurella latimarginata (FLH), and Megathura crenulata (KLH), are oligomeric glycoproteins with complex dodecameric quaternary structures and heterogeneous glycosylation patterns, primarily consisting of mannose-rich N-glycans. Here, we report that enzyme-catalyzed N-deglycosylation of CCH, FLH, and KLH disrupts their quaternary structure and impairs their immunogenic effects. Biochemical analyses revealed that the deglycosylation does not change hemocyanin secondary structure but alters their refolding mechanism and dodecameric structure. Immunochemical analyses indicated decreased binding of N-deglycosylated hemocyanins to the MR and MGL receptors and TLR4 and reduced endocytosis concomitant with an impaired production of tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukins 6 and 12 (IL-6 and IL-12p40, respectively) in macrophages. Evaluating the function of N-deglycosylated hemocyanins in the humoral immune response and their nonspecific antitumor effects in the B16F10 melanoma model, we found that compared with native hemocyanins N-deglycosylated hemocyanins elicited reduced antibody titers, as well as partially diminished antitumor effects and altered carrier activities.

Mollusk hemocyanins are high-molecular-weight oligomeric glycoproteins (4–8 MDa) characterized by a complex quaternary didecameric structure with repeated epitopes (3.Becker M.I. Arancibia S. Salazar F. Del Campo M. De Ioannes A.E. Duc Ht Mollusk Hemocyanins as Natural Immunostimulants in Biomedical Applications, Immune Response Activation. InTech, London, UK201410.5772/57552Google Scholar). These glycoproteins are composed of 10 subunits, which form hollow cylindrical structures known as decamers. Each subunit (350–450 kDa) has eight globular oxygen-binding domains, known as functional units (FUs), which are differentially glycosylated (13.Lieb B. Altenhein B. Markl J.

Additionally, gastropod hemocyanins are composed of one or two types of subunits associated noncovalently to form heterodidecameric structures, such as CCH, or homodidecameric structures, such as KLH and FLH (6.Arancibia S. Espinoza C. Salazar F. Del Campo M. Tampe R. Zhong T.Y. De Ioannes P. Moltedo B. Ferreira J. Lavelle E.C. Manubens A. De Ioannes A.E. Becker M.I.

Several studies using differential-scanning calorimetry have shown that hemocyanins exhibit considerable thermal stability (melting temperature in the range of 83–90 °C). Moreover, biophysical techniques suggest that hemocyanins are stable in a long range of pH values, which is probably a consequence of the interactions between subunits and the high degree of oligomerization that stabilize the quaternary structure (7.Siezen R.J. Van Bruggen E.F. Structure and properties of hemocyanins. XII. Electron microscopy of dissociation products of Helix pomatia α-hemocyanin: quaternary structure.J. Mol.

Another relevant characteristic of hemocyanins is their high-carbohydrate content, which comprises 3–4% (w/w) of the molecules, such as CCH and KLH; however, this value had not been determined until the present work for FLH. Hemocyanin N-glycosylation motifs are conserved near active sites and between binding sites of their subunits. These N-glycans participate in the assembly and stability of quaternary structures (17.Staudacher E. Stepan H. Gutternigg M. Protein N-glycosylation of gastropods.Curr. Top. Biochem. Res. 2009; 11 (21686044): 29-39PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, glycosylations increase protein solubility and prevent their denaturation or aggregation. Thus, glycans have been described as an essential post-translational modification in terms of protein stability (18.Solá R.J. Griebenow K. Glycosylation of therapeutic proteins: an effective strategy to optimize efficacy.BioDrugs. 2010; 24 (20055529): 9-2110.2165/11530550-000000000-00000Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Besides, hemocyanin glycans are highly heterogeneous and primarily composed of mannose-rich N-glycans, as well as N-mixed carbohydrates with fucose, galactose, GlcNAc, and glycosylation branches that are not found in mammals (19.Dolashka P.

J. 2004; 378 (14613482): 625-63210.1042/bj20031380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, hemocyanins contain highly immunogenic glycan patterns, such as Fuc(α1–3)GalNAc(β1–4)[Fuc(α1–3)]GlcNAc, also observed in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni (24.Kurokawa T. Wuhrer M.

Additionally, KLH contains Gal(β1–6)GalNAc, an immunogenic glycotope known as T antigen, which is present on some tumor cells (27.Wirguin I. Suturkova-Milosević L. Briani C. Latov N. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin contains Gal(β1–3)-GalNAc determinants that are cross-reactive with the T antigen.Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1995; 40 (7600562): 307-31010.1007/BF01519630PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, KLH and FLH, unlike CCH, exhibit exposed O-glycosylations and xylose. Therefore, it has been proposed that, in addition to their structural role, hemocyanin glycans could be highly immunogenic due to their heterogeneity and complexity (6.Arancibia S. Espinoza C. Salazar F. Del Campo M. Tampe R. Zhong T.Y. De Ioannes P. Moltedo B. Ferreira J. Lavelle E.C. Manubens A. De Ioannes A.E. Becker M.I.

Previous data have shown that hemocyanin glycans, which act as multivalent ligands, mediate their interactions with several innate immune receptors on murine antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as carbohydrate-recognizing C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In addition, CCH, FLH, and KLH bind in vitro to human mannose receptor (MR) and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3–grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) with high affinities in a glycan-dependent manner (28.Villar J. Participación de receptores lectina tipo C en el reconocimiento de hemocianinas de moluscos por cèlulas presentadoras de antígeno y consecuencias en la presentación antigènica. Tesis Magíster en Bioquímica, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile2016: 1-136Google Scholar). Moreover, KLH binding to human MR triggers proinflammatory responses in APCs (29.Presicce P. Taddeo A. Conti A. Villa M.L. Della Bella S. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin induces the activation and maturation of human dendritic cells through the involvement of mannose receptor.Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45 (17765973): 1136-114510.1016/j.molimm.2007.07.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similarly, TLR4 has been shown to participate in the immunostimulatory effects of CCH, FLH, and KLH in murine APCs (30.Jimènez J.M. Salazar M.L. Arancibia S. Villar J. Salazar F. Brown G.D. Lavelle E.C. Martínez-Pomares L. Ortiz-Quintero J. Lavandero S. Manubens A. Becker M.I. TLR4, but neither Dectin-1 nor Dectin-2, participates in the mollusk hemocyanin-induced proinflammatory effects in antigen-presenting cells from mammals.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 (31214162): 113610.3389/fimmu.2019.01136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All these receptors recognize glycosylated structures from pathogens and promote endocytosis, proinflammatory responses, and antigen presentation to T lymphocytes (31.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. The C-type lectin superfamily in the immune system.Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163 (9700499): 19-3410.1111/j.1600-065X.1998.tb01185.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 32.McGreal E.P.

Regarding hemocyanins, CCH, FLH, and KLH are incorporated by APCs by both macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis and then slowly processed (34.Arancibia S. Del Campo M. Nova E. Salazar F. Becker M.I. Enhanced structural stability of Concholepas hemocyanin increases its immunogenicity and maintains its nonspecific immunostimulatory effects.Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42 (22144228): 688-69910.1002/eji.201142011Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, hemocyanins undergo prolonged antigen presentation to T or B lymphocytes, promoting a Th1 immune response and the abovementioned antitumor effects. We have shown that hemocyanins promote the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by APCs, such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-12p40, with varying intensity and temporality for each hemocyanin (35.Zhong T.Y. Arancibia S. Born R. Tampe R. Villar J. Del Campo M. Manubens A. Becker M.I. Hemocyanins stimulate innate immunity by inducing different temporal patterns of proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages.J. Immunol. 2016; 196 (27183578): 4650-466210.4049/jimmunol.1501156Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to the beneficial proinflammatory effects of hemocyanins as adjuvants in the early steps of immune responses (30.Jimènez J.M. Salazar M.L. Arancibia S. Villar J. Salazar F. Brown G.D. Lavelle E.C. Martínez-Pomares L. Ortiz-Quintero J. Lavandero S. Manubens A. Becker M.I. TLR4, but neither Dectin-1 nor Dectin-2, participates in the mollusk hemocyanin-induced proinflammatory effects in antigen-presenting cells from mammals.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 (31214162): 113610.3389/fimmu.2019.01136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), these glycoproteins have been shown to induce a potent humoral and cellular immune response, as well as an antitumor effect in mammals by themselves. Indeed, CCH showed comparable antitumor properties to KLH, whereas FLH showed superior properties to KLH in B16F10 murine melanoma models (6.Arancibia S. Espinoza C. Salazar F. Del Campo M. Tampe R. Zhong T.Y. De Ioannes P. Moltedo B. Ferreira J. Lavelle E.C. Manubens A. De Ioannes A.E. Becker M.I.

Similarly, these hemocyanins displayed antitumor effects in models of superficial bladder cancer and oral cancer, as well as a carrier of a tumor associate mimotope of melanoma (36.Becker M.I.

Furthermore, RtH and HpH had potential antitumor effects in a murine model of colon carcinoma (40.Gesheva V. Chausheva S. Mihaylova N. Manoylov I. Doumanova L. Idakieva K. Tchorbanov A. Anti-cancer properties of gastropodan hemocyanins in murine model of colon carcinoma.BMC immunol. 2014; 15 (25168124): 3410.1186/s12865-014-0034-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and HaH showed antiproliferative effects in various carcinoma cell lines (41.Zheng L.

Remarkably, previous results showed that the chemical deglycosylation of FLH significantly decreased its antitumor properties in a murine B16F10 melanoma model. Moreover, in vitro analyses of cytokine secretion by murine APCs showed that chemically-deglycosylated FLH induced a decreased amount of IL-6 and IL-12p40, suggesting that heterogeneous hemocyanin glycans might act as multivalent ligands and contribute to their extensive immune effects (6.Arancibia S.

Furthermore, shared glycan epitopes between hemocyanins and tumor cells induce cross-reacting antibodies, which promote antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity against tumors (25.Geyer H. Wuhrer M.

However, despite all of these and other potential applications of hemocyanins, the mechanism by which they act as nonspecific immunomodulators as well as the role of N-glycans to these effects have not been comprehensively elucidated. In this context, this study investigated whether enzymatic N-deglycosylation of CCH, FLH, and KLH with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; EC 3.5.1.52) affects their structural, immunogenic, and nonspecific immunomodulatory properties. Hemocyanin residual glycans were analyzed by lectin array blotting, revealing a partial but significant glycan removal. Transmission EM (TEM) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses showed that hemocyanin N-deglycosylation decreased their didecameric quaternary structure. Moreover, CD analyses showed that hemocyanin N-glycans contributed to the refolding of these proteins. Furthermore, we showed that N-glycans contributed to the recognition of the hemocyanins by different chimeric innate immune receptors, because ELISA analyses showed decreased binding of N-deglycosylated hemocyanins. In addition, analyses of J774.2 murine macrophages by flow cytometry and ELISA demonstrated decreased endocytosis of N-deglycosylated FLH and KLH, together with impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines. Finally, the immunogenic activity caused by N-deglycosylated hemocyanins was evaluated in the B16F10 murine melanoma model and showed a diminish"
https://openalex.org/W2986345764,"Children, across cultures, show an early-emerging tendency to essentialize gender, viewing gender as inborn and predictive of stereotypical preferences. However, research has been limited to children whose own gender experience is largely consistent with the assumptions of gender essentialism. In contrast, transgender children have gender identities (and related stereotypical preferences) that differ from their sex assigned at birth, which therefore appear to challenge an essentialist view of gender. In the current study, we examined the degree to which transgender children (N = 97, 3–11 years) view a child’s sex at birth as predictive of their later gender-typed preferences. Additionally, we recruited two comparison groups: cisgender siblings of transgender participants (N = 59) and cisgender, age- and gender-matched controls (N = 90). In an adapted switched-at-birth paradigm, participants in all groups believed that a child’s sex at birth would predict their later gender-typed preferences; participants were especially likely to think so when the target character was reared in a socialization environment that aligned with the target’s own gender, rather than one where the socialization environment aligned with a different gender. Whereas cisgender participants showed a decline in essentialism with age, transgender children did not show any age-related changes in their beliefs. The current findings are the first to show that transgender and cisgender children, despite differences in gender experiences, might similarly essentialize gender. However, these findings also raise questions about how different participant groups might interpret measures differently."
https://openalex.org/W2986998890,"Postpartum depression is a non-psychotic disorder that happens during the first 1year after childbirth. It affects both the mother's health and child's development and is given significant public health concern in developed countries. However, in developing countries including Ethiopia, postnatal care is mainly concerned with obstetric problems and the baby's health, while the psychological well-being of the mother is given little attention. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of postpartum depression among women in Nekemte town, East Wollega zone, West Ethiopia, 2019.Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 295 postnatal women, from May 15 to June 5, 2019, in Nekemte town. The study participants were selected by a simple random sampling method and interviewed using structured questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was used to find the independent variables which are associated with postnatal depression. All associations between dependent and independent variables and statistical significance were measured using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval and p-value less than 0.05.From the total of 295 women sampled, 287 were participated in the study. Out of these 287 women participated, 20.9% had developed postnatal depression. Unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 7.84, 95% CI: 3.19, 19.26), Being first time mother (AOR = 4.99, 95% CI: 1.54, 16.09), History of previous depression (AOR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.06, 8.82), Domestic violence (AOR = 5.92, 95% CI: 2.44, 14.40), History of substance use (AOR = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.52, 10.30) and poor social support (AOR = 6.59, 95% CI: 2.25, 19.29) were significantly associated with postnatal depression.In this study, the magnitude of postnatal depression was found moderate compared to other studies. Perinatal depression screening and intervention need to be integrated with maternal health care services, especially for mothers at risk of postnatal depression."
https://openalex.org/W2985877532,"Residential land is expanding in the United States, and lawn now covers more area than the country's leading irrigated crop by area. Given that lawns are widespread across diverse climatic regions and there is rising concern about the environmental impacts associated with their management, there is a clear need to understand the geographic variation, drivers, and outcomes of common yard care practices. We hypothesized that 1) income, age, and the number of neighbors known by name will be positively associated with the odds of having irrigated, fertilized, or applied pesticides in the last year, 2) irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application will vary quadratically with population density, with the highest odds in suburban areas, and 3) the odds of irrigating will vary by climate, but fertilization and pesticide application will not. We used multi-level models to systematically address nested spatial scales within and across six U.S. metropolitan areas-Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. We found significant variation in yard care practices at the household (the relationship with income was positive), urban-exurban gradient (the relationship with population density was an inverted U), and regional scales (city-to-city variation). A multi-level modeling framework was useful for discerning these scale-dependent outcomes because this approach controls for autocorrelation at multiple spatial scales. Our findings may guide policies or programs seeking to mitigate the potentially deleterious outcomes associated with water use and chemical application, by identifying the subpopulations most likely to irrigate, fertilize, and/or apply pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W2984412925,"BRCA2 (also known as FANCD1) is a core component of the Fanconi pathway and suppresses transformation of immature T-cells in mice. However, the contribution of Fanconi-BRCA pathway deficiency to human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains undefined. We identified point mutations in 9 (23%) of 40 human T-ALL cases analyzed, with variant allele fractions consistent with heterozygous mutations early in tumor evolution. Two of these mutations were present in remission bone marrow specimens, suggesting germline alterations. BRCA2 was the most commonly mutated gene. The identified Fanconi-BRCA mutations encode hypomorphic or null alleles, as evidenced by their inability to fully rescue Fanconi-deficient cells from chromosome breakage, cytotoxicity and/or G2/M arrest upon treatment with DNA cross-linking agents. Disabling the tumor suppressor activity of the Fanconi-BRCA pathway is generally thought to require biallelic gene mutations. However, all mutations identified were monoallelic, and most cases appeared to retain expression of the wild-type allele. Using isogenic T-ALL cells, we found that BRCA2 haploinsufficiency induces selective hypersensitivity to ATR inhibition, in vitro and in vivo. These findings implicate Fanconi-BRCA pathway haploinsufficiency in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL, and provide a therapeutic rationale for inhibition of ATR or other druggable effectors of homologous recombination."

Then, computational fluid dynamics(CFD) models were built on the base of the CT scans using Mimics and ANSYS ICEM CFD software. The internal airflow of the upper airways was simulated using ANSYS-FLUENT and the results were analyzed using ANSYS-CFD-Post. The data were analyzed to identify the most important changes of biomechanical properties between patients with and without OA intervention. Upper airway morphology and the internal airflow changes were compared using t-tests and Spearman correlation coefficient analysis.The narrowest area of upper airways was found to be located in the lower bound of velopharynx, where the volume and pressure were statistically significantly increased (P<0.05) and the air velocity was statistically significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the presence of the OA(P<0.05). After wearing OA, pharyngeal resistance was significantly decreased (P<0.05), from 290.63 to 186.25Pa/L, and the airflow resistance of the pharynx has reduced by 35.9%.The enlargement of the upper airway after wearing the OA changed its airflow dynamics, which decreased the negative pressure and resistance in narrow areas of the upper airways. Thus, the collapsibility of the upper airways was reduced and patency was sustained."
https://openalex.org/W2985701095,"Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) remains a major health security threat worldwide. The effectiveness of implementation of DR-TB control strategies has been a subject of research and controversy. In resource-limited settings, using conventional medicine as the only framework to explain DR-TB gives a rather incomplete picture of the disease. This study intended to explore the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers on the management and control of DR-TB in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods The study employed a qualitative methodology with an inductive approach and a thematic analysis. It involved in-depth interviews with healthcare workers providing clinical services to DR-TB patients in 10 public healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Results A total of 18 healthcare workers participated until data saturation, which included 12 clinical nurses, four health officers and two medical laboratory technicians. The findings show that healthcare workers perceive DR-TB as a growing public health threat in Ethiopia, due to factors such as poverty, poor nutrition, crowded settings, healthcare worker and general public awareness of DR-TB, lack of good governance and culture. Conclusion The perspectives drawn from the healthcare workers shed more light on the image of DR-TB in a developing country context. It has been shown that understanding DR-TB is not confined to what can be drawn from the sphere of biomedicine. There are also interconnected barriers, which predict a dystopia in the epidemiology of DR-TB. Bringing DR-TB under control requires taking a step back from an overwhelming focus on the biomedical facets of the disease, and employ critical thinking on the wider social and structural forces as equally important targets."

Our study aimed to assess the association of haemoglobin (Hb) in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and restoration of low Hb levels, with pregnancy outcomes in Australia. Methods Clinical data for singleton pregnancies from two tertiary public hospitals in New South Wales were extracted for 2011–2015. The relationship between the lowest Hb result in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and adverse outcomes was determined using adjusted Poisson regression. Those with Hb <110 g/L were classified into ‘restored’ and ‘not restored’ based on Hb results from 21 weeks onwards, and risk of adverse outcomes explored with adjusted Poisson regression. Results Of 31,906 singleton pregnancies, 4.0% had Hb <110 and 10.2% had ≥140 g/L at ≤20 weeks. Women with low Hb had significantly higher risks of postpartum haemorrhage, transfusion, preterm birth, very low birthweight, and having a baby transferred to higher care or stillbirth. High Hb was also associated with higher risks of preterm, very low birthweight, and transfer to higher care/stillbirth. Transfusion was the only outcome where risk decreased with increasing Hb. Risk of transfusion was significantly lower in the ‘restored’ group compared with the ‘not restored’ group (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22–0.70), but restoration of Hb did not significantly affect the other outcomes measured. Conclusions Women with both low and high Hb in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy had higher risks of adverse outcomes than those with normal Hb. Restoring Hb after 20 weeks did not improve most adverse outcome rates but did reduce risk of transfusion."

This study aimed to clarify the factors related to subclinical arteriosclerosis, including the histopathological severity of the disease and PNPLA3 gene polymorphisms, in NAFLD patients. We measured brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) as an index of arterial stiffness in 153 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients. The baPWV values were significantly higher in the advanced fibrosis group than in the less advanced group (median, 1679 cm/s vs 1489 cm/s; p = 5.49×10-4). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that older age (≥55 years) (p = 8.57×10-3; OR = 3.03), hypertension (p = 1.05×10-3; OR = 3.46), and advanced fibrosis (p = 9.22×10-3; OR = 2.94) were independently linked to baPWV ≥1600 cm/s. NAFLD patients were categorized into low-risk group (number of risk factors = 0), intermediate-risk group (= 1), and high-risk group (≥2) based on their risk factors, including older age, hypertension, and biopsy-confirmed advanced fibrosis. The prevalence of baPWV ≥1600 cm/s was 7.1% (3/42) in the low-risk group, 30.8% (12/39) in the intermediate-risk group, and 63.9% (46/72) in the high-risk group. Non-invasive liver fibrosis markers and scores, including the FIB-4 index, NAFLD fibrosis score, hyaluronic acid, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin positive Mac-2-binding protein, and type IV collagen 7s, were feasible substitutes for invasive liver biopsy. Older age, hypertension, and advanced fibrosis are independently related to arterial stiffness, and a combination of these three factors may predict risk of arteriosclerosis in NAFLD patients."

As cmo disease in mice, the experimental model analogous to human CRMO, is mediated specifically by IL-1β and not by IL-1α, delineating the molecular pathways contributing to pathogenic IL-1β production is crucial to developing targeted therapies. In particular, our earlier findings support redundant roles of NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and caspase-1 with caspase-8 in instigating cmo.

In addition, reduced IL-1β production and abolished caspase-8 activation in Ripk3−/− bone marrow–derived dendritic cells suggest that RIPK3 is required for caspase-8 activation and subsequent release of IL-1β (20Moriwaki K.

Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) acts as an inflammasome sensor for cytosolic DNA, and it activates caspase-1 through the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC). AIM2 induces caspase-8 activation in caspase-1–deficient macrophages in the context of several bacterial infections, including Burkholderia (21Bast A. Krause K. Schmidt I.H. Pudla M. Brakopp S.

Given their established functions in caspase-8 activation under various conditions, we explored the roles of RIPK3 and AIM2 in mediating caspase-8 activation in Pstpip2cmo mice by analyzing cmo disease progression in NLRP3- and RIPK3-deficient Pstpip2cmo mice (Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Ripk3−/−) and NLRP3- and AIM2-deficient Pstpip2cmo mice (Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Aim2−/−). All mice with both genotypes (Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Ripk3−/− and Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Aim2−/−) developed disease similarly to Pstpip2cmo mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scans of the inflamed areas revealed an extensive reduction in bone density and structural malformation in the feet of these mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Further, massive lymphomegaly was observed in the popliteal lymph nodes draining inflamed footpads (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggest that RIPK3 and AIM2 are dispensable for disease progression in Pstpip2cmo mice. In addition to the role of SYK in innate immune signaling pathways (13Lin Y.C. Huang D.Y. Chu C.L.

The SYK adaptor protein caspase recruitment domain–containing protein 9 (CARD9) is expressed primarily in lymphoid tissues and contributes to innate immune signaling in response to fungal, viral, and bacterial infections (25Malik A.

Given that SYK and CARD9 are involved in caspase-8 activation and subsequent IL-1β processing in bone marrow–derived dendritic cells during fungal infection (16Gringhuis S.I. Kaptein T.M. Wevers B.A. Theelen B. van der Vlist M. Boekhout T. Geijtenbeek T.B. Dectin-1 is an extracellular pathogen sensor for the induction and processing of IL-1β via a noncanonical caspase-8 inflammasome.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 (22267217): 246-25410.1038/ni.2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), we explored the respective contributions of SYK and CARD9 to disease progression in Pstpip2cmo mice. First, we monitored disease progression in Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Sykfl/flLysMcre mice and Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Card9−/− mice. Although Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/− Card9−/− mice did not show protection from disease, Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Sykfl/flLysMcre mice displayed nearly complete protection (Fig. 2, A and B). Next we investigated whether deletion of SYK in Pstpip2cmo mice with intact NLRP3 would be sufficient to provide protection from disease. We found that myeloid-specific deletion of SYK alone in Pstpip2cmo mice (Pstpip2cmoSykfl/flLysMcre) provided complete protection from disease (Fig. 2C). The structural bone lesions found by micro-CT and the popliteal lymphomegaly observed in Pstpip2cmo, Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−, and Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Card9−/− mice were rescued in Pstpip2cmoNlrp3−/−Sykfl/flLysMcre and Pstpip2cmo Sykfl/flLysMcre mice (Fig. 2, A–C). Taken together, these data suggest that SYK functions upstream of both caspase-1 and caspase-8 in inducing cmo disease, that SYK is sufficient and necessary for cmo disease induction, and that NLRP3 and CARD9 are dispensable for cmo disease progression. Disease in cmo mice is mediated by the cytokine IL-1β (9Lukens J.R. Gross J.M. Calabrese C. Iwakura Y. Lamkanfi M. Vogel P. Kanneganti T.D. Critical role for inflammasome-independent IL-1β production in osteomyelitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24395792): 1066-107110.1073/pnas.1318688111Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of SYK in regulating IL-1β up-regulation in cmo, we first measured pro-IL-1β expression and SYK activation in the footpads of WT and Pstpip2cmo mice. Footpads from Pstpip2cmo mice had increased pro-IL-1β expression and SYK activation with respect to those of WT mice (Fig. 3A). Myeloid-specific deletion of SYK in Pstpip2cmo mice reduced the expression of pro-IL-1β in footpads to a level similar to that of WT mice without affecting the expression of caspase-1 or caspase-8 (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these data, the expression of pro-IL-1β induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment was increased in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from Pstpip2cmo mice relative to that of BMDMs from WT mice (Fig. 3B). The increased pro-IL-1β expression in Pstpip2cmo mice correlated with activation of SYK. Myeloid-specific deletion of SYK in Pstpip2cmo mice abolished the increased induction of pro-IL-1β in BMDMs upon LPS stimulation relative to Pstpip2cmo BMDMs without affecting the expression of caspase-1 and caspase-8 (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest a primary role for SYK in mediating pro-IL-1β production and cmo disease progression. We next sought to identify additional intracellular signaling pathways mediated by SYK signaling that contribute to induction of pro-IL-1β expression and excessive inflammation in Pstpip2cmo mice. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ASK1 and ASK2 centrally regulate NF-κB and downstream MAP kinases, including JNK, ERK, and p38, to drive autoinflammatory disease progression in the Ptpn6spin mouse model of neutrophilic dermatosis (28Tartey S. Gurung P. Dasari T.K. Burton A. Kanneganti T.D. ASK1/2 signaling promotes inflammation in a mouse model of neutrophilic dermatosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 (29629899): 2042-204710.1172/JCI98446Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling promote cmo disease progression and that SYK plays a role in regulating this signaling. Although there was more activation of NF-κB and ERK in the footpads of Pstpip2cmo mice compared with WT mice, JNK and p38 were activated similarly (Fig. 3C). However, deletion of SYK reversed the elevated NF-κB but not ERK activation in Pstpip2cmo mice, suggesting that NF-κB plays an important role downstream of SYK to mediate persistent inflammation in cmo disease. Furthermore, SYK has been shown to regulate inflammasome activation and IL-1β maturation downstream of dectin-1 signaling (16Gringhuis S.I. Kaptein T.M. Wevers B.A. Theelen B. van der Vlist M. Boekhout T. Geijtenbeek T.B. Dectin-1 is an extracellular pathogen sensor for the induction and processing of IL-1β via a noncanonical caspase-8 inflammasome.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 (22267217): 246-25410.1038/ni.2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether SYK regulates both NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-8 activation upstream of IL-1β production. We observed similar caspase-1 and caspase-8 cleavage in BMDMs derived from WT, Pstpip2cmo, and Pstpip2cmoSykfl/flLysMcre mice in response to the classical NLRP3 inflammasome trigger LPS + ATP, which was further supported by the similar gasdermin D (GSDMD) activation observed among these genotypes (Fig. 3D). In addition, we further noticed that SYK deficiency did not affect the expression of pro-IL-1β, NLRP3, and ASC, all of which are crucial components of inflammasome signaling (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that SYK does not regulate the caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation mediated by the classical NLRP3 trigger. Overall, our data indicate that SYK regulates NF-κB signaling, but not inflammasome activation, for the induction of pro-IL-1β to mediate disease progression in Pstpip2cmo mice. Cmo has been shown to be mediated by pathological IL-1β production downstream of NLRP3/caspase-1 and caspase-8 (9Lukens J.R. Gross J.M. Calabrese C. Iwakura Y. Lamkanfi M. Vogel P. Kanneganti T.D.

Disease progression occurs despite single deficiency of either caspase-1 or caspase-8 (12Gurung P. Burton A. Kanneganti T.D. NLRP3 inflammasome plays a redundant role with caspase 8 to promote IL-1β-mediated osteomyelitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although caspase-1 and caspase-8 have both been shown to colocalize with AIM2/ASC speck to mediate pro-IL-1β cleavage (22Pierini R. Juruj C. Perret M. Jones C.L. Mangeot P. Weiss D.S. Henry T. AIM2/ASC triggers caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in Francisella-infected caspase-1-deficient macrophages.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19 (22555457): 1709-172110.1038/cdd.2012.51Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), AIM2 deficiency did not provide protection in Pstpip2cmo mice, further supporting that, in cmo disease, caspase-1 and caspase-8 operate and are activated independently in distinct complexes. In this study, we demonstrated that deficiency of SYK in Pstpip2cmo mice prevented the induction of osteomyelitis. SYK signaling upstream of caspase-1 and caspase-8 to promote pro-IL-1β production centrally mediates cmo disease induction. Thus, it is interesting that deficiency of the SYK adaptor protein CARD9 did not provide protection in Pstpip2cmo mice. In addition to promoting pro-IL-1β synthesis, SYK, but not CARD9, has been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation during fungal infection (29Gross O. Poeck H. Bscheider M. Dostert C. Hannesschläger N. Endres S. Hartmann G. Tardivel A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Mocsai A. Tschopp J. Ruland J.

This suggests that the CARD9 pathway selectively transduces SYK signaling to promote pro-IL-1β synthesis but not inflammasome activation. Additionally, several reports have highlighted the role of SYK in regulation of the NLRP3- and caspase-8-mediated inflammasomes (16Gringhuis S.I. Kaptein T.M. Wevers B.A. Theelen B. van der Vlist M.

However, our data with the canonical NLRP3 trigger LPS + ATP did not reveal a dependence of caspase-1 and caspase-8 processing on SYK, suggesting an exclusively diverse but specific role for SYK in mediating cmo disease. In this regard, SYK primarily acts as a pivotal regulator of pro-IL-1β synthesis but not as a regulator of inflammasome activation; however, these two processes both converge toward the production of active IL-1β. Recent evidence has also established central roles for the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β signaling in several additional related disorders of nonbacterial osteomyelitis, including Majeed syndrome; synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome; and deficiency of IL-1R antagonist (3Hofmann S.R.

Our findings provide an important context for evaluating the role of SYK in mediating these related autoinflammatory bone disorders and for the therapeutic potential of SYK inhibitors in this disease spectrum. The central regulatory role of SYK is not confined to IL-1β–mediated autoinflammatory disease. We have reported previously that SYK licenses MyD88 to induce IL-1α–mediated inflammatory disease in Ptpn6spin mice (31Gurung P. Fan G. Lukens J.R. Vogel P. Tonks N.K. Kanneganti T.D. Tyrosine kinase SYK licenses MyD88 adaptor protein to instigate IL-1α-mediated inflammatory disease.Immunity. 2017; 46 (28410990): 635-64810.1016/j.immuni.2017.03.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed increased activation of SYK in the absence of PSTPIP2, suggesting that PSTPIP2 functions to suppress SYK signaling. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind SYK activation by PSTPIP2 require further investigation. Recent evidence has established that PSTPIP2 interacts with SHIP1, which is encoded by Ptpn6 (32Drobek A. Kralova J. Skopcova T. Kucova M. Novák P. Angelisová P. Otahal P. Alberich-Jorda M. Brdicka T. PSTPIP2, a protein associated with autoinflammatory disease, interacts with inhibitory enzymes SHIP1 and Csk.J. Immunol. 2015; 195 (26304991): 3416-342610.4049/jimmunol.1401494Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that SHIP1 may be able to modulate SYK activation through its phosphatase activity. SYK signaling is known to be activated downstream of various cell surface receptors, including CD74, integrins, C-type lectin receptors (dectin-1 and dectin-2), and Fc receptors (27Mócsai A. Ruland J. Tybulewicz V.L. The SYK tyrosine kinase: a crucial player in diverse biological functions.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10 (20467426): 387-40210.1038/nri2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Identification of the specific triggers of SYK activation in these Pstpip2cmo mice would further clarify the signaling mechanism and provide a deeper understanding of the progression of cmo disease. SYK signaling has also been strongly associated with the recruitment of neutrophils to areas of inflammation (33Van Ziffle J.A. Lowell C.A. Neutrophil-specific deletion of Syk kinase results in reduced host defense to bacterial infection.Blood. 2009; 114 (19797524): 4871-488210.1182/blood-2009-05-220806Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The marked reductions in inflammation and lymphomegaly seen in SYK-deficient Pstpip2cmo mice indicate that SYK signaling potentially mediates neutrophil recruitment in Pstpip2cmo mice. Although T cell dysregulation has been associated with inflammatory bone diseases, previous studies have characterized the osteomyelitis in cmo disease by increased neutrophil numbers without T cell abnormalities (9Lukens J.R. Gross J.M. Calabrese C. Iwakura Y. Lamkanfi M. Vogel P. Kanneganti T.D. Critical role for inflammasome-independent IL-1β production in osteomyelitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As neutrophils have been implicated as major contributors to IL-1β production in cmo (11Lukens J.R. Gurung P. Vogel P. Johnson G.R. Carter R.A. McGoldrick D.J. Bandi S.R. Calabrese C.R. Vande Walle L. Lamkanfi M. Kanneganti T.D.

Previous studies have shown that inhibition of signaling pathways highly associated with caspase-8 activation and inflammatory bone disease, such as tumor necrosis factor signaling, fails to protect against cmo disease (9Lukens J.R.

This also indicates that current guidelines for the therapeutic use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in the subset of patients with CRMO and concurrent autoimmune diseases may not be effective in treating CRMO. Therapeutic options for the largely pediatric and adolescent CRMO population are limited by nonspecificity and inadequate control of pain and disease progression, which can result in physical disabilities or permanent deformities. As genetic deletion of Syk in the myeloid compartment of Pstpip2cmo mice resulted in complete prevention of disease induction and progression, SYK and its downstream signaling components represent promising novel therapeutic targets in CRMO.

https://openalex.org/W2983989124,"The cornea is the most highly innervated tissue in the body. It is generally accepted that corneal stromal nerves penetrate the epithelial basal lamina giving rise to intra-epithelial nerves. During the course of a study wherein we imaged corneal nerves in mice, we observed a novel neuronal-epithelial cell interaction whereby nerves approaching the epithelium in the cornea fused with basal epithelial cells, such that their plasma membranes were continuous and the neuronal axoplasm freely abutted the epithelial cytoplasm. In this study we sought to determine the frequency, distribution, and morphological profile of neuronal-epithelial cell fusion events within the cornea. Serial electron microscopy images were obtained from the anterior stroma in the paralimbus and central cornea of 8–10 week old C57BL/6J mice. We found evidence of a novel alternative behavior involving a neuronal-epithelial interaction whereby 42.8% of central corneal nerve bundles approaching the epithelium contain axons that fuse with basal epithelial cells. The average surface-to-volume ratio of a penetrating nerve was 3.32, while the average fusing nerve was smaller at 1.39 (p ≤ 0.0001). Despite this, both neuronal-epithelial cell interactions involve similarly sized discontinuities in the basal lamina. In order to verify the plasma membrane continuity between fused neurons and epithelial cells we used the lipophilic membrane tracer DiI. The majority of corneal nerves were labeled with DiI after application to the trigeminal ganglion and, consistent with our ultrastructural observations, fusion sites recognized as DiI-labeled basal epithelial cells were located at points of stromal nerve termination. These studies provide evidence that neuronal-epithelial cell fusion is a cell-cell interaction that occurs primarily in the central cornea, and fusing nerve bundles are morphologically distinct from penetrating nerve bundles. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of neuronal-epithelial cell fusion in the literature adding a new level of complexity to the current understanding of corneal innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2984129932,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial dysfunction are related to neuron loss in multiple sclerosis (MS). Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) appears to play a key role in modulating levels of mitochondrial ROS, antioxidants, and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), and PGC-1α expression is reduced in the neocortex of patients with MS, it is unclear what its role is in neurons and in the manifestation of clinical symptoms of MS. Here, we show in wild-type (WT) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice that PGC-1α is decreased 13 d after EAE induction followed by a steady decline up to 20 d. These changes were accompanied by parallel alterations in levels of superoxide dismutase 2, peroxiredoxin 3, thioredoxin 2, UCP4, and UCP5. In transgenic (TG) mice with neuron-specific overexpression of PGC-1α (PGC-1αf/fEno2-Cre), clinical symptoms after EAE induction were delayed and less severe than in WT mice. The degrees of apoptotic neuron loss and demyelination were also less severe in PGC-1α-TG mice. Overexpression of PGC-1α in neuronal neuroblastoma spinal cord 34 cells subjected to EAE inflammatory conditions showed similar results to those obtained in vivo. RNA sequencing analysis showed that apoptotic processes were significantly enriched in the top 10 significant gene ontology (GO) terms of differentially expressed genes, and the apoptotic pathway was significantly enriched in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Our findings indicate that up-regulation of neuronal PGC-1α protected neurons from apoptosis in EAE. Manipulating PGC-1α levels in MS may help stave off this devastating disease.-Dang, C., Han, B., Li, Q., Han, R., Hao, J.

https://openalex.org/W2985010893,"In this paper, we propose a predictive Generalized OBF (Orthonormal Basis Functions)-Fuzzy flow control scheme for the 5G downlink by deriving an expression for the optimal control rate of the traffic sources considering minimization of data delay and a minimum traffic rate to the users. The adaptive GOBF-Fuzzy model is applied to predict queueing behavior in initial 5G systems. To this end, we propose to obtain orthonormal basis functions related to the real traffic flows via multifractal modeling, inserting these functions into the fuzzy model trained with the LMS (Least Mean Square) adaptive algorithm. Simulations of a F-OFDM (Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) based 5G Downlink are carried out to validate the proposed flow control algorithm. Comparisons with other predictive control schemes in the literature prove the efficiency of the adaptive GOBF-fuzzy based control in enhancing the performance of the system downlink as well as guaranteeing some QoS (Quality of Service) parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2985085190,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), one of the major global threats to human security, has serious negative consequences for both health and economies. Excessive and inappropriate uses of antibiotics are the main drivers of the emergence of resistant bacterial strains. In Thailand, antibiotics have been used in citrus production since 2012 to treat citrus greening disease or Huanglongbing disease, despite no antibiotics being registered for use in mandarin. This raises concerns about irrational use of antibiotics, which can cause AMR.To assess the status of greening disease and the use of antibiotics in mandarin production.A face-to-face interview survey in 2017 with 221 mandarin growers in two major mandarin-producing areas.Greening disease is one of the most serious diseases in mandarins and farmers in the two major mandarin-producing areas in Thailand used ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline and penicillin to treat it. As no antibiotics are registered for use in plants, farmers used antibiotics (registered with the Thai Food and Drug Administration) for human use, either active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished products. They commonly purchased them from retail pharmacies or agrochemical suppliers. Farmers were influenced to use antibiotics by their orchard neighbours and advice from a few academics. The farmers injected antibiotics into the tree trunks approximately three to four times a year and stopped for more than two months before harvesting for in-season fruits.Antibiotics registered for human use are being applied to control greening diseases. We recommend scaling up sustainable disease control measures and curtail the use of antibiotics through close and effective dialogue among 'One Health' partners."

Eighty non-obese single-pregnant women diagnosed with GDM were included into the case group (GDM, n = 80), together with another eighty pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance were matched in the same period and divided into the control group (CON, n = 80), for detecting multiple biochemical indicators in different pregnancy stages by ELISA.The serum levels of PTX3 and hs-CRP in pregnant women increased with the increase of gestational age (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). The levels of PTX3 and hs-CRP in group GDM were significantly higher in the middle and late pregnancy stages than group CON (p < 0.01, p < 0.05; p < 0.05, p < 0.05). PTX3 was positively correlated with hs-CRP, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR).PTX3 and hs-CRP may be related to the pathogenesis of GDM, and they are significantly increased in the second trimester, which provides a new idea for early prevention and treatment of GDM and risk prediction of long-term cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2987401457,"Introduction Although a concentric pattern of left ventricular (LV) geometry appears to be common in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), there is no accepted method for diagnosing LV abnormalities in FRDA, sex and body size have often not been taken into consideration, and it has not been clear whether children and adults should be classified using the same criteria. The aim of this study was to better define the LV geometric changes in FRDA with respect to sex, body size and subject age, and to investigate the relationship of LV changes with genetic severity, as assessed by GAA repeat length within the shorter allele of the FXN gene (GAA1). Methods Echocardiography was performed in 216 subjects (68 children, 148 adults), measurements were made at end-diastole of LV internal diameter (LVEDID), septal wall thickness (SWT), LV length (LVEDL) and LV volume (LVEDV), and calculations were made of relative wall thickness (RWT), LV mass and LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Results The most common LV abnormalities in both adults and children with FRDA were increases in RWT and age-normalized RWT. In adults with a normal LVEF, all LV variables other than RWT were larger in males independent of body surface area (BSA), and all LV variables other than SWT and RWT were positively correlated with BSA. After adjustment for sex and BSA, GAA1 was a positive correlate of SWT and RWT (but not of LV mass), and was an inverse correlate of LVEDID, LVEDL and LVEDV. In children with a normal LVEF, SWT, LV mass and LVEDL were larger in males than females after adjusting for BSA, and in combination with sex, BSA was a positive correlate of all the LV variables except SWT and RWT. In children there were no correlations of GAA1 with any of the LV variables. Conclusion In FRDA, increases in RWT and age-normalized RWT are the most frequent LV structural abnormalities, sex and body size are important determinants of most other LV structural variables in both children and adults, and increased genetic severity is associated with a smaller left ventricle and increased LV wall thickness in adults, but not associated with LV size or wall thickness in children."
https://openalex.org/W2984814065,"The stegosaur species Miragaia longicollum was erected based on a partial anterior skeleton from the Upper Jurassic of Portugal. Until then, almost all stegosaur specimens in Portugal and Spain had been identified as Dacentrurus armatus, the sister taxon of M. longicollum and only other member of the clade Dacentrurinae. The holotypes of the two species have little overlap, since the holotype of D. armatus is mostly a posterior skeleton, so the classification of other specimens to either species is unclear and the validity of M. longicollum has been questioned and debated. Here we describe a largely complete specimen of M. longicollum discovered in 1959 in Atouguia da Baleia, Peniche, Portugal, consisting of both anterior and posterior portions of the skeleton. Comparisons to the holotypes of dacentrurines and other stegosaurs shed light on the convoluted relationships of this group. We conclude that M. longicollum is valid and rather different from D. armatus, and provide a revised diagnosis of M. longicollum, as well as revised diagnoses for D. armatus, Dacentrurinae, and the first diagnosis of the genus Miragaia, granting stability to these taxa and allowing new considerations to be given on the classification of other Iberian stegosaurs. This new specimen is, to date, the most complete dinosaur described from Portugal and the most complete stegosaur described from Europe. Miragaia shared anatomical features that show a close affinity to Alcovasaurus longispinus, confirming this to be the first known dacentrurine stegosaur in America, coherent with the hypothesis of an ephemeral land bridge between North America and Iberia that allowed faunal exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2987649480,"Nemaline myopathy (NEM) is a congenital neuromuscular disorder primarily caused by nebulin gene (NEB) mutations. NEM is characterized by muscle weakness for which currently no treatments exist. In NEM patients a predominance of type I fibers has been found. Thus, therapeutic options targeting type I fibers could be highly beneficial for NEM patients. Because type I muscle fibers express the same myosin isoform as cardiac muscle (Myh7), the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), a small molecule activator of Myh7, was studied in a nebulin-based NEM mouse model (Neb cKO). Skinned single fibers were activated by exogenous calcium and force was measured at a wide range of calcium concentrations. Maximal specific force of type I fibers was much less in fibers from Neb cKO animals and calcium sensitivity of permeabilized single fibers was reduced (pCa50 6.12 ±0.08 (cKO) vs 6.36 ±0.08 (CON)). OM increased the calcium sensitivity of type I single muscle fibers. The greatest effect occurred in type I fibers from Neb cKO muscle where OM restored the calcium sensitivity to that of the control type I fibers. Forces at submaximal activation levels (pCa 6.0-6.5) were significantly increased in Neb cKO fibers (~50%) but remained below that of control fibers. OM also increased isometric force and power during isotonic shortening of intact whole soleus muscle of Neb cKO mice, with the largest effects at physiological stimulation frequencies. We conclude that OM has the potential to improve the quality of life of NEM patients by increasing the force of type I fibers at submaximal activation levels."
https://openalex.org/W2989377517,"Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) is often chosen as an effective experimental method for analyzing gene expression. However, an appropriate reference gene as a standard is needed to obtain accurate gene expression data. To date, no internal reference genes have been reported for research on cranberries. Expanding the selection of internal reference genes for cranberry will enable reliable gene expression analysis, and, at the same time, can also lay a solid foundation for revealing the biological characteristics of cranberry. Here, we selected ten candidate reference gene families and used three statistical software tools-geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper-to evaluate their expression stability under the influence of different experimental factors. The results showed that protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit (PP2A) or RNA helicase-like 8 (RH 8) was the best choice for an internal reference gene when analyzing different cranberry cultivars. In two sample sets comprising different cranberry organs and three abiotic stress treatments, sand family protein (SAND) was the best choice as a reference gene. In this study, we screened genes that are stably expressed under the influence of various experimental factors by qRT-PCR. Our results will guide future studies involving gene expression analysis of cranberry."
https://openalex.org/W2985685230,"As the use of environmental-DNA (eDNA) expands as a method to detect the presence and quantity of aquatic taxa, factors potentially impacting the efficacy of this technique must be investigated. Many studies have examined the effects of abiotic parameters on the degradation of environmental-DNA (e.g. UV radiation, pH, temperature, etc.), however, few have focused on biotic effectors. Through high-filtering rates coupled with dense colonization, Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) are able to drastically alter the quantity of particulate matter through translocation into the sediment, potentially including sources of eDNA in lotic and lentic systems. Using a longitudinal, laboratory experiment, we tested the effect of varying densities of Asian clams on the translocation rate of common goldfish (Carassius auratus) DNA. Target DNA in testing tanks was quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) at regular intervals and compared. Tanks housing the highest density of Asian clams produced significantly lower DNA concentrations over time compared to tanks of lower densities. These results show, for the first time, a density-dependent reduction of local eDNA sources by bivalve filtration that may lead to the obstructed detection of target species through the sampling of eDNA. Based on these findings, we recommend highly concentrated bivalve populations be taken into consideration when choosing the time and locality of eDNA sampling efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2984119337,"Animal trials contribute to major achievements in medical science. The so-called lavage model is frequently used to evaluate ventilation strategies in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). But, the lavage model itself might have systematic impacts on EIT parameters. Therefore, we established an additional experimental model, in which ARDS is caused by intravenously administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we want to examine if EIT measurements provide consistent results in both experimental models or whether the pathophysiology of the model influences the findings. Overall, we want to compare both experimental models regarding clinical parameters and EIT-derived indices, namely the global inhomogeneity (GI) index and the regional ventilation delay (RVD) index.Nineteen pigs were included in this study, allocated to the control group (CO; n = 5), lavage group (LAV; n = 7) and LPS group (LPS; n = 7). After baseline measurements and the establishment of ARDS, assessment of respiratory mechanics, hemodynamics, gas exchange and EIT recordings were performed hourly over eight hours.In both experimental ARDS models, EIT measurements provided reliable results. But, the GI and the RVD index did not show consistent results as compared to the CO group. Initially, GI and RVD index were higher in the LAV group but not in the LPS group as compared to the CO group. This effect disappeared during the study. Furthermore, the GI index and the RVD index were higher in the LAV group compared to the LPS group in the beginning as well. This, once again, disappeared. Clinical lung injury parameters remained more stable when using LPS.The two models showed quite different influences on the GI and RVD index. This implies, that the underlying pathophysiology affects EIT parameters and thus the findings. Hence, translation to EIT-guided clinical therapy in humans suffering from ARDS might be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2987395770,"Introduction Recent studies have reported a significant increase in the prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Further, several studies employing disparate modelling algorithms have projected a significant rise in the frequency of CRC cases in the region. However, lack of good quality data on multiple themes related to CRC including incidence, among others, continues to be a problem in the region. Therefore, this study was designed to collect data on the incidence of CRC in Eritrea. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis using data captured between 2011 and 2017 at the National Health Laboratory (NHL) in Asmara, Eritrea. Results 241 colorectal cases were identified in the Eritrean National Health Laboratory (NHL) database between 2011 and 2017. In the final analysis we included 94 patients confirmed cases giving an average of 18.8 patients per annum. The average age ± Standard deviation (SD) was 57.62 ± 17.14 with a male: female ratio of 58/36 (1: 1.61). The minimum and maximum age of the patients was 19 and 90 years, respectively. The rectum to colon ratio was 47/47 (1:1). The proportion of patients < 50 years in this cohort was significant. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) in the study period was between 0.97 per 100 000 to 2.21 per 100 000. Similarly, the cumulative ASIR was 9.97 per 100 000. Analysis of trends did not reveal shifts over the study period (P<0.05). However, a strong correlation between incidence and age was established. Conclusion This study suggests that the incidence of CRC in Eritrea is relatively low. A significant number of patients were less than 50 years of age. Even then it’s our opinion that this study may underestimate the incidence of CRC."

Although the structure and function of ABCG2 have been extensively studied, little is known about its biogenesis and the regulation thereof. In this study, using mutagenesis and several biochemical analyses, we show that the positive charges in the vicinity of the RKR motif downstream of the ABC signature drive trafficking of nascent ABCG2 out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) onto plasma membranes. Substitutions of and naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphisms within these positively charged residues disabled the trafficking of ABCG2 out of the ER. A representative ABCG2 variant in which the RKR motif had been altered underwent increased ER stress–associated degradation. We also found that unlike WT ABCG2, genetic ABCG2 RKR variants have disrupted normal maturation and do not reduce accumulation of the anticancer drug mitoxantrone and no longer confer resistance to the drug. We conclude that the positive charges downstream of the ABC signature motif critically regulate ABCG2 trafficking and maturation.

Unfortunately, management is still heterogeneous across different specialists. A multidisciplinary approach is needed in this setting due to recent, promising results obtained by consolidative immunotherapy. The aim of this survey is to assess current LA-NSCLC management in Italy. From January to April 2018, a 15-question survey focusing on diagnostic/therapeutic LA-NSCLC management was sent to 1,478 e-mail addresses that belonged to pneumologists, thoracic surgeons, and radiation and medical oncologists. 421 answers were analyzed: 176 radiation oncologists, 86 medical oncologists, 92 pneumologists, 64 thoracic surgeons and 3 other specialists. More than a half of the respondents had been practicing for >10 years after completing residency training. Some discrepancies were observed in clinical LA-NSCLC management: the lack of a regularly planned multidisciplinary tumor board, the use of upfront surgery in multistation stage IIIA, and territorial diffusion of cCRT in unresectable LA-NSCLC. Our analysis demonstrated good compliance with international guidelines in the diagnostic workup of LA-NSCLC. We observed a relationship between high clinical experience and good clinical practice. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for managing LA-NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2983588957,"In this study, we analyzed the application of four autosomal kits and the sensitivity of the combined paternity index (CPI) cutoff value (CPI≥10000) in parentage testing. First, 1442 real trios and 803 real duos were tested using the Goldeneye 25A kit. The Goldeneye 25A kit covers the autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci of the other three kits, so we calculated the CPI value of every case for the four kits. Second, three complex close relative kinship cases were also analyzed to evaluate the application of the CPI cutoff value. The CPI values of all trio cases were higher than 10000 using the four kits; the CPI values of all duo cases were higher than 10000 using the Goldeneye 25A kit; and the CPI values of a portion of the duo cases were lower than 10000 using the other three kits. In the three complex close relative cases, the alleged father or mother was not excluded using 40 autosomal STRs. Adding X chromosome short tandem repeats (X-STR) and samples of biological fathers or mothers, the conclusions were confirmed. The four kits were adequate to draw conclusions in the trio cases; the Goldeneye 25A Kit was adequate to draw conclusions in the duo cases; and the other three kits were not sufficient for a portion of the duo cases. The CPI cutoff value was sensitive for real trio and duo cases. In complex close relative kinship cases, high CPI values may result in false conclusions."

Potentially harmful outcomes of this competition depend on surface molecules through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Combining surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with atomic force microscopy (AFM), here we studied two complement system proteins at the single-molecule level: C3b, the proteolytically activated form of C3, and factor H (FH), the surface-sensing C3b-binding complement regulator. We used SPR to monitor complement initiation occurring through a positive-feedback loop wherein surface-deposited C3b participates in convertases that cleave C3, thereby depositing more C3b. Over multiple cycles of flowing factor B, factor D, and C3 over the SPR chip, we amplified C3b from ∼20 to ∼220 molecules·μm−2. AFM revealed C3b clusters of up to 20 molecules and solitary C3b molecules deposited up to 200 nm away from the clusters. A force of 0.17 ± 0.02 nanonewtons was needed to pull a single FH molecule, anchored to the AFM probe, from its complex with surface-attached C3b. The extent to which FH molecules stretched before detachment varied widely among complexes. Performing force-distance measurements with FH(D1119G), a variant lacking one of the C3b-binding sites and causing atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, we found that it detached more uniformly and easily. In further SPR experiments, KD values between FH and C3b on a custom-made chip surface were 5-fold tighter than on commercial chips and similar to those on erythrocytes. These results suggest that the chemistry at the surface on which FH acts drives conformational adjustments that are functionally critical. Activation and suppression of the complement system compete on every serum-exposed surface, host or foreign. Potentially harmful outcomes of this competition depend on surface molecules through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Combining surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with atomic force microscopy (AFM), here we studied two complement system proteins at the single-molecule level: C3b, the proteolytically activated form of C3, and factor H (FH), the surface-sensing C3b-binding complement regulator. We used SPR to monitor complement initiation occurring through a positive-feedback loop wherein surface-deposited C3b participates in convertases that cleave C3, thereby depositing more C3b. Over multiple cycles of flowing factor B, factor D, and C3 over the SPR chip, we amplified C3b from ∼20 to ∼220 molecules·μm−2. AFM revealed C3b clusters of up to 20 molecules and solitary C3b molecules deposited up to 200 nm away from the clusters.

https://openalex.org/W2987985474,"Background It is unclear whether alcohol consumption may impact survival after breast cancer diagnosis. To clarify the association between pretreatment alcohol consumption and survival in breast cancer patients, a prospective patient cohort study was conducted. Methods The cohort comprised 1,420 breast cancer patients diagnosed during 1997–2013 at a single institute in Japan. Alcohol drinking and other lifestyle factors were assessed by questionnaire survey at the initial admission. The patients were followed until December 31, 2016. The crude associations of pretreatment alcohol intake with survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) controlled by confounders. Results During a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, 261 all-cause and 193 breast cancer-specific deaths were documented. Survival curves showed that ever-drinkers tended to have better survival than never-drinkers (breast cancer-specific survival, log-rank p = 0.0381). Better survival was also observed for light drinkers with an intake of <5.0 g per day. In the Cox model, ever-drinking was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.54–1.05) and breast cancer-specific death (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.46–0.99). Light drinkers had a lower risk of breast cancer-specific death (frequency of drinking, HR = 0.57 for occasional or 1–2 times per week and 0.72 for 3–7 times per week; amount of alcohol consumed per day, HR = 0.57 for <5.0 g and 0.68 for ≥5.0 g compared with never-drinking). In terms of hormone receptor status, a significantly decreased risk of death associated with ever-drinking was observed among women with receptor-negative cancer (ER-/PR-, HR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.20–0.84 for breast cancer-specific death). Conclusions Pretreatment, i.e., pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption is unlikely to have an adverse effect on survival after breast cancer diagnosis. Light alcohol consumption may have a beneficial effect on patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2985571773,"Almost all cases of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections in Japan are caused by blaIMP-positive Enterobacteriaceae (especially blaIMP-6) and infections caused by other types of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are quite rare. We examined drug resistance genes co-harboring with blaIMP-6 and their inoculum size effects. We screened β-lactamase genes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, and aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes by PCR and performed sequencing for 14 blaIMP-6-positive Enterobacteriaceae. Further, all PMQR-positive isolates were submitted to conjugation and inoculum effect evaluation. Our data showed that 13 of the 14 isolates harbored CTX-M-2 and one co-harbored CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-1 as extended-spectrum β-lactamases. All isolates carried one or more PMQRs; aac(6')-Ib-cr was the most prevalent (92.8%), and was followed by oqxA (64.3%), qnrS (50%), oqxAB (21.4%), and qnrB (14.3%). However, Klebsiella pneumoniae contains chromosomal OqxAB. Inoculum size effects were significant in all strains for meropenem, 13 strains for imipenem, 7 for levofloxacin, and 3 for amikacin. We observed that 11 of the experimental strains (100%), 8 strains (72.7%), and 1 strain showed inoculum size effects for meropenem, imipenem, and amikacin, respectively. However, four strains harbored qnr genes and two strains harbored qnr genes and QRDR mutations concurrently; no inoculum size effect was seen for levofloxacin. The blaIMP-6-positive Enterobacteriaceae that we studied was found to harbor at least one plasmid-mediated drug resistance gene. The inoculum size effect for carbapenems was thought to be mainly due to IMP-6-type metallo-β-lactamase; however qnrB and qnrS also had a minimal impact on the inoculum size effect for levofloxacin."
https://openalex.org/W2986336739,"There is considerable debate on whether the employment and earnings prospects are better for those on low pay or for the unemployed. Low-pay work tends to be undertaken more locally but no empirical analysis has focused on how local opportunities alter prospects. Using Understanding Society data for England matched with local unemployment rates, we estimate dynamic random effects panel models, which show robust evidence that the future unemployment risk is lower for those who are currently on low pay compared to those who are currently unemployed. The low-paid also have a higher chance than the unemployed of becoming higher-paid. These findings are most marked in neighbourhoods with high unemployment."
https://openalex.org/W2987026944,"The most southern population of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) inhabits northeastern China, but the migration route and origin of this population have not been confirmed. The sequences of mitochondrial DNA control regions from domestic and wild herds from Eurasia and China were analysed. The results showed that the Chinese reindeer population originated independently from north-central Russian domestic herds, belonging to a large reindeer population that was present across Beringia during the last glacial period. Some studies have reported that the Chinese reindeer population is closely related to wild forest reindeer herds in Russia. Our results, however, indicate that wild forest reindeer herds of southeastern Russia contributed little or nothing to the Chinese reindeer herd gene pool. Chinese reindeer herds have a much greater genetic similarity to more northerly distributed tundra-type herds that inhabit open areas. The present findings will be essential for future conservation planning for Chinese reindeer."
https://openalex.org/W2983999662,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of hemodialysis on the concentrations of sodium and potassium in the blood when a 25 g dose of sodium thiosulfate injection is infused over 60 minutes in combination with hemodialysis.Sodium thiosulfate (25 g) was prepared by diluting 100 mL of 250 mg/mL Sodium Thiosulfate Injection with 800 mL of 5% dextrose. This was added to the circulating blood surrogate solution at a rate of 15 mL/minute using an infusion pump of an in vitro model of dialysis machine. Serial samples were collected before the administration of the sodium thiosulfate solution, after 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes of infusion from pre-and post-dialyzer ports in both the dialysate circuit and the extracorporeal circuit.The concentration of sodium thiosulfate in pre-dialyzer and post-dialyzer samples of the circulating blood surrogate solution peaked at 30 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively and then remained relatively unchanged during the remainder of the infusion. Mean sodium concentrations (mEq/L) in the circulating blood surrogate solution collected after exposure to a dialyzer were 103.2 ± 12.2, 114.2 ± 18.8, 117.2 ± 7.5, 93.5 ± 5.9 at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively (p = 0.248). Mean potassium concentrations (mEq/L) in the circulating blood surrogate solution collected after exposure to a dialyzer were 1.4 ± 0.3, 1.6 ± 0.3, 1.5 ± 0.1, 1.2 ± 0.1 at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively (p = 0.365). Sodium and potassium concentrations in dialysate increased marginally after exposure to the dialyzer.Our study demonstrates that neither potassium nor sodium accumulated in circulating blood surrogate solution when a dose of sodium thiosulfate was infused in conjunction with hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2986643808,"Humans process single objects in relation to other simultaneously maintained objects in visual working memory. This interdependence is called spatial configuration. Humans are able to reorganize global spatial configurations into relevant partial configurations. We conducted three experiments investigating the process underlying reorganization by manipulating memory set size and the presence of configurations at retrieval. Participants performed a location change detection task for a single object probed at retrieval. At the beginning of each trial, participants memorized the locations of all objects (set size: 4, 8, 12, or 16). During maintenance, a valid retro cue highlighted the side containing the object probed at retrieval, thus enabling participants to reorganize the memorized global spatial configuration to the partial cued configuration. At retrieval, the object probed was shown together with either all objects (complete configuration; Experiment 1a), the cued objects only (congruent configuration; all Experiments), the non-cued objects only (incongruent configuration, all Experiments) or alone (no configuration; Experiment 1b). We observed reorganization of spatial configurations as indicated by a superior location change detection performance with a congruent partial configuration than an incongruent partial configuration across all three experiments. We also observed an overall decrease in accuracy with increasing set size. Most importantly, however, we did not find evidence for a reliable impairment of reorganization with increasing set size. We discuss these findings with regard to the memory representation underlying spatial configurations."
https://openalex.org/W2988288411,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are toxic chemicals that persist in human tissue. Short and long term exposure to OCPs have been shown to have adverse effects on human health. This motivates studies into the concentrations of pesticides in humans. However these studies typically emphasise the analysis of the main effects of age group, gender and time of sample collection. The interactions between main effects can distinguish variation in OCP concentration such as the difference in concentrations between genders of the same age group as well as age groups over time. These are less studied but may be equally or more important in understanding effects of OCPs in a population. The aim of this study was to identify interactions relevant to understanding OCP concentrations and utilise them appropriately in models. We propose a two stage analysis comprising of boosted regression trees (BRTs) and hierarchical modelling to study OCP concentrations. BRTs are used to discover influential interactions between age group, gender and time of sampling. Hierarchical models are then employed to test and infer the effect of the interactions on OCP concentrations. Results of our analysis show that the best fitting model of an interaction effect varied between OCPs. The interaction between age group and gender was most influential for hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations. There was strong evidence of an interaction effect between age group and time for β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) concentrations in >60 year olds as well as an interaction effect between age group and gender for HCB concentrations for adults aged >45 years. This study highlights the need to consider appropriate interaction effects in the analysis of OCP concentrations and provides further insight into the interplay of main effects on OCP concentration trends."
https://openalex.org/W2986477185,"Most mice ethanol sensitization studies focused on neurobiology at the expense of its behavioral characterization. Furthermore, relatively short ethanol exposures (10 to 20 injections) were used in these studies. The first aim of the present study is to better characterize the development and expression of ethanol sensitization after an extended exposure of 45 daily injections. In some previous studies, mice were classified as ""respondent"" and ""resistant"" to ethanol sensitization. The second aim of the present study is to test the long-term reliability of such categorizations and the consequences of their use on the interpretation of the ethanol sensitization results. Swiss and DBA/2J female mice received 45 consecutive daily ethanol administrations (respectively 2.5 and 2.0 g/kg) and their locomotor activity was daily recorded to test the development of ethanol sensitization. At the end of the procedure, a challenge test assessed the inter-group ethanol sensitization.The results of the present study show that ethanol sensitization continues to develop beyond 20 days to reach maximal levels after about 25 injections in DBA/2J mice and 40 injections in Swiss mice, although the core phase of the development of ethanol sensitization occurred in both strains during the first 20 days. Remarkably, ethanol sensitization after such a long daily ethanol treatment resulted in both an upward shift of the magnitude of ethanol stimulant effects and a prolongation of these effects in time (up to 30 minutes). Mice classified as ""resistant to ethanol sensitization"" according to previous studies developed very significant levels of ethanol sensitization when tested after 45 ethanol injections and are best described as showing a delayed development of ethanol sensitization. Furthermore, mice classified as respondent or resistant to ethanol sensitization also differ in their acute response to ethanol, such that it is difficult to ascertain whether these classifications are specifically related to the sensitization process."
