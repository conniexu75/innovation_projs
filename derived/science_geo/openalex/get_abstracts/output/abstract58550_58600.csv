https://openalex.org/W1987438294,"Although the entorhinal cortex is a major contributor of afferents to the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, knowledge of its own afferents has been vague. Regions of both the frontal and temporal lobes were found to contribute afferents to this region of the brain. These afferents form probable multisynaptic links in pathways connecting the classical sensory areas of the cortex and the limbic system."

https://openalex.org/W1550668714,"Abstract A newly developed procedure is described for the isolation and purification on a large scale of luciferases from two different bioluminescent bacteria, Pf and MAV. In only three major steps luciferase can be obtained in greater than 95% purity. An improved method for the isolation of subunits in milligram quantities by column chromatography in 5 m urea is also described; upon recombination of the subunits with the removal of urea, renatured luciferase with a high specific activity is obtained. These procedures should be generally applicable with luciferases from different bacterial strains, including mutant luciferases. The two luciferases have been used to produce specific antiluciferases, which, by precipitation patterns on Ouchterlony plates, appear distinctively different. Nevertheless, a degree of homology has been demonstrated by cross-reaction in an antibody activity inhibition assay. Interaction between subunits from the different strains has also been demonstrated by inhibition of renaturation (from 5 m urea) of one of the luciferases by a subunit of the other luciferase, indicating that inactive hybrids may be formed."
https://openalex.org/W1506473971,"Abstract Procedures are presented for the isolation of ornithine transcarbamylase from Streptococcus faecalis and bovine liver. The enzyme from S. faecalis, homogeneous on electrophoresis in starch gel and in the ultracentrifuge (s20,w = 9.06 S), has a specific activity of 3,200 at pH 8.5, 37°, and an extinction coefficient (A1%280 nm) of 8.32. Its molecular weight is 223,000 in dilute buffer and 38,000 in 6 m guanidine HCl, both determined by measurement at sedimentation equilibrium, and 39,600 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. Quantitative determination of the NH2-terminal residues gave one methionine per 40,000. Therefore, the enzyme is a hexamer. In 0.1 m NH4Cl, pH 9.5, the enzyme dissociates to the dimer, which is inactive but reassociates rapidly at pH 6.0 to form the active enzyme. The activity was also recovered nearly quantitatively on reassociation of a sample of the enzyme that had been dissociated in 6 m guanidine HCl. The preparation of bovine liver ornithine transcarbamylase is homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge (s20,w = 5.8 S), but electrophoretograms in polyacrylamide gel show five to six components evenly spaced and present in successively decreasing amounts. These have been separated by isoelectric focusing. They all have approximately the same specific activity and are immunologically identical. The differences in their pI values are consistent with each differing from its immediate neighbor by a single charge, perhaps because of hydrolysis of amide groups. The enzyme has a specific activity of 780 at pH 8.5, 37°, and an extinction coefficient (A1%280 nm) of 12.3. Its molecular weight is 108,000 in dilute buffer and 36,000 in 6 m guanidine HCl, both determined by measurement at sedimentation equilibrium, and 37,800 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. Quantitative determination of the NH2-terminal residues gave one aspartic acid per 38,000 g. Therefore, the enzyme is a trimer. The enzyme recovered, with a yield of 50%, after dissociation in 6 m guanidine HCl had the same specific activity and electrophoretic composition as the original."
https://openalex.org/W2013811589,"The isolation of a new type of mutant Corynephage beta, which carries a missense mutation in the structural gene for diphtheria toxin synthesis is described. The lysogenic C7(8)(beta(197))(tox-crm+) strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces a nontoxic, extracellular protein of molecular weight 62,000. This protein is immunologically indistinguishable from toxin itself but inhibits the action of toxin on HeLa cells, probably by competing for attachment sites on the cell membrane. In contrast to fragment A derived from diphtheria toxin, fragment A(197) is unable to catalyze the inactivation of eucaryotic polypeptidyl-transfer RNA-transferase II. When mixtures of the two nontoxic mutant proteins, enzymically active crm(45) protein and enzymically inactive crm(197) protein, are subjected to mild treatment with trypsin in the presence of a thiol and then allowed to reoxidize after dialysis to remove excess thiol, ""diphtheria toxin"" is reconstituted in high yield."
https://openalex.org/W2050812103,Most of the neurons tested in the superior temporal cortex of awake squirrel monkeys responded to recorded species-specific vocalizations. Some cells responded with temporally complex patterns to many vocalizations. Other cells responded with simpler patterns to only one call. Most cells lay between these two extremes. On-line deletion of parts of a vocalization revealed the role of temporal interactions in determining the nature of some responses.

https://openalex.org/W1501376994,"Abstract During logarithmic growth Bacillus subtilis synthesizes teichoic acid, but not teichuronic acid. Under conditions of phosphate limitation, teichoic acid synthesis stops, and teichuronic acid synthesis is activated. Suitable radioactive labeling experiments have shown that both of these polymers are attached only to glycopeptide chains synthesized at the same time as these specialized polymers are made. An examination of the teichoic acid glycopeptide complex obtained by lysozyme digestion from cells labeled with d-[3H]glucosamine during a period of phosphate limitation, and with d-[14C]glucosamine after resumption of logarithmic growth, has shown that the glycan chains adjacent to those linked covalently to teichoic acid represent a nearly random selection of new and old chains. This last finding is interpreted to indicate that during cell wall growth there is a random intercalation of new and old glycopeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1601082308,"Abstract The binding of carbamyl-P, l-ornithine, and its competitive inhibitor l-norvaline by ornithine transcarbamylase has been measured by gel filtration at 25° under the conditions used for the kinetic experiments. Carbamyl-P forms a reversible binary complex with the enzyme from both liver and Streptococcus faecalis, whereas l-norvaline is bound tightly only in the presence of carbamyl-P. There is the equivalent for each ligand of one site per monomer. Two dissociation constants, differing 10-fold, are required to describe the data for the binding of both carbamyl-P and norvaline by the S. faecalis enzyme, and three, even more widely separated, for the binding of carbamyl-P to the bovine enzyme. l-Ornithine, which is also poorly bound to the free enzyme, is, in contrast to norvaline, tightly bound in the presence of phosphate. The initial rate data for the S. faecalis enzyme in both the forward and reverse reactions at pH values between 6.6 and 8.8 can be fitted to the rate equation for the ordered sequential mechanism suggested by the requirements for binding. The dissociation constant for carbamyl-P calculated from the kinetic data is close to the lower of the two dissociation constants into which the binding data was resolved, and the equilibrium constant calculated from the kinetic parameters agrees with that determined directly. But, in spite of the fit of these data to a single set of parameters, the variation of Ki norvaline with the concentrations of norvaline and either carbamyl-P or phosphate in both the forward and reverse reactions suggests that the activity is the sum of the activities of species with different kinetic parameters. The influence of sites that are either not identical or interact anticooperatively on the kinetics is more apparent with the bovine enzyme, for which the double reciprocal plots of activity against the concentration of carbamyl-P are concave downward at every pH studied between 6.1 and 8.9. Vf for the S. faecalis enzyme increases with increase in pH, reaching a plateau at pH 8.4. At this pH the turnover per dimer (80,000 g) is 3,400 s-1 at 25°, Korn 0.7 mm, Kcp 0.29 mm, and Kicp 12 µm. At pH 7.1, the optimum for the reverse reaction, Vr, is 90 s-1, Kp 0.8 mm, Kcit 17 mm, and Kip 8 mm. Vf and Korn were determined for the bovine enzyme at a saturating concentration of carbamyl-P. The variation of Vf with pH conforms to the titration curve for a group with pK 6.65; at the plateau (pH 8.5), the turnover per site (36,000 g) is 187 s-1 at 25°. Korn varies with pH approximately as the concentration of the isoelectric species of ornithine. Kcp decreases with decrease in pH; at pH 8.5 the value estimated from the linear portion of the reciprocal plot at low concentrations is 0.035 mm and from the linear portion at high concentrations, 0.4 mm."

https://openalex.org/W1875444097,"Abstract A mutation denoted as trpX defines a previously unrecognized cistron whose gene product, subunit-X, has a catalytic role in two biochemical pathways. Experiments with strains carrying this mutation provided insight into the following gene-enzyme relationships in Bacillus subtilis. 1. The trpX locus codes for a subunit component (subunit-X) of the anthranilate synthase aggregate which appears to confer catalytic reactivity with glutamine. 2. Subunit-X is also a component of p-aminobenzoate synthase in the pathway of folate biosynthesis. 3. A mutation of trpX is not located in the previously described tryptophan operon, showing no linkage by DNA transformation or PBS1 transduction to the various genes located in or near the tryptophan gene cluster of B. subtilis. However, the synthesis of subunit-X is controlled by tryptophan. The synthesis of subunit-X varies coordinately with respect to the other enzymes of the tryptophan operon throughout a large fraction of the time course of the derepression interval; subunit-X is synthesized discoordinately, however, at both very low and very high enzyme levels (semicoordinate repression). A mutant which synthesizes a faulty subunit-X requires a derepressed level of subunit-X in order to synthesize sufficient folate and tryptophan to support growth. Exogenous tryptophan inhibits growth in the mutant because the repression of the synthesis of an already deficient subunit-X by tryptophan results in folate starvation. The mutant enzyme cannot utilize glutamine, the normal physiological substrate, as a nitrogen source in the anthranilate synthase reaction. However, the mutant enzyme retains a substantial level of ammonia-reactive activity, a result which provides suggestive evidence that ammonia may serve in vivo as an amino donor for tryptophan synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1651568541,"Comparative studies on tissue extracts of haddock, cod, and related species in the suborder Gadoidei indicated the presence of a lactate dehydrogenase specific to liver tissue. Genetic and evolutionary variation of the lactate dehydrogenase isozymes in these fishes indicate that the liver isozyme is encoded at a structural gene locus genetically distinct from the loci encoding the heart and muscle isozymes. The properties of purified liver, heart, and muscle lactate dehydrogenases from haddock were compared to investigate their relationship. The haddock liver enzyme is like other lactate dehydrogenases in having a molecular weight of 140,000 with a subunit size of 35,000. The liver enzyme is distinguished from the heart and muscle isozymes by its greater resistance to heat inactivation. The gadoid heart and muscle isozymes do not hybridize with each other in vivo or in vitro, but the liver enzyme can hybridize with both in vitro, although not in a random fashion. The catalytic properties of the haddock liver and heart isozymes are very similar; they are distinct from the muscle isozyme in having a greater affinity for both lactate and pyruvate and in being inhibited at high pyruvate concentrations. The liver enzyme showed no unusual substrate specificities. Ironically, the liver enzyme can be mistaken for the muscle enzyme since both have nearly identical electrophoretic mobilities. The catalytic properties of the haddock heart and liver enzymes suggest that these two may be homologous and that both might be homologous to the heart-type lactate dehydrogenase of the higher vertebrates. The immunological crossreactivity of these two with each other and with chicken heart lactate dehydrogenase provides confirmation for this hypothesis. The immunological data suggest a considerable degree of sequence homology between the heart and liver lactate dehydrogenases of gadoid fishes. From evolutionary considerations, it appears that the divergence of the heart and liver loci from an ancestor heart-type locus is a relatively recent event, perhaps arising concurrently with the evolution of the gadoid fish into a distinct lineage."

https://openalex.org/W1549781178,"Abstract An inducible transport system for d-galactose is present in isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli ML 3 and ML 35. Like the transport systems for β-galactosides and amino acids, galactose transport is coupled primarily to a membrane-bound d-lactic dehydrogenase. In addition to d-lactate, the transport system is markedly stimulated by ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate and oxygen. Succinate, dl-α-hydroxybutyrate, and l-lactate partially replace d-lactate, but are less effective than either d-lactate or ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. ATP and P-enolpyruvate, in addition to a number of other metabolites and cofactors, do not stimulate galactose transport by the vesicles. transport by isolated membrane vesicles requires oxygen, and is blocked by electron transfer inhibitors and by other general metabolic inhibitors. However, transport is not significantly inhibited by high concentrations of arsenate or oligomycin. Galactose binding protein is totally absent from the vesicles, as is a high affinity galactose transport system present in whole cells."

https://openalex.org/W1488715102,"Abstract Homogeneous carbonic anhydrase has been prepared from the erythrocytes of single comb, white Leghorn hens (Gallus domesticus). The procedure involved chloroform-ethanol precipitation of the hemoglobin, gel filtration of the resulting extract on a Sephadex G-75 column, and ion exchange chromatography of the pooled active fractions from the Sephadex column by salt gradient elution on carboxymethylcellulose. The presence of reducing agents, dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, was essential throughout the entire preparation to maintain the stability of the carbonic anhydrase. Only one form of carbonic anhydrase was found in chicken erythrocytes. The purified enzyme behaves as a single molecular entity in sedimentation and diffusion and in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is active as an esterase, with p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate; its amino acid composition and its catalytic properties suggest that it belongs to the class of carbonic anhydrases. Its general properties are similar to those of other vertebrate carbonic anhydrase: s20, w0 is 2.9 S, the frictional ratio is about 1.2, the molecular weight is 28,000 ± 1,200 from sedimentation equilibrium studies, and there is 1 atom of tightly bound zinc per molecule. Attempts to remove the zinc reversibly have not yet succeeded. Acetazolamide strongly inhibits both the CO2 hydration and the esterase activities (Ki ≅ 10-7 m). The esterase activity rises with increasing pH between 6.5 and 9.5. Measurements of ultraviolet absorption, optical rotatory dispersion, and circular dichroism reveal close similarities with other vertebrate carbonic anhydrases, including the presence of Cotton effects in the region between 285 and 295 nm. Chicken carbonic anhydrase differs most strikingly from the corresponding mammalian enzymes in its high half-cystine content: 7 moles of half-cystine per mole of enzyme. The avian enzyme is reversibly inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, and requires the presence of a reducing agent in vitro for maximal enzymatic activity and structural integrity."

https://openalex.org/W1543880555,"Abstract Rabbit liver arginase has been purified about 1,000-fold. The enzyme migrates as a single broad band during electrophoresis in disc gel, and gives a single precipitation line with specific antiserum when assayed by the immunodiffusion technique. However, chromatography of the purified enzyme on DEAE-cellulose columns reveals multiple active forms of identical molecular weight, which are eluted within a narrow range of molarity. The molecular weight determination by gel filtration yields a value of 110,000. The sedimentation coefficient is 5.9 S, as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The rabbit arginase is almost completely inactivated after a long incubation in the presence of EDTA, without altering its immunoprecipitation pattern. It regains its initial activity when assayed in the presence of Mn++. Treatment of the rabbit liver arginase with 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 10, or incubation of the enzyme at pH 2, result in its rapid inactivation, when assayed in the absence of Mn++. However, when the inactivated enzyme is assayed in the presence of Mn++, a residual activity is observed, which corresponds to one component of 2.8 or 2.4 S after treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate or at pH 2, respectively. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated enzyme has a molecular weight of 36,500, thus providing evidence for an oligomeric native structure, probably tetrameric, as previously reported for the rat liver arginase (Hirsch-Kolb, H., and Greenberg, D. M., J. Biol. Chem., 243, 6123 (1968)). The pH 2-dissociated enzyme migrates as two components of very close mobilities in 8 m urea gel electrophoresis, suggesting the occurrence of two kinds of subunits with similar molecular weight. This may account for the different chromatographic forms of the oligomeric native enzyme. The pH 2-dissociated enzyme regains at least 75% of its initial activity, when incubated at pH 8 in the presence of Mn++ and further assayed in the presence of Mn++. The reactivated enzyme appears to recover its native oligomeric structure, as suggested by its sedimentation coefficient (5.6 S), immunological properties, and electrophoretic mobility. If the pH 2-dissociated enzyme is incubated at pH 8 in the presence of EDTA, prior to assay, about 25% of the initial activity is observed, when assayed in the presence of Mn++. Under these conditions, the enzyme has a low sedimentation coefficient (2.7 S), like the dissociated enzyme, and gives rise to two bands migrating faster than the native enzyme in disc gel electrophoresis. Thus, the formation of the oligomeric structure seems to require manganous ions. Furthermore, the subunits are most probably active in the presence of Mn++, as suggested by the characteristics of the assay of dissociated enzymes and of enzyme reactivated at pH 8 in the presence of EDTA (high dilution, absence of lag period)."

The data presented suggest that the increased activity of the enzyme after reduction by thiols is due to an increased affinity for metal ions. Two of the metals, Mn2+ and Cd2+, which were studied in most detail, differ markedly in their binding to the enzyme. In the absence of substrate, Cd2+ ions protect the four reactive —SH groups of the reduced enzyme against 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) titration, and 2 g atoms of Cd2+ were shown to be bound tightly per mole of enzyme. Mn2+ did not bind to the enzyme in the absence of l-histidine, but in the presence of the substrate a partial protection of the sulfhydryl groups was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1544499572,"Abstract Ornithine transcarbamylase from Streptococcus faecalis has two sulfhydryl groups per monomer that react with 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) in urea: one of these reacts rapidly with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (p-HMB) in glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.8). The enzyme from bovine liver has slightly less than three per monomer that react with DTNB in urea: two of these react with p-HMB at pH 7.8 and one reacts rapidly with 0.25 mm DTNB at pH 7.8 without urea and in the presence of carbamyl-P plus norvaline. The sulfhydryl groups in this last category reacted without loss of activity with all of the reagents that were tried. Both enzymes were inactive in the presence of an amount of p-HMB stoichiometric with the reactive sulfhydryl groups. The addition of EDTA slowed down the inactivation by p-HMB to a measurable rate, which was decreased in the presence of carbamyl-P, phosphate, and more effectively, phosphate plus ornithine. These sulfhydryl groups reacted with iodoacetamide only under conditions that are known to cause a conformational change, exposing this group, i.e. with the inactive dimer of the S. faecalis enzyme and in 1 m KCl, pH 10, 0° for the bovine enzyme. They reacted relatively rapidly with cystamine at pH 8.5 in a pseudo-first order reaction that led to complete inactivation. The binding of carbamyl-P was not affected, but the derivatives did not bind norvaline. In the presence of carbamyl-P, the inactivation was still a first order reaction, but the rate decreased. The dissociation constants for carbamyl-P calculated from the change in the rate with concentration agreed with those determined from direct measurement of the binding. The reaction with dithiodiglycol was less rapid than with cystamine, and the derivative of the bovine enzyme with less than 2% of the essential sulfhydryl groups remaining had about one-half the activity of the native enzyme at pH 8.5. The concentration of the substrates, particularly ornithine, required to saturate it were, however, much higher, as were the dissociation constants for carbamyl-P and norvaline. The S. faecalis enzyme lost activity on incubation with acetylimidazole, 50 mm at 25° in 0.1 m sodium morpholinoethanesulfonate (pH 6.0) for 20 min. Neither the sulfhydryl groups nor tyrosine residues had reacted, but 8.3 amino groups per monomer were acetylated. The inactivation was less rapid in the presence of carbamyl-P plus norvaline, and 1.3 fewer amino groups had reacted. Reaction of a single amino group per monomer of the S. faecalis enzyme with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonate (TNBS) at pH 6.0, 25°, caused complete inactivation; no reaction occurred in the presence of carbamyl-P. The specificity is due to the reagent forming a complex with the enzyme at the site of the reaction. From the pH dependence of its dissociation constant, the binding was found to depend on the protonation of a group on the enzyme with pK 6.1. The pH independent value of Ktnbs is 5.4 mm. A number of competitive inhibitors of TNBS were found; the most effective were anions with a bulky nonpolar side chain. Both enzymes, their essential sulfhydryl groups having been protected by oxidation to the aminoethylthio mixed disulfides, reacted with iodoacetate, 10 to 50 mm at pH 5.0 to 5.5, 30–40°, with loss of activity. Carboxymethyl groups (1.4) per monomer were incorporated from [1-14C]iodoacetate when 90% of the activity was lost. The radioactive components separated from the acid hydrolysates of the alkylated derivatives by chromatography in the amino acid analyzer appeared in the same positions as the components separated from the hydrolysate of methionine [14C]carboxymethylsulfonium iodide. The alkylation of methionine did not affect the binding of carbamyl-P, but norvaline was not bound to the derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1543946472,"Abstract T2r+ bacteriophage-induced deoxycytidylate deaminase was purified over 3000-fold to homogeneity as revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunodiffusion, and sedimentation velocity measurements. In the latter case, a value of s20,w = 6.05 ± 0.05 was obtained. Antibody to the T2r+ bacteriophage-induced enzyme cross-reacted with T4r+ bacteriophage-induced deoxycytidylate deaminase, but not with the chick embryo deaminase. Amino acid analyses revealed the enzyme to have a high sulfhydryl content (approximately 50 —SH per mole) and a relatively low methionine content (approximately 10 to 13 per mole). Although active at pH 6.0 in the absence of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, the pH optimum of the deaminase was shifted from 5.3 to 8.3 in the presence of this nucleotide. The quantity of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate required to activate the reaction by 50% increased with the pH as did the sigmoidal nature of the activation. A similar response was obtained with 5-hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, but in this case the effects were even more striking. The ratio of deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate to 5-hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, necessary to achieve a 50% inhibition, was independent of pH, but the ratio decreased sharply as the pH was raised when deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate was substituted for the hydroxymethyl derivative. The degree of inhibition effected by deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate appears to be a function of the positive effector response to pH. When compared with deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, 5-hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate is more susceptible to inhibition by deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate. This effect is not unreasonable in view of the fact that 5-hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate is a more immediate precursor of T-even bacteriophage deoxyribonucleic acid than is deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1496430278,"Abstract Hydroxylysine kinase (guanosine triphosphate:5-hydroxy-l-lysine O-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.-) has been purified 1200-fold from rat liver and its properties partially elucidated. The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of allohydroxy-l-lysine and hydroxy-l-lysine with an apparent Km ∼ 6 µm, but has no activity with either of the d isomers. The maximum velocity with allohydroxy-l-lysine was 1.5 to 3 times greater than with hydroxy-l-lysine. GTP or hypo-xanthine triphosphate, serve as the phosphate donor. Mg2+ is specifically required for the reaction while both Mn2+ and Zn2+ are inhibitory. The active phosphorylating agent appears to be the MgGTP2- complex with guanosine diphosphate as the nucleotide product. The kinase is present in the liver or kidney, or both, of rats, mice, chickens, bovine, rabbits, and two species of primates."

https://openalex.org/W1502584924,"Free and membrane-bound ribosomes were isolated from cerebral cortex of young rats at various times after they received simultaneous intracerebral injections of [14C]uridine and [methyl-3H]methionine. Using acid and alkaline extraction with phenol, two types of doubly labeled RNA were prepared from these ribosomes, one rich in ribosomal RNA (pH 6) and the other rich in messenger RNA (pH 8.3). The pH-6 RNA was further resolved into 18 S and 28 S RNA by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. An examination of the rate of incorporation of [14C]uridine into different RNA fractions showed that there was no difference in the 14C labeling of the 18 S and 28 S RNA's of free and membrane-bound ribosomes, indicating similar rates of polymerization and cytoplasmic transfer for these polynucleotides. The kinetics of 3H incorporation, however, revealed that the membrane-bound ribosomal RNA's had higher rates of methylation and might possess more methylated bases in comparison with their free ribosomal counterparts. The relative rates of incorporation of 14C and 3H indicated that the mRNA attached to the membrane-bound ribosomes may have a lower rate of turnover than the mRNA of free ribosomes. This view was supported by the comparatively slower incorporation in vivo of [3H]uridine into EDTA extract of membrane-bound polysomes, the lower rate of degradation subsequent to actinomycin D injection, and lower susceptibility to RNase of membrane-bound ribosomes as compared to free ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1531464267,"Abstract Calcium salts of analogues of dipicolinic acid were substituted for calcium dipicolinate in tests of germination of spores of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 10778. Only 4H-pyran-2,6-dicarboxylic acid was as active as dipicolinic acid. 3-Methyldipicolinic acid and 4-methyl-4H-pyran-2,6-dicarboxylic acid were active but the germination proceeded less rapidly. In the presence of a threshold concentration (0.020 m) of calcium dipicolinate, calcium salts of pyrimidine-2,4-dicarboxylate, pyrazine-2,6-dicarboxylate, 4-hydroxydipicolinate, and furan-2,5-dicarboxylate also showed activity. A hypothesis is proposed for mobilization of native calcium dipicolinate of dormant spores during germination, by way of a dimerization like that exhibited in crystals of calcium dipicolinate trihydrate and the isostructural calcium pyrandicarboxylate trihydrate. The compounds 4-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminopyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid and ethyl ester, 3-methyl-2,6-distyryl-pyridine, 3-methylpyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and pyrimidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid are reported for the first time. Calcium and proton association constants are given for various ligands."

https://openalex.org/W1572726359,"Abstract The sources of oxygen in the phosphoryl moieties of the intracellular nucleotides and RNA under several conditions were examined with Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Oxygens of nucleotides and RNA are representative of those of the intracellular phosphate pool. Important findings are: 1. Under different conditions, from 50 to 80% of the oxygens of the intracellular phosphate are derived from the medium water. A steady state level of 18O in acid-labile nucleoside di- and triphosphates is reached within a few minutes after addition of H18OH to the growth medium. The principal routes of 18O incorporation from water likely occur via exchanges of oxidative phosphorylation, hydrolysis of phosphates, and transfer from substrates partially labeled with water oxygens. 2. Extracellular phosphate contributes only a small percentage of the phosphate oxygens in B. subtilis and even less with E. coli. This shows that turnover of oxygens of intracellular Pi and phosphorylated substances is very rapid compared to the net uptake of phosphate from the medium. 3. The remaining phosphate oxygens (nearly 30 to 50%) must be derived from glucose and exogenously supplied metabolites. Transfer from [18O]glutamate was shown and addition of amino acids to the medium reduced incorporation of 18O from water. The principal routes are likely through ATP-linked synthetases, and by dehydrogenases or phosphorylases yielding carboxyl phosphates followed by phosphoryl transfer. Only AMP among nucleotides appears to serve as a point of entry of substrate oxygens into the phosphate pool. 4. The 2' - or 3'-hydroxyl oxygens of ribose, or both, in nucleosides are derived in part from medium water. A tabulation is given of principal enzymic reactions participating in the interchange of phosphate oxygens."
