https://openalex.org/W2793369479,"The understanding of strongly-correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has puzzled physicists for decades. Such difficulties have stimulated new research paradigms, such as ultra-cold atom lattices for simulating quantum materials. Here we report on the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in a 2D superlattice created by stacking two graphene sheets with a small twist angle. For angles near $1.1^\circ$, the first `magic' angle, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits ultra-flat bands near charge neutrality, which lead to correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature $T_c$ up to 1.7 K. The temperature-density phase diagram shows similarities with that of the cuprates, including superconducting domes. Moreover, quantum oscillations indicate small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating phase, in analogy with under-doped cuprates. The relative high $T_c$, given such small Fermi surface (corresponding to a record-low 2D carrier density of $10^{11} \textrm{cm}^{-2}$ , renders TBG among the strongest coupling superconductors, in a regime close to the BCS-BEC crossover. These novel results establish TBG as the first purely carbon-based 2D superconductor and as a highly tunable platform to investigate strongly-correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors and quantum spin liquids."
https://openalex.org/W2787584289,"Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are an emergent class of metamaterials comprised of vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) building blocks, which provide us with a vast tool set to engineer their properties on top of the already rich tunability of 2D materials. One of the knobs, the twist angle between different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic properties of a vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other systems such as MBE-grown semiconductor heterostructures. For small twist angles, the moir\'e pattern produced by the lattice misorientation creates a long-range modulation. So far, the study of the effect of twist angles in vdW heterostructures has been mostly concentrated in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) twisted structures, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction due to the presence of a large bandgap in h-BN. Here we show that when two graphene sheets are twisted by an angle close to the theoretically predicted 'magic angle', the resulting flat band structure near charge neutrality gives rise to a strongly-correlated electronic system. These flat bands exhibit half-filling insulating phases at zero magnetic field, which we show to be a Mott-like insulator arising from electrons localized in the moir\'e superlattice. These unique properties of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TwBLG) open up a new playground for exotic many-body quantum phases in a 2D platform made of pure carbon and without magnetic field. The easy accessibility of the flat bands, the electrical tunability, and the bandwidth tunability though twist angle may pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors or quantum spin liquids."
https://openalex.org/W2793309516,"A key limitation of the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for genome editing and other applications is the requirement that a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) be present at the target site. For the most commonly used Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), the required PAM sequence is NGG. No natural or engineered Cas9 variants that have been shown to function efficiently in mammalian cells offer a PAM less restrictive than NGG. Here we use phage-assisted continuous evolution to evolve an expanded PAM SpCas9 variant (xCas9) that can recognize a broad range of PAM sequences including NG, GAA and GAT. The PAM compatibility of xCas9 is the broadest reported, to our knowledge, among Cas9 proteins that are active in mammalian cells, and supports applications in human cells including targeted transcriptional activation, nuclease-mediated gene disruption, and cytidine and adenine base editing. Notably, despite its broadened PAM compatibility, xCas9 has much greater DNA specificity than SpCas9, with substantially lower genome-wide off-target activity at all NGG target sites tested, as well as minimal off-target activity when targeting genomic sites with non-NGG PAMs. These findings expand the DNA targeting scope of CRISPR systems and establish that there is no necessary trade-off between Cas9 editing efficiency, PAM compatibility and DNA specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2789329186,"New neurons continue to be generated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved."

https://openalex.org/W2792813139,"Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive paediatric cancer of the bone and soft tissue. It results from a chromosomal translocation, predominantly t(11;22)(q24:q12), that fuses the N-terminal transactivation domain of the constitutively expressed EWSR1 protein with the C-terminal DNA binding domain of the rarely expressed FLI1 protein. Ewing sarcoma is highly sensitive to genotoxic agents such as etoposide, but the underlying molecular basis of this sensitivity is unclear. Here we show that Ewing sarcoma cells display alterations in regulation of damage-induced transcription, accumulation of R-loops and increased replication stress. In addition, homologous recombination is impaired in Ewing sarcoma owing to an enriched interaction between BRCA1 and the elongating transcription machinery. Finally, we uncover a role for EWSR1 in the transcriptional response to damage, suppressing R-loops and promoting homologous recombination. Our findings improve the current understanding of EWSR1 function, elucidate the mechanistic basis of the sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma to chemotherapy (including PARP1 inhibitors) and highlight a class of BRCA-deficient-like tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2790755828,"Eukaryotic cells contain distinct organelles, but not all of these compartments are enclosed by membranes. Some intrinsically disordered proteins mediate membraneless organelle formation through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS facilitates many biological functions such as regulating RNA stability and ribonucleoprotein assembly, and disruption of LLPS pathways has been implicated in several diseases. Proteins exhibiting LLPS typically have low sequence complexity and specific repeat motifs. These motifs promote multivalent connections with other molecules and the formation of higher-order oligomers, and their removal usually prevents LLPS. The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein involved in motor neuron disease and dementia lacks a dominant LLPS motif, however, and how this domain forms condensates is unclear. Using extensive mutagenesis of TDP-43, we demonstrate here that three tryptophan residues and, to a lesser extent, four other aromatic residues are most important for TDP-43 to undergo LLPS. Our results also suggested that only a few residues may be required for TDP-43 LLPS because the α-helical segment (spanning ∼20 residues) in the middle part of the C-terminal domain tends to self-assemble, reducing the number of motifs required for forming a multivalent connection. Our results indicating that a self-associating α-helical element with a few key residues regulates condensate formation highlight a different type of LLPS involving intrinsically disordered regions. The C-terminal domain of TDP-43 contains ∼50 disease-related mutations, with no clear physicochemical link between them. We propose that they may disrupt LLPS indirectly by interfering with the key residues identified here.

https://openalex.org/W2789212851,"The insulin receptor is a dimeric protein that has a crucial role in controlling glucose homeostasis, regulating lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and modulating brain neurotransmitter levels. Insulin receptor dysfunction has been associated with many diseases, including diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The primary sequence of the receptor has been known since the 1980s, and is composed of an extracellular portion (the ectodomain, ECD), a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of insulin to the dimeric ECD triggers auto-phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain and subsequent activation of downstream signalling molecules. Biochemical and mutagenesis data have identified two putative insulin-binding sites, S1 and S2. The structures of insulin bound to an ECD fragment containing S1 and of the apo ectodomain have previously been reported, but details of insulin binding to the full receptor and the signal propagation mechanism are still not understood. Here we report single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of the 1:2 (4.3 Å) and 1:1 (7.4 Å) complexes of the insulin receptor ECD dimer with insulin. The symmetrical 4.3 Å structure shows two insulin molecules per dimer, each bound between the leucine-rich subdomain L1 of one monomer and the first fibronectin-like domain (FnIII-1) of the other monomer, and making extensive interactions with the α-subunit C-terminal helix (α-CT helix). The 7.4 Å structure has only one similarly bound insulin per receptor dimer. The structures confirm the binding interactions at S1 and define the full S2 binding site. These insulin receptor states suggest that recruitment of the α-CT helix upon binding of the first insulin changes the relative subdomain orientations and triggers downstream signal propagation."
https://openalex.org/W2789792412,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are trimeric, proton-gated and sodium-selective members of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily of ion channels and are expressed throughout vertebrate central and peripheral nervous systems. Gating of ASICs occurs on a millisecond time scale and the mechanism involves three conformational states: high pH resting, low pH open and low pH desensitized. Existing X-ray structures of ASIC1a describe the conformations of the open and desensitized states, but the structure of the high pH resting state and detailed mechanisms of the activation and desensitization of the channel have remained elusive. Here we present structures of the high pH resting state of homotrimeric chicken (Gallus gallus) ASIC1a, determined by X-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-electron microscopy, and present a comprehensive molecular mechanism for proton-dependent gating in ASICs. In the resting state, the position of the thumb domain is further from the three-fold molecular axis, thereby expanding the 'acidic pocket' in comparison to the open and desensitized states. Activation therefore involves 'closure' of the thumb into the acidic pocket, expansion of the lower palm domain and an iris-like opening of the channel gate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the β11-β12 linkers that demarcate the upper and lower palm domains serve as a molecular 'clutch', and undergo a simple rearrangement to permit rapid desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2789558792,"Predictive studies are of paramount importance for biological invasions, one of the biggest threats for biodiversity. To help and better prioritize management strategies, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential invasive range of introduced species. Yet, SDMs have been regularly criticized, due to several strong limitations, such as violating the equilibrium assumption during the invasion process. Unfortunately, validation studies–with independent data–are too scarce to assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in invasion biology. Yet, biological invasions allow to test SDMs usefulness, by retrospectively assessing whether they would have accurately predicted the latest ranges of invasion. Here, we assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in predicting the expansion of invasive species. We used temporal occurrence data for the Asian hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, a species native to China that is invading Europe with a very fast rate. Specifically, we compared occurrence data from the last stage of invasion (independent validation points) to the climate suitability distribution predicted from models calibrated with data from the early stage of invasion. Despite the invasive species not being at equilibrium yet, the predicted climate suitability of validation points was high. SDMs can thus adequately predict the spread of V. v. nigrithorax, which appears to be—at least partially–climatically driven. In the case of V. v. nigrithorax, SDMs predictive accuracy was slightly but significantly better when models were calibrated with invasive data only, excluding native data. Although more validation studies for other invasion cases are needed to generalize our results, our findings are an important step towards validating the use of SDMs in invasion biology."
https://openalex.org/W2794358105,"Early co-transcriptional events during eukaryotic ribosome assembly result in the formation of precursors of the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits. A multitude of transient assembly factors regulate and chaperone the systematic folding of pre-ribosomal RNA subdomains. However, owing to a lack of structural information, the role of these factors during early nucleolar 60S assembly is not fully understood. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of the nucleolar pre-60S ribosomal subunit in different conformational states at resolutions of up to 3.4 Å. These reconstructions reveal how steric hindrance and molecular mimicry are used to prevent both premature folding states and binding of later factors. This is accomplished by the concerted activity of 21 ribosome assembly factors that stabilize and remodel pre-ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins. Among these factors, three Brix-domain proteins and their binding partners form a ring-like structure at ribosomal RNA (rRNA) domain boundaries to support the architecture of the maturing particle. The existence of mutually exclusive conformations of these pre-60S particles suggests that the formation of the polypeptide exit tunnel is achieved through different folding pathways during subsequent stages of ribosome assembly. These structures rationalize previous genetic and biochemical data and highlight the mechanisms that drive eukaryotic ribosome assembly in a unidirectional manner."
https://openalex.org/W2791139933,"Animal by-product meals from the rendering industry could provide a sustainable and commercially viable alternative to fishmeal (FM) in aquaculture, as they are rich in most essential amino acids and contain important amounts of water-soluble proteins that improve feed digestibility and palatability. Among them, poultry by-product meal (PBM) have given encouraging results in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). However, the introduction of new ingredients in the diet needs to be carefully evaluated since diet is one of the main factors affecting the gut microbiota, which is a complex community that contributes to host metabolism, nutrition, growth, and disease resistance. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of partial replacement of dietary FM with a mix of animal by-product meals and plant proteins on intestinal microbiota composition of rainbow trout in relation to growth and feeding efficiency parameters. We used 1540 trout with an initial mean body weight of 94.6 ± 14.2 g. Fish were fed for 12 weeks with 7 different feed formulations. The growth data showed that trout fed on diets rich in animal by-product meals grew as well as fish fed on control diet, which was rich in FM (37.3%) and PBM-free. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (MiSeq platform, Illumina) was utilised to study the gut microbial community profile. After discarding Cyanobacteria (class Chloroplast) and mitochondria reads a total of 2,701,274 of reads taxonomically classified, corresponding to a mean of 96,474 ± 68,056 reads per sample, were obtained. Five thousand three hundred ninety-nine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, which predominantly mapped to the phyla of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The ratio between vegetable and animal proteins proved to play a central role in determining microbiome profiles and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were particularly discriminatory for diet type in trout. Plant ingredients favoured a higher Firmicutes:Proteobacteria ratio than animal proteins. Acceptable abundance of Firmicutes was guaranteed by including at least 25% of vegetable proteins in the diet regardless of animal protein source and percentage. In summary animal by-product meals, as replacements to FM, gave good results in terms of growth performances and did not induce significant changes in gut microbial richness, thus proving to be a suitable protein source for use in rainbow trout aqua feed."

https://openalex.org/W2767861340,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. MYC genes are frequently amplified and correlate with poor prognosis in MB. BET bromodomains recognize acetylated lysine residues and often promote and maintain MYC transcription. Certain cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are further known to support MYC stabilization in tumor cells. In this report, MB cells were suppressed by combined targeting of MYC expression and MYC stabilization using BET bromodomain inhibition and CDK2 inhibition, respectively. Such combination treatment worked synergistically and caused cell cycle arrest as well as massive apoptosis. Immediate transcriptional changes from this combined MYC blockade were found using RNA-Seq profiling and showed remarkable similarities to changes in MYC target gene expression when MYCN was turned off with doxycycline in our MYCN-inducible animal model for Group 3 MB. In addition, the combination treatment significantly prolonged survival as compared to single-agent therapy in orthotopically transplanted human Group 3 MB with MYC amplifications. Our data suggest that dual inhibition of CDK2 and BET bromodomains can be a novel treatment approach for suppressing MYC-driven cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2789423629,"Tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression; however, little is known regarding how differences in the microenvironment affect characteristics of cancer cells. Here, we investigated the effects of tumor microenvironment on cancer cells by using mouse tumor models. After three cycles of inoculation and extraction of human pancreatic cancer cells, including SUIT-2 and Panc-1 cells, from tumors, distinct cancer cell lines were established: 3P cells from the pancreas obtained using the orthotopic tumor model and 3sc cells from subcutaneous tissue obtained using the subcutaneous tumor model. On re-inoculation of these cells, the 3sc cells and, more prominently, the 3P cells, exhibited higher tumorigenic activity than the parental cells. The 3P cells specifically exhibited low E-cadherin expression and high invasiveness, suggesting that they were endowed with the highest malignant characteristics. RNA-sequence analysis demonstrated that distinct signaling pathways were activated in each cell line and that the 3P cells acquired a cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Among cancer stem cell-related genes, those specifically expressed in the 3P cells, including NES, may be potential new targets for cancer therapy. The mechanisms underlying the development of highly malignant cancer cell lines were investigated. Individual cell clones within the parental cells varied in tumor-forming ability, indicating the presence of cellular heterogeneity. Moreover, the tumor-forming ability and the gene expression profile of each cell clone were altered after serial orthotopic inoculations. The present study thus suggests that both selection and education processes by tumor microenvironment are involved in the development of highly malignant cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2793761009,"Liver diseases are a growing epidemic worldwide. If unresolved, liver fibrosis develops and can lead to cirrhosis and clinical decompensation. Around 5% of cirrhotic liver diseased patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which in its advanced stages has limited therapeutic options and negative survival outcomes. CEPBA is a master regulator of hepatic function where its expression is known to be suppressed in many forms of liver disease including HCC. Injection of MTL-CEBPA, a small activating RNA oligonucleotide therapy (CEBPA-51) formulated in liposomal nanoparticles (NOV340- SMARTICLES) upregulates hepatic CEBPA expression. Here we show how MTL-CEBPA therapy promotes disease reversal in rodent models of cirrhosis, fibrosis, hepatosteatosis, and significantly reduces tumor burden in cirrhotic HCC. Restoration of liver function markers were observed in a carbon-tetrachloride-induced rat model of fibrosis following 2 weeks of MTL-CEBPA therapy. At 14 weeks, animals showed reduction in ascites and enhanced survival rates. MTL-CEBPA reversed changes associated with hepatosteatosis in non-alcoholic methionine and cholic-deficient diet-induced steaotic liver disease. In diethylnitrosamine induced cirrhotic HCC rats, MTL-CEBPA treatment led to a significant reduction in tumor burden. The data included here and the rapid adoption of MTL-CEBPA into a Phase 1 study may lead to new therapeutic oligonucleotides for undruggable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2791796243,"Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 10% of adults, and alters brain gray and white matter. Psychological and physiological symptoms of the disorder are sex-specific, perhaps related to greater injury occurs in female than male patients in white matter. Our objective was to identify influences of OSA separated by sex on cortical gray matter. Methods We assessed cortical thickness in 48 mild-severe OSA patients (mean age±std[range] = 46.5±9.0[30.8–62.7] years; apnea-hypopnea index = 32.6±21.1[6–102] events/hour; 12 female, 36 male; OSA severity: 5 mild, 18 moderate, 25 severe) and 62 controls (mean age = 47.7±8.9[30.9–65.8] years; 22 female, 40 male). All OSA patients were recently-diagnosed via polysomnography, and control subjects screened and a subset assessed with sleep studies. We used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to identify OSA-related cortical thinning, based on a model with condition and sex as independent variables. OSA and OSA-by-sex interaction effects were assessed (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Results Multiple regions of reduced cortical thickness appeared bilaterally in the superior frontal lobe in female OSA vs. all other groups. Significant thinning within the pre- and post-central gyri and the superior temporal gyrus, extending into the insula, appeared between the general OSA populations vs. control subjects. No areas showed increased thickness in OSA vs. controls or positive female OSA interaction effects. Conclusions Reduced cortical thickness likely represents tissue atrophy from long term injury, including death of neurons and supporting glia from repeated intermittent hypoxic exposure in OSA, although disease comordities may also contribute to thinning. Lack of polysomnography in all control subjects means results may be confounded by undiagnosed OSA. The greater cortical injury in cognitive areas of female OSA patients may underlie enhanced symptoms in that group. The thinning associated with OSA in male and females OSA patients may contribute to autonomic dysregulation and impaired upper airway sensori-motor function."
https://openalex.org/W2791561964,"Children nowadays, particularly in urban areas, are more disconnected from nature than ever before, leading to a large-scale “extinction of experience” with the natural world. Yet there are many potential benefits from children interacting with nature first-hand, including via outdoor learning opportunities. Urban environmental education programmes typically aim to increase awareness and knowledge of local biodiversity and to promote positive attitudes and behaviour towards the environment. However, limited research has been conducted evaluating to what extent these interventions achieve their goals. Here, we explore and assess the influence of a six-week bird-feeding and monitoring project conducted within school grounds (“Bird Buddies”) on individual awareness, knowledge and attitudes towards birds by primary school children. This initiative was conducted across eight (sub-)urban primary schools within Brighton and Hove (UK), with 220 participating children (aged 7 to 10). Via pre- and post-project questionnaires, we found evidence for enhanced awareness of local biodiversity, alongside significant gains in both bird identification knowledge and attitudes, which were greatest for children with little prior exposure to nature. Many children expressed a keenness to continue improving the environmental value of their school grounds and to apply elements of the project at home. Student project evaluation scores were consistently positive. Mirroring this, participating teachers endorsed the project as a positive learning experience for their students. One year after the project, several schools were continuing to feed and watch birds. Collectively, the findings from this study highlight the multiple benefits that can be derived from engagement with a relatively short outdoor environmental activity. We therefore believe that such interventions, if repeated locally/longer term, could enhance children’s experience with nature in urban settings with combined positive environmental impact."
https://openalex.org/W2790271688,"Biomarkers and mechanisms of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity in tumor cells lacking a BRCA-mutant or BRCA-like phenotype are poorly defined. We sought to explore the utility of PARP-1 inhibitor (PARPi) treatment with/without ionizing radiation in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which has poor therapeutic outcomes. We assessed the DNA damaging and cytotoxic effects of the PARPi olaparib in nine bladder cancer cell lines. Olaparib radiosensitized all cell lines with dose enhancement factors from 1.22 to 2.27. Radiosensitization was correlated with the induction of potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) but not with RAD51 foci formation. The ability of olaparib to radiosensitize MIBC cells was linked to the extent of cell kill achieved with the drug alone. Unexpectedly, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from PARPi treatment were the cause of DSB throughout the cell cycle in vitro and in vivo. ROS originated from mitochondria and were required for the radiosensitizing effects of olaparib. Consistent with the role of TP53 in ROS regulation, loss of p53 function enhanced radiosensitization by olaparib in non-isogenic and isogenic cell line models and was associated with increased PARP-1 expression in bladder cancer cell lines and tumors. Impairment of ATM in addition to p53 loss resulted in an even more pronounced radiosensitization. In conclusion, ROS suppression by PARP-1 in MIBC is a potential therapeutic target either for PARPi combined with radiation or drug alone treatment. The TP53 and ATM genes, commonly mutated in MIBC and other cancers, are candidate biomarkers of PARPi-mediated radiosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2793203376,"Adipose tissue is a metabolic and endocrine organ that secretes bioactive molecules called adipocyto-kines. Among these, adiponectin has a crucial role in obesity-associated breast cancer. The key molecule of adiponectin signaling is AMPK, which is mainly activated by liver kinase B1 (LKB1). Here, we demonstrated that estrogen receptor-α (ERα)/LKB1 interaction may negatively interfere with the LKB1 capability to phosphorylate AMPK and inhibit its downstream signaling TSC2/mTOR/p70S6k. In adiponectin-treated MCF-7 cells, AMPK signaling was not working, resulting in its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) being still active. In contrast, in MDA-MB-231 cells, AMPK and ACC phosphorylation was enhanced by adiponectin, inhibiting lipo-genesis and cell growth. Upon adiponectin, ERα signaling switched the energy balance of breast cancer cells toward a lipogenic phenotype. Therefore, adiponectin played an inhibitory role on ERα-negative cell growth and progression in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, low adiponectin levels, similar to those circulating in obese patients, acted on ERα-positive cells as a growth factor, stimulating proliferation. The latter effect was blunted in vivo by high adiponectin concentration. All this may have translational relevance, addressing how the handling of adiponectin, as a therapeutic tool in breast cancer treatment, needs to be carefully considered in ERα-positive obese patients, where circulating levels of this adipocytokine are relatively low. In other words, in ERα-positive breast cancer obese patients, higher adiponectin doses should be administered with respect to ERα-negative breast cancer, also opportunely combined with antiestrogen therapy..—Mauro, L., Naimo, G.

However, the details of the protein dynamics within either macroscopic IF or OF conformation remain uncharacterized, and the functional role of local dynamics has not been determined.

Among the complex properties of P-gp, the mechanisms by which it achieves its extraordinary substrate promiscuity have not been fully understood. P-glycoprotein is a member of the ABC transporter family (ATP Binding Cassette), which includes many structurally related transporters that utilize ATP hydrolysis to transport lipophilic substrates. P-gp includes 12 transmembrane helices (TMHs) that comprise the drug-binding site and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) that alternately bind and hydrolyze ATP (4Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A.

The linear sequence of P-gp includes an N-terminal transmembrane domain containing six TMHs collectively referred to as “transmembrane domain 1” (TMD1), followed by NBD1, a linker region, six additional TMHs, collectively called “transmembrane domain 2” (TMD2), and a second NBD (NBD2).

For some ABC transporters, nucleotides drive the formation of a stable OF conformation with the NBDs in intimate contact. In addition, the transition state for ATP hydrolysis can be mimicked by addition of ATP, or ADP, and vanadate, which “traps” a quasi-stable OF conformation (13Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J.

In contrast to Sav1886 or MsbA, however, recent data suggest that the IF to OF conformational transition of P-gp is less tightly coupled to nucleotide binding (15Esser L. Zhou F. Pluchino K.M.

The emerging model suggests that drug-free P-gp samples a wide range of IF conformations that could bind different substrates or inhibitors, even with nucleotide bound. Apparently, the drug-free P-gp explores an expansive conformational landscape with a dynamic equilibrium of states defined by different inter-NBD distances. However, little is known about this landscape or the local conformational status of discrete regions within either the IF or OF ensembles. Molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray structures suggest that, in addition to the large amplitude motions associated with switching between IF and OF states, some regions undergo local fluctuations in secondary structure, including “hinge regions” in the TMHs (12Wen P.C.

It is possible that low amplitude, local, transitions in these hinge regions could be propagated to the NBDs to account for the wide range of inter-NBD distances. However, no experimental methods have revealed specific conformational changes within the IF ensemble that could participate in the recruitment of substrates or coupling of binding and ATP hydrolysis. In fact, no information is available concerning the time scales for conformational relaxation within the ensemble. In addition, the structural models are obtained in the absence of a membrane, so the effects of a lipid bilayer on the conformational status remain uncharacterized. To map the local dynamics of P-gp with increased spatial and temporal resolution, we have performed hydrogen–deuterium (H/D) exchange MS (H/DX MS) with P-gp in either lipid nanodiscs or in a lipid/detergent solution. The results indicate complex local dynamics superimposed on the IF conformational ensemble. Interestingly, the dynamics include motions on a remarkably wide range of time scales. H/DX MS was performed with P-gp reconstituted in either DMPC nanodiscs or in detergent/lipid micelles, using membrane scaffold protein 1D1 (MSP1D1) as described under “Experimental procedures.” For each case, at various times after dilution into buffer containing D2O, the exchange reactions were quenched, the protein was digested, and peptides were analyzed for deuterium uptake. The recovered observable peptides spanned 37.7 and 40.1% of the total protein primary sequence for P-gp in nanodiscs versus P-gp in detergent, respectively. As expected this mainly included peptides in the NBDs, covering 68.2 and 70.3% of the NBDs for the P-gp in nanodiscs versus in detergent, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Thus, the H/DX provides a good characterization of the backbone dynamics for the NBDs, with additional information about a few peptides in the TMHs.Table 1Percent coverage of major domains of P-gp in detergent and nanodiscsP-gp in detergent-lipid micellesP-gp nanodiscsOverall coverage (%)40.137.7TMD1 coverage (%)15.613TMD2 coverage (%)1915.7NBD1 coverage (%)76.273.8NBD2 coverage (%)64.262.7Redundancy2.21.55Total peptides9159Bimodal peptides (observed)415 Open table in a new tab Whereas all experiments with P-gp nanodiscs were run in parallel, so that there are no differences in deuterium loss during analysis (back exchange), the experiments with P-gp in micelles were performed separately and can only be qualitatively compared with the experiments with nanodiscs. Therefore, we adopt a conservative approach and do not quantitatively compare results in detergent micelles to nanodiscs samples. Regardless of this, the results clearly demonstrate that the deuterium exchange behavior is qualitatively very similar in the two environments. Exemplary deuterium uptake profiles for a few peptides from P-gp in micelles are shown in Fig. 2. Uptake profiles for all peptides are included in the supporting Fig. S1. The deuterium uptake profiles are consistent with the structure of P-gp. For example, peptide 1 (residues 69–78) is in the membrane-embedded TMH1 and exchanges deuterium very slowly, whereas peptide 2 (residues 631–647) is in the unstructured linker region between the two halves of P-gp and exchanges deuterium very quickly. Other observed peptides have a range of deuterium exchange properties and some are discussed below. The uptake profiles also reveal differential sensitivity of the peptides to vanadate trapping, as elaborated below. A summary of all deuterium uptake data for peptides throughout the P-gp sequence is provided in Fig. 3. The fractional incorporation of deuterium into all recovered peptides at varying times is shown in Fig. 3A for the nucleotide-free P-gp as well as for ATP/vanadate-trapped P-gp (Vi Trapped in Fig. 3A) in both nanodiscs and detergent micelles. The individual points represent the midpoint of each observed peptide and report the percent of amide protons that have been exchanged for that peptide. Note that the density of points within the sequences corresponding to the TMHs is much lower than the density of points in the regions corresponding to NBDs. This reflects the lower recovery of peptides in the TMHs. The “butterfly plots” in Fig. 3A indicate only modest changes in H/D exchange upon vanadate trapping (lower half of each butterfly plot) compared with the apo-P-gp (upper half of each butterfly plot). The differences are most easily identified in the difference plots in Fig. 3B, where positive values indicate peptides with lower deuterium exchange in the vanadate-trapped samples compared with apo samples and negative values indicate greater exchange in the vanadate-trapped protein. These plots demonstrate that the relative deuterium exchange rates of peptides in different locations are very similar for P-gp in detergent versus in nanodiscs with a few notable differences. Furthermore, sequences throughout both NBDs become modestly less susceptible to exchange upon vanadate trapping, and the overall differences are slightly larger for the P-gp in detergent than in nanodiscs. A few specific peptides are of particular interest. It is notable that intracellular loops (ICL) ICL1, ICL3, and ICL4 that are thought to mediate coupling between drug-binding sites in the TMHs (18Jin M.S. Oldham M.L. Zhang Q. Chen J.

These ICLs exhibit a greater sensitivity to vanadate trapping in detergent than in nanodiscs. Consistently in both detergent and lipid environments, ICL4 is the most exchange-protected in the presence of vanadate, followed by ICL1. The peptide-(69–78) in TM1 (peptide 1 in Fig. 2) is notable and provides a useful benchmark for the behavior of the TMHs. The recovery of peptides in the TMHs is very low, as expected because they are hydrophobic and likely depleted during sample clean-up, but it is striking that among the peptides recovered for the P-gp sequence, this peptide is one of only two peptides that exhibits an increase in deuterium exchange upon vanadate trapping. The increase in deuterium exchange is very modest but it was consistently observed in three separate experiments (see supporting Fig. S2). This is consistent with an increase in the contribution of the OF state upon vanadate trapping with corresponding movements of TM1 or neighboring TM helices, as suggested by cross-linking experiments and calculated solvent-accessible surface area changes (17Pan L. Aller S.G. Equilibrated atomic models of outward-facing P-glycoprotein and effect of ATP binding on structural dynamics.Sci.

Another region that consistently shows a modest increase in deuterium exchange upon vanadate trapping is near the D and H loops of NBD2, but not observed in NBD1. In fact, this effect in NBD2 emphasizes the asymmetric effects of vanadate trapping that are well-documented (15Esser L. Zhou F. Pluchino K.M. Shiloach J. Ma J. Tang W.K. Gutierrez C. Zhang A.

Specifically, the Walker A (WA) peptide and the Q loop in NBD1 undergo a larger decrease in solvent accessibility with vanadate trapping compared with NBD2, and in general, NBD1 is more sensitive to ATP/vanadate than NBD2. These results for the P-gp in nanodiscs and in detergent, in the presence and absence of ATP/vanadate, are superimposed on the three-dimensional structure of murine P-gp in Fig. 3, C and D. Close examination of the time course of deuterium exchange revealed a large number of peptides with time-dependent bimodal mass envelope distributions indicative of “EX1 kinetics.” Unlike the more commonly observed EX2 kinetics, where amide protons exchange gradually in an uncorrelated manner, EX1 behavior arises from correlated protein motions that occur more slowly than amide exchange (24Weis D.D. Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Hotchko M. Ten Eyck L.F. Identification and characterization of EX1 kinetics in H/D exchange mass spectrometry by peak width analysis.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17 (16875839): 1498-150910.1016/j.jasms.2006.05.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The EX1 kinetics can provide a direct measure of conformational transitions, in contrast to the EX2 kinetics that report on deuterium exchange of a single conformation or rapidly interconverting conformations. A total of 4 peptides exhibited varying degrees of mixed EX1/EX2 kinetics for P-gp in detergent and an additional 11 peptides demonstrated this behavior in nanodiscs, suggesting that the lipid bilayer slows down local dynamics that are otherwise too fast to observe in the detergent preparations, or the membrane induces additional local structure that slowly “opens.” The deuterium uptake data for exemplary mixed EX1/EX2 behavior are shown in Fig. 4. The widespread distribution of peptides with EX1 kinetic behavior throughout the NBDs, particularly for P-gp in a lipid bilayer, suggests a wide range of conformational diversity on biologically relevant time scales (Fig. 4B). It is particularly striking that the EX1 kinetics occur on a such wide range of time scales for different peptides; some peptides undergo conformational transitions over the course of a minute, whereas others take several minutes to a few hours. Interestingly, some peptides that are far apart based on the primary sequence but interact closely with each other in the tertiary structure of the protein exhibit EX1 kinetics on a similar time scale, such as ICL1-(153–167) and ICL4-(901–915), which extend as coupling helices to NBD 1 (Fig. 3D). Peptides with slower relaxation rates are found at both of the NBDs in the ATP-binding sites. These peptides are mapped onto the structure of P-gp in Fig. 3, C and D, and some are discussed in greater detail below. To ensure that the unusually slow conformational exchange revealed by the bimodal EX1 kinetics of some peptides was not simply due to time-dependent denaturation of P-gp, we monitored the functional properties of P-gp in detergent and nanodiscs during the time course used to monitor H/DX. P-gp in nanodiscs, and separately in detergent/lipid micelles, was preincubated at 25 °C for varying durations and then assayed for ATPase activity by a standard colorimetric method (see “Experimental procedures”). Verapamil was added postincubation to the ATPase assay buffer to produce an appreciable increase in phosphate release. The results are shown in Fig. S3A. The stimulated ATPase activities of P-gp in detergent and nanodiscs are constant throughout the entire course of the 4-h H/DX experiment. As an additional probe of the functional effects of the time-dependent changes in conformation observed by H/DX, we preincubated a sample of P-gp nanodiscs for 4 h at 25 °C prior to H/D exchange. After 4 h we performed an H/D exchange experiment and monitored deuterium uptake after 1 min. The results were essentially identical to the deuterium uptake observed at 1 min without preincubation (Fig. S3B). This result demonstrates that the slow conformational exchange observed in the EX1 kinetic behavior is not the result of an irreversible, nonequilibrium, change such as degradation or aggregation. Rather the slow EX1 kinetics reflect native conformational dynamics of equilibrating states. As noted above, several peptides exhibit EX1 kinetics on varying time scales (Fig. 4). Additional examples are shown in the supporting information (Fig. S4), and include peptide-(494–508), peptide-(593–611), and peptide-(1036–1053). Vanadate trapping slows down the rates of EX1 transitions for some, but not all, of these peptides. Two peptides with “moderate” and “fast” EX1 kinetics that are sensitive to Vi trapping, respectively, are peptide-(901–915) and peptide-(1036–1053) (Fig. 5). For peptide-(1036–1053) that is located in an unstructured loop region after TM12 but prior to WA (NBD2), the increase in t½ for conformational exchange upon Vi trapping is estimated to be ∼12-fold, from 47 s to 9.6 min (supporting Fig. S4). This is consistent with the general “tightening” of the NBDs noted in Fig. 2, with some peptides more affected than others. For peptides that exhibit slower EX1 kinetics, such as peptide-(901–915), the rate constant for exchange in the presence of ATP and Vi could not be measured accurately within the resolution of these experiments due to a small number of time points, although the effect on EX1 rates are directly observable. This effect of vanadate trapping on the rate of conformational exchange, reflected in the EX1 kinetics, is presumably coupled to the shift toward the OF conformation and increased NBD1–NBD2 interactions. The results provide an experimentally-based measurement of the conformational dynamics for specific peptides of P-gp in a lipid bilayer and they reveal several features of nucleotide-dependent, and environmentally sensitive, P-gp dynamics. The results further provide new information about the energy landscape of the IF and OF conformational ensembles and their interconversion in a lipid bilayer. The first important observation is that the global dynamics of P-gp are qualitatively very similar in lipid/detergent micelles versus in lipid nanodiscs, including both ligand-free and “vanadate-trapped” states. This provides assurance that the structure of solubilized P-gp in the presence of lipid faithfully mimics the overall structure in the lipid bilayer. There are, however, modest differences between the H/DX behavior in the two environments, which may be critically important for interpreting some results in the literature. Because the behavior of P-gp in the two environments is qualitatively similar, the discussion highlights important conclusions that span both environments. First the ligand-free P-gp is considered followed by the Vi-trapped state. The most striking result is the large number of peptides in the ligand-free IF state that exhibit EX1 kinetics. Generally, all of the peptides that display bimodal EX1 kinetics are found in connecting loop regions between β strands or α-helices in the NBDs or ICLs. This is consistent with MD simulations where local fluctuations in these regions contribute to global, conformational dynamics of P-gp (12Wen P.C. Verhalen B. Wilkens S. Mchaourab H.S. Tajkhorshid E.

https://openalex.org/W2793779014,"Objective We aim to explore the barriers to accessing primary care for socio-economically disadvantaged older people in rural areas. Methods Using a community recruitment strategy, fifteen people over 65 years, living in a rural area, and receiving financial support were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Four focus groups were held with rural health professionals. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify barriers to primary care access. Findings Older people’s experience can be understood within the context of a patient perceived set of unwritten rules or social contract–an individual is careful not to bother the doctor in return for additional goodwill when they become unwell. However, most found it difficult to access primary care due to engaged telephone lines, availability of appointments, interactions with receptionists; breaching their perceived social contract. This left some feeling unwelcome, worthless or marginalised, especially those with high expectations of the social contract or limited resources, skills and/or desire to adapt to service changes. Health professionals’ described how rising demands and expectations coupled with service constraints had necessitated service development, such as fewer home visits, more telephone consultations, triaging calls and modifying the appointment system. Conclusion Multiple barriers to accessing primary care exist for this group. As primary care is re-organised to reduce costs, commissioners and practitioners must not lose sight of the perceived social contract and models of care that form the basis of how many older people interact with the service."
https://openalex.org/W2790275320,"Low–cost biosorbents (ginkgo leaf, osmanthus leaf, banyan leaf, magnolia leaf, holly leaf, walnut shell, and grapefruit peel) were evaluated in the simultaneous removal of La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Yb3+, Lu3+, UO22+, Th4+, Y3+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Sr2+ from aqueous solutions. In single metal systems, all adsorbents exhibited good to excellent adsorption capacities toward lanthanides and actinides. In a simulated multicomponent mixed solution study, higher selectivity and efficiency were observed for Th4+ over other metal cations, with ginkgo leaves providing the highest adsorptivity (81.2%) among the seven biosorbents. Through optimization studies, the selectivity of Th4+ biosorption on ginkgo leaf was found to be highly pH–dependent, with optimum Th4+ removal observed at pH 4. Th4+ adsorption was found to proceed rapidly with an equilibrium time of 120 min and conform to pseudo–second–order kinetics. The Langmuir isotherm model best described Th4+ biosorption, with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 103.8 mg g–1. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that Th4+ biosorption was spontaneous and endothermic. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent were determined by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, X-ray powder diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared analysis. The biosorption of Th from a real sample (monazite mineral) was studied and an efficiency of 90.4% was achieved from nitric acid at pH 4 using ginkgo leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2789829350,"Background Recent WHO guidelines recommend dual therapy with ceftriaxone or cefixime plus azithromycin for gonorrhea. Azithromycin in combination with gentamicin or spectinomycin has been recommended in treatment failure cases. Due to emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively-drug resistant (XDR) Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, it is important to look for efficacy of these combinations and also of others that might be used in future. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate in vitro synergy of 21 dual combinations including current and alternative WHO recommended treatment regimens and other dual combinations. Methods and findings The potential utility of in-vitro interactions of 21 combinations was investigated against 95 N. gonorrhoeae strains including 79 MDR and one XDR strain collected during March 2013 to July 2017 and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated. These 21 combinations comprised of two WHO currently recommended (cefixime+azithromycin, ceftriaxone+azithromycin); two WHO recommended in treatment failure cases (azithromycin+gentamicin, spectinomycin+azithromycin) and other 17 combinations. Results FICI of the four WHO recommended antimicrobial combinations were higher (>1.0) than the five novel combinationbreeds (FICI range 0.603–0.951) in the study i.e. gentamicin+ertapenem, moxifloxacin+ertapenem, spectinomycin+ertapenem, azithromycin+ moxifloxacin, cefixime+gentamicin. No antagonistic effect of the above four WHO recommended combinations except spectinomycin+azithromycin (FICI = 4.25) was observed for the XDR strain. Out of above five novel combinations, four combinations produced high synergistic effects in overall 95 strains and also for the XDR strain with FICI of 0.13 to 0.38. Antagonistic effects varying from 3.2 to 12.6% were observed for 10 out of 21 tested combinations (azithromycin in combination with gentamicin and spectinomycin; ceftriaxone with moxifloxacin, gentamicin, spectinomycin and ertapenem; spectinomycin with moxifloxacin and gentamicin; cefixime and gentamicin combination with moxifloxacin). Conclusion WHO recommended cefixime+azithromycin, ceftriaxone+azithromycin combinations having no antagonism indicates their continuing clinical utility. Highest antagonism without any synergistic effect for the WHO recommended spectinomycin+azithromycin in treatment failure cases suggests that this combination should be evaluated further both in vitro and in vivo. Highest synergistic or additive effect without any antagonistic effect of the above five novel combinations suggests that these may be recommended for treatment in future."
https://openalex.org/W2791362637,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism for biomedical research and genetic studies relevant to human biology and disease. Such studies are often based on high-resolution imaging of dynamic biological processes in the worm body tissues, requiring well-immobilized and physiologically active animals in order to avoid movement-related artifacts and to obtain meaningful biological information. However, existing immobilization methods employ the application of either anesthetics or servere physical constraints, by using glue or specific microfluidic on-chip mechanical structures, which in some cases may strongly affect physiological processes of the animals. Here, we immobilize C. elegans nematodes by taking advantage of a biocompatible and temperature-responsive hydrogel-microbead matrix. Our gel-based immobilization technique does not require a specific chip design and enables fast and reversible immobilization, thereby allowing successive imaging of the same single worm or of small worm populations at all development stages for several days. We successfully demonstrated the applicability of this method in challenging worm imaging contexts, in particular by applying it for high-resolution confocal imaging of the mitochondrial morphology in worm body wall muscle cells and for the long-term quantification of number and size of specific protein aggregates in different C. elegans neurodegenerative disease models. Our approach was also suitable for immobilizing other small organisms, such as the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei. We anticipate that this versatile technique will significantly simplify biological assay-based longitudinal studies and long-term observation of small model organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2789317204,"In this paper, we present the construction of a reliable and inexpensive pH stat device, by using open-source “OpenPhControl” software, inexpensive hardware (a peristaltic and a syringe pump, Arduino, a step motor…), readily available laboratory devices: a pH meter, a computer, a webcam, and some 3D printed parts. We provide a methodology for the design, development and test results of each part of the device, as well as of the entire system. In addition to dosing reagents by means of a low-cost peristaltic pump, we also present carefully controlled dosing of reagents by an open-source syringe pump. The upgrading of the basic open-source syringe pump is given in terms of pump control and application of a larger syringe. In addition to the basic functions of pH stat, i.e. pH value measurement and maintenance, an improvement allowing the device to be used for potentiometric titration has been made as well. We have demonstrated the device’s utility when applied for cellulose fibers oxidation with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical, i.e. for TEMPO-mediated oxidation. In support of this, we present the results obtained for the oxidation kinetics, the consumption of added reagent and experimental repeatability. Considering that the open-source scientific tools are available to everyone, and that researchers can construct and adjust the device according to their needs, as well as, that the total cost of the open-source pH stat device, excluding the existing laboratory equipment (pH meter, computer and glossary) was less than 150 EUR, we believe that, at a small fraction of the cost of available commercial offers, our open-source pH stat can significantly improve experimental work where the use of pH stat is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2792910434,"Sal-like 4 (SALL4) is a transcription factor that enhances proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells. SALL4 expression therefore has the potential to promote cancer malignancy. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in SALL4 protein expression have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, we observed that treating MCF-7 and SUM159 breast cancer cell lines with a proteasome inhibitor increases SALL4 protein levels, suggesting that SALL4 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Using immunoprecipitation to uncover SALL4-binding proteins, we identified an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21). Using an EGFP reporter probe of the major SALL4 isoform SALL4B, we observed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRIM21 increases cellular SALL4B levels. Immunostaining experiments revealed that TRIM21 localizes to the nucleus, and a K64R substitution in the nuclear localization motif in SALL4B increased SALL4B levels in the cytoplasm. These results suggested that TRIM21 is involved in nuclear SALL4 degradation. To identify the amino acid residue that is targeted by TRIM21, we fragmented the SALL4B sequence, fused it to EGFP, and identified Lys-190 in SALL4B as TRIM21's target residue. Amino acid sequence alignments of SALL family members indicated that the region around SALL4 Lys-190 is conserved in both SALL1 and SALL3. Because SALL1 and SALL4 have similar functions, we constructed a SALL1-EGFP probe and found that the TRIM21 knockdown increases SALL1 levels, indicating that TRIM21 degrades both SALL1 and SALL4. Our findings extend our understanding of SALL4 and SALL1 regulation and may contribute to the development of SALL4-targeting therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2793657564,"Though malaria control initiatives have markedly reduced malaria prevalence in recent decades, global eradication is far from actuality. Recent studies show that environmental and social heterogeneities in low-transmission settings have an increased weight in shaping malaria micro-epidemiology. New integrated and more localized control strategies should be developed and tested. Here we present a set of agent-based models designed to study the influence of local scale human movements on local scale malaria transmission in a typical Amazon environment, where malaria is transmission is low and strongly connected with seasonal riverine flooding. The agent-based simulations show that the overall malaria incidence is essentially not influenced by local scale human movements. In contrast, the locations of malaria high risk spatial hotspots heavily depend on human movements because simulated malaria hotspots are mainly centered on farms, were laborers work during the day. The agent-based models are then used to test the effectiveness of two different malaria control strategies both designed to reduce local scale malaria incidence by targeting hotspots. The first control scenario consists in treat against mosquito bites people that, during the simulation, enter at least once inside hotspots revealed considering the actual sites where human individuals were infected. The second scenario involves the treatment of people entering in hotspots calculated assuming that the infection sites of every infected individual is located in the household where the individual lives. Simulations show that both considered scenarios perform better in controlling malaria than a randomized treatment, although targeting household hotspots shows slightly better performance."
https://openalex.org/W2793646633,"Tumor metastasis depends on the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion through β1-integrin. The Cub-Domain Containing Protein-1, CDCP1, is a transmembrane glycoprotein which regulates cell adhesion. Overexpression and loss of CDCP1 have been observed in the same cancer types to promote metastatic progression. Here, we demonstrate reduced CDCP1 expression in high-grade, primary prostate cancers, circulating tumor cells and tumor metastases of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. CDCP1 is expressed in epithelial and not mesenchymal cells, and its cell surface and mRNA expression declines upon stimulation with TGFβ1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Silencing of CDCP1 in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in 3.4-fold higher proliferation of non-adherent cells and 4.4-fold greater anchorage independent growth. CDCP1-silenced tumors grew in 100% of mice, compared to 30% growth of CDCP1-expressing tumors. After CDCP1 silencing, cell adhesion and migration diminished 2.1-fold, caused by loss of inside-out activation of β1-integrin. We determined that the loss of CDCP1 reduces CDK5 kinase activity due to the phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit, CDK5R1/p35, by c-SRC on Y234. This generates a binding site for the C2 domain of PKCδ, which in turn phosphorylates CDK5 on T77. The resulting dissociation of the CDK5R1/CDK5 complex abolishes the activity of CDK5. Mutations of CDK5-T77 and CDK5R1-Y234 phosphorylation sites re-establish the CDK5/CDKR1 complex and the inside-out activity of β1-integrin. Altogether, we discovered a new mechanism of regulation of CDK5 through loss of CDCP1, which dynamically regulates β1-integrin in non-adherent cells and which may promote vascular dissemination in patients with advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2793850688,"The study of invertebrate-and particularly nematode-viruses is emerging with the advancement of transcriptome sequencing. Five single-stranded RNA viruses have now been confirmed within the economically important soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines). From previous research, we know these viruses to be widespread in greenhouse and field populations of SCN. Several of the SCN viruses were also confirmed within clover (H. trifolii) and beet (H. schachtii) cyst nematodes. In the presented study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of several inbred SCN populations and identified two previously undiscovered viral-like genomes. Both of these proposed viruses are negative-sense RNA viruses and have been named SCN nyami-like virus (NLV) and SCN bunya-like virus (BLV). Finally, we analyzed publicly available transcriptome data of two potato cyst nematode (PCN) species, Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis. From these data, a third potential virus was discovered and called PCN picorna-like virus (PLV). PCN PLV is a positive-sense RNA virus, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first virus described within PCN. The presence of these novel viruses was confirmed via qRT-PCR, endpoint PCR, and Sanger sequencing with the exception of PCN PLV due to quarantine restrictions on the nematode host. While much work needs to be done to understand the biological and evolutionary significance of these viruses, they offer insight into nematode ecology and the possibility of novel nematode management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2791275705,"Introduction The vestibular acute stress induces reversible alert-like reactions that involve the sympathetic adrenal-medullar system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses. The present study aimed to evaluate salivary α-amylase and salivary cortisol production in relation with cardiovascular reactivity induced by acute stress in healthy subjects. Material and methods Forty-eight young healthy male volunteers were examined under basal conditions and at various times after reaching the maximal nystagmic reaction following air caloric vestibular test. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were recorded at the same time as measurement of the salivary α-amylase and salivary cortisol. At the end of the caloric vestibular test session, perceived stress scale questionnaires were administered to measure the self-perceived stress impact induced by the task, and individual scores were compared with those measured on the enrollment day. Results Following caloric vestibular test-evoked vertigo, salivary α-amylase and cortisol showed distinct trends in their production after acute stress: Student’s t-test was used to compare the α-amylase vs cortisol slopes of the respective interpolated regression lines, and the difference was significant (t = -3.283; p<0.001); an increase in salivary cortisol production corresponded with a decrease in the salivary α-amylase concentration. In addition, salivary biomarker modifications were associated with consistent changes in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. Conclusions Using the air caloric vestibular test task as a stressor, the present study demonstrated a connection between the acute hormonal stress response to vestibular stimulation and cardiovascular output. However, further research is needed before we can define the potential importance of the consistent cardiovascular activity changes evoked by vestibular stimulation and the possible functional consequences for cardiovascular regulation and orthostatic tolerance in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2791831081,"Acute elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) to ischemic and non-ischemic levels can cause temporary or permanent changes in the retinal morphology, function and blood flow/blood perfusion. Previously, such changes in the retina were assessed separately with different methods in clinical studies and animal models. In this study, we used a combined OCT+ ERG system in combination with Doppler OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) imaging protocols, in order to evaluate simultaneously and correlate changes in the retinal morphology, the retinal functional response to visual stimulation, and the retinal blood flow/blood perfusion, associated with IOP elevation to ischemic and non-ischemic levels in rats. Results from this study suggest that the inner retina responds faster to IOP elevation to levels greater than 30 mmHg with significant reduction of the total retinal blood flow (TRBF), decrease of the capillaries' perfusion and reduction of the ON bipolar cells contribution to the ERG traces. Furthermore, this study showed that ischemic levels of IOP elevation cause an additional significant decrease in the ERG photoreceptor response in the posterior retina. Thirty minutes after IOP normalization, retinal morphology, blood flow and blood perfusion recovered to baseline values, while retinal function did not recover completely."

The study specimens were provided by the Severance Hospital Gene Bank, and consisted of PTC from each patient. The specimens were prepared for proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. Spectral data by 1H-NMR spectroscopy were acquired, processed, and analyzed. Patients were grouped in three ways, according to the presence of LN metastasis, central LN metastasis and lateral LN metastasis. Chi-square test and the student t-test were used to analyze categorical variables and continuous variables, respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for univariate analysis of metabolites. Orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used for multivariate analysis to discriminate metabolic differences between the two groups.Among 52 patients, 32 had central LN metastasis and 19 had lateral LN metastasis. No clinical or histopathological characteristic was significantly different for all comparisons. On univariate analysis, no metabolite showed significant difference for all comparisons. On multivariate analysis, OPLS-DA did not discriminate the presence and absence of LN metastasis. Lactate was found to be the most promising metabolite.No metabolite could discriminate the presence of LN metastasis. However, lactate was found to be the most promising metabolite for discrimination. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to elucidate significant metabolites which can indicate the presence of LN metastasis in patients with PTC."
https://openalex.org/W2769937061,"PACT is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in host-influenza A virus (IAV) interaction. PACT facilitates the action of RIG-I in the activation of the type I IFN response, which is suppressed by the viral nonstructural protein NS1. PACT is also known to interact with the IAV RNA polymerase subunit PA. Exactly how PACT exerts its antiviral activity during IAV infection remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we demonstrated the interplay between PACT and IAV polymerase. Induction of IFN-β by the IAV RNP complex was most robust when both RIG-I and PACT were expressed. PACT-dependent activation of IFN-β production was suppressed by the IAV polymerase subunits, polymerase acidic protein, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and PB2. PACT associated with PA, PB1, and PB2. Compromising PACT in IAV-infected A549 cells resulted in the augmentation of viral RNA (vRNA) transcription and replication and IFN-β production. Furthermore, vRNA replication was boosted by knockdown of PACT in both A549 cells and IFN-deficient Vero cells. Thus, the antiviral activity of PACT is mediated primarily via its interaction with and inhibition of IAV polymerase. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the host-IAV interaction in which the interplay between PACT and IAV poly-merase affects the outcome of viral infection and antiviral response.—Chan, C.-P., Yuen, C.-K., Cheung, P.-H.

Both cytokines share a common origin and structure, and both interact through a specific region, termed binding site III, to activate a dimeric receptor complex formed by glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and LIF receptor (LIFR) in humans. However, only OSM activates the OSM receptor (OSMR)–gp130 complex. The molecular features that enable OSM to specifically activate the OSMR are currently unknown. To define specific sequence motifs within OSM that are critical for initiating signaling via OSMR, here we generated chimeric OSM–LIF cytokines and performed alanine-scanning experiments. Replacement of the OSM AB loop within OSM's binding site III with that of LIF abrogated OSMR activation, measured as STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705, but did not compromise LIFR activation. Correspondingly, substitution of the AB loop and D-helix in LIF with their OSM counterparts was sufficient for OSMR activation. The alanine-scanning experiments revealed that residues Tyr-34, Gln-38, Gly-39, and Leu-45 (in the AB loop) and Pro-153 (in the D-helix) had specific roles in activating OSMR but not LIFR signaling, whereas Leu-40 and Cys-49 (in the AB loop), and Phe-160 and Lys-163 (in the D-helix) were required for activation of both receptors.

Linear mixed effects models were used to examine longitudinal associations between quartiles of anti-flic and anti-LPS antibodies and changes in LAZ, WAZ and WLZ scores. Spearman's correlations were measured between anti-flic and anti-LPS immunoglobulins with measures of systemic/enteric inflammation and intestinal regeneration.Anti-LPS IgA correlated significantly with CRP, AGP and Reg1 serum at 6mo and with MPO at 9mo. In multivariate analysis at 6mo of age, higher anti-LPS IgA levels predicted greater declines in LAZ scores over subsequent 18mo (comparing highest to lowest quartile, β (SE) change in LAZ score/year = -0.313 (0.125), p-value = 0.013).

Although DmHsp22 has been demonstrated to be an efficient in vitro chaperone, its function within mitochondria in vivo remains largely unknown. Thus, determining its protein-interaction network (interactome) in the mitochondrial matrix would help to shed light on its function(s). In the present study we combined immunoaffinity conjugation (IAC) with mass spectroscopy analysis of mitochondria from HeLa cells transfected with DmHsp22 in non-heat shock condition and after heat shock (HS). 60 common DmHsp22-binding mitochondrial partners were detected in two independent IACs. Immunoblotting was used to validate interaction between DmHsp22 and two members of the mitochondrial chaperone machinery; Hsp60 and Hsp70. Among the partners of DmHsp22, several ATP synthase subunits were found. Moreover, we showed that expression of DmHsp22 in transiently transfected HeLa cells increased maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption capacity and ATP contents, providing a mechanistic link between DmHsp22 and mitochondrial functions."
https://openalex.org/W2792937422,"Introduction To determine whether foveal light and dark adaptation are affected in glaucoma. Methods Case-control study with 23 glaucoma patients and 51 controls. Light and dark adaptation were measured twice. After 10 minutes pre-adaptation to 0.0032 cd/m2, the background luminance increased stepwise to 320 (5 log unit step) or 10,000 cd/m2 (6.5 log unit step) for 10 minutes, then it decreased back to 0.0032 cd/m2 for 30 minutes. Foveal contrast sensitivity [CS]) as a function of time was determined using a 1.15 degree increment. Time resolution of the experiments was 30 seconds. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the effect of glaucoma on the CS plateau and adaptation time (time to reach the plateau minus 3 dB); analyses were adjusted for age and gender. Results After light adaptation to 320 and 10,000 cd/m2, glaucoma patients had a 0.22 (P<0.001) and 0.13 (P = 0.010) log unit lower CS plateau than controls, respectively. After dark adaptation, this difference was 0.21 (P = 0.018) and 0.30 (P<0.001) log unit, respectively. Light adaptation occurred too fast to determine an accurate light adaptation time. Dark adaptation times of glaucoma patients and controls were similar, for both the 5 (7.2 versus 5.5 minutes; P = 0.10) and the 6.5 (18.2 versus 16.6 minutes; P = 0.14) log unit step. Conclusion After a sudden increase or decrease in luminance, the logCS adaptation curves of glaucoma patients are shifted downwards compared to the curves of healthy subjects. Glaucoma patients have a lower CS plateau than healthy subjects, for both light and dark adaptation; dark adaptation times are similar."
https://openalex.org/W2793956431,"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct communication channel by using brain signals, enabling patients with motor impairments to interact with external devices. Motion intention detection is useful for intuitive movement-based BCI as movement is the fundamental mode of interaction with the environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the temporal dynamics of brain processes using electroencephalography (EEG) to explore novel neural correlates of motion intention. We investigate the changes in temporal dependencies of the EEG by characterising the decay of autocorrelation during asynchronous voluntary finger tapping movement. The evolution of the autocorrelation function is characterised by its relaxation time, which is used as a robust marker for motion intention. We observed that there was reorganisation of temporal dependencies in EEG during motion intention. The autocorrelation decayed slower during movement intention and faster during the resting state. There was an increase in temporal dependence during movement intention. The relaxation time of the autocorrelation function showed significant (p < 0.05) discrimination between movement and resting state with the mean sensitivity of 78.37 ± 8.83%. The relaxation time provides movement related information that is complementary to the well-known event-related desynchronisation (ERD) by characterising the broad band EEG dynamics which is frequency independent in contrast to ERD. It can also detect motion intention on average 0.51s before the actual movement onset. We have thoroughly compared autocorrelation relaxation time features with ERD in four frequency bands. The relaxation time may therefore, complement the well-known features used in motion-based BCI leading to more robust and intuitive BCI solutions. The results obtained suggest that changes in autocorrelation decay may involve reorganisation of temporal dependencies of brain activity over longer duration during motion intention. This opens the possibilities of investigating further the temporal dynamics of fundamental neural processes underpinning motion intention."

The inner kinetochore proteins bind centromeres while most outer kinetochore proteins assemble at centromeres during mitosis, connecting the complex to microtubules. Here, we measured the co-migration between protein pairs of the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) and hMis12 complexes by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) in the nucleoplasm outside centromeres in living human interphase cells. FCCS is a method that can tell if in living cells two differently fluorescently labelled molecules migrate independently, or co-migrate and thus are part of one and the same soluble complex. We also determined the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of the hetero-dimers CENP-T/W and CENP-S/X. We measured co-migration between CENP-K and CENP-T as well as between CENP-M and CENP-T but not between CENP-T/W and CENP-S/X. Furthermore, CENP-C co-migrated with CENP-H, and CENP-K with CENP-N as well as with CENP-L. Thus, in the nucleoplasm outside centromeres, a large fraction of the CENP-H/I/K/M proteins interact with CENP-C, CENP-N/L and CENP-T/W but not with CENP-S/X.

Methods Using the national cohort study from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, participants who had undergone a tonsillectomy (5,299) and control participants (21,196) were selected and matched 1:4 (for age, sex, income, region of residence, and pre-operative upper respiratory infection visits). The Cox-proportional hazard model was used. A crude model and an adjusted model for age, sex, income, region of residence, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were used in this analysis. For the subgroup analyses, the participants were divided into 2 groups: children (≤ 14 years old) and adolescents and adults (≥ 15 years old). Results The adjusted hazard ratio of deep neck infection after tonsillectomy was 1.43 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.18–1.72, P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, this ratio was 1.12 (95% CI = 0.86–1.47, P = 0.390) in children and 1.87 (95% CI = 1.43–2.45, P < 0.001) in adolescents and adults. The crude hazard ratios were almost the same as the adjusted ratios. Conclusion The risk of deep neck infection was higher in the tonsillectomy group. The subgroup analysis showed a similar finding in the adolescent and adult group but not in the child group."
https://openalex.org/W2793593550,"Introduction Only 20% of patients with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) have blood pressure within recommended parameters. SAH has been the main risk factor for morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases, which affects the burden of the Public Health System (PHS). Some studies have shown the effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Care (PC) in the care of hypertensive patients. Objective To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare SAH treatment with PC management and conventional treatment for hypertensive patients offered by the PHS. Methods A cost-effectiveness study nested to a quasi-experimental study was conducted, in which 104 hypertensive patients were followed up in a PC program. Blood pressure control was considered as the outcome for the economic analysis and the costs were direct and non-direct medical costs. Results PC was dominant for two years in the post-PC period compared with the pre-PC year. The mean cost effectiveness ratio (CER) for the CERPre-PC, CERPC, and CERPost-PC periods were: US$ 364.65, US$ 415.39, and US$ 231.14 respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis presented ICER of US$ 478.41 in the PC period and US$ 42.95 in the post PC period. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis presented mean ICERPC and ICERPost-PC equal to US$ 605.09 and US$ 128.03, reaching US$ 1,725.00 and US$ 740.00 respectively. Conclusion Even for the highest ICER, the values were below the cost effectiveness threshold, which means that PC was a cost effective strategy for the care of hypertensive patients in the PHS."
https://openalex.org/W2790046820,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are a popular genetic approach in neuroscience because they confer such efficient transgene expression in the brain and spinal cord. A number of studies have used AAV to express pathological disease-related proteins in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in situ (e.g., a-synuclein to model aspects of Parkinson's disease). The neuropathology and neurodegeneration of Parkinson's disease occur in a circumscribed pattern in the brain, and one of the most important goals of any gene transfer study is accurate, pinpoint targeting. By combining Cre recombinase-dependent AAVs in Cre-driver rats in which Cre is expressed only in the tyrosine hydroxylase neurons, we have achieved more highly targeted expression of several disease-relevant neuropathological proteins in the substantia nigra pars compacta than using constitutive expression AAV vectors. Alpha-synuclein, tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa, or the control fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein was individually expressed to induce highly targeted, dopaminergic neuron-specific neurodegeneration models. The refined targeting foreshadows a next-generation disease modeling system for expressing neurodegenerative disease-related proteins in a disease-relevant manner. We foresee specific utilities of this in vivo AAV vector targeting of pathological proteins to a well-defined and well-demarcated cell population.—Grames, M. S., Dayton, R. D., Jackson, K.

https://openalex.org/W2792384820,"Unlike in adults, diagnosis of TB can be challenging in children, as signs and symptoms of paediatric TB can be very non-specific and similar to other common childhood chest infections, which may lead to under or delayed diagnosis of TB disease. In spite of the increasing availability of rapid high-sensitivity diagnostics in public and private sectors, majority of paediatric TB cases are empirically diagnosed, without laboratory confirmation. To address these diagnostic challenges, World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended upfront Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing for the diagnosis of TB in paediatric presumptive pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) cases. However, in spite of the increasing availability of rapid high-sensitivity diagnostics, a significant gap exists in its application with Xpert being rarely used as an upfront diagnostic among patients presumed to have TB. Under an ongoing paediatric project since April 2014, which provided free-of-cost upfront Xpert testing, several low-cost outreach and education interventions were undertaken to increase the diagnostic uptake by different providers catering to the paediatric population, thereby increasing adherence to global guidance.Providers catering to paediatric population in the project cities were systematically mapped and contacted using different outreach strategies. The focus of outreach efforts was to increase provider literacy and increase their awareness of the availability of free rapid diagnostic services with the goal of changing their diagnostic approaches.From April 2014 to June 2016, more than 5,700 providers/facilities were mapped and 3,670 of them were approached. The number of providers/facilities engaged under the project increased more than 10-fold (43 in April, 2014 to 466 in June, 2016), with significant increase in project uptake, both from public and private sector. Overall 42,238 paediatric presumptive TB cases were enrolled in the project, across the four cities. Over the project period, quarterly diagnostic uptake and paediatric TB cases detection rates increased more than two-fold. TB detection rates were similar in patients from public and private sectors.Ongoing efforts in scaling up new rapid diagnostics involves significant investments. These efforts need to be complemented with proactive provider engagement to ensure provider-literacy and awareness, for maximizing impact of this scale-up. The current project demonstrated the usefulness of outreach and education interventions for the effective uptake of newer diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2951276722,"Leishmania is a widespread trypanosomatid protozoan parasite causing significant morbidity and mortality in humans. The endobiont dsRNA virus Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) chronically infects some strains, where it increases parasite numbers and virulence in murine leishmaniasis models, and correlates with increased treatment failure in human disease. Previously, we reported that 2′-C-methyladenosine (2CMA) potently inhibited LRV1 in Leishmania guyanensis (Lgy) and Leishmania braziliensis, leading to viral eradication at concentrations above 10 μm. Here we probed the cellular mechanisms of 2CMA inhibition, involving metabolism, accumulation, and inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). Activation to 2CMA triphosphate (2CMA-TP) was required, as 2CMA showed no inhibition of RDRP activity from virions purified on cesium chloride gradients. In contrast, 2CMA-TP showed IC50 values ranging from 150 to 910 μm, depending on the CsCl density of the virion (empty, ssRNA-, and dsRNA-containing). Lgy parasites incubated in vitro with 10 μm 2CMA accumulated 2CMA-TP to 410 μm, greater than the most sensitive RDRP IC50 measured. Quantitative modeling showed good agreement between the degree of LRV1 RDRP inhibition and LRV1 levels. These results establish that 2CMA activity is due to its conversion to 2CMA-TP, which accumulates to levels that inhibit RDRP and cause LRV1 loss. This attests to the impact of the Leishmania purine uptake and metabolism pathways, which allow even a weak RDRP inhibitor to effectively eradicate LRV1 at micromolar concentrations. Future RDRP inhibitors with increased potency may have potential therapeutic applications for ameliorating the increased Leishmania pathogenicity conferred by LRV1.

Vaccination of mice using the LRV1 capsid results in significant protection against LRV1+ Lgy (31Castiglioni P. Hartley M.-A. Rossi M. Prevel F. Desponds C. Utzschneider D.T. Eren R.-O. Zangger H.

Previously, we reasoned that the powerful nucleoside and nucleobase salvage pathways of Leishmania might enhance the efficacy of nucleosides analogs targeting the viral RDRP (15Kuhlmann F.M.

Accordingly, screening a small library of antiviral nucleosides identified two closely-related adenosine analogs, 2′-C-methyladenosine (2CMA) and 7-deaza-2′-C-methyladenosine (7d2CMA) (Fig. 1B), which specifically inhibited LRV1 replication in cultured Leishmania cells (15Kuhlmann F.M.

These compounds exhibited EC50 values of 3–5 μm for viral inhibition, contrasting with much greater EC50 values for the parasites themselves. The active compounds rapidly eradicated LRV1 when tested at concentrations above 10 μm, allowing us to readily create isogenic LRV1− lines (15Kuhlmann F.M. Robinson J.I. Bluemling G.R. Ronet C. Fasel N. Beverley S.M. Antiviral screening identifies adenosine analogs targeting the endogenous dsRNA Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) pathogenicity factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The mechanism of anti-LRV1 activity was postulated to be through direct inhibition of the LRV1 RDRP by the triphosphorylated form of 2CMA. Here we provide support for this hypothesis, although the potency of 2CMA-TP for viral inhibition was unexpectedly weak. Remarkably, viral inhibition was accomplished through hyper-accumulation and retention of 2CMA-TP, arising from the powerful uptake and metabolic salvage pathways of these purine auxotrophs (32Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Adenine and adenosine salvage in Leishmania donovani.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2013; 190 (23845934): 51-5510.1016/j.molbiopara.2013.06.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These findings have significant implications for future efforts aimed toward developing new and more potent Leishmania virus inhibitors. RDRP assays were carried out with Lgy strain M4147 LRV1 virions purified by CsCl equilibrium gradient centrifugation (7Widmer G. Comeau A.M. Furlong D.B. Wirth D.F. Patterson J.L. Characterization of a RNA virus from the parasite Leishmania.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 5979-598210.1073/pnas.86.15.5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Widmer G.

We reproducibly observed three overlapping “peaks,” designated low-, medium-, and high-density (LD, MD, and HD) (Fig. 2). In previous studies of the yeast L-A Totivirus, similar peaks were shown to correspond to virions that were primarily “empty” or contained ssRNA or dsRNA, respectively (34Oliver S.G. McCready S.J. Holm C. Sutherland P.A. McLaughlin C.S. Cox B.S. Biochemical and physiological studies of the yeast virus-like particle.J.

Virus-like particles from killer, neutral, and sensitive strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Virol. 1976; 17 (768518): 472-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The densities of the Lgy LRV1 LD, MD, and HD peaks were 1.29, 1.36, and 1.41 g/ml, in good agreement with the densities of L-A virus particles bearing ssRNA and dsRNA (1.31 and 1.41 g/ml, respectively) (36Esteban R. Wickner R.B. Three different M1 RNA-containing viruslike particle types in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: in vitro M1 double-stranded RNA synthesis.Mol. Cell.

Preliminary data from S1 nuclease digestion of viral RNA from these fractions were consistent with these assignments. 3J. I. Robinson, unpublished observations. To measure RDRP activity, purified virions were allowed to incorporate [α-32P]UTP in the presence of the other three nucleoside triphosphates for 1 h, a time sufficient for one round of viral genome replication (33Widmer G. Keenan M.C. Patterson J.L. RNA-polymerase activity is associated with viral particles isolated from Leishmania braziliensis subsp. guyanensis.J. Virol. 1990; 64 (2370680): 3712-3715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was purified and separated by native gel electrophoresis, and the products were visualized and quantified. Two products were always found: one about 5 kb, presumably corresponding to the full-length LRV1 genome, and smaller, heterogeneous products ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 kb, which we considered abortive transcripts (Fig. 3A). Neither extending the incubation time nor increasing the concentration of UTP significantly altered the profile obtained.3 Importantly, neither full-length nor small products were produced by corresponding preparations from LRV1-negative parasites (Fig. 3B). Incubation of the three LRV1 fractions with 2CMA-TP reduced synthesis of both the full-length and small RDRP products (Figs. 3–5). The synthesis of each product was quantitated and normalized to that obtained with drug-free controls. IC50 values were calculated by fitting the inhibition data with a logistic dose-response curve (Table 1). These ranged from 150 μm for full-length product synthesis by LD virions to 910 μm for small products synthesized by HD virions (Table 1, Figure 3, Figure 4). These IC50 values were unexpectedly high, greatly exceeding the extracellular concentration of 2CMA shown previously to cause 50% inhibition of LRV1 abundance (∼3 μm) (15Kuhlmann F.M. Robinson J.I. Bluemling G.R. Ronet C. Fasel N. Beverley S.M. Antiviral screening identifies adenosine analogs targeting the endogenous dsRNA Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) pathogenicity factor.Proc. Natl. Acad.

This did not arise artificially from 2CMA-TP degradation during the assay, as HPLC tests of RDRP reactions showed only 3.7 ± 0.6% (n = 3) loss of 2CMA-TP.Table 1Effect of 2CMA-TP on Lgy LRV1 RDRP activityProductLRV1 fraction IC50Low-density (n = 3)Medium-density (n = 3)High-density (n = 4)μmFull-length150 (90–210)250 (100–400)420 (310–540)Small250 (160–330)640 (300–980)910 (620–1200) Open table in a new tab As anticipated, 2CMA did not measurably inhibit RDRP activity when tested at concentrations up to 1000 μm (Fig. 5). Similarly, dATP, which lacks both the 2′-hydroxyl and methyl groups of 2CMA (Fig. 1B), failed to inhibit RDRP activity at the highest concentration tested (600 μm; Fig. 5); nor in limited tests did 600–1000 μm TTP inhibit.3 These data show that high concentrations of a nonsubstrate nucleoside triphosphate do not inhibit RDRP activity nonspecifically. Together, these data suggest that despite its relatively low potency, under these assay conditions 2CMA-TP inhibition of LRV1 RDRP activity was specific. To account for the relative sensitivity of Lgy LRV1 within cells to 2CMA treatment compared with the insensitivity of LRV1 RDRP activity to inhibition by 2CMA-TP, we hypothesized that parasites must acquire and activate 2CMA, accumulating high 2CMA-TP concentrations. We developed an HPLC protocol capable of resolving synthetic 2CMA-TP from natural ribonucleotides and the internal standard, dGTP (Fig. 6, A and B; a small peak presumed to be 2CMA-DP was also observed). Although dGTP occurs naturally, its intracellular concentration of ∼5 μm is well below the limit of detection for this assay and thus does not interfere with its use for this purpose (37Traut T.W. Physiological concentrations of purines and pyrimidines.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140 (7877593): 1-2210.1007/BF00928361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Standard mixtures were then used to generate a calibration curve relating peak area to 2CMA-TP amount. We next evaluated several protocols for extracting parasite nucleotides and determined that extraction with 1:1 acetonitrile:water performed best, as judged by recovery of the added dGTP standard (“Experimental procedures”). We then compared the nucleotide profiles of LRV1+ Lgy grown in the presence or absence of 10 μm extracellular 2CMA for 20 h, a time corresponding to more than two rounds of parasite replication. Under these conditions, we observed a peak co-eluting with synthetic 2CMA-TP that was absent from untreated parasites (Fig. 6B). This established the parasite’s capacity to activate 2CMA to 2CMA-TP. Leishmania cell volumes vary somewhat depending on the culture’s growth phase (38Sacks D.L. Perkins P.V. Identification of an infective stage of Leishmania promastigotes.Science. 1984; 223 (6701528): 1417-141910.1126/science.6701528Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To calculate the intracellular 2CMA-TP concentration, we therefore determined the average volume of Lgy parasites under our assay conditions. In logarithmic growth phase, parasite volumes averaged about 23 femtoliters (“Experiment"

Occupational contact with livestock is a risk factor for exposure to those pathogens and may cause further spreading of those pathogens in the community. The current study used whole genome sequencing to explore nasal Staphylococcus aureus obtained from hog slaughterhouse workers and their community members, all of whom resided in a livestock-dense region in rural North Carolina. Sequence data were analyzed for lineage distribution, pathogenicity-related genomic features, and mobile genetic elements. We observed evidence of nasal S. aureus differences between hog workers and non-workers. Nasal S. aureus from hog workers showed a greater lineage diversity than nasal S. aureus from community residents. Hog worker isolates were less likely to carry the φSa3 prophage and human-specific immune evasion cluster genes than community resident isolates (φSa3 prophage: 54.5% vs. 91.7%, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrected p = 0.035; immune evasion cluster genes: 66.7% vs. 100%, BH p = 0.021). Hog worker isolates had a lower prevalence and diversity of enterotoxins than community resident isolates, particularly lacking the enterotoxin gene cluster (39.4% vs. 70.8%, BH p = 0.125). Moreover, hog worker isolates harbored more diverse antibiotic resistance genes, with a higher prevalence of carriage of multiple resistance genes, than community resident isolates (75.8% vs. 29.2%, BH p = 0.021). Phylogenetic analysis of all ST5 isolates, the most abundant lineage in the collection, further supported separation of isolates from hog workers and non-workers. Together, our observations suggest impact of occupational contact with livestock on nasal S. aureus colonization and highlight the need for further research on the complex epidemiology of S. aureus at the livestock-human interface."
https://openalex.org/W2790290684,"Throughout the animal kingdom, the Notch signalling pathway allows cells to acquire diversified cell fates. Notch signals are translated into activation of Notch target genes by CSL transcription factors. In the absence of Notch signals, CSL together with co-repressors functions as a transcriptional repressor. In Drosophila, repression of Notch target genes involves the CSL homologue Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) and the Notch (N) antagonist Hairless (H) that together form a repressor complex. Guided by crystal structure, three mutations Su(H)LL, Su(H)LLF and Su(H)LLL were generated that specifically affect interactions with the repressor H, and were introduced into the endogenous Su(H) locus by gene engineering. In contrast to the wild type isoform, these Su(H) mutants are incapable of repressor complex formation. Accordingly, Notch signalling activity is dramatically elevated in the homozygotes, resembling complete absence of H activity. It was noted, however, that heterozygotes do not display a dominant H loss of function phenotype. In this work we addressed genetic interactions the three H-binding deficient Su(H) mutants display in combination with H and N null alleles. We included a null mutant of Delta (Dl), encoding the ligand of the Notch receptor, as well as of Su(H) itself in our genetic analyses. H, N or Dl mutations cause dominant wing phenotypes that are sensitive to gene dose of the others. Moreover, H heterozygotes lack bristle organs and develop bristle sockets instead of shafts. The latter phenotype is suppressed by Su(H) null alleles but not by H-binding deficient Su(H) alleles which we attribute to the socket cell specific activity of Su(H). Modification of the dominant wing phenotypes of either H, N or Dl, however, suggested some lack of repressor activity in the Su(H) null allele and likewise in the H-binding deficient Su(H) alleles. Overall, Su(H) mutants are recessive perhaps reflecting self-adjusting availability of Su(H) protein."
https://openalex.org/W2791240235,"Short-activating RNA (saRNA), which targets gene promoters, has been shown to increase the target gene expression. In this study, we describe the use of an saRNA (Flt a-1) to target the flt-1 promoter, leading to upregulation of the soluble isoform of Flt-1 and inhibition of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that Flt a-1 increased sFlt-1 mRNA and protein levels, while reducing VEGF expression. This was associated with suppression of human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. HUVEC migration and tube formation were also suppressed by Flt a-1. An siRNA targeting Flt-1 blocked the effects of Flt a-1. Flt a-1 effects were not mediated via argonaute proteins. However, trichostatin A and 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio) adenosine inhibited Flt a-1 effects, indicating that histone acetylation and methylation are mechanistically involved in RNA activation of Flt-1. In conclusion, RNA activation of sFlt-1 can be used to inhibit angiogenesis."
