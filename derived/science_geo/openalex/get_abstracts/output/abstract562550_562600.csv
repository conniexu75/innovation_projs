Wu et al. and Morisaki et al. developed an approach to study the translation of single messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in live cells. Nascent polypeptides containing multimerized epitopes were imaged with fluorescent antibody fragments, while simultaneously detecting the single mRNAs using a different fluorescent tag. The approach enabled a direct readout of initiation and elongation, as well as revealing the spatial distribution of translation and allowing the correlation of polysome motility with translation dynamics. Membrane-targeted mRNAs could be distinguished from cytoplasmic mRNAs, as could single polysomes from higher-order polysomal complexes. Furthermore, the work reveals the stochasticity of translation, which can occur constitutively or in bursts, much like transcription, and the spatial regulation of translation in neuronal dendrites.

https://openalex.org/W2425957420,"The physical properties and elemental abundances of the interstellar medium in galaxies during cosmic reionization are important for understanding the role of galaxies in this process. We report the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array detection of an oxygen emission line at a wavelength of 88 micrometers from a galaxy at an epoch about 700 million years after the Big Bang. The oxygen abundance of this galaxy is estimated at about one-tenth that of the Sun. The non-detection of far-infrared continuum emission indicates a deficiency of interstellar dust in the galaxy. A carbon emission line at a wavelength of 158 micrometers is also not detected, implying an unusually small amount of neutral gas. These properties might allow ionizing photons to escape into the intergalactic medium."

https://openalex.org/W2427444673,"In a rapidly changing world we need methods to efficiently assess biodiversity in order to monitor ecosystem trends. Ecological monitoring often uses plant community composition to infer quality of sites but conventional aboveground surveys only capture a snapshot of the actively growing plant diversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from soil samples, however, can include taxa represented by both active and dormant tissues, seeds, pollen, and detritus. Analysis of this eDNA through DNA metabarcoding provides a more comprehensive view of plant diversity at a site from a single assessment but it is not clear which DNA markers are best used to capture this diversity. Sequence recovery, annotation, and sequence resolution among taxa were evaluated for four established DNA markers (matK, rbcL, ITS2, and the trnL P6 loop) in silico using database sequences and in situ using high throughput sequencing of 35 soil samples from a remote boreal wetland. Overall, ITS2 and rbcL are recommended for DNA metabarcoding of vascular plants from eDNA when not using customized or geographically restricted reference databases. We describe a new framework for evaluating DNA metabarcodes and, contrary to existing assumptions, we found that full length DNA barcode regions could outperform shorter markers for surveying plant diversity from soil samples. By using current DNA barcoding markers rbcL and ITS2 for plant metabarcoding, we can take advantage of existing resources such as the growing DNA barcode database. Our work establishes the value of standard DNA barcodes for soil plant eDNA analysis in ecological investigations and biomonitoring programs and supports the collaborative development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding."

Many details of these processes are not known due to missing spatial resolution of technologies capable of investigating peroxisomes directly in the cell. Here, we present the use of super-resolution optical stimulated emission depletion microscopy to investigate with sub-60-nm resolution the heterogeneous spatial organization of the peroxisomal proteins PEX5, PEX14, and PEX11 around actively importing peroxisomes, showing distinct differences between these peroxins. Moreover, imported protein sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) occupies only a subregion of larger peroxisomes, highlighting the heterogeneous distribution of proteins even within the peroxisome. Finally, our data reveal subpopulations of peroxisomes showing only weak colocalization between PEX14 and PEX5 or PEX11 but at the same time a clear compartmentalized organization. This compartmentalization, which was less evident in cases of strong colocalization, indicates dynamic protein reorganization linked to changes occurring in the peroxisomes. Through the use of multicolor stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we have been able to characterize peroxisomes and their constituents to a yet unseen level of detail while maintaining a highly statistical approach, paving the way for equally complex biological studies in the future.

Peroxisomes (see Fig. 1A) are small, membrane-enclosed organelles that fulfill many different functions of eukaryotic cells, including a variety of metabolic reactions (1Smith J.J. Aitchison J.D. Peroxisomes take shape.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes contain a diverse collection of densely packed enzymes whose composition is largely dependent on the host organism, cell type, and tissue (2Kunau W.-H. Peroxisomes: morphology, function, biogenesis and disorders.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1363-1808Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 3Gabaldón T. Peroxisome diversity and evolution.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2010; 365: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal function and protein composition, at a given time, are largely dependent on changes occurring in the external environment to which it responds dynamically (4Islinger M. Grille S. Fahimi H.D. Schrader M. The peroxisome: an update on mysteries.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 137: 547-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In human cells, peroxisomes are involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, reactive oxygen species detoxification, and biosynthesis of different lipids, including plasmalogen, the main component of the myelin sheath (5Braverman N.E. Moser A.B. Functions of plasmalogen lipids in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1822: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Because of its crucial roles in human metabolism, defects in peroxisomal function can cause many severe diseases (6Nagotu S. Kalel V.C. Erdmann R. Platta H.W. Molecular basis of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders caused by defects in peroxisomal matrix protein import.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1822: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Waterham H.R. Ferdinandusse S. Wanders R.J. Human disorders of peroxisome metabolism and biogenesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Only a fundamental understanding of peroxisomal biogenesis and assembly will help identify ways to control these diseases, leading to novel therapeutic strategies. Most peroxisomal proteins, needed to maintain the diverse functions of the organelles, are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported post-translationally from the cytosol into the peroxisomes (8Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. Dynamics of the peroxisomal import cycle of PpPex20p ubiquitin-dependent localization and regulation.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These proteins are either inserted into the peroxisomal membrane or transported into the peroxisomal matrix. Translocation of folded and even oligomerized proteins across the peroxisomal membrane is a common principle, which differentiates peroxisomes from other organelles like mitochondria. Most proteins destined for the peroxisomal matrix carry a peroxisomal targeting signal, type 1 (PTS1), 5The abbreviations used are: PTS1peroxisomal targeting signal, type 1STEDstimulated emission depletionSCP2sterol carrier protein 2. at their C terminus that is recognized by the cycling peroxisomal import receptor PEX5. After binding of the PTS1 cargo protein to PEX5 in the cytosol, this cargo-receptor complex is directed to the peroxisomal membrane where it interacts with the peroxisomal membrane protein PEX14. Here PEX5 is integrated into the membrane, and it forms a transient translocation pore together with PEX14 (9Meinecke M. Cizmowski C. Schliebs W. Krüger V. Beck S. Wagner R. Erdmann R. The peroxisomal importomer constitutes a large and highly dynamic pore.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Erdmann R. Schliebs W. Peroxisomal matrix protein import: the transient pore model.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Upon cargo translocation, membrane-associated PEX5 is monoubiquitinated at the cytosolic side of the membrane. This modification functions as an export signal, resulting in the ATP-dependent removal of PEX5 from the peroxisomal membrane (11Platta H.W. Grunau S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R.

Biol. 2005; 25: 10822-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The released PEX5 is available for another round of protein import. Although recent studies shed light on function and mechanisms of the translocation of peroxisomal matrix proteins across the peroxisomal membrane, many details of the organization of the peroxisomal translocon mainly consisting of PEX14 and PEX5 are not yet known due to missing spatial resolution in applied standard optical microscopy techniques. To overcome this limitation, we implemented a multicolor super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) (13Hell S.W. Wichmann J. Breaking the diffraction resolution limit by stimulated-emission-stimulated-emission-depletion fluorescence microscopy.Opt. Lett. 1994; 19: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (4322) Google Scholar) microscope setup that allowed this investigation to be performed with sub-60-nm resolution (14Clausen M.P. Galiani S. Bernardino de la Serna J. Fritzsche M. Chojnacki J. Gehmlich K. Lagerholm B.C. Eggeling C. Pathways to optical STED microscopy.NanoBioImaging. 2013; 1: 1-12Google Scholar). peroxisomal targeting signal, type 1 stimulated emission depletion sterol carrier protein 2. Besides the import complex, represented by PEX14, membrane-bound PEX5, and GFP-sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2), a PTS1 cargo protein, we included two further proteins to form a contrast and control to the peroxisomal import system, the peroxisomal proliferation factor PEX11β and the mitochondrial protein TOM20. PEX11β was used as an internal peroxisomal control as it is supposed to be independent from the peroxisomal import machinery and one of the most abundant integral membrane proteins not involved in protein import. PEX11β facilitates the extension of the membrane during the peroxisomal fission process and therefore plays an essential role in this process as well as in its initialization (15Schrader M. Costello J.L. Godinho L.F. Azadi A.S. Islinger M. Proliferation and fission of peroxisomes—an update.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We will simply refer to PEX11β as PEX11 throughout this text. TOM20, a part of the translocation complex of the outer mitochondrial membrane, represented an external control as it is localized in an unrelated organelle. Furthermore, recent super-resolution studies have been performed on TOM20 localization in the mitochondria (16Wurm C.A. Neumann D. Lauterbach M.A. Harke B. Egner A. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Nanoscale distribution of mitochondrial import receptor Tom20 is adjusted to cellular conditions and exhibits an inner-cellular gradient.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 13546-13551Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and so this protein also added a control in terms of the quality of our nanoscale imaging and fixation methods while remaining suitability detached from the peroxisomes to highlight the similarities between the stains of peroxisomal proteins. An increased spatial resolution for imaging peroxisomes within cells should for the first time allow studying the protein distribution on the peroxisomal membrane. Possible heterogeneity in these distributions in between peroxisomes may on one hand highlight yet undetected molecular rearrangements at the membrane linked to peroxisome aging, proliferation, or differences in the uptake of peroxisomal matrix proteins and most importantly to peroxisomal malfunction. On the other hand, these imaging and analysis techniques could easily be transferred to studying other small cellular organelles such as endosomes or lysosomes. This work introduces the first detailed visualization of peroxisomal membrane proteins with subdiffraction resolution in mammalian cells. Through STED microscopy, we show that peroxisomes are diverse in their appearance and that no individual visualization or qualitative description could accurately represent their heterogeneity. To solve this issue, we adopted quantitative imaging and analysis to approach the diverse characteristics of the peroxisomes. Starting with an optimized multicolor STED imaging protocol, we established a quantitative analysis pipeline involving careful calibration and corrections to ensure that super-resolution was achieved and confounding artifacts were corrected. The result of this effort has been an accurate and thorough characterization of the morphology of peroxisomes by visualization of different peroxisomal proteins. We specifically found a subpopulation of peroxisomes in which the membrane proteins PEX5 and PEX14 as well as PEX11 and PEX14 are separated in distinct compartments on the peroxisomal membrane, resulting in lower colocalization of these proteins. Our data highlight the power of STED microscopy but also the need for experimental optimization and custom data analysis for revealing novel details of the spatial organization of proteins at the peroxisomal membrane. To investigate the morphology and size of peroxisomes, we started by imaging the peroxisomal membrane marker PEX14 and peroxisomal matrix marker SCP2 in fixed human fibroblasts (GM5756T). We used a primary antibody in combination with a secondary fluorescently labeled (Abberior STAR 600) antibody for immunolabeling PEX14 and transfection with GFP-SCP2 in combination with Abberior STAR 635P GFP nanobooster for labeling SCP2 and analyzed their distribution on a two-color STED microscope (using 594 and 635 nm laser light for fluorescence excitation and 755 nm as STED laser light (supplemental Fig. 1)). When imaged with diffraction-limited confocal microscopy (i.e. without the STED laser light), peroxisomes appear to be stained homogeneously by both matrix and membrane markers. However, with the STED microscope, enabling a lateral resolution below 60 nm for both signals, a clear separation of peroxisomal membrane and matrix proteins becomes evident for most of the observed peroxisomes, revealing a broad distribution of heterogeneous features with variation in size from a minimum of 130 nm to a maximum of 650 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B). Line profiles across typical images of a single peroxisome (PEX14 staining) displayed a full width at half-maximum of 330 ± 125 nm (mean ± S.D.; n = 100). In some cases, the SCP2 can be found concentrated in round shaped clusters surrounded by the peroxisomal membrane, indicated by the PEX14 staining. In other cases, PEX14 forms larger, ringlike structures. Here, the SCP2 does not seem to be in the center of the peroxisomes but confined to the periphery of the organelle, attached to the membrane. For further investigations on the heterogeneity in protein organization at peroxisomes, the GFP-SCP2 was used as a reference marker to identify peroxisomes processing an active import of PTS1 proteins (note that SCP2 is a PTS1 protein). Only cells with a bright expression and peroxisomal localization of the GFP-SCP2, indicated by the characteristic punctate pattern of peroxisomal staining, were used for further analysis (Fig. 2). The GFP-SCP2 signal was acquired in the confocal modality, and the spatial distribution of the peroxisomal proteins (peroxins) PEX14, PEX5, and PEX11,and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein TOM20 in the area of the identified peroxisomes was studied with the STED microscope. PEX14 and PEX11 reside in the membrane of peroxisomes, whereas the receptor PEX5 does so only transiently, switching between cytoplasmic and membrane-bound states as it shuttles PTS1-containing proteins into the peroxisome (Fig. 1A). For studying membrane-bound PEX5, only an antibody specifically recognizing the membrane-bound conformation (17Cizmowski C. Jung M. Erdmann R. Schliebs W. A monoclonal antibody for in vivo detection of peroxisome-associated PTS1 receptor.Hybridoma. 2011; 30: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was used. Fig. 2 shows representative images of fixed fibroblast cells with peroxisomal localization of GFP-SCP2 and immunostained for either PEX5, PEX14, PEX11, or TOM20 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). STED images show that the peroxins PEX5, PEX14, and PEX11 are located predominantly in regions containing GFP-SCP2, and only the TOM20 distribution is clearly distinguishable from the SCP2 location. In addition, the super-resolved images revealed that the analyzed peroxins are not homogeneously distributed across the peroxisomal membrane but have characteristic spatial organizations. Although PEX5 and PEX14 show a broad distribution of features from small circular blobs to bigger ringlike or elliptical structures, PEX11 is organized in smaller, more roundish features. Conversely and as expected, TOM20 staining is localized to the mitochondrial network and is, broadly distributed all over the cell. To study this system in such a way that the heterogeneity is properly represented, a detailed imaging acquisition protocol and an elaborate quantitative image analysis were applied. The peroxisome locations were defined as the intensity maxima appearing in the GFP-SCP2 signal (note that the most accurate determination of these maxima was provided by recording the GFP signal in a confocal mode, i.e. without the use of nanoboosters or the STED super-resolution option). Subsequent analysis was then applied to highlight the characteristics of the protein staining in circular regions of 380 nm in diameter around 1) the identified peroxisomes matrix marker and 2) in randomly selected regions, as a control, away from the GFP-SCP2 signal (Fig. 3A). We first investigated how the fluorescence intensity detected for the peroxins and TOM20 correlates with that of the GFP-SCP2 staining. For this, the correlation coefficient was calculated from the paired intensities around each peroxisome (within the 380-nm-diameter circle) and averaged over each cell. The distribution of these values is shown in Fig. 3B. The GFP signal was found to be consistent across all analyzed conditions, which indicates equal levels of SCP2, i.e. equal PTS1 protein uptake across all peroxisomes, at least those that actively participated in protein import. PEX5, PEX11, and PEX14 show positive intensity correlations with the GFP signal, whereas TOM20 shows hardly any correlation. Upon close inspection, PEX14 shows a significantly (p < 0.001) higher intensity correlation (0.63 ± 0.14, mean ± S.D.; 1 = maximum correlation, 0 = no correlation) compared with PEX11 (0.45 ± 0.15) and PEX5 (0.45 ± 0.14). This might reveal the tighter link of PEX14 to the import of PTS1 proteins. Despite the difference, the correlation coefficient of the GFP-SCP2 signal with the antibody staining of the different peroxins is above 0.4 for all three membrane-bound peroxins, indicating an overall strong relationship between imported SCP2 and the amount of peroxisomal membrane proteins. Mitochondrially bound TOM20 in contrast showed only a very low intensity correlation with SCP2, indicating a weak or no relationship between PTS1 import and the amount of TOM20 at close proximity to the peroxisomes. We next more deeply hunted possible differences in the abundance of the different peroxisomal proteins at the peroxisomes by analyzing the frequency distribution of the intensity of the observed signal. As before, using STED microscopy on the same samples, we determined the overall intensity of the immunostained peroxins in each identified peroxisomal regions (selection as before; Fig. 3A) and normalized it to the maximum intensity for each cell, resulting in values between 0 and 1. The frequency histograms of these relative intensity values (Fig. 3C, bold lines) confirm that all the peroxisomes contain measureable amounts of peroxisomal membrane proteins PEX5, PEX11, and PEX14. The intensity frequency histograms of the latter are very alike with very similar peak and standard deviation values (when approximated by a Gaussian distribution 0.28 ± 0.17 for PEX5, 0.30 ± 0.18 for PEX11, and 0.31 ± 0.16 for PEX14). Moreover, because there are no zero intensity peaks in our data, it shows that peroxisomes actively importing the GFP-SCP2 proteins never lack one of the three peroxins. Furthermore, the relative intensity of the TOM20 staining close to the actively importing peroxisomes is significantly lower (peak at 0.11) than for the peroxins, indicating that most peroxisomes show low staining of TOM20 relative to the background. The same intensity distribution analysis was repeated in randomly chosen regions that do not include any GFP-SCP2 signal (Fig. 3C, dotted lines). In this control case, all histograms show a sharp peak close to zero (peak values <0.1) with a significant number of zero intensity events. For the membrane-associated peroxins, this evidence shows an expected clear difference in abundance near and far away from the peroxisomes. In contrast, the intensity distribution of TOM20 is very similar between peroxisomal and the non-peroxisomal regions. However, the statistically relevant higher peak value in the case of peroxisomal proximity (0.11 versus 0.08) indicates a slightly higher abundance of TOM20 close to the peroxisomes. Qualitative visual assessment of the STED images of protein distributions at the peroxisomes revealed a great diversity in appearance. As highlighted before, PEX11 is organized in smaller, more roundish features, whereas the staining patterns for PEX5 and PEX14 are more heterogeneous, ranging from small circular blobs to bigger ringlike or elliptical structures. To quantify this diversity, a morphology analysis was performed on the STED images (Fig. 4, left panels) taken for immunolabeled PEX5, PEX11, PEX14, and TOM20 as well as for SCP2 (nanobooster). As before, circular regions around each individual peroxisome were identified by the GFP-SCP2 signal. Each selected circular patch (Fig. 4, second panels from left) was thresholded, and the resulting binary mask (or structural features; Fig. 4, middle panels) was evaluated for its morphological properties. A suitable metric for evaluation of these structures was the comparison of perimeter and area. This approach allows the broad heterogeneity of cluster shapes to be visualized in a relatively low dimensional space in the form of a scatter plot of paired values (perimeter and area) where each dot represents one peroxisome within the population of cells (i.e. depicting variability over all peroxisomes) and the larger green circles represent values averaged over all peroxisomes within one cell (i.e. cell-to-cell variability) (Fig. 4, right panels). The black line in the scatter plots provides orientation and represents the perimeter-area dependence that a perfectly circular structure would show at the different scales. Spherical structures are expected to lie close to this line, whereas tubular and ringlike structures possess much greater perimeter values than expected for a circular area; i.e. the scatter point lies above the black line. The spread in the value pairs statistically confirms the wide range of sizes and shapes in protein organization at the peroxisomes. However, the morphology analysis now allows us to characterize differences between the proteins that become most evident on the cell-averaged values (larger green circles). Both PEX5 and PEX14 show a broad distribution in size; however, the morphology diverges from a circular shape (i.e. the value pairs divert from the black line representing circular shape). A detailed analysis indicates that the morphology of PEX5 varies more strongly than does that PEX14 and that PEX5 clusters are slightly (p < 0.001) larger on average than PEX14 clusters. This becomes obvious when comparing the population average and S.D. for the morphological parameters for both proteins (average cluster area, 14.9 ± 3.1 (PEX5) and 13.0 ± 1.7 nm2 (PEX14); perimeter length, 510 ± 65 (PEX5) and 485 ± 50 nm (PEX14)). In contrast, PEX11 is slightly less heterogeneously distributed around a peroxisome, displaying smaller, more circular shapes with an average area of 5.4 ± 2.3 nm2 and perimeter of 265 ± 80 nm (p < 0.001 versus PEX5 and PEX14). Conversely, randomly chosen regions away from the peroxisomes show morphologies characterized by very small and circular patterns (Fig. 4, far right panels), indicating that the organization of the proteins is distinct at the peroxisomes. SCP2 staining shows a broad distribution in size, however, mainly of round shaped features, indicated by the positioning of the value pairs close to the black line. The average area of the SCP2 staining patterns is 18.2 ± 4.1 nm2 and the perimeter is 530 ± 60 nm, indicating that on average the SCP2 patterns are larger and more roundish than those of PEX5 and PEX14 but similarly heterogeneous in size. The spatial patterning of TOM20 is very similar at peroxisomal and in randomly selected regions but forms slightly larger structures (9.0 ± 2.8 versus 6.3 ± 2.0 nm2) with perimeters (370 ± 80 versus 270 ± 60 nm) at the peroxisomes, which confirms the weak correlation of the mitochondrial protein with peroxisomal positions. Through using dual color STED imaging, we were able to relate the spatial staining of more than one protein simultaneously with a 60-nm spatial resolution. Fig. 5A shows representative dual color STED images from our study on peroxisomal proteins. We analyzed three different conditions, each a different pairing of immunolabeled protein, in fixed fibroblasts: PEX5 versus PEX14, PEX11 versus PEX14, and TOM20 versus PEX5. As before, the signal of the GFP-SCP2 was additionally recorded in confocal mode as a means of identifying actively importing peroxisomes. We analyzed more than 30 images for each condition acquired on at least 10 different cells from at least three separate samples. Our analysis compares the spatial distribution of the proteins within each peroxisomal region first by performing a pixel-wise Pearson's colocalization test to quantify the colocalization of PEX5/PEX14, PEX11/PEX14, and TOM20/PEX5 (values of 1 indicate complete colocalization, 0 indicates no colocalization, and −1 indicates opposing colocalization). Fig. 5B shows the histogram of colocalization values over the entire peroxisome population (solid line). PEX5/PEX14 show the highest colocalization with a median Pearson's value of 0.55 compared with 0.45 for PEX11/PEX14 and 0.22 for TOM20/PEX5. Two different controls were applied for the colocalization analysis, a “random region” control (Fig. 5B, dashed line) and a “flip” control (Fig. 5B, dotted line). The first random region control was similar to the previous cases (Fig. 5B, upper left panel; compare with Fig. 3A) with the colocalization of the staining of the respective two proteins being analyzed in random locations away from the peroxisomes. All protein combinations show similarly low colocalization in these randomly chosen regions. In the second flip control, the colocalization of the staining of the respective two proteins is calculated within the peroxisomal regions after mirroring (or flipping) the spatial signal distribution along the vertical axis in one of the channels (Fig. 5B, upper left panel). This flip control is used to check the level of colocalization, which coincidentally arises due to the dense concentration of the proteins within the peroxisomal regions. However, in all cases, the protein pairs hardly showed any colocalization after this flip, indicating that the bulk of observed colocalization is a reflection of congruent compartmentalized protein distributions and does not result from a general homogeneous distribution around the peroxisomes. Our data thus highlight strong colocalization of all proteins within compartments at the peroxisomes with the highest level for PEX5/PEX14, slightly less for PEX11/PEX14, and the lowest level for TOM20/PEX5. However, the colocalization of TOM20/PEX5 is also statistically higher at the peroxisomes than at random regions, once again highlighting the slightly increased abundance of TOM20 at the peroxisomes, which seems to be correlated with the spatial organization of PEX5, which is also obvious from visual inspection of the images (Fig. 6). To further highlight the compartmentalized spatial distribution of the proteins at the peroxisomal membrane, we developed a more rigorous image analysis regime to examine the trends in the data. This resulted from close inspection of the two-color STED images where although there was a tendency toward a compartmentalized distribution of the proteins at the same time there was also an indication that there was a significant number of peroxisomes with a low level of colocalization, for example PEX5 and PEX14 or PEX11 and PEX14 (Fig. 5A). This is quantitatively shown by a fraction of peroxisomes exhibiting a Pearson's coefficient that tended toward zero (Fig. 5B). To confirm this tendency, we expanded our colocalization analysis. As mentioned, the spatial intensity distribution of each protein staining at a single peroxisome is usually strongly compartmentalized and characterized by multiple maxima. We determined the locations of the maxima within the intensity distribution of each protein staining. We plotted the average interchannel distance between those maxima for a region against the corresponding Pearson's correlation value both for PEX5/PEX14 and PEX11/PEX14, resulting in a reciprocal relationship between both parameters. These data show that large distances between maxima (or strongly compartmentalized protein distributions) are characterized by a low colocalization with other proteins (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. 2). Representative protein distribution patterns with high and low Pearson's correlation values are depicted in Fig. 7C. Peroxisomes characterized by high colocalization between PEX5 and PEX14 or PEX11 and PEX14 appear more circular and less compartmentalized compared with the low colocalization cases where multiple maxima are present. Furthermore, note the slightly stronger colocalization between PEX5 and PEX14 compared with PEX11 and PEX14; however, both comparisons still show the same tendency between colocalization and compartmentalization. Our super-resolution STED imaging of immunostained peroxisomes in fixed fibroblasts revealed that peroxisomes are small, predominantly circular shaped organelles with a heterogeneous size and shape distribution.

ProTx-II acts by binding to the membrane-embedded voltage sensor domain of hNaV1.7, but the precise peptide channel-binding site and the importance of membrane binding on the inhibitory activity of ProTx-II remain unknown. In this study, we examined the structure and membrane-binding properties of ProTx-II and several analogues using NMR spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show a direct correlation between ProTx-II membrane binding affinity and its potency as an hNaV1.7 channel inhibitor. The data support a model whereby a hydrophobic patch on the ProTx-II surface anchors the molecule at the cell surface in a position that optimizes interaction of the peptide with the binding site on the voltage sensor domain. This is the first study to demonstrate that binding of ProTx-II to the lipid membrane is directly linked to its potency as an hNaV1.7 channel inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2442717346,"Certain food groups are often rejected during chemotherapy (CT) due to the side effects of treatment, which may interfere with adequate diet and nutritional status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment impact on the diet and nutritional status of women with breast cancer (BC). In this prospective longitudinal study, conducted in 2014–2015, 55 women diagnosed with BC, with a mean age 51.5±10.1 years, were followed and data were collected at three different times. Anthropometric and dietary assessments were performed, the latter by applying nine 24h dietary recalls, by using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index Revised (BHEI-R), and calculating the prevalence of inadequacy by the EAR cut-off point method. Regarding the BHEI-R analysis, the majority of women had a “diet requires modification’, both at the beginning (T0, 58.2%, n = 32) and during treatment (T1, 54.5%, n = 30). However, after the end of the CT, the greater percentage of patients (T2, 49.1%, n = 27) were classified as having an ""inadequate diet"", since the Total Fruit consumption as well as the Dark Green and Orange Vegetable and Legume consumption decreased significantly during treatment (p = 0.043 and p = 0.026, respectively). There was a significant reduction in the intake of macro and micronutrients, with a high prevalence of inadequacy, of up to 100%, for calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B6, vitamin C and zinc. Assessment of the nutritional status indicated that 56% (n = 31) of patients were overweight at these three different times. Weight, BMI and Waist Circumference increased significantly, indicating a worse nutritional status, and there was a correlation between poor diet quality and higher values for BMI, Waist-Hip Ratio and Waist-to-Height Ratio. Chemotherapy interferes in the patients’ diet generating a negative impact on the quality and intake of micro and macronutrients, as well as an impact on their nutritional status, with an increase in anthropometric measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2420401258,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an environmentally ubiquitous estrogen-like endocrine-disrupting compound. Exposure to BPA in utero has been linked to female reproductive disorders, including endometrial hyperplasia and breast cancer. Estrogens are an etiological factor in many of these conditions. We sought to determine whether in utero exposure to BPA altered the global CpG methylation pattern of the uterine genome, subsequent gene expression, and estrogen response. Pregnant mice were exposed to an environmentally relevant dose of BPA or DMSO control. Uterine DNA and RNA were examined by using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation methylation microarray, expression microarray, and quantitative PCR. In utero BPA exposure altered the global CpG methylation profile of the uterine genome and subsequent gene expression. The effect on gene expression was not apparent until sexual maturation, which suggested that estrogen response was the primary alteration. Indeed, prenatal BPA exposure preferentially altered adult estrogen-responsive gene expression. Changes in estrogen response were accompanied by altered methylation that preferentially affected estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-binding genes. The majority of genes that demonstrated both altered expression and ERα binding had decreased methylation. BPA selectively altered the normal developmental programming of estrogen-responsive genes via modification of the genes that bind ERα. Gene-environment interactions driven by early life xenoestrogen exposure likely contributes to increased risk of estrogen-related disease in adults.-Jorgensen, E. M., Alderman, M. H., III, Taylor, H.

https://openalex.org/W2212163165,"Severe Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections pose an immense threat to population health and constitute a great burden for the health care worldwide. Inter alia, S. aureus septic arthritis is a disease with high mortality and morbidity caused by destruction of the infected joints and systemic bone loss, osteoporosis. Toll-Like receptors (TLRs) are innate immune cell receptors recognizing a variety of microbial molecules and structures. S. aureus recognition via TLR2 initiates a signaling cascade resulting in production of various cytokines, but the mechanisms by which S. aureus causes rapid and excessive bone loss are still unclear. We, therefore, investigated how S. aureus regulates periosteal/endosteal osteoclast formation and bone resorption. S. aureus stimulation of neonatal mouse parietal bone induced ex vivo bone resorption and osteoclastic gene expression. This effect was associated with increased mRNA and protein expression of receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) without significant change in osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression. Bone resorption induced by S. aureus was abolished by OPG. S. aureus increased the expression of osteoclastogenic cytokines and prostaglandins in the parietal bones but the stimulatory effect of S. aureus on bone resorption and Tnfsf11 mRNA expression was independent of these cytokines and prostaglandins. Stimulation of isolated periosteal osteoblasts with S. aureus also resulted in increased expression of Tnfsf11 mRNA, an effect lost in osteoblasts from Tlr2 knockout mice. S. aureus stimulated osteoclastogenesis in isolated periosteal cells without affecting RANKL-stimulated resorption. In contrast, S. aureus inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in bone marrow macrophages. These data show that S. aureus enhances bone resorption and periosteal osteoclast formation by increasing osteoblast RANKL production through TLR2. Our study indicates the importance of using different in vitro approaches for studies of how S. aureus regulates osteoclastogenesis to obtain better understanding of the complex mechanisms of S. aureus induced bone destruction in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2444198266,"Although most studies on treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have focused on effects in the epithelium, EoE is a transmural disease. Eosinophils that infiltrate the subepithelial layers of the esophagus lead to fibrosis and the serious complications of EoE, and current therapies have shown minimal effects on this fibrosis. We aimed to elucidate T helper (Th)2 cytokine effects on esophageal fibroblasts and to explore potential fibroblast-targeted therapies for EoE.We established telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts from human esophageal biopsies. We stimulated these esophageal fibroblasts with Th2 cytokines, and examined effects of omeprazole and inhibitors of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT6) pathway (AS1517499, leflunomide, and ruxolitinib) on STAT6 phosphorylation, STAT6 nuclear translocation, and eotaxin-3 expression. We also measured the effects of these inhibitors in esophageal epithelial cells stimulated with Th2 cytokines.As in esophageal epithelial cells, Th2 cytokines increased STAT6 phosphorylation, STAT6 nuclear translocation, eotaxin-3 transcription and protein secretion in esophageal fibroblasts. Unlike in epithelial cells, however, omeprazole did not inhibit cytokine-stimulated eotaxin-3 expression in fibroblasts. In contrast, JAK-STAT6 pathway inhibitors decreased cytokine-stimulated eotaxin-3 expression in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells.Omeprazole does not inhibit Th2 cytokine-stimulated eotaxin-3 expression by esophageal fibroblasts, suggesting that PPIs will have limited impact on subepithelial EoE processes such as fibrosis. JAK-STAT6 pathway inhibitors block Th2 cytokine-stimulated eotaxin-3 expression both in fibroblasts and in epithelial cells, suggesting a potential role for JAK-STAT inhibitors in treating both epithelial inflammation and subepithelial fibrosis in EoE."

We investigated the expression of miRNAs (previously associated with mycobacterial and viral infections) in MS patients and healthy donors (HD) following 6 months natalizumab therapy. In addition, Th1/Th17 cytokines and the presence of anti-EBNA1/VCA IgG in MS patients with different pattern of miRNA expression have been evaluated. MiR-155, miR-26a, miR-132, miR-146a and Th1/Th17 cytokines expression was detected by RT-real time PCR; moreover anti-EBNA1 and VCA IgG titres were measured by ELISA. We observed an up-regulation of miR-155 (p value = 0.009) and miR-132 (p value = 0.04) in MS patients compared to HD. In MS patients, IL-17a (p = 0.037), IFN γ (p = 0.012) and TNFα (p = 0.015) but not IL-6 were over-expressed compared to HD. Two different miRNAs patterns associated to the expression of different cytokines were observed in the MS cohort. Moreover, a down-regulation of miR-155 and miR-26a was seen in MS patients during and after natalizumab therapy. MS patients that over-expressed miR-155 showed a higher EBNA1 IgG titer than MS patients with high levels of miR-26a. In conclusions the expression of particular miRNAs modulates the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the humoral response against EBV and this expression is natalizumab regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2439143110,"Bioactive lipids derived from the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids are important mediators of the inflammatory response. Labor per se is considered a sterile inflammatory process. Intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI) due to microorganisms (i.e., intra-amniotic infection) or danger signals (i.e., sterile IAI) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of preterm labor and clinical chorioamnionitis at term. Early and accurate diagnosis of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) requires analysis of amniotic fluid (AF). It is possible that IAI caused by microorganisms is associated with a stereotypic lipidomic profile, and that analysis of AF may help in the identification of patients with this condition. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the fatty acyl lipidome of AF by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry from patients in spontaneous labor at term and preterm gestations. We report that the AF concentrations of proinflammatory lipid mediators of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are significantly higher in MIAC than in cases of sterile IAI. These results suggest that the concentrations of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and leukotriene B4 in particular could serve as potential biomarkers of MIAC. This finding could have important implications for the rapid identification of patients who may benefit from anti-microbial treatment.-Maddipati, K.

https://openalex.org/W2443984374,"Thyroid hormones modulate not only multiple functions in vertebrates (energy metabolism, central nervous system function, seasonal changes in physiology, and behavior) but also in some non-vertebrates where they control critical post-embryonic developmental transitions such as metamorphosis. Despite their obvious biological importance, the thyroid hormone precursor protein, thyroglobulin (Tg), has been experimentally investigated only in mammals. This may bias our view of how thyroid hormones are produced in other organisms. In this study we searched genomic databases and found Tg orthologs in all vertebrates including the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). We cloned a full-size Tg coding sequence from western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Comparisons between the representative mammal, amphibian, teleost fish, and basal vertebrate indicate that all of the different domains of Tg, as well as Tg regional structure, are conserved throughout the vertebrates. Indeed, in Xenopus, zebrafish, and lamprey Tgs, key residues, including the hormonogenic tyrosines and the disulfide bond-forming cysteines critical for Tg function, are well conserved despite overall divergence of amino acid sequences. We uncovered upstream sequences that include start codons of zebrafish and Xenopus Tgs and experimentally proved that these are full-length secreted proteins, which are specifically recognized by antibodies against rat Tg. By contrast, we have not been able to find any orthologs of Tg among non-vertebrate species.

In many amphibians as well as in teleost fishes and some invertebrate chordates, THs trigger metamorphosis, a spectacular life-history transition (3.Laudet V. et al.The origins and evolution of vertebrate metamorphosis.Curr.

THs are produced in two forms: T4, which harbors four iodine atoms and behaves as a hormonal precursor, and T3, with three iodine atoms, representing the active hormone that binds the receptor. In addition to their unusual diversity of functions, THs are also unusual in their mode of production. First, the reason for a requirement of iodine in a compound with hormonal activity (the only one to our knowledge) remains a mystery (10.Miller A.E. Heyland A. et al.Iodine accumulation in sea urchin larvae is dependent on peroxide.J. Exp. Biol. 2013; 216: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, with a molecular mass of <0.8 kDa and based upon a structure that engages only two tyrosyl residues, THs are synthesized by vertebrate thyrocytes from a large dimeric protein named thyroglobulin (Tg) with a monomer molecular mass of 330 kDa and containing nearly 2750 residues (11.Malthiéry Y.

Besides mammals, all other available Tg sequences are only predictions from genome assembly or EST data, and even these are known only from Gnathostomes. As a consequence, it remains unknown how the TH precursor protein emerged during evolution.

Overall, TH synthesis is energetically very costly as it requires the synthesis and endocytic destruction of two very large Tg monomers to produce only one or two TH molecules. Herein, we have examined the extent of conservation of Tg organization and structure across the whole vertebrate clade. We have cloned and expressed Tg both from western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) and demonstrate that these are secreted proteins. Moreover, to complete the analysis, we searched genomic data accumulated in lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and in genome sequences outside of vertebrates, with the thought that identifying functionally relevant regions of Tg may help in the search for distant orthologs. Remarkably, our findings strongly suggest that the mechanism of Tg synthesis is conserved throughout the vertebrates, but there is no clear sign of Tg presence outside vertebrates. Thus, all evidence suggests that the Tg modular structure appeared at the base of vertebrates and has remained conserved since then. Using RT-PCR with primers designed from the partial predicted sequences available in complete genome data, we were able to isolate a full-length zebrafish (D. rerio) Tg cDNA clone that encodes a 2733-amino acid protein harboring a very similar organization to that of human Tg (Fig. 1, A and B). Using the same strategy, we isolated a western clawed frog (X. tropicalis) Tg cDNA clone that was incomplete at its 5′-end. This cDNA starts at an exon whose position is conserved and encodes a peptide sequence (EYQL … ) that includes the putative conserved hormonogenic Tyr-5 but did not encode any immediate upstream sequence corresponding to a signal peptide. We called this Xenopus Tg cDNA “incomplete” and extended the 5′-end of the clone using a combined approach of PCR amplification and massive sequencing (Fig. 1B). We obtained a sequence that did seem to correspond to an upstream initiating open reading frame, encoding two potential initiator methionine residues: MAPVLLSTMTHRFIYTIFCVFRIIAAIETEYQL. When analyzed by the SignalP 4.1 program, the second of these two methionines predicts the generation of a functional signal peptide with a satisfactory cleavage site, preserving the position of hormonogenic Tyr-5, ultimately encoding a 2772 residue protein. Given the recent suggestion of extrathyroidal expression of Tg variants (34.Wu H. Suzuki S. Sellitti D.F. Doi S.Q. Tanigawa K. Aizawa S. Akama T. Kawashima A. Mishima M. Ishii N. Yoshida A. Hisatome I. Koles N.L. Katoh R. Suzuki K. et al.Expression of a thyroglobulin (Tg) variant in mouse kidney glomerulus.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 389: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we used zebrafish and Xenopus-specific probes to examine Tg mRNA expression during embryogenesis in both species. Expression of tg in zebrafish was evaluated by whole mount in situ hybridization (ISH) at four different stages of development (Fig. 2A, supplemental Fig. S1A). Because the Tg gene encodes a very large mRNA as well as the possibility of extrathyroidal expression (34.Wu H. Suzuki S. Sellitti D.F. Doi S.Q. Tanigawa K. Aizawa S. Akama T. Kawashima A. Mishima M. Ishii N. Yoshida A. Hisatome I. Koles N.L. Katoh R. Suzuki K. et al.Expression of a thyroglobulin (Tg) variant in mouse kidney glomerulus.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 389: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we employed two different probes corresponding to different Tg regions, one at the 5′ end of the transcript and the other in the middle of the transcript. At 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), no expression was observed. At 48 hpf, Tg was expressed in one localized spot in the pharyngeal region of the fish. At 120 hpf, the expression pattern increased in size and adopted an elongated shape but remained exclusive to the pharyngeal region. This corresponds to the organization of the teleost thyroid gland that, in contrast to the well defined gland of amniotes, is scattered in several nodules to form a chain-like pattern along the pharyngeal region. The expression pattern was identical at 144 hpf, and the same pattern was observed with both probes, rendering unlikely any major extrathyroidal expression of an alternative transcript. In the Xenopus tadpole, as in zebrafish, Tg was found to be expressed exclusively in thyrocytes of the thyroid gland (Fig. 2B, supplemental Fig. S1B). ISH on cross-sections revealed expression at Nieuwkoop Faber stages NF57 and NF59. Although ISH is not a quantitative method, the difference in labeling tends to indicate that, as expected, the thyroid is more active at stage NF59 (climax of metamorphosis) than NF57 (onset of metamorphosis), consistent with increased TH levels described at NF59 (35.Leloup J. Buscaglia M. et al.La triiodothyronine, hormone de la métamorphose des Amphibiens.C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1977; 284: 2261-2263Google Scholar). As Tg secretion is known to be mandatory for its biological function in vertebrates (23.Di Jeso B. Arvan P. et al.Thyroglobulin from molecular and cellular biology to clinical endocrinology.Endocr. Rev. 2016; 37: 2-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we wished to investigate the secretability of recombinant Tg from Xenopus and zebrafish. The cDNAs encoding mouse and zebrafish Tg were expressed in 293T cells. Secretion into the cell culture medium was collected for 24 h, the cells were lysed, and both were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody against rodent Tg (Fig. 3A). As expected, there was very strong immunoreactivity of mouse Tg, which was secreted efficiently from cells (C) to medium (M), and the secreted Tg exhibited a slower (higher) mobility consistent with modification of N-linked glycans by Golgi processing enzymes (see below). Zebrafish Tg was also immunoreactive, indicating preserved structural elements of rodent Tg contained within Zebrafish Tg, although the signal strength was weaker than for mouse Tg (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, zebrafish Tg was clearly also secreted, and the protein exhibited a slower (higher) mobility in the medium than in the cell lysate (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). We next examined expression of the incomplete Xenopus Tg cDNA that included the putative conserved hormonogenic Tyr-5 but did not encode any apparent signal peptide. When transfected in 293T cells, this incomplete Xenopus Tg protein was poorly expressed in either the cells or medium (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). To better understand the role of the signal peptide in the stability and trafficking of Tg, we performed endoglycosidase H digestion. For mouse Tg, the protein starts off intracellularly as an endoglycosidase H-sensitive species (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) and is converted to a secreted protein that has a slower (higher) mobility that is endoglycosidase H-resistant (lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, the incomplete Xenopus Tg cDNA encodes a protein that is unglycosylated even before endoglycosidase H digestion (Fig. 3, B lane 5 and 6), indicating that this protein never enters the secretory pathway (as a consequence of the absence of a signal peptide). Thus, as for other secretory proteins (36.Baïsse B. Galisson F. Giraud S. Schapira M. Spertini O. et al.Evolutionary conservation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 primary structure and function.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 166Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) the N-terminal signal peptide fulfills a critical conserved function in mediating intracellular trafficking and secretion. Because we suspected the absence of the signal peptide as a primary reason for the lack of Tg secretion, the mouse Tg signal peptide was engineered in-frame at the 5′-end of the Xenopus Tg open reading frame. With this, Tg protein expression was increased, and secretion was obtained (Fig. 3A, lane 10). After we succeeded in extending the 5′-end of the incomplete Xenopus Tg cDNA clone, we expressed in 293T cells the complete Tg cDNA bearing both potential initiator methionyl residues and found that the encoded Tg protein was well expressed and secreted (Fig. 3A, lanes 11 and 12). Because we expected that the second methionyl residue would lead to a functional signal peptide, we mutated (truncated) our cDNA to delete the first potential initiator methionine and found that this Tg protein was also well expressed and well secreted (Fig. 3A, lanes 13 and 14). Moreover, sequence analysis predicted that the signal peptides of human, Xenopus and zebrafish Tg are all enriched in α helix (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating a conservation of their structure despite divergence in amino acid sequences. These data support the concept that Zebrafish Tg and Xenopus Tg, like mammalian Tgs, are secretable proteins. This result seemed surprising as Xenopus Tg cDNA encodes a protein that lacks the second disulfide bond of the Tg repeat 1–8 because of substitution of two Cys residues (Fig. 1B). This disulfide bond had been presumed to be essential for the structural integrity of the Tg type 1 repeat domain (23.Di Jeso B. Arvan P. et al.Thyroglobulin from molecular and cellular biology to clinical endocrinology.Endocr. Rev. 2016; 37: 2-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To test its importance, we mutagenized these Cys residues within the context of full-length mouse Tg (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the mTg-C1043Y-C1050N double mutant Tg was well expressed and secreted (Fig. 4, lane 10); indeed, even the single cysteine mutants mTg-C1043Y or mTg-C1050N (which prevent formation of the same disulfide bond but leave an unpaired Cys residue) were secreted (Fig. 4, lane 6 and 8). Thus, we conclude that the second Tg1–8 disulfide bond is not required for Tg secretion. Early biochemical evidence has suggested the existence in lamprey (P. marinus) of a large iodinated protein present in the endostyle and/or thyroid gland (37.Suzuki S. Kondo Y. et al.Thyroidal morphogenesis and biosynthesis of thyroglobulin before and after metamorphasis in the lamprey, Lampetra reissneri.Gen. Comp.

B. 1978; 60: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the corresponding clones have never been isolated. We, therefore, searched for Tg orthologs in basal vertebrates (chondrichthyes and agnathas, for which several genomes are available). We found a clear candidate for lamprey Tg, including an excellent signal peptide (MRTSPLLPATTTLYLVLWIGTISALY) predicted by the SignalP.4.1 program. The retrieved sequence encodes a partial 2605-amino acid protein that contains the various N-terminal Tg repeats as well as the C terminus of the ChEL domain. However, this sequence misses part of the ChEL domain that is not present in the genome data (Fig. 1A), creating a sequence gap present between residues 2453 and 2632 of the lamprey protein (Fig. 1B). Comparing the organization of Tgs in human, Xenopus, zebrafish, and lamprey (Fig. 1A) clearly shows that Tg in each of these species contains all of the domains found in mammalian Tg (11.Malthiéry Y. Lissitzky S. et al.Primary structure of human thyroglobulin deduced from the sequence of its 8448 base complementary DNA.Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Tg in each of these species harbors 11 Tg type-1, 3 Tg type-2, and 5 Tg type-3 domains. In contrast to previous reports (17.Belkadi A. Jacques C. Savagner F. Malthièry Y. et al.Phylogenetic analysis of the human thyroglobulin regions.Thyroid Res. 2012; 5: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) we observed that the seventh and ninth Tg1 repeats are also present in zebrafish (although the Tg1–7 repeat does seem to be absent in Percomorph fishes; supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). In addition, Tg3 domains, subcharacterized as type-3a and type-3b (called Tg3a and Tg3b, respectively), appear to be present in each of these species. Moreover, Xenopus, zebrafish, and lamprey Tgs exhibit a linker and a hinge region in the middle of the protein and a ChEL domain at the C-terminal end. These regions are of similar size to the mammalian one, with preservation of conserved cysteines. Taken together, these data indicate a strong conservation of the molecular architecture of Tg throughout the vertebra"

However, as an opportunistic pathogen, GBS is the leading cause of neonatal meningitis and sepsis in the developed world. The predominant route by which GBS is transmitted to infants is from the mother, either during birth or following breach of the placental barrier in utero. Antenatal GBS screening strategies are therefore commonly used to identify colonized women, who then receive antimicrobial prophylaxis. Nevertheless, GBS remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants worldwide (2Le Doare K.

A number of putative colonization determinants have been identified, including the following: αC protein, mediating entry of GBS into cervical epithelial cells (4Baron M.J. Bolduc G.R. Goldberg M.B.

In addition, GBS expresses numerous extracellular matrix-binding proteins, including C5a peptidase (ScpB) and FbsA, which may promote attachment to mucosal tissues of the GU tract (7Doran K.S. Nizet V. et al.Molecular pathogenesis of neonatal group B streptococcal infection: no longer in its infancy.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Antigen I/II (AgI/II) family polypeptide adhesins are found widely across the Streptococcus genus and have been best characterized for those streptococci indigenous to the oral cavity (8Brady L.J. Maddocks S.E. Larson M.R. Forsgren N. Persson K. Deivanayagam C.C. Jenkinson H.F. et al.The changing faces of Streptococcus antigen I/II polypeptide family adhesins.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In silico analyses have recently revealed the presence of genes encoding AgI/II family polypeptides in GBS, which we have designated here group B Streptococcus surface proteins (Bsp). These proteins conform to a conserved primary structure consisting of seven distinct regions (Fig. 1) . The N-terminal region comprises a signal (leader) peptide, an N-terminal domain, and an alanine-rich repeat region (A). The C-terminal region consists of a proline-rich repeat sequence (P) followed by a C-terminal domain (C) and an LPXTG motif required for bacterial cell wall anchorage. The A and P regions flank a central variable region (V), which exhibits the greatest strain-to-strain sequence variation between streptococci and is thought to confer ligand-binding specificity (8Brady L.J. Maddocks S.E. Larson M.R. Forsgren N. Persson K. Deivanayagam C.C. Jenkinson H.F. et al.The changing faces of Streptococcus antigen I/II polypeptide family adhesins.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Structural characterization of AgI/II family proteins from Streptococcus mutans (SpaP) and Streptococcus gordonii (SspB) has revealed a distinctive extended fibrillar structure that projects outwards from the wall-proximal C domain (Fig. 1). The stalk is generated by a high affinity interaction between the α-helix and polyproline II (PPII)-helices of the A and P domains, respectively, serving to present the V “head” domain at its tip (9Larson M.R. Rajashankar K.R. Patel M.H. Robinette R.A. Crowley P.J. Michalek S. Brady L.J. Deivanayagam C. et al.Elongated fibrillar structure of a streptococcal adhesin assembled by the high-affinity association of α- and PPII-helices.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5983-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The N terminus forms a stabilizing scaffold by wrapping behind the base of the stalk (10Heim K.P. Crowley P.J. Long J.R. Kailasan S. McKenna R. Brady L.J. et al.An intramolecular lock facilitates folding and stabilizes the tertiary structure of Streptococcus mutans adhesin P1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Crystal structures of the V regions of SpaP and SspB have revealed a common architecture consisting of a lectin-like fold with a putative binding cleft (11Troffer-Charlier N. Ogier J. Moras D.

AgI/II family polypeptides are multifunctional adhesins that serve as important colonization determinants for oral streptococci, mediating binding to host substrata and to other resident microbes. A common receptor for AgI/II polypeptides is glycoprotein-340 (gp340), an innate immunity scavenger receptor produced at mucosal surfaces (17Madsen J. Mollenhauer J. Holmskov U. et al.Review: Gp-340/DMBT1 in mucosal innate immunity.Innate. Immun. 2010; 16: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Fluid-phase gp340, in saliva and other mucosal secretions, agglutinates microbes for clearance from the body, whereas solid-phase gp340 adsorbed onto host surfaces provides a substratum for microbial adherence (18Loimaranta V.

More recently, an AgI/II family polypeptide (group A Streptococcus surface protein, AspA) has been described in group A Streptococcus (GAS) (25Maddocks S.E. Wright C.J. Nobbs A.H. Brittan J.L.

The gene encoding AspA is located within an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) designated region of difference 2 (RD2), which is found among GAS serotypes implicated in puerperal fever (26Green N.M.

It has been proposed that genes carried within RD2 might contribute to both GAS and GBS pathogenicity (28Zhang S. Green N.M. Sitkiewicz I. Lefebvre R.B.

Supporting this, AspA has been shown to facilitate GAS biofilm formation on salivary pellicle (25Maddocks S.E. Wright C.J. Nobbs A.H. Brittan J.L. Franklin L. Strömberg N. Kadioglu A.

Given this precedent, we hypothesized that Bsp polypeptides may serve as important host colonization determinants of GBS. In this study, we introduce four similar, but non-identical, Bsp family proteins that are distributed among GBS of different capsular serotypes. Crystallographic and biophysical characterization of isolated functional domains from one of these proteins (BspA) identifies unique structural features that distinguish it as an AgI/II family deviant. These findings are of significance in directing the development of new vaccines or anti-infective agents that selectively target GBS, while not impacting the commensal microbiota. In silico analyses were undertaken to determine the prevalence of bsp genes across GBS, using the completed GBS genome sequences available on NCBI. The bsp genes were found in five strains (summarized in Table 1) , and each was present on an RD2-like ICE (28Zhang S. Green N.M. Sitkiewicz I. Lefebvre R.B. Musser J.M. et al.Identification and characterization of an antigen I/II family protein produced by group A Streptococcus.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4200-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based upon primary sequence identities, four homologues of the bsp gene were identified, which we designated bspA–D (Fig. 1B). BspA shares 90.35% amino acid (aa) sequence identity with BspB, and both homologues were found in strain NEM316, which carries one copy of bspA and three copies of bspB. The remaining GBS strains carry either bspC or bspD. The proteins encoded by these genes share 99.52–99.76% aa sequence identity, with the only major difference being that BspD is missing a leader peptide (39–41-aa residues) for targeting to the Sec translocation machinery. BspA/B homologues can be separated from BspC/D homologues based upon the presence of two additional sequences in BspA/B homologues, one in the A domain (51-aa residues) and the second in the P domain (25-aa residues). There was no correlation between GBS capsular serotype and bsp homologue distribution.TABLE 1Distribution of AgI/II family polypeptides in GBSAgI/II geneStrain (serotype)Previous locus tagNew locus tagbspANEM316 (III)gbs1143GBS_RS06095bspBNEM316 (III)gbs0393GBS_RS02350gbs0723GBS_RS04015gbs0986GBS_RS05325bspC515 (Ia)SAL_2056SAL_RS04265COH1 (III)SAN_2127GBSCOH1_1801bspD2603V/R (V)SAG_202118RS21 (II)SAJ_1924 Open table in a new tab To investigate the functions of BspA as a putative colonization determinant in the absence of confounding problems due to adhesin redundancy in GBS, Lactococcus lactis was utilized as a heterologous expression strain. The bspA gene was cloned under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter into vector pMSP (31Hirt H. Erlandsen S.L. Dunny G.M. et al.Heterologous inducible expression of Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 aggregation substance asc10 in Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii contributes to cell hydrophobicity and adhesion to fibrin.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), enabling expression of BspA to be regulated by the concentration of nisin added to the growth medium. Expression of BspA on the surface of L. lactis following nisin induction was confirmed by immuno-dot blot analysis (Fig. 2A) with α-Spy1325mid antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes AspA mid-region (25Maddocks S.E. Wright C.J. Nobbs A.H. Brittan J.L. Franklin L. Strömberg N. Kadioglu A. Jepson M.A. Jenkinson H.F. et al.Streptococcus pyogenes antigen I/II-family polypeptide AspA shows differential ligand-binding properties and mediates biofilm formation.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 81: 1034-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which shares 63% aa sequence identity across the corresponding VPC(473–990) region of BspA. A primary host factor recognized by members of the AgI/II polypeptide family in oral streptococci and GAS is gp340, a mucin-like glycoprotein associated with the surface of mucosal tissues (17Madsen J. Mollenhauer J. Holmskov U. et al.Review: Gp-340/DMBT1 in mucosal innate immunity.Innate. Immun. 2010; 16: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When gp340 becomes adsorbed onto a surface, exposed cryptitopes can provide receptors for microbial adherence. To examine the interaction of BspA with gp340, binding levels of L. lactis expressing BspA (pMSP.bspA+) to immobilized gp340 were compared with L. lactis containing empty vector (pMSP), using a crystal violet spectrophotometric assay. Adhesion levels of L. lactis pMSP.bspA+ were significantly (p < 0.005) higher than those of L. lactis containing empty vector (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a dose-dependent response in binding to gp340 by BspA was seen with increasing nisin concentration. By contrast, neither L. lactis-expressing BspA nor empty vector adhered to the blocking agent, bovine serum albumin (BSA). There is evidence that the head (V) regions of SspB, SpaP, and AspA facilitate gp340 binding activity (9Larson M.R. Rajashankar K.R. Patel M.H. Robinette R.A. Crowley P.J. Michalek S. Brady L.J.

To determine whether the V domain of BspA plays a similar role in mediating binding to immobilized gp340, anti-V domain antibodies were affinity-purified from α-Spy1325mid antiserum (Fig. 3A). These antibodies (designated α-rV.BspA) were then investigated for the capacity to impair adherence of L. lactis pMSP.bspA+ to immobilized gp340. L. lactis expressing the AgI/II family polypeptide SspB from Streptococcus gordonii was included as a control to confirm antiserum specificity. Lactococcal cells were labeled with FITC, and binding to gp340 was measured using a fluorescence plate reader. Adherence of L. lactis pMSP.bspA+ cells to immobilized gp340 was significantly (p < 0.0001) impaired by α-rV.BspA, which reduced binding by 85% relative to the no antiserum control (Fig. 3B). Importantly, this inhibition was specific to the reactivity of α-rV.BspA antibody with BspA, as α-rV.BspA had no significant inhibitory effect on adherence of L. lactis pKS80.sspB+ to immobilized gp340 (Fig. 3B). Previous studies have shown that SspB expressed by S. gordonii, an integral member of the human oral microbiota, interacts with C. albicans hyphal cell wall Als3 protein, promoting the development of mixed species communities (24Silverman R.J.

To determine whether BspA was involved in promoting this association of GBS with C. albicans, the interactions of L. lactis expressing BspA or vector control (pMSP) with C. albicans were compared. L. lactis pMSP cells exhibited few interactions with C. albicans (Fig. 4B). Similarly, uninduced L. lactis pMSP.bspA+ cells associated only sparsely with candidal hyphae (Fig. 4C). By contrast, L. lactis cells induced to express BspA showed high affinity for C. albicans and preferentially bound along the lengths of the hyphal filaments (Fig. 4C). GBS colonization of vaginal and cervical epithelia is the primary risk factor for vertical transmission of neonatal infection (3Verani J.R. McGee L. Schrag S.J. et al.Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease-revised guidelines from CDC.MMWR Recomm. Rep. 2010; 59: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether BspA was a candidate for mediating GBS adherence to epithelial cells, binding levels of L. lactis pMSP.bspA+ to a vaginal epithelial cell line, VK2/E6E7, were compared with those of L. lactis pMSP vector control. Lactococci were incubated with VK2/E6E7 monolayers and numbers of associated bacteria enumerated by viable count. Numbers of L. lactis cells expressing BspA associating with VK2/E6E7 monolayers were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than vector control (Fig. 5) , implying that BspA mediates adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells. To gain further insight into the adhesive properties of BspA, we sought to structurally characterize this protein. Initially, we focused our efforts on the BspA C-terminal domain (BspA-C, 328-aa residues). Although our whole cell binding studies identify the BspA variable domain as being responsible for gp340 binding by this polypeptide, a role for the C-terminal domain of AgI/II family polypeptides in target binding has been suggested by others (9Larson M.R.

Despite being significantly shorter (328-aa residues as compared with 502–508 aa in other AgI/II family proteins), the BspA-C domain exhibits a high degree of sequence identity to equivalent regions in other AgI/II family proteins, indicative of analogous function. The crystal structures of BspA-C and a more readily crystallizable point mutant of this protein, BspA-CG744D (both comprising residues 554–881 of full-length BspA), were determined by molecular replacement in the space groups C2122 and P212121 respectively.

Neutrophils can respond to infection by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are formed of chromatin and specific granular proteins and are released after execution of a poorly characterized cell death pathway. Here, we show that NET formation induced by PMA or Candida albicans is independent of RNA polymerase II and III-mediated transcription as well as of protein synthesis. Thus, neutrophils contain all the factors required for NET formation when they emerge from the bone marrow as differentiated cells."

Increased understanding of the RNAi pathway in target insect pests will provide information to use this technology effectively and to inform decisions related to resistant management strategies for RNAi based traits. Dicer 2 (Dcr2), an endonuclease responsible for formation of small interfering RNA's and Argonaute 2 (Ago2), an essential catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) have both been associated with the RNAi pathway in a number of different insect species including the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We identified both genes from a transcriptome library generated from different tissues and developmental stages of the western corn rootworm, an important target pest for transgenic plants expressing dsRNA targeting essential genes. The expression of these genes was suppressed by more than 90% after injecting gene specific dsRNA into adult rootworms. The injected beetles were then fed vATPase A dsRNA which has previously been demonstrated to cause mortality in western corn rootworm adults. The suppression of both RNAi pathway genes resulted in reduced mortality after subsequent exposure to lethal concentrations of vATPase A dsRNA as well as increased vATPase A expression relative to control treatments. Injections with dsRNA for a non-lethal target sequence (Laccase 2) did not affect mortality or expression caused by vATPase A dsRNA indicating that the results observed with Argo and Dicer dsRNA were not caused by simple competition among different dsRNA's. These results confirm that both genes play an important role in the RNAi pathway for western corn rootworms and indicate that selection pressures that potentially affect the expression of these genes may provide a basis for future studies to understand potential mechanisms of resistance."

This disease frequently affects melon (Cucumis melo L.) and other Cucurbitaceous family crops in both open field and greenhouse cultivation. One of the goals of genomics is to identify the polymorphic loci responsible for variation in phenotypic traits. In this study, powdery mildew disease assessment scores were calculated for four melon accessions, 'SCNU1154', 'Edisto47', 'MR-1', and 'PMR5'. To investigate the genetic variation of these accessions, whole genome re-sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was performed. A total of 754,759,704 quality-filtered reads were generated, with an average of 82.64% coverage relative to the reference genome. Comparisons of the sequences for the melon accessions revealed around 7.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 1.9 million InDels, and 182,398 putative structural variations (SVs). Functional enrichment analysis of detected variations classified them into biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories. Further, a disease-associated QTL map was constructed for 390 SNPs and 45 InDels identified as related to defense-response genes. Among them 112 SNPs and 12 InDels were observed in powdery mildew responsive chromosomes. Accordingly, this whole genome re-sequencing study identified SNPs and InDels associated with defense genes that will serve as candidate polymorphisms in the search for sources of resistance against powdery mildew disease and could accelerate marker-assisted breeding in melon."
https://openalex.org/W2422276618,"The bacterial cell envelope is composed of a mixture of different lipids and proteins, making it an inherently complex organelle. The interactions between integral membrane proteins and lipids are crucial for their respective spatial localization within bacterial cells. We have employed microsecond timescale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of vesicles of varying sizes and with a range of protein and lipid compositions, and used novel approaches to measure both local and global system dynamics, the latter based on spherical harmonics analysis. Our results suggest that both hydrophobic mismatch, enhanced by embedded membrane proteins, and curvature based sorting, due to different modes of undulation, may drive assembly in vesicular systems. Interestingly, the modes of undulation of the vesicles were found to be altered by the specific protein and lipid composition of the vesicle. Strikingly, lipid dynamics were shown to be coupled to proteins up to 6 nm from their surface, a substantially larger distance than has previously been observed, resulting in multi-layered annular rings enriched with particular types of phospholipid. Such large protein-lipid complexes may provide a mechanism for long-range communication. Given the complexity of bacterial membranes, our results suggest that subtle changes in lipid composition may have major implications for lipid and protein sorting under a curvature-based membrane-sorting model."
https://openalex.org/W2426590442,"Background Activation of inflammatory pathway with elevation of inflammatory biomarkers such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been considered a pathophysiological feature of frailty. In recent years, the association between Intercellular adhesive molecule -1 (ICAM-1) and vascular inflammatory was established. Provocation of inflammatory cascades from ICAM-1 is potential IL-6 related, although the association between the inflammatory process and frailty is little to known. The study was intended to evaluate the relationship between serum ICAM-1, IL-6 and frailty. Materials and Methods Data was derived from a representative national sampling cohort in Taiwan. The cross-sectional study included nine-hundred-forty-six community-dwelling people aged 53 and older. Frailty was defined as having three or more components (including, muscle shrinkage, slowness, weakness, exhaustion, and low activity) Serum IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels were measured using standard enzyme–linked immunosorbent assays. Results Soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) levels were stepwise increased in non-frail, pre-frail and frail elderly people (the median levels were 255 vs. 265 vs. 285 ng/ml, respectively p<0.001). A multivariate multinomial logistic regression, which was adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, BMI, and chronic disease number, was utilized to determine that the probability of being frail due to increased log (ICAM-1) and log (IL-6) standard deviation levels were 1.44 (95% CI 1.09–1.91) and 1.54 (95%CI 1.07–2.20), respectively. Conclusion sICAM-1 was significantly associated with frailty, independent of IL-6. This implied that leukocyte migration and inflammation cascade activation might contribute to frailty, in addition to monocyte/macrophage-mediated immuno-inflammation."

To study how the density of biological literature has changed over the past two decades we visually inspected 1464 research articles related only to the biological sciences from ten scholarly journals (with average Impact Factors, IF, ranging from 3.8 to 32.1). By scoring the number of data items (tables and figures), density of composite figures (labeled panels per figure or PPF), as well as the number of authors, pages and references per research publication we calculated an Average Publishable Unit or APU for 1993, 2003, and 2013. The data show an overall increase in the average ± SD number of data items from 1993 to 2013 of approximately 7±3 to 14±11 and PPF ratio of 2±1 to 4±2 per article, suggesting that the APU has doubled in size over the past two decades. As expected, the increase in data items per article is mainly in the form of supplemental material, constituting 0 to 80% of the data items per publication in 2013, depending on the journal. The changes in the average number of pages (approx. 8±3 to 10±3), references (approx. 44±18 to 56±24) and authors (approx. 5±3 to 8±9) per article are also presented and discussed. The average number of data items, figure density and authors per publication are correlated with the journal’s average IF.

To quantitatively map the nature of sleep-induced modulations in sensory responses we presented participants with auditory stimuli possessing different levels of linguistic complexity. Ten participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the waking state and after falling asleep. Sleep staging was based on heart rate measures validated independently on 20 participants using concurrent EEG and heart rate measurements and the results were confirmed using permutation analysis. Participants were exposed to three types of auditory stimuli: scrambled sounds, meaningless word sentences and comprehensible sentences. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, we found diminishing brain activation along the hierarchy of language processing, more pronounced in higher processing regions. Specifically, the auditory thalamus showed similar activation levels during sleep and waking states, primary auditory cortex remained activated but showed a significant reduction in auditory responses during sleep, and the high order language-related representation in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) cortex showed a complete abolishment of responses during NREM sleep. In addition to an overall activation decrease in language processing regions in superior temporal gyrus and IFG, those areas manifested a loss of semantic selectivity during NREM sleep. Our results suggest that the decreased awareness to linguistic auditory stimuli during NREM sleep is linked to diminished activity in high order processing stations."

Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes provide protection to patients with colon cancer while patients deficient in these responses have significantly worse prognosis. To determine if differences in cytotoxic immunity might play a role in racial disparities in colorectal cancer 258 microsatellite-stable colon tumors were examined for infiltrating immune biomarkers via immunohistochemistry. Descriptive summary statistics were calculated using two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests, while linear regression models with log-transformed data were used to assess differences in race and Pearson and Spearman correlations were used to correlate different biomarkers. The association between different biomarkers was also assessed using linear regression after adjusting for covariates. No significant differences were observed in CD8+ (p = 0.83), CD57+ (p = 0.55), and IL-17-expressing (p = 0.63) cell numbers within the tumor samples tested. When infiltration of granzyme B+ cells was analyzed, however, a significant difference was observed, with African Americans having lower infiltration of cells expressing this cytotoxic marker than Caucasians (p<0.01). Analysis of infiltrating granzyme B+ cells at the invasive borders of the tumor revealed an even greater difference by race (p<0.001). Taken together, the data presented suggest differences in anti-tumor immune cytotoxicity may be a contributing factor in the racial disparities observed in colorectal cancer."

The HBV covalently-closed circular DNA cccDNA is a key to HBV persistence, and its degradation can be induced by the cellular deaminase APOBEC3. This study aimed to measure the distribution of intrahepatic cccDNA levels and evaluate the association between levels of cccDNA and APOBEC3 in HCC patients. Among 49 HCC patients, 35 matched cancerous and contiguous noncancerous liver tissues had detectable cccDNA, and the median intrahepatic cccDNA in the cancerous tissues (CT) was significantly lower than in the contiguous noncancerous tissues (CNCT) (p = 0.0033). RCA (rolling circle amplification), followed by 3D-PCR identified positive amplification in 27 matched HCC patients. Sequence analysis indicated G to A mutations accumulated to higher levels in CT samples compared to CNCT samples, and the dinucleotide context showed preferred editing in the GpA context. Among 7 APOBEC3 genes, APOBEC3B was the only one up-regulated in cancerous tissues both at the transcriptional and protein levels (p < 0.05). This implies APOBEC3B may contribute to cccDNA editing and subsequent degradation in cancerous tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2439412971,"Non-human primates are the animals closest to humans for use in influenza A virus challenge studies, in terms of their phylogenetic relatedness, physiology and immune systems. Previous studies have shown that cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are permissive for infection with H1N1pdm influenza virus. These studies have typically used combined challenge routes, with the majority being intra-tracheal delivery, and high doses of virus (> 107 infectious units). This paper describes the outcome of novel challenge routes (inhaled aerosol, intra-nasal instillation) and low to moderate doses (103 to 106 plaque forming units) of H1N1pdm virus in cynomolgus macaques. Evidence of virus replication and sero-conversion were detected in all four challenge groups, although the disease was sub-clinical. Intra-nasal challenge led to an infection confined to the nasal cavity. A low dose (103 plaque forming units) did not lead to detectable infectious virus shedding, but a 1000-fold higher dose led to virus shedding in all intra-nasal challenged animals. In contrast, aerosol and intra-tracheal challenge routes led to infections throughout the respiratory tract, although shedding from the nasal cavity was less reproducible between animals compared to the high-dose intra-nasal challenge group. Intra-tracheal and aerosol challenges induced a transient lymphopaenia, similar to that observed in influenza-infected humans, and greater virus-specific cellular immune responses in the blood were observed in these groups in comparison to the intra-nasal challenge groups. Activation of lung macrophages and innate immune response genes was detected at days 5 to 7 post-challenge. The kinetics of infection, both virological and immunological, were broadly in line with human influenza A virus infections. These more authentic infection models will be valuable in the determination of anti-influenza efficacy of novel entities against less severe (and thus more common) influenza infections."

This study investigates whether erythropoietin levels are inappropriately low in these cases of “anemia of unknown etiology” and whether this trend persists after accounting for confounders. Methods This study includes all anemic patients over 60 years old who had erythropoietin measured between 2005 and 2013 at a single center. Three independent reviewers used defined criteria to assign each patient’s anemia to one of ten etiologies: chronic kidney disease, iron deficiency, chronic disease, confirmed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), suspected MDS, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, anemia of unknown etiology, other etiology, or multifactorial etiology. Iron deficiency anemia served as the comparison group in all analyses. We used linear regression to model the relationship between erythropoietin and the presence of each etiology, sequentially adding terms to the model to account for the hemoglobin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results A total of 570 patients met the inclusion criteria. Linear regression analysis showed that erythropoietin levels in chronic kidney disease, anemia of chronic disease and anemia of unknown etiology were lower by 48%, 46% and 27%, respectively, compared to iron deficiency anemia even after adjusting for hemoglobin, eGFR and comorbidities. Conclusions We have shown that erythropoietin levels are inappropriately low in anemia of unknown etiology, even after adjusting for confounders. This suggests that decreased erythropoietin production may play a key role in the pathogenesis of anemia of unknown etiology."

The structured phospholipids were obtained in high yields (59–87%) and evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines of different origin: MV4-11, A-549, MCF-7, LOVO, LOVO/DX, HepG2 and also towards non-cancer cell line BALB/3T3 (normal mice fibroblasts). The phosphatidylcholines modified with monoterpene acid showed a significantly higher antiproliferative activity than free monoterpene acids. The highest activity was observed for the terpene-phospholipids containing the isoprenoid acids in sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine and palmitic acid in sn-2."
https://openalex.org/W2440610582,"Small colony variants (SCVs) can be defined as a naturally occurring sub-population of bacteria characterized by their reduced colony size and distinct biochemical properties. SCVs of Staphylococcus aureus have been studied extensively over the past two decades due to their role in recurrent human infections. However, little work has been done on SCVs of Escherichia coli, and this work has focused on the physiology and morphology that define these colonies of E. coli, such as small size and slow growth. E. coli strain JW0623, has a null lipA mutation in the lipoic acid synthase gene (lipA), and is a lipoic acid auxotroph. When the mutant was grown in LB medium to log phase, it showed remarkable resistance to acid (pH 3), hydrogen peroxide, heat and osmotic stress compared to its parent BW25113. Using RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR, the expression of certain genes was compared in the two strains in an attempt to create a molecular profile of Escherichia coli SCVs. These include genes involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, electron transport, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis. It was also demonstrated that the addition of 5 μg/ml of lipoic acid to LB medium allows for the phenotypic rescue of the mutant; reversing its slow growth, its resistance characteristics, and elevated gene expression. These results indicate that the mutation in lipA leads to an E. coli SCV that resembles an electron transport defective SCV of S. aureus These strains are typically auxotrophs, and are phenotypically rescued by adding the missing metabolite to rich medium. There are global shifts in gene expression which are reversible and depend on whether the auxotrophic molecule is absent or present. Looking at the E. coli SCV from an evolutionary point of view, it becomes evident that its path to survival is to express genes that confer stress resistance."

While simian foamy virus (SFV) and simian T- lymphotropic virus (STLV)-like infection were reported in healthy persons exposed to nonhuman primates (NHPs) in West-Central Africa, less is known about the distribution of these viruses in Western Africa and in hospitalized populations. We serologically screened for SFV and STLV infection using 1,529 specimens collected between 1985 and 1997 from Côte d'Ivoire patients with high HIV prevalence. PCR amplification and analysis of SFV, STLV, and HIV/SIV sequences from PBMCs was used to investigate possible simian origin of infection. We confirmed SFV antibodies in three persons (0.2%), two of whom were HIV-1-infected. SFV polymerase (pol) and LTR sequences were detected in PBMC DNA available for one HIV-infected person. Phylogenetic comparisons with new SFV sequences from African guenons showed infection likely originated from a Chlorocebus sabaeus monkey endemic to Côte d'Ivoire. 4.6% of persons were HTLV seropositive and PCR testing of PBMCs from 15 HTLV seroreactive persons identified nine with HTLV-1 and one with HTLV-2 LTR sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that two persons had STLV-1-like infections, seven were HTLV-1, and one was an HTLV-2 infection. 310/858 (53%), 8/858 (0.93%), and 18/858 (2.1%) were HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-positive but undifferentiated by serology, respectively. No SIV sequences were found in persons with HIV-2 antibodies (n = 1) or with undifferentiated HIV results (n = 7). We document SFV, STLV-1-like, and dual SFV/HIV infection in Côte d'Ivoire expanding the geographic range for zoonotic simian retrovirus transmission to West Africa. These findings highlight the need to define the public health consequences of these infections. Studying dual HIV-1/SFV infections in immunocompromised populations may provide a new opportunity to better understand SFV pathogenicity and transmissibility in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2437521692,"The post-larval or puerulus stage of spiny, or rock, lobsters (Palinuridae) swim many kilometres from open oceans into coastal waters where they subsequently settle. The orientation cues used by the puerulus for this migration are unclear, but are presumed to be critical to finding a place to settle. Understanding this process may help explain the biological processes of dispersal and settlement, and be useful for developing realistic dispersal models. In this study, we examined the use of reef sound as an orientation cue by the puerulus stage of the southern rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Experiments were conducted using in situ binary choice chambers together with replayed recording of underwater reef sound. The experiment was conducted in a sandy lagoon under varying wind conditions. A significant proportion of puerulus (69%) swam towards the reef sound in calm wind conditions. However, in windy conditions (>25 m s-1) the orientation behaviour appeared to be less consistent with the inclusion of these results, reducing the overall proportion of pueruli that swam towards the reef sound (59.3%). These results resolve previous speculation that underwater reef sound is used as an orientation cue in the shoreward migration of the puerulus of spiny lobsters, and suggest that sea surface winds may moderate the ability of migrating pueruli to use this cue to locate coastal reef habitat to settle. Underwater sound may increase the chance of successful settlement and survival of this valuable species."
https://openalex.org/W2439089088,"Although human flexible behavior relies on cognitive control, it would be implausible to assume that there is only one, general mode of cognitive control strategy adopted by all individuals. For instance, different reliance on proactive versus reactive control strategies could explain inter-individual variability. In particular, specific life experiences, like a highly demanding training for future Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs), could modulate cognitive control functions. A group of ATC trainees and a matched group of university students were tested longitudinally on task-switching and Stroop paradigms that allowed us to measure indices of cognitive control. The results showed that the ATCs, with respect to the control group, had substantially smaller mixing costs during long cue-target intervals (CTI) and a reduced Stroop interference effect. However, this advantage was present also prior to the training phase. Being more capable in managing multiple task sets and less distracted by interfering events suggests a more efficient selection and maintenance of task relevant information as an inherent characteristic of the ATC group, associated with proactive control. Critically, the training that the ATCs underwent improved their accuracy in general and reduced response time switching costs during short CTIs only. These results indicate a training-induced change in reactive control, which is described as a transient process in charge of stimulus-driven task detection and resolution. This experience-based enhancement of reactive control strategy denotes how cognitive control and executive functions in general can be shaped by real-life training and underlines the importance of experience in explaining inter-individual variability in cognitive functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2444271794,"Purpose To compare the effect of 4-week unknown vs known loads strength training intervention on power output performance and throwing velocity in junior team handball players. Methods Twenty-eight junior team-handball players (17.2 ± 0.6 years, 1.79 ± 0.07 m, 75.6 ± 9.4 kg)were divided into two groups (unknown loads: UL; known loads: KL). Both groups performed two sessions weekly consisting of four sets of six repetitions of the bench press throw exercise, using the 30%, 50% and 70% of subjects’ individual 1 repetition maximum (1RM). In each set, two repetitions with each load were performed, but the order of the loads was randomised. In the KL group, researchers told the subjects the load to mobilise prior each repetition, while in the UL group, researchers did not provide any information. Maximal dynamic strength (1RM bench press), power output (with 30, 50 and 70% of 1RM) and throwing velocity (7 m standing throw and 9 m jumping throw) were assessed pre- and post-training intervention. Results Both UL and KL group improved similarly their 1RM bench press as well as mean and peak power with all loads. There were significant improvements in power developed in all the early time intervals measured (150 ms) with the three loads (30, 50, 70% 1RM) in the UL group, while KL only improved with 30% 1RM (all the time intervals) and with 70% 1RM (at certain time intervals). Only the UL group improved throwing velocity in both standing (4.7%) and jumping (5.3%) throw (p > 0.05). Conclusions The use of unknown loads has led to greater gains in power output in the early time intervals as well as to increases in throwing velocity compared with known loads. Therefore unknown loads are of significant practical use to increase both strength and in-field performance in a short period of training."

Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are an important part of the outer blood-retina barrier and their death is a determinant of AMD. Propofol, a common clinically used intravenous anesthetic agent, has been shown to act as an efficacious neuroprotective agent with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo and in vitro. However, little is known about its effects on RPE cells. The purpose of our research was to investigate whether propofol could protect RPE cells from apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent pathways. To this end, prior to stimulation with thapsigargin (TG), ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with varying concentrations of propofol. A protective effect of propofol in TG-treated ARPE-9 was apparent, TUNEL and flow cytometric assays showed decreased apoptosis. We further demonstrated that propofol pretreatment attenuated or inhibited the effects caused by TG, such as upregulation of Bax, BiP, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), active caspase 12, and cleaved caspase 3, and downregulation of Bcl2. It also decreased the TG-induced levels of ER stress-related molecules such as p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and ATF4. Furthermore, it downregulated the expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This study elucidated novel propofol-induced cellular mechanisms for antiapoptotic activities in RPE cells undergoing ER stress and demonstrated the potential value of using propofol in the treatment of AMD."

The small GTPase Ras superfamily in human consists of at least 154 members divided into five principal families: the Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran families (1.Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. et al.The Ras superfamily at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). These proteins act as molecular switches, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form, transducing signals from plasma membrane receptors to downstream signal molecules. These small GTPases generally have low intrinsic GTPase hydrolytic activity, and efficient hydrolysis requires interaction with family-specific groups of GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) which can accelerate the cleavage step by several orders of magnitude. Arf6, an Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family member, is involved in endocytic pathways, endosomal recycling, cell migration, exocytosis, actin reorganization, plasma membrane reorganization, and cytokinesis (2.D'Souza-Schorey C.

Because Rap1-GTP can up-regulate the RhoGAP activity of ARAP3, the role of ARAP3 in downstream Rap1-GTP cell processes is RhoGAP-dependent. In neutrophils, ARAP3 regulates chemotaxis and adhesion-dependent processes (14.Gambardella L. Anderson K.E. Nussbaum C. Segonds-Pichon A. Margarido T. Norton L. Ludwig T. Sperandio M. Hawkins P.T.

However, the nature of the ARAP3-RhoGAP·RhoA interaction was still unknown. To determine the structure and function of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain, we solved the x-ray crystal structures of the RhoGAP domain and of the complexed RhoA·RhoGAP domain with a substrate transition state analog GDP·AlF4−. Through these structures, we mapped the interface between RhoA and the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain. Using the complexed structure as a guide, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the role of interface residues on complex formation and on GTP hydrolysis. Meanwhile, we also found the residues responsible for the substrate specificity of ARAP3 among RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. To investigate the structure and function of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain, we constructed different fragments according to the secondary structure prediction. The most promising construct is the fragment containing ARAP3 residues 906–1107, which binds RhoA with a dissociation constant (KD) of 2.45 μm (Fig. 1d; see Table 2). After extensive crystallization trials, we determined the 2.30 Å crystal structure of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain (Table 1). Although we failed to obtain crystals by mixing the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain with different RhoA constructs, we successfully obtained crystals by expressing a fusion protein of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain and RhoA, using a 28-residue flexible linker (19.van Leeuwen H.C.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain belong to space group P43212 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two ARAP3-RhoGAP domain molecules in the asymmetric unit are similar to one another with a Cα atom root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.375 Å calculated by PyMOL. The overall structure of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain exhibits a canonical RhoGAP domain structure, which consists of nine long α-helices and two short α-helices packed in an anti-parallel way, labeled as α1–α10, with an extra α-helix at the C terminus (Fig. 1b). Most RhoGAP domains have a conserved motif in the loop between the α2 and the α3 helices. In this motif, a central arginine is the primary element required for GTPase rate enhancement and is called the arginine finger. The sequence of this motif in the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain is GVYRKGG (residues 939–945; Fig. 1b). The ARAP3-RhoGAP domain structure exhibits structural similarity to many other RhoGAP structures with an RMSD from 1.4 to 2.4 Å and identity from 17 to 30%, analyzed by the Dali server (23.Holm L. Rosenström P. et al.Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar). Crystals of RhoA·GDP·AlF4− complexed with the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain belong to space group P212121, and the asymmetric unit contains two molecules. The structure was solved by molecule replacement, refined to 2.10 Å (Table 1), and the overall structure of one complex in the asymmetric unit is shown in Fig. 1c. The two complex molecules in the asymmetric unit are similar to one another with a Cα atom RMSD of 0.4 Å calculated by PyMOL. Residues 28–40 in the switch I region of RhoA, which cannot be observed because of missing electron density, are shown by the dotted line in Fig. 1c. In this final refined complex structure, the electron density map next to the GDP in the active center is almost square planar, modeled as AlF4− (Fig. 1f). The structures of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain in the apo and the complexed state show no significant difference with a Cα atom RMSD of 0.523 Å calculated by PyMOL. The main differences between the apo and the complexed state structures of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain are found in the α2-α3 loop and the α3 helix (Fig. 1e). The Arg-942 residue in the α2-α3 loop is moved closer to interact with and stabilize the orientation of GDP·AlF4−. The α3 helix of ARAP3 RhoGAP domain has a 6.5° rotation between the apo and the complexed state, driving Arg-949ARAP3 closer to Asp-90RhoA to form tight salt bridges (Fig. 1e). RhoA·GDP·AlF4− superimposes well with the structure of RhoA-GTPγS (PDB code 1A2B; Fig. 1g) but has a conformational difference at the switch II region compared with RhoA-GDP (PDB code 1FTN; Fig. 1h). However, we could not compare the conformation of switch I from these structures because the electron density map of this region was missing from the structure we solved. ARAP3-RhoGAP domain complexed with RhoA in the transition state buries 2092 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface. The interaction surface of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain involves the α2-α3 loop and the α3, α4, and α8 helices. Residues contributing to the interaction interface from RhoA are located at the switch II region, the α3 helix, and the insert region (Fig. 2a). The complexed structure shows the conserved active center as reported previously. In the complexed structure, residue Arg-942 is pointed into the nucleotide binding pocket; the guanidinium group of Arg-942 interacts with the α-oxygen of GDP and two fluorides of AlF4−, and the main chain oxygen of Arg-942 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain amide group of the RhoA catalytic residue Gln-63. Gln-63RhoA is thus stabilized and forms hydrogen bonds with a fluoride of AlF4− and a water molecule through its side chain (Fig. 2b). Through these conserved interactions, GTP is positioned in line with the water molecule, because the aluminum ion of the γ-phosphate analog AlF4− is located in line with the water molecule and the β-oxygen of GDP, with distances of 2.0 and 1.9 Å (Fig. 2b), respectively. In addition, the positively charged arginine finger of the ARAP3-RhoGAP neutralizes negative charge at the γ-phosphate, which makes the water molecule easier to conduct a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of GTP; thus the GTP hydrolysis rate of RhoA is accelerated. The RhoGAP domain of ARAP3 interacts with RhoA mainly through electrostatic interactions. Negatively charged GDP·AlF4− and negatively charged residues Glu-64 and Asp-65 of the switch II region and Asp-90 of the α3 helix of RhoA interact tightly with positively charged residues of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain (Arg-942 of the α2-α3 loop, Arg-949 of the α3 helix, and Arg-982 and Arg-985 of the α4 helix) through salt bridges (Fig. 2b). We can observe the electrostatic interactions more clearly from the electrostatic representation of the complexed structure (Fig. 2c); residues Glu-64, Asp-65, and Asp-90 and GDP·AlF4− forming the negatively charged surface of RhoA directly bind to the positively charged surface of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain formed by residues Arg-942, Arg-949, Arg-982, and Arg-985. In addition to the interactions shown above, there are several hydrogen bonds formed between the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain and RhoA: the main chain oxygen of residue Gly-945ARAP3 and the main chain nitrogen of residue Arg-947ARAP3 form hydrogen bonds with residue Asn-94RhoA (see Fig. 4b); the main chain nitrogen of residue Ala-948ARAP3 forms a hydrogen bond with residue Glu-97RhoA (see Fig. 4b); and the main chain oxygen of residue Leu-1057ARAP3 forms a hydrogen bond with residue Tyr-66RhoA. There are also water-mediated contacts between the main chain nitrogen of residue Gly-944ARAP3 and Gly-14RhoA and between the main chain oxygen of residue Gly-944ARAP3 and Asp-90RhoA. In addition to electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, hydrophobic interactions are also observed; residue Phe-972ARAP3 of the α3′-α4 loop and residue Pro-1061ARAP3 of the α8 helix make hydrophobic contacts with residue Met-134RhoA and residue Tyr-66RhoA in the switch II region. Based on the complexed structure, we made site-directed mutations in ARAP3-RhoGAP to verify the importance of residues for the interaction between the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain and RhoA. We used ITC experiments to measure the binding affinity between RhoA and the wild type or mutants of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain. The results indicated that substitution of residue Phe-972 in the RhoGAP domain by alanine reduced the binding affinity to a KD of 4.37 μm, approximately half of the binding ability of the wild type ARAP3-RhoGAP domain (Fig. 2d and Table 2). Moreover, a single mis-sense mutation of each of the residues Arg-949, Arg-982, or Arg-985 in the RhoGAP domain to glutamic acid was sufficient to abolish complex formation (Fig. 2d and Table 2). The GTPase assay results were consistent with the ITC findings. The GTP hydrolysis reaction rate, using 25 nm wild type ARAP3-RhoGAP domain and 35 μm RhoA-GTP, was 10-fold greater than that of the RhoA alone (Fig. 2e). A single point mutation of each of the residues R942A, R949A, R949E, R982E, and R985E in the RhoGAP domain dramatically reduced the GAP activity of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain under the same conditions (Fig. 2e). Mutants R982A and R985A still retained slight GAP activity so they could weakly accelerate the GTP hydrolysis reaction rate of RhoA by ∼3-fold (Fig. 2e). Intriguingly, mutant R949A also dramatically reduced the GAP activity of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain (Fig. 2e), indicating that Arg-949ARAP3 is important for the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain to perform its GAP activity. Indeed, Arg-949ARAP3 interacts tightly with Phe-972ARAP3 and Asp-975ARAP3 through cation-π and electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2f), thus stabilizing the RhoGAP structure. All of these results demonstrate that both the arginine finger and the residues responsible for binding to RhoA are crucial to maintain the GAP activity of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters of the wild type and mutants of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain to different small GTPases by ITC experimentsRhoGAPGTPases with GDP·MgFxΔHΔSKDNkcal/molcal/mol/KμmWild typeRhoA1.87 ± 0.0831.92.45 ± 0.610.74F972ARhoA4.23 ± 0.1937.74.37 ± 0.520.55R949ERhoANDR982ERhoANDR985ERhoANDWild typeCdc4210.33 ± 2.2154.559.88 ± 11.310.67Wild typeCdc42 (S88D)5.50 ± 0.2342.95.41 ± 0.950.73Wild typeRac1NDWild typeRac1 (A88D,A95E)14.13 ± 0.5069.818.87 ± 1.560.79 Open table in a new tab Although there are over 70 different RhoGAPs, only two other RhoGAPs in complex with RhoA in the transition state have been solved (Fig. 3, b and c): ARHGAP1, which is also called p50RhoGAP or Cdc42GAP (PDB codes 1TX4 and 1OW3), and ARHGAP20 (PDB code 3MSX). The sequence of the RhoGAP domain of ARAP3 shows identity with ARHGAP1 (26%) and ARHGAP20 (25%). The most remarkable difference was found at the interface involving the switch I region of RhoA; in the p50RhoGAP·RhoA complex residues Tyr-34RhoA, Pro-36RhoA, Val-38RhoA, and Phe-39RhoA make extensive hydrophobic contacts with RhoGAP of ARHGAP1 (24.Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. et al.Always look on the bright site of Rho: structural implications for a conserved intermolecular interface.EMBO Reports. 2004; 5: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas in the ARHGAP20·RhoA complex residues Tyr-34RhoA, Val-35RhoA, Pro-36RhoA, and Phe-39RhoA make extensive hydrophobic interactions with RhoGAP of ARHGAP20. However, we could not observe these hydrophobic interactions between RhoA and RhoGAP of ARAP3, because the switch I region in our structure is poorly ordered, and the electron density map of residues 28–40 is missing. The missing electron density in the switch I region of RhoA indicates that the switch I region may not be concerned with the ARAP3-RhoGAP binding. Another notable difference was found at the N terminus of the α9 helix. The α9 helix of ARAP3 RhoGAP is shorter than ARHGAP1 and ARHGAP20 (Fig. 3d), and the α8-α9 loop (residues 1067–1071) is poorly ordered, losing the hydrophobic interactions with residues Leu-69 and Leu-72 in the α2 helix of RhoA (24.Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. et al.Always look on the bright site of Rho: structural implications for a conserved intermolecular interface.EMBO Reports. 2004; 5: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, all three RhoGAP·RhoA complexes exhibit two interfaces in the same location. The first interface consists of the α3 helix of RhoGAP and the α3 helix of RhoA, and the second interface consists of the α4 helix of RhoGAP and the switch II region of RhoA. Residues in the first interface are less conserved than those in the second interface among ARAP3, ARHGAP1, and ARHGAP20 (Fig. 4a). There is a conserved alanine residue at the end of the α2-α3 loop of the RhoGAP domain (Fig. 4a), which interacts with Asn-94RhoA in ARHGAP1 and ARHGAP20 (Fig. 4b). However, in ARAP3, it is replaced by the Gly-945APAP3 (Fig. 4b). There is also a conserved arginine residue at the α3 helix (Fig. 4a), which interacts with Glu-97RhoA only in ARHGAP20 (Fig. 4b). In the first interface, ARHGAP1 only has interactions with Asn-94RhoA and Glu-97RhoA, whereas the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain has extra interactions with Asp-90RhoA through salt bridges, and ARHGAP20 has interactions with Asp-90RhoA, Glu-93RhoA, Asn-94RhoA, and Glu-97RhoA (Fig. 4b). In the α4 helix, there are two conserved residues, lysine and arginine (Fig. 4a). The conserved arginine in the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain (Arg-985) interacts with Asp-65RhoA, whereas in both ARHGAP1 and ARHGAP20, it interacts with both Glu-64RhoA and Asp-65RhoA (Fig. 4c). In ARHGAP1 and ARHGAP20, the conserved lysine interacts with Asp-65RhoA (Fig. 4c). In ARAP3, however, the conserved lysine is not on the interface and is replaced by Arg-982 that interacts tightly with Glu-64RhoA (Fig. 4c). All of the residues involved in interacting with the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain are conserved among RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, except for the negatively charged residues Asp-90 and Glu-97 in the α3 helix (Fig. 5a). In Cdc42, Ser-88 replaces Asp-90, whereas in Rac1, Ala-88 and Ala-95 replace Asp-90 and Glu-97, respectively. We speculated that residues Asp-90 and Glu-97 of RhoA confer the substrate specificity of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain over Cdc42 and Rac1. To test this hypothesis, we generated RhoA-like mutations in Cdc42 and Rac1 and tested the effects on binding by ITC and GTPase activity assays. The ITC results showed that the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain binds wild type Cdc42 and the RhoA-like Cdc42 mutant (S88D) with KD values of 59.88 and 5.41 μm, respectively (Fig. 5b and Table 2). The RhoA-like Cdc42 mutant (S88D) shows ∼11-fold stronger binding affinity than wild type Cdc42 to the RhoGAP domain of ARAP3. The ARAP3-RhoGAP domain shows very weak binding affinity to wild type Rac1 that could not be detected by ITC. Meanwhile, the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain binds the RhoA-like Rac1 mutant (A88D,A95E) with a KD of 18.87 μm (Fig. 5c and Table 2). Additionally, in GTPase activity experiments, the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain had greater efficiency in the presence of the RhoA-like Cdc42 or Rac1 mutants than with wild type Cdc42 and Rac1 (Fig. 5, d and e, Table 3). The best fit Km and Kcat/Km values of ARAP3-RhoGAP to RhoA-GTP examined by the 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurineriboside (MESG)/purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) system are 11.08 μm and 16.93 min−1 μm−1, respectively. The Km values of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain to Cdc42-GTP and Cdc42 (S88D)-GTP are ∼7.4- and 1.8-fold greater than that of RhoA-GTP, indicating that the binding affinity of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain for the RhoA-like mutation of Cdc42 with ∼4.2-fold higher than for wild type Cdc42 and ∼1.8-fold weaker affinity for RhoA during GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis reactions. The catalytic efficiency of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain with the RhoA-like Cdc42 mutant is ∼4.3-fold greater than that of wild type Cdc42 and is comparable with that of RhoA (only 1.5-fold weaker than that of RhoA). The kinetic parameters of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain to wild type Rac1-GTP was not determined because of the very low binding affinity. However, the Km and Kcat/Km values of ARAP3-RhoGAP to Rac1 (A88D,A95E)-GTP are 69.40 μm and 5.68 min−1 μm−1, indicating that the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain binding affinity and catalytic efficiency toward the RhoA-like Rac1-GTP mutant is only ∼6.2- and ∼3-fold weaker than that of RhoA-GTP, respectively. Taken together, the specific GAP activity of the ARAP3 RhoGAP domain to RhoA over Cdc42 and Rac1 may be conferred by the interaction with the negatively charged residues Asp-90 and Glu-97 of RhoA.TABLE 3Kinetic parameters of the ARAP3-RhoGAP domain to different small GTPasesVmaxKmKcatKcat/Kmμm/minμmmin−1min−1 μm−1RhoA3.75 ± 0.1011.08 ± 0.94187.52 ± 4.8616.93 ± 1.88Cdc4213.14 ± 0.4081.79 ± 4.58219.07 ± 6.742.68 ± 0.23Cdc42 (S88D)5.65 ± 0.1419.56 ± 1.55225.88 ± 5.5811.55 ± 1.20Rac1NDNDNDNDRac1 (A88D,A95E)11.84 ± 0.1669.40 ± 1.62394.50 ± 5.355.68 ± 0.21 Open table in a new tab ARAP3 w"

This study assessed the effect of a two-component intervention of case finding and subsequent care on these outcomes.In a cluster RCT we assessed whether education of family physicians (FPs; trial stage 1) resulted in more mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia diagnoses among older persons in whom FPs suspected cognitive decline and whether case finding by a practice nurse and the FP (trial stage 2) added to this number of diagnoses. In addition, we assessed mental health effects of case finding and subsequent care (trial stage 2). FPs of 15 primary care practices (PCPs = clusters) judged the cognitive status of all persons ≥ 65 years. The primary outcome, new MCI and dementia diagnoses by FPs after 12 months as indicated on a list, was assessed among all persons in whom FPs suspected cognitive impairment but without a formal diagnosis of dementia. The secondary outcome, mental health of patients and their relatives, was assessed among persons consenting to participate in trial stage 2. Trial stage 1 consisted of either intervention component 1: training FPs to diagnose MCI and dementia, or control: no training. Trial stage 2 consisted of either intervention component 2: case finding of MCI and dementia and care by a trained nurse and the FP, or control: care as usual.Seven PCPs were randomized to the intervention; eight to the control condition. MCI or dementia was diagnosed in 42.3% (138/326) of persons in the intervention, and in 30.5% (98/321) in the control group (estimated difference GEE: 10.8%, OR: 1.51, 95%-CI 0.60-3.76). Among patients and relatives who consented to stage 2 of the trial (n = 145; 25%), there were no differences in mental health between the intervention and control group.We found a non-significant increase in the number of new MCI diagnoses.

https://openalex.org/W2423783235,"The reconcilability of actions and beliefs in inter-country relationships, either in business or politics, is of vital importance as incorrect beliefs on foreigners’ behavior can have serious implications. We study a typical inter-country interaction by means of a controlled laboratory investment game experiment in Germany, Israel and Palestine involving 400 student participants in total. An investor has to take a risky decision in a foreign country that involves transferring money to an investee/allocator. We found a notable constellation of calibrated and un-calibrated beliefs. Within each country, transfer standards exist, which investees correctly anticipate within their country. However, across countries these standards differ. By attributing the standard of their own environment to the other countries investees are remarkably bad in predicting foreign investors’ behavior. The tendency to ignore this potential difference can be a source of misinterpreting motives in cross-country interaction. Foreigners might perceive behavior as unfavorable or favorable differentiation, even though—unknown to them—investors actually treat fellow-country people and foreigners alike."

Herein, we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial RNA polymerase (Rpo41) and its transcription factor (Mtf1) is an efficient primase that initiates DNA synthesis on ssDNA coated with the yeast mitochondrial ssDNA-binding protein, Rim1. Both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 can synthesize short and long RNAs on ssDNA template and prime DNA synthesis by the yeast mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1. However, the ssDNA-binding protein Rim1 severely inhibits the RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41, but not the Rpo41-Mtf1 complex, which continues to prime DNA synthesis efficiently in the presence of Rim1. We show that RNAs as short as 10–12 nt serve as primers for DNA synthesis. Characterization of the RNA-DNA products shows that Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 have slightly different priming specificity. However, both prefer to initiate with ATP from short priming sequences such as 3′-TCC, TTC, and TTT, and the consensus sequence is 3′-Pu(Py)2–3.

Both of these modes of replication can initiate leading strand DNA synthesis; however, the mechanism of lagging strand synthesis on the displaced ssDNA is not well understood. Lagging strand initiation would require priming on ssDNA covered with the single strand binding protein (SSB). It has been shown that the S. cerevisiae Rpo41 can transcribe on ssDNA (19.Sanchez-Sandoval E. Diaz-Quezada C. Velazquez G. Arroyo-Navarro L.F. Almanza-Martinez N. Trasviña-Arenas C.H.

Chang H.R. Yin Y.W. et al.Yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 determines the precision of promoter-directed initiation of RNA polymerase Rpo41.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0136879PubMed Google Scholar). However, Rpo41 associates with Mtf1 (21.Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. et al.Release of the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase specificity factor from transcription complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, it is important to determine whether the Rpo41-Mtf1 complex can synthesize RNA on ssDNA and more importantly prime DNA synthesis on ssDNA covered with SSB. Such a priming mechanism would also facilitate the restart of DNA synthesis from ssDNA after replication stalling. In this study, we investigate the RNA synthesis and priming activities of Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 on long and short ssDNA templates and determine whether the RNAs made by Rpo41 alone and Rpo41-Mtf1 can prime DNA synthesis by the yeast mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1 (ymtDNAP). In vivo, the ssDNA displaced by the replisome catalyzing leading strand synthesis is expected to be coated with the mt ssDNA-binding protein Rim1 (ymtSSB). Hence, we have compared the effects of ymtSSB on the activities of Rpo41-Mtf1 and Rpo41. Additionally, we use defined ssDNA template to determine the priming start sequences and the length of the minimal primer that can initiate DNA synthesis by the ymtDNAP. Overall, our findings indicate that the complex of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and transcription initiation factor is an efficient primase under physiologically relevant conditions. The RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 on ssDNA template was investigated using M13 ssDNA. The kinetics of RNA synthesis was measured in the presence of all rNTPs spiked with [α32P]ATP for RNA detection (Fig. 1A). The RNA products were quantified after separating free ATP from the RNA using thin layer chromatography. An example of the TLC image is shown as an inset in Fig. 1A. RNA synthesis is reported as the μm amount of total nucleotides incorporated into the RNA as a function of time (Fig. 1A). We find that both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 are efficient RNA polymerases on ssDNA. The overall kinetics of RNA synthesis by Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 are comparable; and although Rpo41 makes slightly higher amounts of RNA at the initial time points, RNA synthesis by Rpo41 alone saturates at the later time points, but RNA synthesis by Rpo41-Mtf1 continues linearly (Fig. 1A). We also noted that the amount of RNA made at longer times exceeded the amount of the provided template (10 nm M13 ssDNA circle corresponding to ∼65 μm nucleotides). This indicates that Rpo41-Mtf1 and Rpo41 are capable of catalyzing rolling circle RNA synthesis on circular M13 ssDNA template. To assess the size of the RNA products, we analyzed the reactions on polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gels. Previously, it was shown that the lengths of RNAs transcribed by Rpo41 on M13 ssDNA are between 25–100 nt (19.Sanchez-Sandoval E. Diaz-Quezada C. Velazquez G. Arroyo-Navarro L.F. Almanza-Martinez N. Trasviña-Arenas C.H. Brieba L.G. et al.Yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase primes mitochondrial DNA polymerase at origins of replication and promoter sequences.Mitochondrion. 2015; 24: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, we find that the dominant products synthesized by both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 are long RNA products; among which some migrated close to the 9 kb marker (in the Rpo41-Mtf1 reaction) and others remained closer to the wells (Fig. 1B). The RNA products running close to the 9 kb DNA marker could be the size of M13 template (∼7 kb) and result from a single round of rolling circle RNA synthesis (shown as asterisk mark in Fig. 1B). It was difficult to estimate the exact size of the RNA product due to the different migration of RNA and DNA marker on the polyacrylamide gel. The migration pattern of the long RNAs from rolling circle RNA synthesis did not change when the samples were treated with proteinase K and 1% SDS detergent (data not shown), which indicates that the long RNAs close to the wells are not RNA-protein complexes. The long RNAs were observed within 1 min of reaction time, which indicates that RNA initiation is the rate-limiting step and once initiated the elongation step is much faster; otherwise, we would have observed a progressive increase in RNA length with increasing reaction time. We also observed short RNAs from 10–20 nt in the reactions with Rpo41-Mtf1, and RNAs from 50 nt to 2 kb in the reactions with Rpo41 alone. Thus, our results indicate that Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 are both efficient RNA polymerases on ssDNA template and this activity makes both short and long RNA products. Next we investigated the kinetics of RNA synthesis on M13 ssDNA by Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 in the presence of the ymtDNAP (Mip1). We used both dNTPs and rNTPs nucleotide substrates but spiked the reactions with [α32P]ATP for RNA detection. The TLC quantitation shows that both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 make RNA in the presence of ymtDNAP with similar kinetics (Fig. 1C). However, the amount of RNA synthesized in the presence of ymtDNAP + dNTPs is about 40% lower as compared with RNA synthesis without ymtDNAP (compare Fig. 1, A and C). This is likely due to accompanying DNA synthesis by the ymtDNAP. Analysis of the nucleic acid products on the sequencing gel shows a similar pattern of long and short RNA products as observed in the absence of ymtDNAP, with some differences. There is a decrease in the amount of 10–20 nt and the single round RNA synthesis products in the Rpo41-Mtf1 reactions in the presence of ymtDNAP (Fig. 1D). Analysis on the reaction products on 1% native agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide shows that the long nucleic acid products are >23 kb in sizes (Fig. 1E). In summary, our results show that Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 can use ssDNA as a template for RNA synthesis, both in the presence and absence of the ymtDNAP. In contrast to reported studies (19.Sanchez-Sandoval E. Diaz-Quezada C. Velazquez G. Arroyo-Navarro L.F. Almanza-Martinez N. Trasviña-Arenas C.H. Brieba L.G. et al.Yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase primes mitochondrial DNA polymerase at origins of replication and promoter sequences.Mitochondrion. 2015; 24: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), our results show that RNA synthesis is not limited to short lengths, as both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 make very long RNA products, including products from rolling circle RNA synthesis. In vivo, the ssDNA displaced during leading strand synthesis is expected to be coated with the ssDNA binding protein, which in the yeast mitochondria is Rim1 (ymtSSB), a 13-kDa protein that binds ssDNA as a tetramer (22.Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. et al.A single-stranded DNA binding protein required for mitochondrial DNA replication in S. cerevisiae is homologous to E. coli SSB.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The ymtSSB is homologous to the Escherichia coli SSB, which binds 35–65 nt of ssDNA/tetramer (23.Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. et al.Two binding modes in Escherichia coli single strand binding protein-single stranded DNA complexes. Modulation by NaCl concentration.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this information, we calculated that between 1–2 μm of yeast SSB tetramer would be needed to cover the entire M13 ssDNA at 10 nm concentration. Hence, we used 0, 1, 4, and 8 μm tetramer ymtSSB to test its effect on the RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1, both in the presence and absence of ymtDNAP plus dNTPs. Both the TLC quantitation (Fig. 2A) and polyacrylamide/urea gel (Fig. 2B) show that ymtSSB severely inhibits the RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41. At 1 μm ymtSSB, there is about 80% inhibition, but there are no detectable RNAs at 4 and 8 μm ymtSSB (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the inhibition of Rpo41-Mtf1 is less severe and there are detectable amounts of RNA made even at 4 and 8 μm ymtSSB. Next, we checked the RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 in the presence of ymtDNAP plus dNTPs and at increasing ymtSSB concentrations. The RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41 in the presence of ymtDNAP remained severely inhibited as observed in the absence of ymtDNAP (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, the RNA synthesis activity of Rpo41-Mtf1 was restored to the levels observed in the absence of ymtSSB with ymtDNAP, particularly at 4 and 8 μm ymtSSB concentrations (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, our results indicate that Rpo41-Mtf1 acts as a better RNA polymerase as compared with Rpo41 alone on ssDNA template coated with ymtSSB. This could be because Rpo41-Mtf1 has a 4-fold higher affinity for ssDNA as compared with Rpo41 alone (Fig. 3), hence Rpo41-Mtf1 is able to better compete with ymtSSB for binding to the ssDNA and/or is a stronger motor and able to mobilize the ymtSSB whereas Rpo41 alone is unable to carry out these functions. To determine whether the RNAs made by Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 can be used for DNA synthesis by the ymtDNAP, we carried out reactions with a mixture of NTPs and dNTPs and spiked the reactions with [α32P]dGTP for DNA detection. The TLC quantitation shows robust DNA synthesis in reactions containing Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 (Fig. 4A). Control experiments showed no DNA synthesis without ymtDNAP and negligible synthesis with ymtDNAP alone (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the ymtDNAP is able to utilize the RNAs generated by Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 as primers to catalyze DNA synthesis on M13 ssDNA template. The polyacrylamide/urea gel shows that the RNA-DNA products are very long and run close to the wells (Fig. 4C). The agarose gel shows that the nucleic acid products are >23 kb in length (Fig. 4D). In the agarose gel analysis, we treated the nucleic acid products with a mixture of RNaseH and RNase1f and observed that the nucleic acid products running close to the wells disappeared suggesting that those are long RNA products. Interestingly, the sizes of >23 kb products did not change, which suggests that these are mostly DNA and since there is no change in length, these are primed by short RNAs. Next, we investigated the RNA-primed DNA synthesis reaction in the presence of ymtSSB. The DNA synthesis reactions were carried out in the presence of NTPs and dNTPs spiked with [α32P]dGTP at increasing concentrations of ymtSSB (0, 1, 4, and 8 μm tetramer). The ymtSSB at 1 μm stimulated the RNA-primed DNA synthesis reactions of Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 (Fig. 4, E and F). This stimulation is most likely due to increase in the processivity and strand-displacement activities of the DNAP in the presence of ymtSSB, as has been seen in case of human POLRMT and T7 DNAP with their SSB proteins (9.Wanrooij S. Fusté J.M. Farge G. Shi Y. Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. et al.Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase primes lagging-strand DNA synthesis in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, higher ymtSSB concentrations inhibited the RNA-primed DNA synthesis reactions of Rpo41 alone, but not the Rpo41-Mtf1 primed DNA synthesis reaction, which remained stimulated (Fig. 4, E and F). These results indicate that Rpo41-Mtf1 is a better RNA polymerase and a better primase on ymtSSB-coated ssDNA as compared to Rpo41. To determine if Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 have any preference for start sites for RNA synthesis on ssDNA, we used a nonspecific 62-nt ssDNA as the template (Fig. 5A). The short template allowed us to map the start sites from the precise lengths of the transcribed RNAs using high-resolution sequencing gels. Reactions were carried out with Rpo41 or Rpo41-Mtf1 in the presence of all NTPs spiked with either [α32P]ATP (Fig. 5B) or [γ32P]ATP (Fig. 5C). As a control and a marker, we used the yeast 15S rRNA double-stranded promoter DNA (sequence under “Experimental Procedures”) that makes a 31-nt runoff RNA. Rpo41 alone is not active on the promoter dsDNA (21.Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. et al.Release of the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase specificity factor from transcription complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Matsunaga M. Jang S.H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 5514-5522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but Rpo41-Mtf1 makes short abortive products and the expected 31-mer runoff product from the promoter dsDNA (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 1). In contrast to the dsDNA promoter, the ssDNA serves as the template for both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 for RNA synthesis (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 2 and 3). Additionally, the RNA products made by both enzymes are of defined lengths, which is an indication that transcription is initiated from specific sites on this nonspecific ssDNA template. If initiation were not sequence specific and randomly initiated on ssDNA, then we would have observed a ladder of RNA products and not the distinct products observed here. The transcription profile was almost indistinguishable when [γ32P]ATP or [α32P]ATP was used as the initiating nucleotide (compare lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5, B and C), which indicates that Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 prefer to initiate RNA synthesis on ssDNA using ATP as the initiating nucleotide, which is similar to the preference of initiating with ATP on dsDNA promoter substrates. There are two major long RNA products made on ssDNA template and several short RNA products between 9 and 18-nt in length (Fig. 5, B and C). Using molecular markers and the fact that RNA synthesis initiates with ATP (with [γ32P]ATP as spike), we estimate that the lengths of the long RNA products are ∼41-nt and ∼30-nt initiating from the indicated TCC and TTC sites (Fig. 5A). The 31-nt run-off transcription product from the dsDNA promoter substrate is a good marker (Fig. 5, B and C compare lanes 1 to lanes 2 and 3). Further characterization, as detailed below, indicated that the ∼30-nt and ∼41-nt products are runoff products, whereas the 9–18 nt are incomplete RNA products from polymerase stalling or RNA dissociation before reaching the run-off length. To map the start sites for RNA synthesis, we used mixtures of NTP and 3′-dNTP as nucleotide substrates. In the presence of ATP, GTP, CTP, and 3′-dUTP, RNA synthesis will terminate at the first A-templating base, and based on the sequence of our 62-nt template, this combination of nucleotides will produce run-off products 4-nt shorter in length from the indicated start sites (Fig. 5A). This was indeed the case. In the presence of 3′-dUTP, both the ∼30-nt and ∼41-nt products migrated faster on the gel, and appeared as single bands (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2, 3 and 4, 5). The latter result indicates that the multiple bands observed around the ∼30-nt RNA product in the absence of 3′-dUTP result from incomplete copying to the end of the template. Interestingly, in the presence of 3′-dUTP, there was no change in the profile of the 9–18 nt RNA products (compare lanes 3 and 5 in Fig. 5C), which indicates that these are not run-off RNA products but aborted or stalled RNA products. From the RNA lengths and knowing that RNA synthesis initiates from a T-templating base, we conclude that there are two major initiation sites on the 62-nt ssDNA template with the sequence TCC and TTC, as marked on the ssDNA template (Fig. 5A). The initiation specificity of Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 is slightly different. Both make almost equal amounts of the ∼41-nt RNA product from TCC but Rpo41-Mtf1 makes more of the ∼30-nt from TTC and more of the shorter 9–18 nt aborted or stalled RNA products (Fig. 5D). To further validate these start sites, we carried out walking experiments by using additional terminating nucleotides, 3′-dCTP and 3′-dGTP (Fig. 5C, lanes 6–9). With a mixture of ATP, GTP, UTP, and 3′-dCTP, we observed mainly an 8-nt RNA product with Rpo41 alone (lane 6) and 5-nt and 8-nt product (lane 7) with Rpo41-Mtf1, the expected length products from the proposed start site TTC and TCC, respectively. The intensity of the 8-nt is much higher than that of the 5-nt RNA, which indicates that TCC is a better initiation site for Rpo41-Mtf1 as compared with TTC, which is also consistent with the relative intensities of the 41-nt and 30-nt RNAs (Fig. 5D). With a mixture of ATP, CTP, UTP, and 3′-dGTP, we observed mainly 2-nt RNA (lanes 8 and 9). In summary, the walking experiments indicate that both Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 initiate transcription site-specifically from ssDNA, and in the context of this DNA sequence, the preferential initiation site is TCC followed by TTC. To test whether RNA synthesis by Rpo41 and Rpo41-Mtf1 support DNA synthesis, the reactions were carried out using [α32P]dATP to detect only the RNA-DNA products. The major RNA-primed DNA product in the Rpo41 reaction is the 41-nt product initiating with TCC (Fig. 6A, lane 1). On the other hand, there are three major RNA-primed DNA products of lengths ∼60-nt, 41-nt, and 30-nt in the Rpo41-Mtf1 reactions (Fig. 6A, lane 2), which we determine are from initiation sites CC, TTC, and TCC start sites, respectively (marked on the 62-nt ssDNA sequence). Next we carried out reactions in the presence of [α32P]ATP as the spike to detect both the RNA and RNA-DNA products (Fig. 6B). The RNA and RNA-DNA products of the same length appear as doublets: the faster migrating band (Fig. 6B, lane 2, marked with *) corresponds to the RNA-DNA product and the slower migrating bands are the RNAs. As expected, the doublets are not observed when we leave out dNTPs (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4). In addition to the above mentioned products (30-nt, 41-nt, 60-nt), we also observed a ∼16-nt band (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 3). The ∼16-nt appears to be a run-off RNA product from a downstream i"

The major feature is the C-repeat region, consisting of 35-42 amino acid repeat units that display high but not perfect identity. SV1 is a S. pyogenes vaccine candidate that incorporates five 14mer amino acid sequences (called J14i variants) from differing C-repeat units in a single recombinant construct. Here we show that the J14i variants chosen for inclusion in SV1 are the most common variants in a dataset of 176 unique M-proteins. Murine antibodies raised against SV1 were shown to bind to each of the J14i variants present in SV1, as well as variants not present in the vaccine. Antibodies raised to the individual J14i variants were also shown to bind to multiple but different combinations of J14i variants, supporting the underlying rationale for the design of SV1. A Lewis Rat Model of valvulitis was then used to assess the capacity of SV1 to induce deleterious immune response associated with rheumatic heart disease. In this model, both SV1 and the M5 positive control protein were immunogenic. Neither of these antibodies were cross-reactive with cardiac myosin or collagen. Splenic T cells from SV1/CFA and SV1/alum immunized rats did not proliferate in response to cardiac myosin or collagen. Subsequent histological examination of heart tissue showed that 4 of 5 mice from the M5/CFA group had valvulitis and inflammatory cell infiltration into valvular tissue, whereas mice immunised with SV1/CFA, SV1/alum showed no sign of valvulitis. These results suggest that SV1 is a safe vaccine candidate that will elicit antibodies that recognise the vast majority of circulating GAS M-types."

An insert situated proximal to the active site or ligand binding site frequently impacts protein function; however, the effect of distal indels on protein activity and/or stability are often not studied. In this paper, we have investigated a distal insert, which influences the function and stability of a unique DNA polymerase, called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). TdT (EC:2.7.7.31) is a monomeric 58 kDa protein belonging to family X of eukaryotic DNA polymerases and known for its role in V(D)J recombination as well as in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. Two murine isoforms of TdT, with a length difference of twenty residues and having different biochemical properties, have been studied. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures and interaction network analyses were performed on the short and long-length isoforms. We observed conformational changes in the regions distal to the insert position (thumb subdomain) in the longer isoform, which indirectly affects the activity and stability of the enzyme through a mediating loop (Loop1). A structural rationale could be provided to explain the reduced polymerization rate as well as increased thermosensitivity of the longer isoform caused by peripherally located length variations within a DNA polymerase. These observations increase our understanding of the roles of length variants in introducing functional diversity in protein families in general."

A thematic analysis approach was used.Different barriers and facilitators for referral were found for patients, GPs and physiotherapists on the individual level, but also in the interaction between stakeholders and their context. Individual perceptions such as knowledge and beliefs about manual therapy for neck pain either impeded or facilitated referral. Fear for complications associated with cervical manipulation was an important barrier for patients as well as GPs. For GPs and physiotherapists it was important whether they perceived it was part of their professional role to refer for manual therapy. Existing relations formed referral behavior, and the trust in a particular practitioner was a recurrent theme among GPs and physiotherapist as well as patients. The contextual factor availability of manual therapy played a role for all stakeholders.Barriers and facilitators were found especially in individual perceptions on manual therapy for neck pain (e.g. knowledge and beliefs), the interaction between stakeholders (e.g. collaboration and trust) and the organizational context. Implementation strategies that focus on these different aspects seem to be likely to optimize referral rates and the use of manual therapy in primary care management of neck pain."

We now show that the gene rearrangement linked to mouse Ppcd1 is a 3.9 Mbp chromosomal inversion flanked by 81 Kbp and 542 bp deletions. This recombination event leads to deletion of Csrp2bp Exons 8 through 11, Dzank1 Exons 20 and 21, and the pseudogene Znf133. In addition, we identified translocation of novel downstream sequences to positions adjacent to Csrp2bp Exon 7 and Dzank1 Exon 20. Twelve novel fusion transcripts involving Csrp2bp or Dzank1 linked to downstream sequences have been identified. Eight are expressed at detectable levels in PPCD1 but not wildtype eyes. Upregulation of two Csrp2bp fusion transcripts, as well as upregulation of the adjacent gene, Ovol2, was observed. Absence of the PPCD1 phenotype in animals haploinsufficient for Csrp2bp or both Csrp2bp and Dzank1 rules out haploinsufficiency of these genes as a cause of mouse PPCD1. Complementation experiments confirm that PPCD1 embryonic lethality is due to disruption of Csrp2bp expression. The ocular expression pattern of Csrp2bp is consistent with a role for this protein in corneal development and pathogenesis of PPCD1."

We present the first empirical study to address edge effects on the population level of a widespread galling herbivore in a temperate deciduous forest. By analyzing edge effects on abundance and trophic interactions of beech gall midge (Mikiola fagi Htg.), we found 30% higher gall abundance in the edge habitat as well as lower mortality rates due to decreased top-down control, especially by parasitoids. Two GLM models with similar explanatory power (58%) identified habitat specific traits (such as canopy closure and altitude) and parasitism as the best predictors of gall abundance. Further analyses revealed a crucial influence of light exposure (46%) on top-down control by the parasitoid complex. Guided by a conceptual framework synthesizing the key factors driving gall density, we conclude that forest edge proliferation of M. fagi is due to a complex interplay of abiotic changes and trophic control mechanisms. Most prominently, it is caused by the microclimatic regime in forest edges, acting alone or in synergistic concert with top-down pressure by parasitoids. Contrary to the prevailing notion that specialists are edge-sensitive, this turns M. fagi into a winner species in fragmented temperate beech forests. In view of the increasing proportion of edge habitats and the documented benefits from edge microclimate, we call for investigations exploring the pest status of this galling insect and the modulators of its biological control."

https://openalex.org/W2426805056,"The “hyperdynamic” chromatin state, which characterizes embryonic stem cell (ESC) epigenetic state, facilitates a rapid and efficient reaction to external and internal cues. These cues lead to the activation of key master regulators that drive the cells into their developmental fate. Thus, ESCs hold great promise as a source of diverse differentiated cell types for cell therapy and regenerative medicine.

Two major bottlenecks to realizing such potential are allogenic immune rejection of ESC-derived cells and ethical concerns related to the use of fetal tissues. In 2006, two Japanese scientists, Kazutoshi Takahashi and Shinya Yamanaka, made progress toward addressing both of these hurdles when they showed that introducing four transcription factors—Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc (OSKM)—can reprogram fibroblasts derived from adult mice into functional embryonic stem-like cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). (Resetting the epigenome of a somatic cell to a pluripotent state has already been achieved with somatic cell nuclear transfer, but this type of transformation is mediated by the actions of a large number of genes expressed within the host oocyte.)

The notion that as few as four factors are sufficient to reset the epigenome of a cell has inspired scientists to attempt to convert different adult cells into other somatic cell types by avoiding the pluripotent state, using a specific combination of key master regulators. Several subsets of cell types—including hematopoietic cells, various neuronal cells, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, embryonic Sertoli cells, endothelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells—have been generated from somatic cells by using the direct conversion approach pioneered by Takahashi and Yamanaka.

Unfortunately, the majority of directly converted cells are not stable and represent mostly incomplete reprogramming states, and the vast majority of iPSCs exhibit poor potential for incorporation into all developing tissues in mice ([ 1 ][1]). This suggests that the current prevailing reprogramming methods are not ideal and must be improved before we consider using these cells in the clinic.

During my postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Rudolf Jaenisch at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), I explored the reprogramming process at the single-cell level. I analyzed the expression of 48 genes in single mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at various stages during the reprogramming process ([ 2 ][3]). Analysis of early stages revealed considerable variation in gene expression between cells, in contrast to late stages, which exhibited more homogeneous expression between reprogrammable cells. We found that cells that expressed Esrrb, Utf1, Lin28 , and Dppa2 were more likely to become iPSCs than were those that expressed previously suggested reprogramming markers such as Fbxo15, Fgf4 , and Oct4. We also noticed that stochastic gene expression early in reprogramming is followed by a late deterministic phase, in which Sox2 is the upstream factor in the gene expression network. Exploiting this network allowed us to reprogram MEFs to iPSCs in the absence of “Yamanaka” key pluripotency genes and Nanog, a transcription factor that had previously been considered crucial for reprogramming, demonstrating for the first time that the core pluripotency circuitry can be activated via different entries.

As a postdoctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT, he used single-cell technologies and bioinformatic approaches to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs. Currently the leader of his own laboratory at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Buganim uses somatic cell conversion models to identify and investigate the elements that facilitate safe and complete nuclear reprogramming.

In a follow-up study, we reasoned that a combination of key factors derived from the later phase of reprogramming would convert cells in a more controlled way and therefore might uniformly yield iPSCs of high quality. We chose Sall4, Esrrb , and Lin28 —key downstream players during the late reprogramming phase—and Nanog for our initial experiment. We observed that ectopic expression of Sall4, Nanog, Esrrb , and Lin28 (SNEL) in MEFs generated iPSCs of superior quality to iPSCs derived from OSKM ([ 3 ][4]). SNEL-iPSCs contributed to highgrade chimeras and produced “all-iPSC” mice by means of 4n complementation at a significantly higher frequency than did OSKM-derived iPSCs. These results demonstrate that bioinformatic models derived from in vitro single-cell data can aid in improving the quality of iPSCs.

In January 2014, I became an independent faculty member at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My first goal was to determine whether a high degree of nuclear reprogramming can be achieved even in cells undergoing conversion to nonpluripotent cells. Indeed, in a paper that we published in Cell Stem Cell ([ 4 ][5]), we showed for the first time that a high nuclear resetting state can be attained in cells undergoing conversion to induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs) and that this complete nuclear reprogramming process is independent from the pluripotent state. The iTSCs resemble blastocyst-derived trophoblast stem cells in all examined parameters, including transcription, methylation, epigenome, and function. As such, we believe that these cells hold great promise for modeling and treating placental dysfunction diseases and for mitigating recurrent miscarriage.

Overall, the main goal of my laboratory is to identify and investigate the components that regulate cell plasticity and epigenome resetting. To that end, we study several conversion models in order to identify common and more global elements that facilitate nuclear reprogramming and improve the quality of converted cells. We investigate both nearly complete conversion models, such as conversion of fibroblasts into iPSCs and iTSCs, together with less stable, partial-reprogramming models, such as the conversion of somatic cells into induced embryonic Sertoli-like cells, induced neurons, and induced hepatocytes. To capture rare reprogrammable cells, we have established triple/quadruple fluorescent knock-in reporter systems, using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, to mark the cells that are destined to become converted. We have applied cutting-edge single-cell technologies such as RNA-sequencing, Fluidigm-BioMark, and single-molecule-mRNA–fluorescence in situ hybridization to probe the transcriptome of multiple individual reprogrammable cells from the various conversion models. To understand how different key master regulators define a new epigenome and reshape the chromatin, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing on various transcription factors and histone marks from different models. These approaches allow us to dissect the most global and fundamental events that facilitate complete nuclear reprogramming and will ultimately improve the quality of iPSCs and converted cells available for clinical use.

https://openalex.org/W2429470558,"The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) pitched its recent court battle with Apple as one of national security versus privacy. But in the conflict over public use of cryptography, decades in the making, this latest battle is actually a collision over differing notions of security in a digital age ( 1 ). Law enforcement contends that there should be no “warrant-proof” spaces: When there is a valid court order, agents should be able to access communications devices and systems. Technologists ( 2 ) and many former government security officials ( 3 – 5 ) see this differently: Weakening smartphones' security provided by encrypted communications is counterproductive to long-term security. The ability to secure data on smartphones is crucial not just for the private information present on phones but also because of the ability of smartphones to securely authenticate users to online accounts. Rather than rely on out-of-date approaches to law enforcement, the FBI must develop 21st-century investigative capability."

We speculate that this protein splicing activity arose to post-translationally repair proteins that had been inactivated by deleterious insertions or extensions. The chloroplast transcriptome is highly dependent on RNA processing, because pervasive transcription has to be balanced with activities that discard nonfunctional or deleterious transcripts (1Germain A.

Among the most prominent of these activities are endo- and exoribonucleases that exert RNA quality control and create mature 5′ and 3′ termini (2Stern D.B. Goldschmidt-Clermont M.

We previously examined the mechanism of 3′ end maturation for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast atpB mRNA, whose 3′ terminus is defined by a stem-loop structure. The atpB 3′-extended precursor undergoes two-step maturation, in which an endonuclease cleaves at a specific site called the endonuclease cleavage site (ECS) 2The abbreviations used are: ECSendonuclease cleavage sitePABPpolyadenylate-binding proteinRRMRNA recognition motifCCTconserved C-terminal domainNCLnon-conserved linkerTPtransit peptideCTDC-terminal deletionNIPSnon-intein protein splicing. ∼10 nucleotides (nt) distal to the stem-loop, followed by exonucleolytic trimming (5Stern D.B.

Of particular interest was that the sequence downstream of the ECS was extremely rapidly degraded both in vivo and in vitro, even in ectopic contexts (6Hicks A. Drager R.G. Higgs D.C.

During the course of purification, we identified an endoribonuclease activity that appeared to cleave the RNA substrate near the ECS. As shown below, the endoribonuclease we isolated turned out to be RB47, a member of the polyadenylate-binding protein family (PABP). RB47 had been discovered previously in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts through affinity purification of proteins binding to the psbA mRNA 5′-UTR (7Danon A.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on a variety of correlative experiments, RB47 was proposed to regulate psbA translation in response to light (9Danon A.

Danon A. et al.The chloroplast protein disulfide isomerase RB60 reacts with a regulatory disulfide of the RNA-binding protein RB47.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RB47, for which the isolated cDNA encoded a protein of 68 kDa (80 kDa by SDS-PAGE), could be converted during in vitro chloroplast import to the 47 kDa size found in chloroplasts (7Danon A. Mayfield S.P. et al.Light regulated translational activators: identification of chloroplast gene specific mRNA binding proteins.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a difference far in excess of what can be accounted for by removal of the short N-terminal transit peptide (8Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. et al.A poly(A) binding protein functions in the chloroplast as a message-specific translation factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This size difference was proposed to be the result of a proteolytic cleavage, which removed ∼30 kDa from the C terminus. Here we demonstrate that this conversion in fact results from splicing following the removal of an internal RB47 precursor sequence, the non-conserved linker. This splicing requires both light and chloroplast factors, unlike the spontaneous splicing of inteins (13Paulus H. et al.Protein splicing and related forms of protein autoprocessing.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and additionally unmasks the otherwise-cryptic endonuclease activity of RB47. We suggest that protein splicing of this type is an underappreciated generator of protein diversity, both within and outside of organelles. An in vitro assay using total chloroplast soluble proteins had previously been established for an endoribonuclease activity cleaving at the atpB 3′-UTR ECS (5Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. et al.3′ end maturation of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast atpB mRNA is a two-step process.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify the protein(s) involved we used sequential chromatography steps (Fig. 1A) and assayed column fractions for endoribonuclease activity using the previously described RNA substrate (Fig. 1B). A final gel filtration column showed that the peak of activity eluted at ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1C). The activity generated an endoribonuclease product consistent with cleavage near the ECS (band 1), as well as several smaller products (bands 2 and 3). A size marker similar in size to band 1 was generated by processing the same substrate with a spinach chloroplast extract, which trims exonucleolytically to the ECS (Sp), and a no protein control was included (No). Subsequent 5′- and 3′-end labeling showed that band 1 in fact represents the downstream endonuclease cleavage product that is normally rapidly degraded in total soluble chloroplast protein extracts, suggesting that the endoribonuclease had been separated from that activity and furthermore, that the purified protein was cleaving near, but not at the ECS (see below). To identify candidate proteins for the activity peaking near 50 kDa, the peak gel filtration fractions were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis and bands in the 50-kDa size range, which were the dominant species in these fractions, were excised and submitted for analysis by mass spectroscopy (MS). Surprisingly, we did not identify any peptides from known chloroplast endoribonucleases such as CSP41 and RNase J (4Stoppel R. Meurer J. et al.The cutting crew - ribonucleases are key players in the control of plastid gene expression.J. Exp. Bot. 2012; 63: 1663-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Instead, MS analysis identified numerous peptides from RB47, a previously-described PABP (see above). PABPs are found in all eukaryotes and are localized to both the nucleus and cytosol (15Lemay J.F. Lemieux C. St-André O. Bachand F. et al.Crossing the borders: poly(A)-binding proteins working on both sides of the fence.RNA Biol. 2010; 7: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RB47 shares the typical cytosolic PABP structure, which includes four repeats of a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the N terminus, a conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, and a proline-rich non-conserved linker (NCL) between the RRMs and the CCT. The function of this linker is unknown, although virus-mediated proteolytic cleavage within the linker of cytosolic PABPs may lead to inhibition of host mRNA translation (16Smith R.W. Gray N.K. et al.Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP): a common viral target.Biochem. J. 2010; 426: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, only peptides from the RRM and CCT domains were found in our MS analysis, with the only significant stretches of predicted amino acid sequence not detected being the chloroplast transit peptide (TP), as expected, and the NCL. To exclude that the NCL was not removed at the level of RNA splicing, we examined the collective results of RNA deep sequencing available for Chlamydomonas (Fig. 1E). This analysis showed that while there is evidence for alternative splicing, namely partial inclusion of the intron preceding the NCL, the NCL itself is expressed in cDNA at an equivalent level to all other exonic sequences. Therefore, it is highly improbable that any significant amount of RB47 mRNA lacks sequences encoding the NCL. These results, together with previously published results showing conversion of full-length RB47 to a 47-kDa form under in vitro chloroplast import conditions (8Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. et al.A poly(A) binding protein functions in the chloroplast as a message-specific translation factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggested that the NCL domain is removed upon translocation into the chloroplast, and that the CCT domain is then somehow joined to the RRM domains. Because no PABP has been previously shown to exhibit endoribonuclease activity, we wished to ascertain if recombinant RB47 possessed this capacity. To do so, we tested several versions of recombinant RB47, as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 2A. These included a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion to the full-length protein predicted from cDNA (GST-RB47), an internal deletion lacking most of the NCL (missing sequence underlined in Fig. 2A) and approximating the version we had sequenced (GST-RB47 ID), and a truncated version (with the truncation beginning with the start of the underlined sequence) lacking the NCL and CCT (GST-RB47-CTD). A GST-CCT fusion (with the CCT sequence in italics in Fig. 2A) that served as a source of antigen for production of RB47 antibodies was also tested. The recombinant proteins were purified along with a GST-only control (Fig. 2B), and the specificity of the CCT antibody was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). We next tested the recombinant RB47 proteins described above and diagrammed in Fig. 3A for endoribonuclease activity (Fig. 3B), along with spinach chloroplast extract and no protein controls as described for Fig. 1C (lanes 1 and 2). The results showed that while neither GST alone nor GST fused to full-length RB47 had detectable activity (lanes 4 and 5), the GST-RB47 proteins with internal (ID) or C-terminal (CTD) deletions had robust activity (lanes 6 and 7). The reaction products recapitulated the pattern seen when assaying the gel filtration peak fractions (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the CCT alone (lane 8) did not display activity. Both 5′- and 3′-end labeled substrates were used to identify the RNA cleavage products produced by recombinant RB47 CTD (Fig. 3C). This analysis showed that of the two major products, band 1 represented the downstream (3′) part and band 2 the upstream (5′) part of the full-length substrate, with band 3 apparently containing neither end. Size markers were produced from uniformly-labeled substrate by hybridizing specific DNA oligonucleotides to the RNA and then cleaving at those sites (at the 5′ and 3′ base(s) of the stem loop structure) with RNase H. Comparison of these size markers with bands 1, 2, and 3 produced by RB47 CTD (Fig. 3D) demonstrates that the two CTD cleavage sites are within the stem-loop structure (Fig. 3E). Thus, we conclude that RB47 (47 kDa) possesses endoribonuclease activity that cleaves near the atpB ECS in vitro, is dependent on the presence of one or more of the RRMs, does not require the CCT, and is inhibited in some way by the NCL. As mentioned above, in vitro-synthesized RB47 was reported (8Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. et al.A poly(A) binding protein functions in the chloroplast as a message-specific translation factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to undergo proteolytic cleavage upon import into pea chloroplasts, which removed an as-yet unidentified ∼30-kDa segment of the protein. Our analysis of RB47 purified from chloroplasts suggested that along with short the N-terminal transit peptide, most or all of the internal ∼30-kDa NCL was removed by an unusual processing event that allowed retention of an apparently contiguous stretch comprising the RRM and CCT domains. To facilitate additional studies, an in vitro processing assay was developed relying on homologous (Chlamydomonas) chloroplast extracts. Initially, chloroplasts were lysed in buffer containing detergent and the soluble fraction was incubated with recombinant GST-RB47 (i.e. the full-length protein) bound to a glutathione-Sepharose column. After incubation, the beads were thoroughly washed to avoid contamination by proteins from the chloroplast extract, and the recombinant substrate and products were released from beads by heating, then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Results from processing of GST-RB47 and controls were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4A), and immunoblotting with the antibody raised against the CCT domain (Fig. 4B). The stained gel revealed that the amount of input GST-RB47 (∼100 kDa, lane 1) was greatly reduced following incubation with chloroplast lysate (lane 3), concomitant with the appearance of smaller bands consistent with protein cleavage activity. These bands were not present when the lysate was incubated with the beads in the absence of recombinant RB47 (lane 2). When treated with thrombin, which cleaves between GST and the RB47 sequences, still smaller species were seen (lane 4). To find which of these species contained the CCT, immunoblot analysis was used. We found that three of these bands seen in lane 3 (marked with asterisks) contained both the GST moiety, since they were bound to the glutathione-Sepharose column, and the CCT, since they were identified with the antibody. The three GST-RB47-derived species include an SDS-resistant form (top band), which barely entered the gel, residual unprocessed GST-RB47 (middle band, which co-migrated with the input; lane 1), and a 75-kDa species, a size consistent with the removal of the linker domain. To verify that the 75-kDa species was not in some way derived by removal of the GST moiety, thrombin cleavage was used (lanes 4). Based on immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B), the major species accumulating following incubation with the chloroplast extract was ∼47 kDa, consistent with the size of RB47 sequenced from chloroplasts. The predominance of this band also suggested that the SDS-resistant complex primarily contained processed RB47, that became amenable to gel migration following treatment with thrombin. An additional control lane was included in Fig. 4B (lane 5) to rule out the possibility that the 47-kDa band seen in Fig. 4B, lane 4, might represent RB47 from the chloroplast lysate which had bound to the recombinant GST-RB47. This lane was loaded with whole lysate corresponding to the amount of lysate used for the processing reactions ultimately loaded into lanes 3 and 4. No chloroplast RB47 was detected in the amount of lysate used and therefore the bands detected in lanes 3 and 4 were derived from the recombinant GST-RB47. Adherence to a GST column, presence of the thrombin cleavage site, and recognition by the CCT antibody collectively supported the notion that the 47 kDa species had undergone internal processing. To ascertain the protein sequences directly, we subjected the precursor GST-RB47 and the processed product (arrowheads in Fig. 4A) to peptide mapping by trypsin/formic acid digestion and MS. As shown earlier, RB47 purified from chloroplasts had MS coverage in most regions excepting the transit peptide (TP) and NCL (Fig. 4C, top). On the other hand, unprocessed GST-RB47 had reasonable coverage of both those regions and the NCL, suggesting that the NCL is not inherently refractory to MS. Using the same method, however, we were not able to identify peptide sequences from the linker region in the processed GST-RB47 species that migrated at 47 kDa (Fig. 4C, bottom). The precise extents of sequenced peptides are detailed in Fig. 5. Taken together, we tentatively conclude that factors in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast extract had excised the the majority of the NCL while splicing the RRMs to the CCT. While the above evidence is strongly suggestive of protein splicing, we wished to demonstrate formally that the RRM and CCT domains had been joined together as a linear sequence of amino acids, rather than as a covalent cross-linking between amino acid side chains or by some other mechanism. The locations of the splice site(s) could not be precisely determined by peptide mapping alone, because intermittent portions of the NCL could be not be detected by sequencing recombinant unprocessed RB47 (Fig. 5, middle). To begin to narrow down the borders of sequence excision, histidine tags were inserted near the likely upstream (Sph) and downstream (Bsp) splice sites within the NCL, as estimated by processed protein migration and MS results (Fig. 6A). Our strategy was to use the presence or absence of the tags in spliced RB47 as an indication of on which side of the tag splicing had occurred. Because our original GST-RB47 fusion possessed a His tag at the extreme C-terminal end (Fig. 5, bottom two sequences), this tag had to be removed. This generated a version of GST-RB47 lacking the C-terminal tag (RB47-His), into which the two tags within the NCL could be inserted (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this, and in all subsequent experiments, the growth conditions were altered from the continuous light used for cells from which chloroplast extracts were prepared for use in the experiments in Fig. 4. Instead, chloroplasts were isolated two hours into the light phase of a light/dark growth cycle (16 h light/8 h dark). This change did not affect splicing per se, but did seem to affect the nature of the SDS-resistant complex seen in Fig. 4 (lane 3). Rather than a single, slowly migrating complex, which barely entered the gel, the SDS-resistant form manifested as a series of complexes ranging in migration from slightly larger than the unspliced form of RB47, to barely entering the gel (Fig. 6B, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12). Furthermore, these complexes seemed more resistant to digestion with thrombin than the complex shown in Fig. 4. The nature of the SDS-resistant complex has not been determined, but may be explained by a cross-linking between RB47 and a component(s) of the putative splicing complex (see below). The three His-tagged precursor proteins were subjected to processing in the chloroplast lysate as described above, and an immunoblot analysis with the anti-RB47 CCT antibody is shown in Fig. 6B. Lanes 1, 5, and 9 show the intact precursors, from which GST could be removed by thrombin digestion (lanes 2, 6, 10). When incubated in the chloroplast lysate a series of bands including an SDS-resistant species was observed in all cases (lanes 3, 7, 11). When each of these samples was treated with thrombin, a 47 kDa species was observed (lanes 4, 8, and 12). This suggested that neither removal of the original C-terminal His tag, nor the insertion of tags into the NCL, affected in vitro splicing. We next used the anti-His tag antibody to determine whether the tag had been retained upon protein splicing (Fig. 6C). Of the three precursor proteins, only the two with internal His tags were recognized without or with thrombin cleavage (compare lanes 1 and 2 with 5/9 and 6/10, respectively). We found that the signal from the internally tagged proteins was completely lost after incubation with chloroplast lysate, with or without thrombin cleavage (lanes 7, 8, 11, 12). This suggested that the 47 kDa species was created by excising sequences within or upstream of the Sph His tag, and within or downstream of the Bsp His tag, and that the higher molecular weight bands in the splicing reactions all were species lacking the NCL, most likely aggregates with different degrees of resistance to SDS denaturation. We had anticipated detecting the excised NCL following splicing, if the His tags were found to be within the region removed during the reaction, as was indeed the case. We could rule out that the spliced NCL was trapped within an SDS-resistant complex, because anti-His tag immunoblots showed no signal whatsoever following splicing. We therefore considered it likely that the excised NCL, or at least those portions containing His tags, had been degraded. Since the chloroplast lysate used in the reactions consisted was a crude soluble protein preparation, it was likely to contain numerous proteases and exopeptidases. The inability to detect the extreme C-terminal peptides from either chloroplast RB47 or recombinant RB47 exposed to chloroplast lysate (Figs. 4C and 5) is consistent with exopeptidase activity. To address this issue, and to obtain more highly purified preparations of splicing activity, additional fractionation steps were carried out as outlined in Fig. 7A. Briefly, chloroplasts were initially lysed without detergent and separated into soluble (S) and insoluble (membrane-associated) fractions. The membrane-associated fraction was further extracted with detergent and tested for activity. The activity was primarily found associated with the detergent extracted fraction, which was then applied to a series of three columns for further purification. In each case, the activity was found in the flow-through fraction. Splicing assays for the membrane-associated, detergent-extracted fraction and the final column flow-through (DE) are shown in Fig. 7, B and C, using the Bsp internal His-tagged substrate. Independently, we had found that RB47 splicing activity was resistant to heating to 85 °C for 20 min, and we used this treatment to obtain additional purity by precipitating other proteins that were insoluble under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 7B, splicing carried out by heat-treated proteins (H) was indistinguishable from that catalyzed by the membrane-extracted (ME) or DEAE Sepharose (DE) column-purified fractions, in terms of production of the 47-kDa product. On the other hand, when reaction products were probed with the anti-His tag antibody, a strong signal remained when the heat-treated proteins were used, unlike the wholesale loss of signal from the His tag when less purified fractions were used (Fig. 7C; ME, DE). Unfortunately, the signal remained trapped within SDS-resistant complexes under standard denaturation conditions, precluding meaningful size analysis. This supports our hypothesis that loss of the His tag signal in cruder fractions was due to the activity of a heat-labile protease/peptidase(s). Based on the experiments in FIGURE 6., FIGURE 7., the splice junctions are located N-terminal to the Sph tag and C-terminal to the Bsp tag. To identify the splice junctions precisely, we used the Bsp-His substrate for splicing with the most purified fraction, namely the heated lysate. After splicing and thrombin digestion, the 47-kDa product was excised from a Coomassie-stained gel and subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectroscopy. The peptides identified were queried using a custom database comprising all the possible complete and partial tryptic peptides that could be generated by splicing between the two junction regions identified using the His tags. The resulting positives were then screened against a human peptide database to eliminate false positives. Two tryptic peptides remained after these steps, as shown in Fig. 8. Peptide 123 was P-QQK and peptide 243 PPNPMAVTS-QK, where the dash indicates the inferred splice junction. The initial proline of each tryptic peptide must be preceded by a basic residue (K/R) since trypsin cleaves C-terminal to these residues (although rarely when K/R is followed by a proline). The (K/R) proline combination of both peptides must lie upstream of the SphI site in which the His tag, when inserted, is excised during splicing. There is only one combination, (R) proline, between that site and sequences present, based on MS, in the spliced product (Fig. 8, first black arrowhead). The QQK of peptide 123 is unambiguous and is found shortly downstream of the His tag that was present in the substrate used for splicing. Peptide 243 appears to be derived from splicing immediately upstream of the SphI site, with the downstream junction one amino acid displaced from the site defined by peptide 123. We conclude that the RRM and CCT domains of the RB47 Bsp-His substrate are joined as a linear peptide sequence in at least these two configurations (see “Discussion”). All previous reports documenting RB47 purified from chloroplasts described the 47-kDa form, but no evidence for the longer, unspliced form predicted by cDNA (8Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A.

Many of the analyzed fractions had been highly purified, or were assayed by UV-crosslinking rather than immunoblotting, which might have led to failure to detect the unspliced form. Another possibility was that splicing occurs rapidly and quantitatively during or immediately after import of RB47 from the cytosol, where it is synthesized, leading to a very low steady-state level of the unspliced form. To explore whether unspliced RB47 is present in chloroplasts, we examined isolated chloroplasts. Furthermore, as RB47 was posited to be a light-regulated translation factor (7Danon A.
