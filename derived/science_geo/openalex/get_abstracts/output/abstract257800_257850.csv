Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time."
https://openalex.org/W2152103620,"The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is the main limitation for automotive applications. We demonstrated that the Pt 3 Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt 3 Ni(111) surface has an unusual electronic structure ( d -band center position) and arrangement of surface atoms in the near-surface region. Under operating conditions relevant to fuel cells, its near-surface layer exhibits a highly structured compositional oscillation in the outermost and third layers, which are Pt-rich, and in the second atomic layer, which is Ni-rich. The weak interaction between the Pt surface atoms and nonreactive oxygenated species increases the number of active sites for O 2 adsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2030667580,"We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This behavior was observed under the oxidizing conditions of the O 2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. There were insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over the course of cycling, in contrast to sizable losses observed with the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential."
https://openalex.org/W1966073503,"Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tr cells), the development of which is critically dependent on X-linked transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3), prevent self-destructive immune responses1. Despite its important role, molecular and functional features conferred by Foxp3 to Tr precursor cells remain unknown. It has been suggested that Foxp3 expression is required for both survival of Tr precursors as well as their inability to produce interleukin (IL)-2 and independently proliferate after T-cell-receptor engagement, raising the possibility that such ‘anergy’ and Tr suppressive capacity are intimately linked2,3,4. Here we show, by dissociating Foxp3-dependent features from those induced by the signals preceding and promoting its expression in mice, that the latter signals include several functional and transcriptional hallmarks of Tr cells. Although its function is required for Tr cell suppressor activity, Foxp3 to a large extent amplifies and fixes pre-established molecular features of Tr cells, including anergy and dependence on paracrine IL-2. Furthermore, Foxp3 solidifies Tr cell lineage stability through modification of cell surface and signalling molecules, resulting in adaptation to the signals required to induce and maintain Tr cells. This adaptation includes Foxp3-dependent repression of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B, affecting genes responsible for Tr cell homeostasis."

Repeats and transposable elements comprise about two-thirds of the ∼160-megabase genome, reflecting a recent massive expansion of genetic material. This expansion, in conjunction with the shaping of metabolic pathways that likely transpired through lateral gene transfer from bacteria, and amplification of specific gene families implicated in pathogenesis and phagocytosis of host proteins may exemplify adaptations of the parasite during its transition to a urogenital environment. The genome sequence predicts previously unknown functions for the hydrogenosome, which support a common evolutionary origin of this unusual organelle with mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2038282326,"A major goal of systems biology is to predict the function of biological networks. Although network topologies have been successfully determined in many cases, the quantitative parameters governing these networks generally have not. Measuring affinities of molecular interactions in high-throughput format remains problematic, especially for transient and low-affinity interactions. We describe a high-throughput microfluidic platform that measures such properties on the basis of mechanical trapping of molecular interactions. With this platform we characterized DNA binding energy landscapes for four eukaryotic transcription factors; these landscapes were used to test basic assumptions about transcription factor binding and to predict their in vivo function."

In this work, we demonstrate a fundamental role of the SM protein: to act as a stimulatory subunit of its cognate SNARE fusion machinery. In a reconstituted system, mammalian SNARE pairs assemble between bilayers to drive a basal fusion reaction. Munc18-1/nSec1, a synaptic SM protein required for neurotransmitter release, strongly accelerates this reaction through direct contact with both t- and v-SNAREs.

SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins comprise the core fusion machinery in which cognate vesicle-associated (v-) and target membrane-associated (t-) SNAREs assemble into SNAREpins to bring two membranes into close apposition and fuse (Hu et al., 2003Hu C.

Each fusion event must satisfy two fundamental physical requirements: (1) fusion must be fast enough or of high enough probability to meet the physiological requirements of that trafficking step, and (2) fusion must be specific such that vesicles release their contents after encountering the correct target membrane. As such, there is considerable interest in uncovering regulatory factors that might modulate one or the other of these inherent properties of SNARE proteins (Jahn et al., 2003Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Membrane fusion.Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family of proteins may serve one or both of these functions. First isolated in genetic screens in yeast and C. elegans (Brenner, 1974Brenner S.

Vesicle trafficking: pleasure and pain from SM genes.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). SM proteins directly interact with SNAREs, yet the details of this interaction appear to differ dramatically across pathways or organisms such that binding to SNARE proteins in different systems may require “closed” syntaxins, syntaxin N-terminal peptides, or assembled SNARE complexes. The mechanistic consequences of these interactions are uncertain, though one interesting possibility has emerged from studies on yeast exocytic SNAREs: yeast Sec1p can bind to exocytic t-SNAREs and increase the rate of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in a liposome assay (Scott et al., 2004Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. Sec1p directly stimulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in vitro.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whether this could constitute one component of a general principle for SM protein action is unknown. Mechanistic generalizations are complicated by the fact that the Sec1p-SNARE interaction does not involve two key binding modes observed in other SM-SNARE pairs—namely the syntaxin N-terminal peptide binding and the closed syntaxin interaction (Toonen et al., 2005Toonen R.F. de Vries K.J.

Here, we investigate how SM proteins regulate SNARE-dependent membrane fusion by using synaptic vesicle fusion as a model taking advantage of the large amount of genetic and physiological data that are already available for synaptic exocytosis (Brunger, 2006Brunger A.T.

Fusion of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, which serves as the brain's major form of cell-cell communication, is catalyzed by three SNARE proteins: syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (t-SNAREs) and VAMP2/synaptobrevin (v-SNARE) (Sollner et al., 1993Sollner T.

Munc18-1, a neuron-specific SM protein, is required for neuronal/exocytic membrane fusion, as demonstrated in a variety of organisms including nematodes (unc-18), flies (ROP), and mice (Munc18-1) (Harrison et al., 1994Harrison S.D.

A significant body of biochemistry provides a possible explanation for such a negative role: Munc18-1 binds to and locks monomeric syntaxin 1 in a closed conformation that prevents formation of the synaptic SNARE complex (closed mode of binding) (Dulubova et al., 1999Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

Arachidonic acid allows SNARE complex formation in the presence of Munc18.Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While this neuron-specific binding mode of Munc18-1 likely plays important roles in synaptic physiology, it is not conserved among SM proteins of other trafficking pathways. Thus, how Munc18-1 and other SM proteins may positively regulate membrane fusion remains a critical outstanding question in synaptic and cellular biology. The complexity of the cellular environment precludes delineating the molecular mechanism of Munc18-1 in intact cells. To this end, we utilize a defined fusion system (Weber et al., 1998Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. SNAREpins: minimal machinery for membrane fusion.Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar), in which SNAREs are reconstituted into liposomes at physiologically relevant surface densities (Takamori et al., 2006Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Gronborg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brugger B. Ringler P. et al.Molecular anatomy of a trafficking organelle.Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar) and in which regulatory proteins can be added or altered individually in the absence of other proteins that are naturally present. Fusion of lipid bilayers results from SNARE complexes formed between v- and t-SNARE liposomes and is monitored by lipid mixing by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Recombinant Munc18-1 protein was expressed in E. coli and directly added to liposomes reconstituted with synaptic/exocytic SNAREs (syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2) (Figure 1A). When t- and v-liposomes were mixed in the presence of Munc18-1 at the start of the fusion assay, Munc18-1 had little effect on the fusion kinetics, suggesting that it does not affect the initial assembly of trans-SNARE complexes (Figure 1B). We next considered whether Munc18-1 might act upon a transient, partially assembled SNARE intermediate as has been observed with other regulatory factors. For example, complexin binds to trans-SNARE complexes to clamp membrane fusion at a late stage of SNARE assembly (Giraudo et al., 2006Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. A clamping mechanism involved in SNARE-dependent exocytosis.Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Preincubation of liposomes at 4°C allows otherwise transient intermediate SNARE assemblies to accumulate, which is required for complexin to bind and exert its inhibitory role (Schaub et al., 2006Schaub J.R. Lu X. Doneske B. Shin Y.K. McNew J.A. Hemifusion arrest by complexin is relieved by Ca(2+)-synaptotagmin I.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We found that preincubation of the liposomes indeed led to SNARE complex formation and vesicle clustering (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). When t- and v-SNARE liposomes were preincubated at 4°C for 3 hr prior to elevating the temperature to 37°C, Munc18-1 strongly stimulated the initial rate of fusion (Figure 1B). Essentially no fusion occurred during the 3 hr preincubation period (Figure 1B). The maximum stimulation (∼6-fold) was reached with 4 μM Munc18-1, similar to the concentration of t-SNARE proteins present on the liposomes (Figure 1D), suggesting a stoichiometric interaction between Munc18-1 and the SNAREpin. Interestingly, synaptic transmission in the fly exhibits a similar Rop/Munc18-1 dose dependence (Wu et al., 1998Wu M.N. Littleton J.T. Bhat M.A. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. ROP, the Drosophila Sec1 homolog, interacts with syntaxin and regulates neurotransmitter release in a dosage-dependent manner.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fusion was completely blocked by coincubation with the inhibitory cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 (cdv2) (Figure 1B), which prevents trans-SNARE assembly (Weber et al., 1998Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. SNAREpins: minimal machinery for membrane fusion.Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Thus, Munc18-1 acts by facilitating the SNARE-mediated fusion pathway rather than by causing fusion via an alternative mechanism. The requirement for vesicle preincubation suggests that Munc18-1 specifically acts on a transient, partially assembled intermediate of the SNARE complex and promotes the progression of the fusion pathway. Indeed, preincubation of Munc18-1 with either t- or v-SNARE liposomes alone resulted in little activation (Figure 1C). The robust stimulation of fusion by Munc18-1 suggests that binding of Munc18-1 to the SNARE intermediate was efficient. However, even after 4°C preincubation, a certain fraction of SNAREs remains unpaired (Weber et al., 1998Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. SNAREpins: minimal machinery for membrane fusion.Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B) and drives a basal fusion reaction that is not activated by Munc18-1, thus confounding the quantitative analysis of the stimulatory activity of Munc18-1. We next selectively blocked those unpaired SNAREs by adding inhibitory cdv2 at the same time the temperature was shifted to 37°C (Figures 2A–2C). As a result, the stimulatory effect of Munc18-1 on SNARE-catalyzed membrane fusion was dramatically amplified, with Munc18-1 increasing the initial rate of membrane fusion by more than 20-fold (Figure 2B). Within 20 min, Munc18-1 allowed nearly 40% of v-liposomes to complete one round of fusion. In contrast, basal fusion (fusion without Munc18-1) was indistinguishable from background levels (where SNAREs were all inactivated by inhibitory cdv2). This dramatic stimulatory effect is also supported by the coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) results demonstrating that Munc18-1 significantly promotes the formation of cdv2-resistant SNAREpins (Figure S1B). This strong dependence of membrane fusion on Munc18-1 agrees well with the dramatic reduction of neuronal vesicle fusion observed in Munc18-1 null animals (Harrison et al., 1994Harrison S.D.

ROP, the Drosophila Sec1 homolog, interacts with syntaxin and regulates neurotransmitter release in a dosage-dependent manner.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate that Munc18-1 constitutes a stimulatory subunit of the SNARE complex and strongly accelerates an otherwise slow fusion reaction. We next examined whether the stimulatory activity of Munc18-1 is specific to the SNAREs mediating neuronal exocytosis. Within the late secretory and endocytic pathways, individual t- or v-SNAREs can pair with multiple other SNAREs to allow a certain level of crosstalk. This targeting flexibility is recapitulated in liposome reconstitution experiments, where, for example, the yeast plasma membrane t-SNARE Sso1p/Sec9p can fuse efficiently with proteoliposomes carrying Snc1p, Snc2p, Nyv1p, or Sec22p and the mammalian endosomal t-SNARE syntaxin 13/syntaxin 6/vti1A fuses equally well with VAMP2, VAMP4, and VAMP8 (Brandhorst et al., 2006Brandhorst D. Zwilling D. Rizzoli S.O. Lippert U. Lang T. Jahn R. Homotypic fusion of early endosomes: SNAREs do not determine fusion specificity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Compartmental specificity of cellular membrane fusion encoded in SNARE proteins.Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To explore the intrinsic specificity of the neuronal t-SNARE, we mixed syntaxin 1/SNAP-25 liposomes with liposomes bearing v-SNAREs involved in the constitutive exocytic (VAMP3/cellubrevin), the early endosomal (EE) (VAMP4), the lysosomal/late-endosomal (LE) (VAMP7 and VAMP8/endobrevin), or the yeast exocytic/endocytic (Snc2p) pathways. Fusion was observed in all cases (Figure 3A). Fusion with VAMP7 was less efficient than with other v-SNAREs (Figure 3A), perhaps due to the presence of an N-terminal inhibitory longin domain (Pryor et al., 2004Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Lindsay M.R. Gray S.R. Richardson S.C. Stewart A. James D.E. Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Combinatorial SNARE complexes with VAMP7 or VAMP8 define different late endocytic fusion events.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We then extended our study to nonneuronal t-SNAREs. We found that liposomes reconstituted with lysosomal/LE t-SNAREs—syntaxin 7, Vti1b, and mTlg1/syntaxin 8—could fuse with neuronal/exocytic VAMP2 liposomes to a degree comparable to fusion with its cognate VAMP8 liposomes (Figure 3B, left). Similarly, liposomes reconstituted with constitutive/nonneuronal exocytic t-SNAREs syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 could fuse equally well with VAMP2 and VAMP8 liposomes (Figure 3B, right). Thus, every endocytic/exocytic SNARE pair tested here was able to mediate liposome fusion at a comparable (slow) rate. Next we examined how Munc18-1 affects the fusion reactions catalyzed by these cognate and noncognate t- and v-SNARE pairs. Strikingly, of all the tested SNARE combinations, only the cognate neuronal/exocytic SNARE complexes (syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2/VAMP3) were strongly activated by Munc18-1. The ability of VAMP3 to partially support Munc18-1 activation agrees well with the finding that VAMP3 can partially compensate for the deletion of VAMP2 in calcium-triggered exocytosis (Bhattacharya et al., 2002Bhattacharya S.

Bruns D. v-SNAREs control exocytosis of vesicles from priming to fusion.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For all other SNARE combinations, Munc18-1 was essentially without effect (Figures 3A and 3B, top). When the fusion reactions were driven solely by preassembled SNARE complexes (Figure 2A), only the neuronal/exocytic SNARE pairs (syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2/3) elicited appreciable fusion in the presence of Munc18-1, while membrane fusion mediated by other SNARE pairs was essentially eliminated (Figures 3A and 3B, bottom, and Figure 3C). Thus, Munc18-1 selectively activates the cognate neuronal/exocytic SNARE complex. Interestingly, among those fusion reactions not activated by Munc18-1, two were catalyzed by physiologically cognate SNARE pairs involved in lysosomal/LE fusion (syntaxin 7, Vti1b, mTlg1, and VAMP8) or constitutive/nonneuronal exocytosis (syntaxin 4, SNAP-23, and VAMP2) (Antonin et al., 2000Antonin W.

The inability of Munc18-1 to stimulate fusion by these SNARE pairs is consistent with the compartment-specific activity of SM proteins observed in genetic studies (Verhage et al., 2000Verhage M.

How can Munc18-1 selectively activate fusion by the cognate SNARE pair? The simplest possibility is that Munc18-1 simultaneously binds to both t- and v-SNARE proteins. This is also consistent with our finding that Munc18-1 acts on assembled SNARE complexes, yet little is known about the binding of SM proteins to v-SNAREs. We introduced point mutations into VAMP2 and examined if any of these mutations affect the activation of fusion by Munc18-1 without affecting basal fusion in the absence of Munc18-1. Four pairs of VAMP2 residues were chosen based on two criteria: (1) they are conserved in VAMP3, a v-SNARE that can also be activated by Munc18-1, and (2) they are distributed between the helical bundle-forming layer residues such that they may be exposed on the surface of SNAREs to interact with regulatory proteins such as Munc18-1 (Figure 4A). These residues were mutated into corresponding sequences in VAMP8, a v-SNARE that does not support Munc18-1 stimulation (Figure 4A). We found that the double mutations located adjacent to the −3 and 0 layers of the VAMP2 SNARE domain (R47T/V48Q or D57G/Q58E) had little effect on Munc18-1 stimulation (Figure 4B). In contrast, in double mutations located adjacent to the +1 and +5 layers of the SNARE motif (S61D/E62H or S75E/Q76H), the stimulation of membrane fusion by Munc18-1 was largely abolished (Figure 4B), while basal fusion was unaffected. Thus Munc18-1 functionally interacts with membrane-proximal sequences of the VAMP2 SNARE domain, which could be expected—due to their location—to influence the rate of fusion. Interestingly, mutation of a three-residue motif (S75/E78/T79) within this region has previously been shown to reduce calcium-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells (Sorensen et al., 2002Sorensen J.B. Matti U. Wei S.H. Nehring R.B. Voets T. Ashery U. Binz T. Neher E. Rettig J. The SNARE protein SNAP-25 is linked to fast calcium triggering of exocytosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We next generated the same triple mutant that had been tested in vivo (S75A/E78A/T79A) and found that the mutations markedly decreased Munc18-1-stimulated fusion (Figure 4B). Again, the SNARE-mediated basal membrane fusion was unaffected. Thus, these loss-of-function VAMP2 mutations selectively disrupt the functional interaction between Munc18-1 and SNAREs without affecting the catalytic activities of the core SNARE fusion machinery (Figure 4B). In addition to the SNARE domain, VAMP2 has a short proline-rich N-terminal region required for optimal calcium-triggered neuronal exocytosis (Borisovska et al., 2005Borisovska M. Zhao Y. Tsytsyura Y. Glyvuk N. Takamori S. Matti U. Rettig J. Sudhof T. Bruns D. v-SNAREs control exocytosis of vesicles from priming to fusion.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We found that deletion of this region (aa 1–28) had no effect on the basal SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, but the stimulation by Munc18-1 was decreased by about half (Figure 4B), comparable to the reduction of calcium-evoked exocytosis in vivo (Borisovska et al., 2005Borisovska M. Zhao Y. Tsytsyura Y. Glyvuk N. Takamori S. Matti U. Rettig J. Sudhof T. Bruns D. v-SNAREs control exocytosis of vesicles from priming to fusion.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus Munc18-1 discriminates cognate SNAREpins via interactions involving both the SNARE motif and the N-terminal regulatory domain of the v-SNAREs (Figure 4C). The effect of mutation or deletion of these sequences in our in vitro assay correlates well with established consequences of the same mutations on in vivo calcium-triggered exocytosis (Figure 4D). We next asked whether the conserved Habc domain of syntaxin 1 might play a role in Munc18-1 function. A thrombin-cleavage site was previously introduced into syntaxin 1 between the Habc domain and the core motif (Parlati et al., 1999Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Rapid and efficient fusion of phospholipid vesicles by the alpha-helical core of a SNARE complex in the absence of an N-terminal regulatory domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We found that this thrombin-cleavable syntaxin 1 could be stimulated by Munc18-1 to a similar extent as WT syntaxin (Figure 5A). However, when the Habc domain was removed by thrombin proteolysis (Figure S2), the stimulatory activity of Munc18-1 was completely abolished. As published previously (Parlati et al., 1999Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Rapid and efficient fusion of phospholipid vesicles by the alpha-helical core of a SNARE complex in the absence of an N-terminal regulatory domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To circumvent the BBB, we investigated a novel brain-targeting gene vector based on the nanoscopic high-branching dendrimer, polyamidoamine (PAMAM), in vitro and in vivo. Transferrin (Tf) was selected as a brain-targeting ligand conjugated to PAMAM via bifunctional polyethyleneglycol (PEG), yielding PAMAM-PEG-Tf. UV and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to evaluate the synthesis of vectors. The characteristics and biodistribution of gene vectors were evaluated by fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and a radiolabeling method. The transfection efficiency of vector/DNA complexes in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy and determination of luciferase activity. The potency of vector/DNA complexes was evaluated by using frozen sections and measuring tissue luciferase activity in Balb/c mice after i.v. administration. UV and NMR results demonstrated the successful synthesis of PAMAM-PEG-Tf. This vector showed a concentration-dependent manner in cellular uptake study and a 2.25-fold brain uptake compared with PAMAM and PAMAM-PEG in vivo. Transfection efficiency of PAMAM-PEG-Tf/DNA complex was much higher than PAMAM/DNA and PAMAM-PEG/DNA complexes in BCECs. Results of tissue expression experiments indicated the widespread expression of an exogenous gene in mouse brain after i.v. administration. With a PAMAM/DNA weight ratio of 10:1, the brain gene expression of the PAMAM-PEG-Tf/DNA complex was approximately 2-fold higher than that of the PAMAM/DNA and PAMAM-PEG/DNA complexes. These results suggested that PAMAM-PEG-Tf can be exploited as a potential nonviral gene vector targeting to brain via noninvasive administration."

A novel lineage of TH cells that is regulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been identified recently as promoting tissue inflammation. These inflammatory TH (THi) cells, also called TH17 or THIL-17, produce IL-17 and IL-17F, two highly homologous cytokines that have genes located in the same chromosomal region. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques, we have demonstrated that similar to the regulation in TH1 and TH2 cell lineages, polarization of THi cells was accompanied by selective chromatin remodeling events. Histone H3 acetylation and Lys-4 tri-methylation were specifically associated with IL-17 and IL-17F gene promoters in THi lineage.

Upon activation, naive TH cells differentiate into effector cells that have been historically classified into two lineages, TH1 and TH2, based on their cytokine secretion and immune regulatory function (1Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (6863) Google Scholar, 2Dong C. Flavell R.A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). TH1 cells secret IFN-γ and regulate cellular immunity, whereas TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and mediate humoral responses. IL-17-producing T helper cells have been recently identified as a distinct inflammatory TH (THi) cell lineage (3Harrington L.E. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Turner H. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Weaver C.T.

Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Similar to TH1 and TH2 lineage differentiation, THi cell development is mediated by selective cytokine signals. It was shown that early induction of THi cells in vitro is initiated by TGFβ and IL-6 in antigen receptor-stimulated naive TH cells (7Veldhoen M. Hocking R.J. Atkins C.J. Locksley R.M. Stockinger B. Immunity. 2006; 24: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar, 8Bettelli E. Carrier Y. Gao W. Korn T. Strom T.B. Oukka M. Weiner H.L. Kuchroo V.K. Nature. 2006; 441: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (5591) Google Scholar). At the transcriptional level, the differentiation of THi lineage induced by cytokines requires an orphan nuclear receptor, RORγt, that is selectively expressed in THi cells (9Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R. Cell. 2006; 126: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). RORγt induces the transcription of the genes encoding IL-17 and the related cytokine IL-17F in TH cells and is required for their expression in response to IL-6 and TGFβ. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that epigenetic regulation is another important mechanism of TH cell differentiation. Epigenetic changes mediated by covalent histone modification have been observed in a number of models of TH cells differentiation and provide a mechanism whereby cytokine gene transcriptions are stable and heritable in a polarized cell lineage. Various studies have shown that both IL-4/IL-5/IL-13/Rad50 and IFN-γ cytokine gene loci in both gene promoters and conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) undergo extensive chromatin remodeling when naive TH cells are differentiated into TH1 and TH2 cells (10Lee G.R. Kim S.T. Spilianakis C.G. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2006; 24: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Because THi differentiation is still poorly understood, we thus have examined the possible role of chromatin remodeling in mediating selective IL-17 and IL-17F gene expression by differentiated THi cells. We show here that under THi-polarizing conditions, histone H3 at the promoter regions of both IL-17 and IL-17F genes becomes hyperacetylated and tri-methylated at Lys-4. The initiation of histone acetylation at an early stage of TH activation is greatly promoted by the combination of TGFβ and IL-6. Moreover, we also found widespread acetylation of histone H3 associated with several CNS elements in the IL-17-IL-17F locus in polarized THi cells. This study provides a foundation for the further understanding of gene regulation associated with THi differentiation. TH Differentiation—Naive TH cells, isolated from OT-II TcR transgenic mice by AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) selection of CD4+ T cells following the manufacturer’s instruction, were cultured as described previously (11Chung Y. Yang X. Chang S.H. Ma L. Tian Q. Dong C. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) at a ratio of 1:1 with irradiated B6 splenic antigen-presenting cells depleted of T cells along with 10 μg/ml chicken ovalbumin (OVA) peptide (amino acids 323–339; ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR). Under THi condition, cells were incubated in the presence of 5 ng/ml TGFβ, 10 ng/ml IL-6, 10 ng/ml IL-23, 10 ng/ml IL-1β, 10 ng/ml TNFα, 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4 (11B11), and 10 μg/ml anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2). Under TH1 condition, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-12, 10 ng/ml IFN-γ, and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4. Under TH2 condition, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-4 and 10 μg/ml anti-IFN-γ. The medium was changed when necessary, but the concentrations of cytokines and antibodies were maintained. Differentiated cells were analyzed 5 days after activation. ChIP Assay—ChIP assays were carried out as described (12Soutoglou E. Talianidis I. Science. 2002; 295: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).

RT-PCR—Fluorescence-activated cell-sorted CD4+CD62LhiCD44lo naive TH cells were activated with plate-bound αCD3/αCD28 Abs (5 μg/ml each) in the presence or absence of TGFβ and/or IL-6 for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was generated with an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) and, for real-time PCR, was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) in the iCycler sequence detection system (Bio-Rad) based on expression of the reference gene (Actb, encoding β-actin). The primers used were: IL-17, 5′-CTCCAGAAGGCCCTCAGACTAC-3′ and 5′-GGGTCTTCATTGCGGTGG-3′; IL-17F, 5′-CCCATGGGATTACAACATCACTC-3′ and 5′-CACTGGGCCTCAGCGATC-3′; β-actin, 5′-GACGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG-3′ and 5′-AGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGCC-3′. Visualization Tool for Alignment (VISTA) Analysis—Sequence comparison of the IL-17-IL-17F gene locus in human, dog, and mouse was performed using Web-based software available at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory genome Web site. IL-17 and IL-17F sequences were obtained from the Ensembl Genome Web site. THi Differentiation Is Accompanied by Selective Chromatin Changes within the Cytokine Gene Promoters—To determine whether epigenetic changes occur during THi cell development, we differentiated OT-II cells toward TH1, TH2, and THi lineages. 5 days later, differentiated cells were harvested, and a ChIP assay was performed using antibodies against acetylated H3 tails or tri-methylated Lys-4 of H3. Consistent with the literature (10Lee G.R. Kim S.T. Spilianakis C.G. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2006; 24: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), in TH1 cells, histone H3 in the IFN-γ but not IL-4 gene promoter region was hyperacetylated (Fig. 1A). Conversely, in TH2 cells, histone H3 associated with the IL-4 gene promoter was highly acetylated, and at the IFN-γ gene promoter it exhibited very low levels of acetylation (Fig. 1A). In both TH1 and TH2 cells, IL-17 and IL-17F promoter regions were hypoacetylated in histone H3 (Fig. 1A), consistent with their lack of expression in these cells, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism in silencing these genes in TH1 and TH2 subsets. However, as a result of THi lineage differentiation, histone H3 acetylation at the IL-17 and IL-17F gene promoters was greatly increased (Fig. 1A), in keeping with the ability of THi cells to produce significant amounts of IL-17 and IL-17F cytokines. Unlike the IL-17 and IL-17F loci, histone H3 within the IL-4 and IFN-γ gene promoter regions was hypoacetylated in THi cells. We also examined the tri-methylation at Lys-4 in H3 (K4me3), another form of histone modification associated with actively transcribed chromatin structure. As shown at Fig. 1B, H3K4me3 exhibited a pattern identical to that of H3 acetylation associated with TH cytokine gene promoters in polarized TH subsets, suggesting that the regulation of these two histone modifications during TH cells differentiation might be similar and possibly involve the same regulatory mechanisms. Thus, our results indicate that THi cell development is accompanied by epigenetic changes at both IL-17 and IL-17F gene promoters. This suggests that similar to other T helper cell lineages, epigenetic modification is an integral part of THi cell differentiation. Cytokine Induction of Chromatin Remodeling at the IL-17-IL-17F Gene Promoters—Although recent data indicate the essential function of TGFβ and IL-6 in THi differentiation (7Veldhoen M. Hocking R.J. Atkins C.J. Locksley R.M. Stockinger B. Immunity. 2006; 24: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar, 8Bettelli E. Carrier Y. Gao W. Korn T. Strom T.B. Oukka M. Weiner H.L. Kuchroo V.K. Nature. 2006; 441: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (5591) Google Scholar), the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. We thus examined the induction of IL-17 and IL-17F gene transcription in naive TH cells upon plate-bound αCD3 and αCD28 stimulation in the presence of various cytokines. Treatment with IL-6 resulted in significant increase of both IL-17 and IL-17F gene transcripts 2 days after activation, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR, whereas TGFβ alone had no effect (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the combination of IL-6 and TGFβ led to an even more potent induction of IL-17 and IL-17F mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), which indicates a synergistic function of the two cytokines in IL-17 and IL-17F gene transcription. Next, to assess whether the induction of IL-17 and IL-17F gene transcription is associated with chromatin remodeling, we examined histone H3 acetylation levels in naive TH cells upon various treatments. Consistent with the above observations, H3 hyperacetylation at the IL-17 and IL-17F gene promoters was triggered by the combination of IL-6 and TGFβ 48 h after activation (Fig. 2B). Therefore, it is likely that at the early stage of TH cells activation, IL-6 and TGFβ together control the accessibility of the IL-17-IL-17F gene locus to allow the binding of transcription factors and promote the further polarization of T cells. Lineage-specific Histone H3 Hyperacetylation at Multiple CNS—The genes encoding IL-17 and IL-17F cytokines are located on mouse chromosome 1 flanked by the non-cytokine genes MCM3 and PKHD1 (Fig. 3A). To further characterize the epigenetic changes associated with THi cell differentiation, we performed comparative genomic analysis to identify CNS. Using the on-line-based mVISTA alignment program, we compared DNA sequences of the IL-17-IL-17F loci among mouse, dog, and human. Regions containing fragments longer than 100 bp, with at least 75% homology between paired sequences, were identified as CNS. We found eight CNS in this region (Fig. 3A), which may represent potential regulatory elements. Previous studies have demonstrated that histone acetylation is often colocalized with CNS (13Roh T.Y. Cuddapah S. Zhao K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To evaluate the function of these CNS, we performed a ChIP assay using naive or differentiated TH1, TH2, and THi cells. Naive CD4 T cells exhibited merely background levels of H3 acetylation at all of CNS sites (Fig. 3B). Following THi differentiation, most of the CNS analyzed exhibited lineage-specific hyperacetylation of histone H3. Although the CNS-5 site remained acetylated in all types of polarized T helper cells, we did not detect significant levels of acetylated histone H3 in TH1 or TH2 cells at seven of eight CNS sites. The nonconserved region between CNS-1 and CNS-2, chosen as a negative control, exhibited no association with acetylated histone H3 in all cell samples (data not shown). These results suggest that the majority of CNS located within this locus undergo association with hyperacetylated H3 during THi cell development. Therefore, the chromatin remodeling appears to be spread though the entire locus, providing accessibility of the IL-17/IL-17F gene promoter regions and other regulatory elements. Our data from the current study demonstrate that similar to other TH subsets, the process of pro-inflammatory T cell differentiation is tightly associated with stable epigenetic modifications at THi-specific cytokine locus and possibly results in long-range coordinated chromatin remodeling. Activation of IL-17 and IL-17F genes by cytokine signals appears to be functionally correlated with histone H3 hyperacetylation. Moreover, we also found widespread H3 acetylation associated with most CNS in the IL-17-IL-17F locus. These observations not only support THi as a distinct cellular lineage but also provide the basis for the further identification and characterization of putative regulatory elements involved in the regulation of THi cytokine gene expression and the selective transcription factors that target these sites. We thank the members of the Dong laboratory for their help."
https://openalex.org/W2009715778,The Sfh protein is encoded by self-transmissible plasmids involved in human typhoid and is closely related to the global regulator H-NS. We have found that Sfh provides a stealth function that allows the plasmids to be transmitted to new bacterial hosts with minimal effects on their fitness. Introducing the plasmid without the sfh gene imposes a mild H-NS – phenotype and a severe loss of fitness due to titration of the cellular pool of H-NS by the A+T-rich plasmid. This stealth strategy seems to be used widely to aid horizontal DNA transmission and has important implications for bacterial evolution.
https://openalex.org/W2041678148,"Environmental sequencing has revealed unimagined diversity among eukaryotic picoplankton. A distinct picoplanktonic algal group, initially detected from 18 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, was hybridized with rRNA λ-targeted (rRNA-targeted) probes, detected by tyramide signal amplification–fluorescent in situ hybridization, and showed an organelle-like body with orange fluorescence indicative of phycobilins. Using this fluorescence signal, cells were sorted by flow cytometry and probed. Hybridized cells contained a 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole–stained organelle resembling a plastid with a nucleomorph. This suggests that they may be secondary endosymbiotic algae. Pending the isolation of living cells and their formal description, these algae have been termed picobiliphytes."

In the absence of cultivation data, we have taken a proteomic approach based on the metagenome sequence to study the metabolism of this peculiar microorganism in detail. As one result, we found that three major sulfide oxidation proteins constitute ∼12% of the total cytosolic proteome, which highlights the essential role of these enzymes for the symbiont's energy metabolism. Unexpectedly, the symbiont uses the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle in addition to the previously identified Calvin cycle for CO 2 fixation."
https://openalex.org/W2050377041,"The inflammation-associated cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) can contribute to tumor growth and resistance to therapy by the activation of survival mechanisms. In several human cancers, IL-6-activated survival signaling involves the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) factors or protein kinase cascades. microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulators of gene expression that are altered in expression in many cancers. However, the effect of inflammatory cytokines on miRNA expression and the role of miRNA in modulating IL-6-mediated cell survival are unknown.

IL-6 has been implicated in tumor growth in many of these tumors, and elevated IL-6 expression has been associated with poor outcomes and resistance to chemotherapy (1Frassanito M.A. Cusmai A. Iodice G. Dammacco F. Blood. 2001; 97: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Experimentally, growth of prostate cancer and cholangiocarcinoma xenografts in athymic mice has been shown to be increased by enforced expression of IL-6 by activation of cell survival signaling (2Meng F. Yamagiwa Y. Ueno Y. Patel T. J. Hepatol. 2006; 44: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Hodge D.R. Hurt E.M. Farrar W.L. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2502-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which IL-6 promotes cell survival in cancers are of considerable interest because they may be therapeutically targeted. IL-6-activated survival signaling has been shown to involve the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) factors or various protein kinase cascades (4Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 5Darnell J.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 595-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although constitutive activation of Stat has been described in many cancers, the precise mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. Cholangiocarcinomas are highly resistant to chemotherapy. However, inhibition of IL-6-dependent pathways such as the Jak-Stat pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or the p38 MAPK pathways can enhance chemotherapy-induced cell death. Thus, aberrant IL-6-dependent survival signaling may contribute to the refractoriness of cholangiocarcinoma to most chemotherapeutic agents. We sought to understand the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in IL-6-mediated tumor cell survival. miRNAs are endogenous regulators of gene expression that are altered in expression in many cancers (6He L.

The expression of several miRNAs in cholangiocarcinoma xenografts in athymic mice is altered during in vivo treatment with gemcitabine (9Meng F. Henson R. Lang M. Wehbe H. Maheshwari S. Mendell J.T.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 2113-2129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). miRNAs are small endogenous molecules that can regulate gene expression in a sequence complementary manner. Several hundred miRNAs have been identified, and details of the mechanisms by which they regulate gene expression are being unraveled (10Cummins J.M. He Y. Leary R.J. Pagliarini R. Diaz Jr., L.A. Sjoblom T. Barad O. Bentwich Z. Szafranska A.E. Labourier E. Raymond C.K. Roberts B.S. Juhl H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Velculescu V.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Less is known about the mechanism by which miRNAs contribute to cellular behavior and function. Alterations in miRNA expression occur in many different cancers (8Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. varez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. Downing J.R. Jacks T. Horvitz H.R. Golub T.R. Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (8279) Google Scholar). Thus, individual miRNAs may play contributory or regulatory roles in tumor cell pathogenesis or behavior. Potential downstream targets of miRNA include oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, but few miRNA-regulated targets relevant to tumor biology have been described such as the Ras oncogene (12Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3119) Google Scholar). We postulated that genetic reprogramming resulting from altered miRNA regulatory networks may contribute to tumor cell response and resistance to chemotherapy. Cell Lines and Cultures—Mz-1 and KMCH-1 human malignant cholangiocytes and their respective IL-6-overexpressing stable transfectants, Mz-IL-6 and KM-IL-6, were obtained and cultured as described previously (2Meng F. Yamagiwa Y. Ueno Y. Patel T. J. Hepatol. 2006; 44: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Basal IL-6 expression was increased by ∼1.5-fold in KM-IL-6 and ∼3-fold in Mz-IL-6 cells relative to their respective controls. Transfections—20 μl of 100 nm microRNA precursor, antisense inhibitor, or controls were added to 1 × 106 cells suspended in 80 μl of Nucleofector solution (Amaxa Biosystems, Koln, Germany) at room temperature. Electroporation was performed using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems). Transfected cells were then resuspended in regular culture medium containing 10% serum for 48–72 h prior to study. MicroRNA Isolation and Expression Profiling—miRNA was isolated by PAGE purification of total RNA, and expression profiling was performed using a custom-generated microarray as described previously (9Meng F. Henson R. Lang M. Wehbe H. Maheshwari S. Mendell J.T. Jiang J. Schmittgen T.D. Patel T. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 2113-2129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A array scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Normalization was performed by expressing each miRNA replicate relative to a control miRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) added to each sample, thus allowing comparisons between chips. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.0 Software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), and an average value of the median intensity of each replicate in four groups was generated. MicroRNA expression levels were clustered using a self-organizing tree algorithm using the MultiExperiment Viewer Version 3.1 from The Institute for Genomic Research (13Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J.

Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (4021) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR—RNA was isolated using the ToTALLY RNA isolation kit (Ambion), and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using 1 μg of total RNA and the reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). Mature let-7a miRNA expression was assessed using a TaqMan® human microRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using a MX 3000P™ PCR instrument (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Cytotoxicity Assay—Cell viability was assessed using a commercially available tetrazolium bio-reduction assay as described previously (14Tadlock L. Yamagiwa Y. Marienfeld C. Patel T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G924-G932PubMed Google Scholar). 10,000 viable cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated with gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, camptothecin, or appropriate diluent controls in a final volume of 200 μl of medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Caspase Assay—Cells were plated in 96-well plates (20,000 cells/well) and incubated with different chemotherapeutic agents or diluent control. Caspase 3/7 activity was assayed using the fluorometric Apo-ONE homogenous caspase 3/7 assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Cytofluor microplate fluorescence plate reader. Stat-3 Kinase Assay—Stat-3 activity was assessed in cell lysates after immunoprecipitation using monoclonal P-Stat-3-Tyr705 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and using a tyrosine kinase activity assay kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Luciferase Reporter Vectors—The pMIR-NF2-luc and pMIR-NF2-MUT-luc firefly luciferase reporter vectors, which contain the intact or mutated putative let-7a recognition sequence from the 3′-UTR of NF2, respectively, cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene were constructed as follows. Synthetic oligonucleotides encompassing the intact or mutated let-7a recognition sequence, sticky ends for HindIII and SpeI to eliminate digestion of the insert, and a unique BlpI site to test for positive clones were synthesized and annealed. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTAGTGCTCAGCTACAAGAGATTCTCCTGCCTCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTTTGAGGCAGGAGAATCTCTTGTAGCTGAGCA-3′ (antisense) for pMIR-NF2-luc, or 5′-CTAGTGCTCAGCTATAGGCGCTTTGCTCGATGGAA-3′(sense) and 5′-AGCTTTCCATCGAGCAAAGCGCCTATAGCTGAGCA-3′ (antisense) for pMIR-NF2-MUT-luc. The recognition sequence is underlined in the former sequence, and the random mutations introduced are italicized in the latter sequence. To anneal the oligonucleotides, 2 μg of each strand was added to 46 μl of DNA annealing buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 nm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for a final volume of 50 μl and incubated at 90 °C for 3 min and then at 37 °C for 1 h. The annealed insert was then directly ligated into the HindIII and SpeI cloning sites of the pMIR-REPORT luciferase expression vector (Ambion). Clones were selected after screening by restriction digestion with BlpI. Mz-IL-6 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of pMIR-NF2-UTR or pMIR-NF2-MUT-UTR construct and 1 μg of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase expression construct without (empty vector control) or with anti-let-7a inhibitor using TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For validation of the effect of anti-let-7a, we used the pRL-TK let-7a firefly luciferase expression construct in which two let-7a sites are inserted into the XbaI site in the 3′-UTR. Cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK, and luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for each sample. Western Blotting—For immunoblot analysis of cells in culture, cell lysates were obtained from cells grown in 100-mm dishes, whereas for analysis of xenograft tissue, lysates were obtained after tissue homogenization. Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis in a 4–20% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and infrared dye-labeled secondary antibodies. The protein of interest was then detected using the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were obtained using the NE-PER extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Xenograft Model—Studies were performed under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol. Eight-week-old male athymic nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were maintained in accordance with IACUC procedures and guidelines. 5 × 106 Mz-1 or Mz-IL-6 cells were suspended in 0.25 ml of extracellular matrix gel, and the mixture was injected subcutaneously into the right and left flanks. Serial measurements of xenograft growth were performed, and tumor volume was estimated using the formula 4/3 π (L*W*H/8). Once tumor volume was 200–230 mm3, xenografts were excised, and the tissue was homogenized for miRNA isolation or immunoblot studies or used for miRNA inhibition studies. For the latter, mice with Mz-IL-6 xenografts were injected intratumorally with 4 ng/mm3 tumor volume of either anti-let-7a or diluent. The following day, gemcitabine (150 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally every 3 days for three doses. The change in tumor size was assessed, and tumors were excised after 10 days. Homogenates were obtained for Western blot analysis. Sections of tumors were obtained for immunofluorescence studies using mouse anti-P-Stat-3 (Tyr705) (1:75 dilution) or rabbit anti-NF2 (1:75 dilution) primary antibodies and with detection using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) or Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution), respectively. Imaging was performed using a Axiovert 200 motorized fluorescent microscope imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Reagents—All microRNA precursors, inhibitors and controls were obtained from Ambion Inc. Primary antibodies against NF2, Mcl-1, and Survivin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-AKT (Ser473), phospho-STAT-3 (Tyr705), phospho-p38 (Thy180/Tyr182), PARP, and active caspase-3 were from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and α-tubulin was from Sigma. TATA box-binding protein monoclonal antibody was from ABcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA), whereas IRDye700 and IRDye800-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Rockland (Gilberts-ville, PA). Gemcitabine was provided by Lilly. 5-Fluorouracil and camptothecin were from Sigma. pRL-TK let7a from Phil Sharp (Addgene plasmid 11324) and pcDNA3/5′F encoding NF2 from Vijaya Ramesh (Addgene plasmid 11623) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) (15Doench J.G. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 16Xu L. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Beauchamp R. Pinney D. Sterner C. Ramesh V. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—In vivo responses were compared using the t test. Data are expressed as the mean ± 95% confidence interval unless otherwise noted. The difference between two groups was analyzed using a double-sided Student’s t test, and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. IL-6 Survival Signaling Involves Alterations in miRNA Expression—To identify miRNA that may contribute to survival signaling and chemoresistance, we first assessed the effect of IL-6 on miRNA expression. Mz-ChA-1 human cholangio-carcinoma cells were stably transfected to overexpress IL-6 (Mz-IL-6 cells) and implanted as xenografts in athymic nude mice. When compared with Mz-1 control cell xenografts, the growth rate of Mz-IL-6 xenografts was increased (Fig. 1A). Moreover, there was a loss of sensitivity of Mz-IL-6 tumor xenografts to the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (Fig. 1B), in conjunction with a decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells when compared with controls (Fig. 1C). We used a miRNA microarray to assess the expression of human miRNAs in tumor cell xenografts and in two different cholangiocarcinoma cell lines overexpressing IL-6. The pattern of miRNA expression in IL-6-overexpressing Mz-IL-6 and KM-IL-6 cells differed from their controls (supplemental Fig. 1). A cluster of miRNAs that were increased with enforced IL-6 expression both in vivo as well as in vitro was identified and included several members of the let-7 family and miRNA that have been implicated in oncogenesis such as miR-21 (Fig. 2A) (17Chan J.A. Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). These data showing altered miRNA expression profiles in vivo suggest that some effects of IL-6 on tumor cell growth and apoptosis may be mediated by miRNA-dependent regulation of gene expression. The relative expression of several members of the let-7 family was altered in vivo (Fig. 2B). Of these, let-7a was chosen for further study based on consistency and level of expression. The expression of mature let-7a miRNA was confirmed to be increased by realtime PCR in IL-6-overexpressing cells in vitro, as well as in tumor cell xenografts in vivo when compared with controls (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2IL-6 overexpression alters miRNA expression. A, miRNA was isolated from IL-6-overexpressing Mz-IL-6 and KM-IL-6 cells and their respective control Mz-1 and KMCH-1 cells in vitro and from Mz-IL-6 and Mz-1 tumor cell xenografts in nude mice. Cluster analysis of miRNA expression profiles identified a group of miRNA that was consistently altered with enforced expression of IL-6 both in vivo and in vitro. This cluster contained the listed members of the let-7 family and miR-21. B, quantitative analysis of the let-7 family of miRNA in vivo representing the average and 95% confidence intervals from eight samples. C, real-time PCR confirmed increased expression of mature let-7a in Mz-IL-6 and KM-IL-6 cells as well as tumor xenografts when compared with expression in their respective controls. Data represents the mean and standard error of four determinations performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.05 when compared with respective controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) let-7a Contributes to Survival Signaling by IL-6—To determine the relevance of enhanced let-7a expression to survival signaling, we next evaluated the effect of let-7a inhibition on the response to chemotherapy in vitro. The effect of the anti-let-7a inhibitor was assessed by co-transfecting with the pRL-Tk let-7a firefly luciferase construct that contains two let-7a sites in the 3′-UTR of the firefly luciferase reporter. An increase in luciferase activity confirmed the efficacy of anti-let-7a under the conditions used for our studies (Fig. 3A). Cytotoxicity in response to diverse agents was enhanced by preincubation with antisense inhibitors to let-7a (Fig. 3B). Moreover, there was an increase in caspase-3/7 activity in response to chemotherapy in cells preincubated with anti-let-7a when compared with a control inhibitor (Fig. 3C). Similarly, an increase in PARP cleavage and activated caspase-3 was noted in response to anti-let-7a in Western blots from gemcitabine-treated cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, inhibition of let-7a increases chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data are consistent with an effect of let-7a on IL-6-mediated anti-apoptotic survival pathways. let-7a Regulates Stat-3 Phosphorylation—Survival signaling by IL-6 can involve activation of the Stat family of transcription factors or protein kinases such as p38 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Constitutive phosphorylation and activation of Stat-3 in cholangiocarcinoma cells have been shown to be IL-6-dependent (18Isomoto H. Kobayashi S. Werneburg N.W. Bronk S.F. Guicciardi M.E. Frank D.A. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, there was an increase in Tyr705-phosphorylated Stat-3 (p-Stat-3) in Mz-IL-6 cells when compared with controls. An increase of Ser473 phosphorylated Akt was also noted in these cells. We next evaluated the effect of antisense inhibition of miR-21 and let-7a on these pathways (Fig. 4A). Constitutive Stat-3 phosphorylation in Mz-IL-6 cells was markedly decreased by antilet-7a but not by anti-miR-21. Furthermore, incubation of Mz-IL-6 cells with anti-let-7a decreased basal Stat-3 kinase activity to 76.9 ± 2.5% of controls after 48 h (n = 8, p = 0.002). Stat-3 has several well characterized targets that inhibit apoptosis and can modulate survival, such as survivin, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 (19Hsieh F.C. Cheng G. Lin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Of these, survivin expression can predict prognosis in human cholangiocarcinoma, and Mcl-1 expression can modulate responses to chemotherapy (20Javle M.M. Tan D. Yu J. LeVea C.M. Li F. Kuvshinoff B.W. Gibbs J.F. Hepatogastroenterology. 2004; 51: 1653-1657PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for Stat-3 in mediating the survival effects of IL-6 in chemoresistance, the expression of both survivin and Mcl-1 was increased in Mz-IL-6 cells in a let-7a- and Stat-3-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). NF2 Is a Target for let-7a—To elucidate potential mediators of let-7a modulation of Stat-3 phosphorylation, we performed a bioinformatics analysis. The let-7a sequence was compared with proposed regulators of Stat-3, using the criteria of Doench and Sharp (15Doench J.G. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) but modified to include 85% sequence complementarity at positions 2–9 of the miRNA. The tumor suppressor gene NF2, a known modulator of Stat-3 activation, was identified as a putative target for let-7a. Moreover, interrogation of various target prediction databases such as TargetScan, miRScan, miRanda, and PicTar did not identify any other known regulators of Stat-3 as potential targets for let-7a (21Bentwich I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5904-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The location of the let-7a complementary site in the 3′-UTR of NF2 is shown in Fig. 5. The site is conserved in human and rat homologs of NF2. NF2 has been previously shown to regulate Stat-3 phosphorylation by a mechanism involving the hepatocyte growth factor tyrosine kinase substrate HRS (22Scoles D.R. Nguyen V.D. Qin Y. Sun C.X. Morrison H. Gutmann D.H. Pulst S.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We verified that NF2 was a target for let-7a using luciferase reporter constructs containing the let-7a recognition sequence from the 3′-UTR of NF2 inserted downstream of the luciferase gene (pMIR-NF2-luc), along with a similar construct in which random mutations were introduced at sites involved in base-pairing (pMIR-NF2-MUT-luc) (Fig. 5A). Transfection with anti-let-7a increased reporter activity in Mz-IL-6 cells, whereas let-7a precursor decreased reporter activity in Mz-1 cells However, these effects were ameliorated when the mutated reporter construct pMIR-NF2-MUT was used in place of pMIR-NF2-luc (Fig. 5, B and C). Constitutive expression of NF2 was decreased and p-Stat-3 increased in Mz-IL-6 cells when compared with Mz-1 controls. Moreover, inhibition of let-7a increased NF2 expression and concomitantly decreased p-Stat-3 (Fig. 6A). Conversely, p-Stat-3 was increased during incubation of Mz-1 cells with NF2 siRNA (Fig. 6B). Incubation with the let-7a precursor miRNA increased nuclear Stat-3 expression, suggesting that let-7a enhances activation of Stat-3 and nuclear translocation. Similar effects were also observed with NF2 siRNA (Fig. 6C). These studies support a mechanism by which enhanced IL-6 production enhances constitutive Stat-3 phosphorylation and activation via a mechanism involving let-7a-mediated inhibition of NF2. let-7a Can Mediate Downstream Effects of IL-6 Overexpression on Stat-3 Phosphorylation—We evaluated whether an increase in let-7a expression alone could recapitulate the effects of IL-6 on NF2 and Stat-3. Mz-1 cells were transfected with either let-7a precursor or control precursors. Interestingly, NF2 expression was decreased, and Stat-3 phosphorylation was increased in Mz-1 cells transfected with let-7a precursor. Furthermore, the effect of let-7a expression on Stat-3 phosphorylation was blocked by enforced expression of NF2 (Fig. 7A). To assess the involvement of NF2 on IL-6-dependent signaling, we measured phospho-Stat-3 and NF2 levels in Mz-1 and Mz-IL-6 cells after transfection with NF2 or Lac Z. Aberrant expression of NF2 successfully blocked IL-6-dependent Stat-3 activation (Fig. 7B). Thus, enforced expression of NF2 is sufficient to overcome the effects of IL-6 on constitutive Stat-3 expression in malignant cholangiocytes. let-7a Modulates NF2 and Stat-3 in Vivo—To explore the in vivo relevance of these observations, we assessed the expression of p-Stat-3, NF2, and the Stat-3-regulated anti-apoptotic proteins in homogenates from xenograft tumors. The results corresponded to those observed in vitro with an increase in basal expression of p-Stat-3 and decrease in NF2 in Mz-IL-6 xenografts when compared with control cell xenografts (Fig. 8A). Intratumoral administration of anti-let-7a increased NF2 and decreased p-Stat-3 expression in Mz-IL-6 xenografts in vivo (Fig. 8, B and C). Moreover, a decrease in tumor growth consistent with increased gemcitabine toxicity was observed in response to anti-let-7a when compared with tumors that were untreated. Anti-let-7a (n = 6) or diluent (n = 4) was administered intratumorally into Mz-IL-6 xenografts. Animals subsequently received a course of three doses of gemcitabine 150 mg/kg intraperitoneally given every 3 days. The mean change in tumor growth at the end of treatment was 0.6 ± 2.0% in tumors that received anti-let-7a when compared with 18.4 ± 8.2% in controls (p = 0.02). In combination, these findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism that contributes to constitutive Stat-3 phosphorylation involving NF2, a target of regulation by the let-7a microRNA. Although the association between chronic inflammation and malignancy has been recognized for many decades, the role of miRNA in cancer cell biology has only recently been appreciated. The role of cytokines as stimulators of miRNA expression have not been explored, and here, we demonstrate a role for persistent IL-6 stimulation on altered miRNA expression in a human cancer. The demonstration of an inflammation-associated cytokine-regulated miRNA-mediated survival mechanism is highly relevant to both tumor biology and regulation of cytokine signaling. Moreover, these studies emphasize the emerging complexity of miRNA-mediated cellular responses. There is compelling evidence of a critical role for activated Stat-3 in human cancers. Constitutively activated Stat-3 is observed in many cancers, and abrogation of Stat-3 activation results in the loss of the malignant phenotype (23Bromberg J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells expressing persistently activated Stat-3 are dependent on it for survival. Thus, Stat-3 can act as an oncogene and may contribute to tumor growth (24Garcia R. Yu C.L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chan K.S. Sano S. Kiguchi K. Anders J. Komazawa N. Takeda J. DiGiovanni J. J. Clin.

Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Although several cytokines including IL-6 can induce Stat-3 tyrosine phosphorylation, the mechanisms by which it is constitutively activated in cancers are unknown. Although activating Stat-3 mutations have not been described, aberrant expression of modulators of Stat expression or phosphorylation such as PIAS-3, modulators of upstream Stat-3 activation such as SOCS-1, or as yet uncharacterized Stat-3 tyrosine phosphatases may all contribute (5Darnell J.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 595-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). None of these mechanisms have been shown to predominate in tumor cells. The contribution of miRNA modulation of NF2 expression warrants further investigation as an alternative mechanism contributing to constitutive Stat-3 activation. We speculate that the NF2-dependent mechanism may be more relevant to constitutively increased Stat-3 phosphorylation in the setting of chronic IL-6 stimulation, rather than transient, non-sustained activation of Stat-3 in response to acute stimulation of IL-6 signaling, which has been well characterized and involves, among others, Jak-Stat interactions. NF2 is located on chromosome 22q12.2 and encodes for merlin, a putative tumor suppressor gene. Merlin has strong binding to HRS, a potent regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking, and the interaction of HRS and Merlin can result in inhibition of Stat activation (22Scoles D.R. Nguyen V.D. Qin Y. Sun C.X. Morrison H. Gutmann D.H. Pulst S.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Merlin has been shown to act as growth regulator, and its decreased expression could partly contribute to the increased growth rate observed in IL-6-overexpressing tumor cell xenografts. In response to IL-6 stimulation, activation of Stat-3 is associated with the endocytotic pathway (27Shah M. Patel K. Mukhopadhyay S. Xu F. Guo G. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7302-7308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, a plausible mechanism by which decreased NF2 expression in response to persistent IL-6 stimulation results in activation of Stat-3 could involve facilitating its association with the endocytotic pathway through an HRS-mediated mechanism. The miRNA family of let-7 and its homologs have been implicated as cancer-associated miRNAs in recent studies (28Esquela-Kerscher A. Slack F.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar, 29Akao Y. Nakagawa Y. Naoe T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Although we focused our studies on let-7a, we note that the relative expression of other members of the let-7 family such as let-7d and let-7f-2 were also increased in vivo (Fig. 2B). It is quite likely that these other members of the let-7 family that are differentially altered in response to increased IL-6 stimulation may also have cellular actions. NF2 is not a predicted target for either let-7d or let-7f-2. However, both these miRNAs could potentially target SOCS-1, an established inhibitor of the Jak-Stat-3 pathway, and thereby modulate IL-6-dependent Stat-3 activation. In reported series of lung cancers, let-7 expression is downregulated in association with Ras expression in the setting of activating Ras mutations, and decreased expression of let-7a2 has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis (12Johnson S.M.

However, these observations are likely to be cell type-specific since let-7 is only sporadically reduced in tumor types other than lung cancer. Our experimental model differs considerably from these studies in representing a state of persistent cytokine stimulation, and it is unknown whether let-7 expression can be modulated by IL-6 in a similar manner in lung cancer. Although augmenting let-7 expression is being touted as a potential therapeutic strategy, such approaches may be inappropriate for cancers that are associated with elevated IL-6 levels such as cholangiocarcinoma. In contrast, potential interventions to decrease survival signaling and Stat-3 activation by IL-6 may be a useful approach for these cancers.

Although numerous physiological studies have measured ammonia excretion, the mechanism of ammonia movement through the membranes of gill epithelial cells is still unknown. Mammalian Rh glycoproteins are members of a family of proteins that mediate ammonia transport in bacteria, yeast, and plants. We identified the Rh glycoprotein homologs, fRhag, fRhbg, fRhcg1, and fRhcg2, of the pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes. Northern blot, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry revealed that the pufferfish erythroid Rh glycoprotein homologue fRhag was present in red blood cells and the hematological organs (spleen and kidney) in fish. All four pufferfish Rh glycoproteins are specifically localized in the gill and line the pillar cells, pavement cells, and the mitochondrion-rich cells. Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes showed that they mediate methylammonium (an analog of ammonium) transport. These results suggest that pufferfish Rh glycoproteins are involved in ammonia excretion from the gill. These findings challenge the classic view that ammonia excretion in the fish gill occurs by passive diffusion."

The data set indicates a lunar mantle with long-term, chondritic, highly siderophile element ratios, but with absolute abundances that are over 20 times lower than those in Earth's mantle. The results are consistent with silicate-metal equilibrium during a giant impact and core formation in both bodies, followed by post–core-formation late accretion that replenished their mantles with highly siderophile elements. The lunar mantle experienced late accretion that was similar in composition to that of Earth but volumetrically less than (∼0.02% lunar mass) and terminated earlier than for Earth."

We have identified Sox13 as a gammadelta-specific gene in the immune system. Using Sox13 transgenic mice, we showed that this transcription factor promotes gammadelta T cell development while opposing alphabeta T cell differentiation. Conversely, mice deficient in Sox13 expression exhibited impaired development of gammadelta T cells but not alphabeta T cells. One mechanism of SOX13 function is the inhibition of signaling by the developmentally important Wnt/T cell factor (TCF) pathway. Our data thus reveal a dominant pathway regulating the developmental fate of these two lineages of T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2047072851,"We have devised a strategy (called recombinase-mediated genomic replacement, RMGR) to allow the replacement of large segments (>100 kb) of the mouse genome with the equivalent human syntenic region. The technique involves modifying a mouse ES cell chromosome and a human BAC by inserting heterotypic lox sites to flank the proposed exchange interval and then using Cre recombinase to achieve segmental exchange. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by replacing the mouse α globin regulatory domain with the human syntenic region and generating homozygous mice that produce only human α globin chains. Furthermore, modified ES cells can be used iteratively for functional studies, and here, as an example, we have used RMGR to produce an accurate mouse model of human α thalassemia. RMGR has general applicability and will overcome limitations inherent in current transgenic technology when studying the expression of human genes and modeling human genetic diseases."

The skull is morphologically modern overall but displays some archaic features. Its strongest morphometric affinities are with Upper Paleolithic (UP) Eurasians rather than recent, geographically proximate people. The Hofmeyr cranium is consistent with the hypothesis that UP Eurasians descended from a population that emigrated from sub-Saharan Africa in the Late Pleistocene."

Most euphorbs produce minute flowers, suggesting that the enormous flowers of Rafflesiaceae evolved from ancestors with tiny flowers.

The amino-terminal (n-) region contains the Tat consensus motif (S/T)RRXFLK, which includes the signature twin arginine dipeptide.

Proteomic studies based on comparison of secreted proteins in WT and tat deletion strains are complicated because many Tat proteins are expressed only under specialized conditions (26Caldelari I. Mann S. Crooks C. Palmer T. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2006; 19: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, data from the localization of reporter protein fusions to Tat signal peptides have to be interpreted with caution because the nature of the reporter protein can misdirect the fusion to the Sec pathway (21Stanley N.R.

In this report we evaluated the export pathway preference of the putative Tat signal peptides of E. coli by examining the localization of fusions to three complementary reporter proteins. This analysis, and additional localization studies of the respective epitope-tagged full-length proteins, revealed that the E. coli genome encodes at least 27 Tat-targeting signal peptides. Surprisingly, the majority of these signal peptides can direct export via either Tat or Sec depending on the export competence of the reporter polypeptide. We show that increasing the positive charge in the N terminus of the mature protein prevents export via Sec, without affecting Tat export. Thus, it appears that in E. coli the Tat pathway is utilized for the translocation of proteins containing positively charged N-terminal regions that serve as “stop transfer” signals (29Yamane K. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19690-19696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Coleman J. Inukai M. Inouye M.

Bioinformatics—Putative Tat signal peptides were identified by conducting a BLAST search using the strings: SRRRFLK, SRRXFLX, TRRXFLX, SRRXXLK, SRRXXLA, TRRXXLK, TRRXXLA, SRRXXLT, SRRXXIK, SRRXXIA, SRRXFIX, SRRXFMK, SRRXFVK, SRRXFVA, SRRQFLK, RRXFLA, and RRXFLK within the first 50 residues. Sequences were then analyzed for signal peptide characteristics using SignalP 1.1 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) (31Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DmsA and YaeI, which had been assigned incorrect start codons in the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), were also included in the list, as was YcdO, which did not match our criteria but had been predicted to be a Tat substrate (14Bendtsen J.D.

Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. Signal peptides were amplified from E. coli XL1-Blue genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 1-56 shown in supplemental Table S3 and cloned into pKKGS (32DeLisa M.P. Samuelson P. Palmer T. Georgiou G.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar). Although SignalP predicts the likely signal peptidase cleavage site, there is evidence that such predictions are not always accurate for Tat signal peptides (34Thomas G. Potter L. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol.

Details of the construction of the gene fusions can be found in the supplemental data. Full-length proteins were tagged with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) (Sigma) by PCR amplification (supplemental Table S3) and cloning into the SacI and XbaI sites of pBAD33 (33Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionations—Cell fractionations were performed by the cold osmotic shock procedure as described earlier (2DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The soluble cytoplasmic fraction was obtained by resuspending the cell pellet obtained after fractionation into 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, sonication for 30 s, and recentrifugation to precipitate and remove insoluble cell debris. General Procedures—Unless otherwise noted, cells were grown at 37 °C on Luria Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, or 100 μg/ml ampicillin as appropriate. To test growth on maltose, E. coli HS3018 or its derivatives containing plasmids encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions were grown overnight, diluted, plated on M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% maltose, and incubated at 37 °C for 2-3 days. PhoA assays and Western blotting were performed as described earlier (2DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma), monoclonal rabbit anti-DsbA (Stressgen), monoclonal rabbit anti-GroEL (Sigma), polyclonal rabbit anti-PhoA (Rockland), and monoclonal mouse anti-MalE (Sigma). For flow cytometric analysis, E. coli MC4100-P and B1LK0-P containing plasmids encoding GFP-SsrA fusions were grown overnight in Luria Bertani medium as described above, and 500 μl of overnight culture were used to inoculate 10 ml of fresh medium. After 1 h of shaking at 37 °C, gene expression was induced with arabinose to a final concentration of 0.01%, the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h, and 1-ml samples were harvested by centrifugation, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed with a BD Biosciences FACSort flow cytometer. Bioinformatic Identification of Putative Tat Signal Peptides—Putative Tat signal peptides were identified by first using BLAST to search for E. coli open reading frames encoding proteins that contained a twin arginine dipeptide in the first 50 aa and, in addition, any two of the additional four aa that comprise the conserved Tat motif. Hits were then analyzed for signal peptide characteristics using SignalP (31Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 26 sequences meeting ≥25% of the SignalP 1.1 threshold values were found. Two more were included that have misannotated start codons in the data base but otherwise fit the above criteria (Table 1). Furthermore, YcdO was included because it is in the same operon as another putative Tat protein and was previously predicted to be a Tat substrate itself (14Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. Widdick D. Palmer T. Brunak S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The final set contained all 15 confirmed Tat substrates (AmiA, AmiC, CueO, DmsA, FdnG, FhuD, HyaA, HybO, MdoD, NapA, NrfC, SufI, TorA, TorZ, and YcdB) and is in good agreement with the prediction from program TATFIND (11Dilks K. Rose R.W. Hartmann E. Pohlschroder M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, TATFIND does not predict AmiC, DmsA, YaeI, YcdO, and YfhG to be Tat substrates; in addition, it predicts plasmid-encoded and membrane proteins that were not considered in the present study. Another program used to identify Tat signal peptides, TatP, is also in good agreement with our list but the latter missed FhuD, YagT, YcdO, and YfhG and predicted b3000, which was not considered in this study (14Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. Widdick D. Palmer T. Brunak S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although SignalP predicts signal peptidase cleavage sites, there is evidence that such predictions are not always accurate for Tat signal peptides (34Thomas G. Potter L. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 167-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate ambiguities, all signal peptide fusions in this study were designed to include the first six to eight aa following the SignalP-predicted cleavage site (Table 1).TABLE 1Characteristics, reporter protein fusion assay results, and assigned export pathway for each putative Tat signal peptideSignal peptideSequenceaShown in bold is the signal peptide c-region and in italics the predicted N-terminal region of the mature protein.Hydrophobicity h-regionbAverage hydrophobicity using Kyte Doolittle values is calculated for the h-region, defined as described by Cristóbal et al.

Open table in a new tab Export Pathway Analysis Using Reporter Fusions—We sought to experimentally verify the export pathway preference of the putative 29 signal peptides above by systematic analysis using reporter fusions (Fig. 1). DeLisa et al. (32DeLisa M.P. Samuelson P. Palmer T. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29825-29831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have shown that a short-lived version of GFP containing an SsrA tag confers cell fluorescence only when it is exported to the periplasm by virtue of a Tat signal peptide. In the absence of export, GFP-SsrA is rapidly degraded by ClpXP and ClpAP in the cytoplasm, whereas targeting to the Sec apparatus also results in non-fluorescent cells. For these reasons, the fluorescence of cells expressing fusions between Tat signal peptides and GFP-SsrA is proportional to the efficiency of export into the periplasm (35DeLisa M.P. Lee P. Palmer T. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GFP-SsrA fusions to the set of 29 putative signal peptides were expressed under the control of the pBAD promoter. Because high level expression of SsrA-tagged proteins can saturate the ClpXP and ClpAP machinery, the fusions were expressed in E. coli MC4100 carrying a pcnB deletion that lowers the copy number of pBR322 and its derivatives (36Lopilato J. Bortner S. Beckwith J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cell fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S5), and the mean fluorescence values conferred by the 29 fusions are reported in Table 1. Signal peptides were classified as capable of mediating Tat export if they conferred a mean cell fluorescence ≥10 arbitrary units and the cell fluorescence decreased by more than 3-fold in an isogenic tatC strain. These criteria were derived from genetic studies in which we isolated TatC suppressor mutations that allow the export of twin lysine signal peptides. 5E. Strauch and G. Georgiou, unpublished observations. Nineteen signal peptides satisfied these criteria (Table 1). However, GFP-SsrA fusions to several experimentally confirmed Tat signal peptides (ssFdnG (signal sequence FdnG), ssFhuD, ssNapA, and ssNrfC), resulted in low cell fluorescence. Low whole cell fluorescence can result from poor expression and does not necessarily imply absence of Tat export. Indeed, when whole cell lysates were analyzed for GFP expression via Western blotting, no bands were detected for these four signal peptides or for other signal peptides with a mean fluorescence below 10 arbitrary units in the wild type strain (supplemental Fig. S6). MBP is naturally a Sec substrate in E. coli but is also competent for Tat export (Fig. 1) (28Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A low level of periplasmic MBP is sufficient to allow growth of malE cells on minimal medium with maltose as the sole carbon source. We reasoned that growth on maltose minimal medium might be a more sensitive reporter system for Tat export of fusions that are expressed poorly. However, Tat export of signal peptide-MBP fusions can only be inferred if a tatC mutation abolishes growth on maltose, thus ruling out the possibility that the fusion protein is instead exported via Sec. Eleven of the 29 fusions conferred growth on maltose only in WT cells (Table 1). These included ssFdnG, ssFdoG, ssNapA, ssNapG, ssNrfC, and ssYnfE, whose Tat export could not be assigned with GFP-SsrA fusions due to low fluorescence. To ensure that lack of growth in a tatC mutant strain was not due to lower protein expression levels, fusions to the six signal peptides above were further tested using maltose minimal medium plates containing inducer. Nonetheless, Tat-dependent growth was still observed only in WT cells and not in the tatC mutant strain. Western blotting revealed that expression levels are nearly equal in WT and tatC mutant cells (with the exception of ssTorA, for which expression was higher in the tatC mutant relative to the WT cells). Representative results are shown in Fig. 2A. The ssNrfC-MBP fusion could not be detected by Western blotting in either the WT or tatC strain, despite its ability to confer Tat-dependent growth on maltose plates with and without inducer. Collectively, these data indicate that the set of 11 signal peptides is capable of directing export via Tat but not via the Sec pathway. We tested whether the mal+ phenotype conferred by the set of 11 signal peptide fusions above was dependent on other Tat proteins. As expected, colony formation was abolished or severely retarded in a tatA strain but was unaffected in a tatE strain (data not shown). Interestingly, not all fusions were dependent on TatB for export. A tatB malE strain expressing ssHyaA-MBP or ssYcbK-MBP grew normally on minimal medium with maltose even though growth was abolished in the tatC strain. TatB-independent export of an ssHyaA fusion to a different reporter protein had also been reported earlier (2DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that interactions with TatB may not be required for the initiation of export by some E. coli Tat signal peptides. The remaining 18 MBP fusions conferred growth in both WT and tatC cells. Because Tat translocation is completely inactivated in a tatC strain, the export of MBP into the periplasm of these cells must have occurred through the Sec pathway. Export through Sec does not rule out the ability to target the Tat translocon as well, but these two possibilities cannot be distinguished from the phenotype of MBP fusions alone. However, 14 of these 18 signal peptides satisfied the criteria for Tat export of GFP-SsrA. Because they allow translocation of the MBP reporter in a tatC strain, these 14 signal peptides also possess the ability to direct export via Sec and therefore are assigned as Tat+Sec in Table 1. The ssFhuD-GFP-SsrA fusion gave 3-fold higher fluorescence in WT cells relative to the tatC strain but was lower compared with other fusions. Nonetheless, independent evidence has demonstrated that FhuD utilizes the Tat pathway (24Ize B. Porcelli I. Lucchini S. Hinton J.C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47543-47554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and therefore this signal peptide was also assigned as Tat+Sec. Sec export was also evaluated quantitatively based on the alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) activity conferred by PhoA fusions. T"

The actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex is an essential, evolutionarily conserved seven-subunit protein complex that promotes actin cytoskeleton assembly in the cytoplasm upon stimulation by WASP family proteins. Our recent study indicates that the nuclear localized neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) can induce de novo actin polymerization in the nucleus, and this function is important for the role of N-WASP in the regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Here, we have presented evidence to show that the Arp2/3 complex is also localized in the nucleus and plays an essential role in mediating nuclear actin polymerization induced by N-WASP. We have also demonstrated that the Arp2/3 complex physically associates with RNA polymerase II and is involved in the RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation both in vivo and in vitro. Together, these data provide strong support for the hypothesis that N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex regulate transcription, at least in part, through the regulation of nuclear actin polymerization in a manner similar to their function in the cytoplasm.

The rapid assembly of actin filaments in the cell is required for many basic cellular processes, such as endocytosis and cell motility (1Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The Arp2/3 complex is one of the most important mediators of actin assembly. It consists of two proteins that are closely related to actin in sequence and conformation (Arp2 and Arp3) and five other proteins including p41, p34, p21, p20, and p16 in humans (3Welch M.D. DePace A.H.

Despite the central function of the Arp2/3 complex in the regulation of actin filament nucleation and organization in the cytoplasm, the localization and function of the Arp2/3 complex in the nucleus have not been studied. Recent studies have shown that actin is localized in the nucleus and involved in a variety of nuclear functions (19Bettinger B.T. Gilbert D.M. Amberg D.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

A number of recent studies have shown that the nuclear actin plays a role in the regulation of gene transcription, which is independent of its function in chromatin remodeling (29Kukalev A. Nord Y.

Antibodies against actin have been shown to inhibit the transcription of naked DNA template by RNA polymerases I and II (31Hofmann W.A. Stojiljkovic L. Fuchsova B. Vargas G.M. Mavrommatis E.

In addition, β actin has been shown to be necessary for the activity of partially purified RNA polymerase III (33Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The role of actin in transcription is further supported by the findings that actin is associated with all three RNA polymerases (29Kukalev A. Nord Y. Palmberg C. Bergman T. Percipalle P. Nat. Struct.

Despite this progress, one important unsolved issue is whether actin polymerization is also essential for the various nuclear functions of actin, including regulation of transcription, although several recent studies suggest the presence of polymeric actins in the nucleus (35Schoenenberger C.A.

J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). N-WASP is a member of the WASP family and functions as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton by relaying the activation signal from small G proteins to the Arp2/3 complex (13Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 37Takenawa T. Miki H. J.

Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the nuclear localized N-WASP exists in a large nuclear protein complex containing PSF/NonO (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor/non-pou domain octamer-binding protein), nuclear actin and RNA polymerase II (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We found that the interaction between N-WASP and NonO/PSF complex coupled N-WASP to RNA polymerase II and was important for the regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in vivo and in vitro. We also showed that N-WASP could promote nuclear actin polymerization, and this process was important for the transcriptional regulation. These results suggest the interesting possibility that N-WASP may regulate the organization of nuclear actin in a similar manner as in the cytoplasm, namely through the Arp2/3 complex. In the present study, we have investigated this possibility directly and demonstrated that the Arp2/3 complex is also localized in the nucleus, where it plays a role in the promotion of de novo actin polymerization and RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Plasmid Construction—DNA vector-based RNA interference was generated using pBS-U6 essentially as described previously (41Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). pBS-U6-Arp2 RNA interference was prepared by using oligos 5′-ggagagagatttgaagcacca-3′,5′-agcttggtgcttcaaatctctctcc-3′,5′-agcttggtgcttcaaatctctctccctttttg-3′, and 5′-aattcaaaaagggagagagatttgaagcaccaa-3′. For pBS-U6-Arp3 RNA interference, oligos 5′-ggtgatcaagctcaaaggagga-3′,5′-agcttcctcctttgagcttgatcacc-3′, 5′-agcttcctcctttgagcttgatcaccctttttg-3′, and 5′-aattcaaaaagggtgatcaagctcaaaggagga-3′ were used. To clone the cDNA for Arp2, Arp2-5 primers 5′-cgggatccaagcttatggacagccagggcaggaaggtggtggtg-3′ and 5′-ggaattccttatcgaacagtcacaccaagtttctctag-3′ were used for the PCR from the cDNA library prepared from 293T cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and the Superscript III reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen (Valencia, CA) Invitrogen, respectively) according to the manufacturers' manuals. For Arp3 cDNA, Arp3-5 primers 5′-cgggatccaagcttatggcgggacggctgccggcctgtgtggtg-3′ and 5′-ggaattccttacgacatgactccaaacactggattgtg-3′ were used. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then ligated to a linearized pKH3 vector in the BamHI and EcoRI sites on the ends to generate pKH3-Arp2 and pKH3-Arp3. To make the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant mutant of Arp2 (pKH3-Arp2-res), site-directed mutagenesis was performed using oligos 5′-aaagttgggggggagaggtttgaggcaccagaagct-3′ and 5′-agcttctggtgcctcaaacctctcccccccaacttt-3′. For the siRNA-resistant mutant of Arp3 (pKH3-Arp3-res), oligos 5′-gcaaaagtgggcgatcaggctcagaggagagtgatgaaa-3′ and 5′-tttcatcactctcctctgagcctgatcgcccacttttgc-3′ were used. To make the nuclear exporting sequence (NES)-tagged proteins, nine amino acids of NES from Nrf2 (42Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29158-29168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were tagged to the C-terminal of Arp2 and Arp3 by PCR. For NESm, four hydrophobic leucines of NES were replaced by glutamines. To make Myc-Arp2-NES, Arp2-5 primer and oligo 5′-ggcccgggttataggtatagtgttgatagtcgtcgttttagtcgaacagtcacaccaagtttctctag-3′ were used for PCR amplification from pKH-Arp2-res. For Myc-Arp2-NESm, the same Arp2-5 primer and oligo 5′-ggcccgggttattggtattgtgttgattgtcgtcgtttttgtcgaacagtcacaccaagtttctctag-3′ were used for PCR from pKH-Arp2-res. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SmaI and then ligated to a linearized pHan vector in the corresponding sites to generate pHan-Arp2-NES and Arp2-NESm. For Myc-Arp3-NES, the same strategy was used for PCR. Arp3-5 primer and oligo 5′-ggaattcttataggtatagtgttgatagtcgtcgttttagcgacatgactccaaacactggattgtg-3′ were used. For Myc-Arp3-NESm, oligo 5′-ggaattcttattggtattgtgttgattgtcgtcgtttttgcgacatgactccaaacactggattgtg-3′ was used. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into pHan vector at the corresponding sites to generate pHan-Arp3 NES and pHan-Arp3-NESm. pHan vector has been described previously (43Wu X. Suetsugu S. Cooper L.A. Takenawa T. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9565-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Reagents and Cell Culture—Rabbit polyclonal anti-hemag-glutinin (HA) (Y11), anti-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (anti-PARP), anti-Arp2, anti-Arp3, and anti-GFP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-RNA polymerase II was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-BrdUrd antibody was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit anti-Myc, mouse anti-HA, mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin, and bromouridine were obtained from Sigma. RNase A was obtained from Qiagen. The RNase-free DNase I and cDNA kits were obtained from Invitrogen. The actin polymerization biochemistry kit containing pyrene-labeled actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). HeLa and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Subconfluent cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating the cell lysates with the appropriate antibody for >2 h at 4 °C. For the experiment to detect endogenous association, immunoprecipitation was followed by incubation with protein-G-Sepharose for another 2 h. After three washings, the immune complex was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as a secondary antibody and the ECL system for detection. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractionation—Fractionation was performed as described previously (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lifted by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min to sediment the nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant formed the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in the same lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl to extract the nuclear proteins. The extracted nuclear proteins were sedimented at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supplement was harvested as the nuclear fraction. For the pyrene actin assay, the extract was dialyzed with XB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for at least 3 h. Fluorescent Microscopy—Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (44Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). GFP was observed directly by fluorescent microscope. In Vivo Bromouridine Incorporation Assay—Bromouridine incorporation for detection of nascent transcription in situ was performed essentially as described earlier (45Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). HeLa cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 1 h in culture medium containing 2 mm bromouridine. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the samples were processed by immunofluorescent staining with mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (which cross-reacts with bromouridine) as well as with anti-HA (to identify positively transfected cells). The fraction of bromouridine(+) cells among positively transfected cells was determined by blind counting. Three independent experiments were performed, and the Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. Pyrene Actin Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293 cells as described earlier (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against XB buffer for >3 h. The final concentration was generally 7 μg/μl. The reaction mix contained 180 μl of extract with 10 μl of energy-regenerating mix (150 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2), 10 μl (0.4 mg/ml) of pyrene actin, and 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-VCA fusion protein. Pyrene fluorescence was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm, and the kinetics of actin filament assembly was monitored essentially as described earlier (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription Assay—In vitro transcription assays were performed using the HeLaScribe nuclear extract in vitro transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol, except that the nuclear extracts were preincubated with various affinity-purified antibodies (0.2 μg), for 15 min before initiation of the reaction by the addition of DNA templates and ribonucleotide triphosphates. The intensity of the bands was quantified with Image J software. Three independent experiments were performed, and the Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. Nuclear Localization of the Arp2/3 Complex—To examine the potential presence of the Arp2/3 complex in the nucleus, subcellular localization of Arp2 and Arp3 subunits was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunostaining of HeLa cells using antibodies against Arp2 or Arp3 showed their localization in the cytoplasm, especially in the cell periphery, as observed previously (3Welch M.D. DePace A.H. Verma S. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Both Arp2 and Arp3 were also detected in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Confocal images also showed localization of Arp2 and Arp3 in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). The potential nuclear localization of the Arp2/3 complex was further evaluated by subcellular fractionation studies. Protein extracts from HeLa cells were subjected to fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against Arp2 or Arp3. Fig. 1C shows that both Arp2 and Arp3 were detected in the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic fractions, whereas the nuclear (PARP) and cytoplasmic (vinculin) protein markers were only detected in their respective compartments. Given the well characterized function of the Arp2/3 complex in the regulation of actin polymerization in the cytoplasm, our observation of Arp2 and Arp3 in the nucleus was somewhat surprising, although a previous study reports similar nuclear localization of another subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, p34 (46DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Indeed, some cytoplasmic proteins could be detected in the nucleus due to nonspecific recognition of other proteins by the antibodies used in these assays. To exclude such a possibility for Arp2 and Arp3, we generated specific siRNA vectors to deplete endogenous Arp2 or Arp3 and examined their effects on the detection of Arp2 or Arp3 in these assays. Fig. 2A shows that both the Arp2 and Arp3 siRNA vectors significantly reduced the endogenous levels of Arp2 and Arp3, respectively, but did not affect the expression level of control proteins PARP or vinculin. Importantly, the nuclear fraction of both Arp2 and Arp3 was reduced upon the treatments with respective siRNA constructs. Consistent with the fractionation studies, immunofluorescent staining of Arp2 and Arp3 was found to be reduced in the nucleus of the cells transfected with the respective siRNAs but not the cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the Arp2/3 complex is specifically localized in the nucleus, in addition to its cytoplasmic localization. The Arp2/3 Complex Mediates Actin Polymerization in the Nucleus—Our recent studies show that the nuclear localized N-WASP could induce de novo actin polymerization in the purified nuclear extract (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Given its well characterized role in mediating N-WASP-induced actin polymerization in the cytoplasm, the Arp2/3 complex localized in the nucleus may also be responsible for the potential actin polymerization in the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of down-regulation of Arp2 and Arp3 on the actin polymerization in the nuclear extract by using pyrene actin assays as described previously (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As observed previously (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the addition of the GST-VCA domain of N-WASP (but not control GST) accelerated actin polymerization in the nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). Depletion of Arp2 or Arp3 in the nuclear extracts through expression of the corresponding siRNA constructs (but not a control GFP siRNA (see Fig. 2)) significantly reduced GST-VCA-stimulated actin polymerization, suggesting a role for the Arp2/3 complex in the process. Furthermore, the addition of the purified Arp2/3 complex in the nuclear extracts restored the stimulation of actin polymerization by GST-VCA in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that the nuclear Arp2/3 complex is a major mediator of N-WASP-induced de novo actin polymerization in the nucleus. Regulation of Transcription by the Arp2/3 Complex—It has been known that nuclear actin is important for transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our previous study shows that nuclear N-WASP associates with a large protein complex containing RNA polymerase II and is involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription through its function in promoting the polymerization of nuclear actin. Therefore, the above data showing a role of the nuclear Arp2/3 complex in actin polymerization raised an interesting possibility for a potential function of the nuclear Arp2/3 complex in transcriptional regulation. To test this possibility, we first examined whether the Arp2/3 complex is also associated with RNA polymerase II by immunoprecipitation assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared by biochemical fractionation from 293T cells that had been transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged Arp2 or Arp3 or GST as the control. The samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting to detect associated proteins. Fig. 4A shows that RNA polymerase II was detected in the samples expressing HA-Arp2 and HA-Arp3 but not control samples. To examine the association of endogenous Arp2 and Arp3 with RNA polymerase II, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using the nuclear extract of 293 cells with antibody against RNA polymerase II. Western blotting with antibody against Arp2 and Arp3 shows co-precipitation of Arp2 and Arp3 with RNA polymerase II, but not with control antibody (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the nuclear Arp2/3 complex may also be present in the large complex containing RNA polymerase II and regulates transcription, as shown previously (40Wu X. Yoo Y. Okuhama N.N. Tucker P.W. Liu G. Guan J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), for the nuclear N-WASP. We then investigated a potential role of the Arp2/3 complex in transcription regulation by measuring the effects of depletion of Arp2 and Arp3 on the RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in vivo using bromouridine incorporation assays. We established the specificity of the assay for transcription by RNA polymerase II by showing that the signal of antibody-bromouridine staining is diminished by treatment with RNase, but not with DNase, and by actinomycin D at high concentration, which inhibits both RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase I, but not at low concentration, which selectively inhibits both RNA polymerase I activity (data not shown). Thereafter, HeLa cells were co-transfected with siRNA for Arp2 or Arp3 or the control gene along with a vector encod"
https://openalex.org/W2021140489,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway plays a central role in growth, development, and metabolism in both normal and neoplastic cells. In skeletal muscle, Akt has been implicated in regulating regeneration and hypertrophy and in counteracting atrophy. Here we provide evidence that Akt1 and not Akt2 is essential for muscle differentiation. Using a robust model of MyoD-mediated muscle development, in which dominant-negative Akt blocked differentiation, we show that targeted loss of Akt1 was equally inhibitory. Selective elimination of Akt1 had no effect on myoblast viability or proliferation but prevented differentiation by impairing the transcriptional actions of MyoD. In contrast, knockdown of Akt2 had no effect on myoblast survival or differentiation and minimally inhibited MyoD-regulated transcription. Our results define isoform-specific Akt-regulated signaling pathways in muscle cells that act through Akt1 to sustain muscle gene activation and promote differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2091256286,"Targeting to mitochondria is emerging as a common strategy that bacteria utilize to interact with these central executioners of apoptosis. Several lines of evidence have in fact indicated mitochondria as specific targets for bacterial protein toxins, regarded as the principal virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria. This work shows, for the first time, the ability of the Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB), a glucosyltransferase that inhibits the Rho GTPases, to impact mitochondria. In living cells, TcdB provokes an early hyperpolarization of mitochondria that follows a calcium-associated signaling pathway and precedes the final execution step of apoptosis (i.e. mitochondria depolarization). Importantly, in isolated mitochondria, the toxin can induce a calcium-dependent mitochondrial swelling, accompanied by the release of the proapoptogenic factor cytochrome c. This is consistent with a mitochondrial targeting that does not require the Rho-inhibiting activity of the toxin. Of interest, the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels are also involved in the apoptotic response to TcdB and appear to be crucial for the cell death execution phase, as demonstrated by using specific modulators of these channels. To our knowledge, the involvement of these mitochondrial channels in the ability of a bacterial toxin to control cell fate is a hitherto unreported finding."
https://openalex.org/W1965958608,"TRPA1, a poorly selective Ca2+-permeable cation channel, is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons, where it is considered to contribute to a variety of sensory processes such as the detection of painful stimuli. Furthermore, TRPA1 was also identified in hair cells of the inner ear, but its involvement in sensing mechanical forces is still being controversially discussed. Amphipathic molecules such as trinitrophenol and chlorpromazine have been shown to provide useful tools to study mechanosensitive channels. Depending on their charge, they partition in the inner or outer sheets of the lipid bilayer, causing a curvature of the membrane, which has been demonstrated to activate or inhibit mechanosensitive ion channels. In the present study, we investigated the effect of these molecules on TRPA1 gating. TRPA1 was robustly activated by the anionic amphipathic molecule trinitrophenol. The whole-cell and single channel properties resemble those previously described for TRPA1. Moreover, we could show that the toxin GsMTx-4 acts on TRPA1. In addition to its recently described role as an inhibitor of stretch-activated ion channels, it serves as a potent activator of TRPA1 channels. On the other hand, the positively charged drug chlorpromazine modulates activated TRPA1 currents in a voltage-dependent way. The exposure of activated TRPA1 channels to chlorpromazine led to a block at positive potentials and an increased open probability at negative potentials. The variability in the shape of the I-V curve gives a first indication that native mechanically activated TRPA1 currents must not necessarily exhibit the same biophysical properties as ligand-activated TRPA1 currents.

Corey et al. (1Corey D.P. Garcia-Anoveros J. Holt J.R. Kwan K.Y. Lin S.Y. Vollrath M.A. Amalfitano A. Cheung E.L. Derfler B.H. Duggan A. Geleoc G.S. Gray P.A. Hoffman M.P. Rehm H.L. Tamasauskas D.

In addition to its expression in inner and outer hair cells, TRPA1 can also be found in somatosensory neurons, where it might play a role in decoding sensory or painful mechanical stimuli. Indeed, TRPA1-deficient mice have been reported to display a higher threshold in sensing noxious mechanical stimuli when compared with wild-type mice and had reduced responses to a series of suprathreshold stimuli (7Kwan K.Y.

These findings could not be validated by a second group (8Bautista D.M. Jordt S.E. Nikai T. Tsuruda P.R. Read A.J. Poblete J. Yamoah E.N. Basbaum A.I. Julius D.

A direct activation of TRPA1 by mechanical forces has not been described so far. TRPA1 channels are not sensitive to applying either positive or negative pressure via the recording pipette in patch clamp experiments. Here we have used an alternative approach to examine a potential mechanical gating of TRPA1. We imparted mechanical stress to the lipid bilayer using two amphipathic molecules, trinitrophenol and chlorpromazine, which have been previously shown to influence gating of mechanosensitive channels (9Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Nature. 1990; 348: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Qi Z. Chi S. Su X. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Mol. Membr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Trinitrophenol is a negatively charged amphiphilic compound, which accumulates in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, inducing a crenation of the membrane (12Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). In contrast, the positively charged phenothiazine drug chlorpromazine incorporates preferentially into the inner leaflet of the membrane inducing a so-called cup formation (12Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of these compounds on gating characteristics of TRPA1 in calcium imaging and electrophysiological experiments. Both molecules modulate TRPA1 gating but do so in different ways. The application of trinitrophenol led to a robust and reversible activation of TRPA1 channels in both the whole-cell and cell-attached configurations, similar to an activation by AITC. In contrast, chlorpromazine inhibited TRPA1 at positive holding potentials but markedly increased the open probability of TRPA1 at negative holding potentials. The presented data give a first indication that TRPA1 gating may be sensitive to membrane deformation and provide additional tools for identifying TRPA1-mediated cation permeabilities. Cell Culture and Reagents—HEK293 cells, stably transfected with human TRPA1 cDNA (HEK293TRPA1), were kindly provided by Dr. Natalie Tigue and Dr. Steve Moore (GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, UK). Parental HEK293 cells (for transient transfection) or HEK293TRPA1 cells were maintained on tissue culture plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips 24–48 h prior to the experiments. GsMTx-4 peptide (PeptaNova, Sandhausen, Germany) was dissolved at a concentration of 100 μm in distilled water, stored at –20 °C, and was freshly diluted into extracellular recording solution before use. Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were seeded onto 35-mm coverslips (105 cells/well) and grown for 18–24 h prior to transfection. Transient transfections were performed using a FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 1.5 μg of human TRPA1 together with 100 ng of eYFP as a transfection marker, 1.5 μg of TRPV1-YFP, 1.5 μg of TRPM8-YFP, or 1.5 μg of TRPV4-CFP. For confocal imaging experiments of PKCα translocation, 0.5 μg of an eYFP-tagged PKCα construct was co-transfected with TRPA1. For control experiments, either non-transfected cells from the same coverslip were used (internal controls) or 1.5 μg of pcDNA3 together with 100 ng of eYFP were used in control transfections. Transfected cells were utilized for patch clamp recordings 24–48 h after transfection. Electrophysiology—Cells were transferred to a continuously perfused recording chamber (500-μl volume) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. For whole-cell patch clamp experiments, the standard bath solution consisted of (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose pH 7.4 (NaOH). The pipette solution for whole-cell experiments contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 4 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). For cell-attached recordings, the standard bath solution was used in the patch pipette. All experiments were performed at room temperature using a HEKA EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Patch pipettes of 3–5 megaohms were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries. Experiments were carried out and analyzed under the control of the Pulse and Pulsefit software (HEKA Electronics). Series resistances were <10 megaohms and were compensated by 75–85%. Stated membrane potentials are corrected for liquid junction potentials. Whole-cell currents were filtered at 3 kHz (four-pole Bessel filter) and sampled continuously at 5 kHz. Single channel currents were sampled at 10 kHz. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Stated membrane potentials always refer to the physiological inner side of the membrane. Data Analysis—Single channel analysis was performed using the Pclamp software (Axon Instruments). In single channel experiments, transitions between open and closed states were detected using a half-amplitude threshold criterion and a minimum event width of 0.2 ms. For recordings with more than one active channel, the number of available channels in each membrane patch was estimated by the maximum number of channels simultaneously open observed in recordings of at least 3 min. For open time analysis, only recordings with a single active channel were used. The open time distributions were fitted to monoexponential functions. Mean channel open times were determined as arithmetic means of the dwell time data. Fluorescence Imaging—Measurements of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single cells were carried out using the fluorescent indicator fura-2. In brief, transiently transfected HEK293 cells were seeded on coverslips and loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min in a Hepes-buffered solution consisting of (in mm) 135 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5.5 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). This solution was supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were mounted on a monochromator-equipped (Polychrome UV, TILL-Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) inverted microscope (Axiovert 100, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The fluorescence of fura-2 and of eYFP was sequentially excited at 340, 380, and 475 nm, filtered through a 512-nm long-pass filter, and recorded with a 12-bit cooled CCD camera (IMAGO, TILL-Photonics). The calibration of the calcium concentration was performed using a regression-based spectral unmixing method as described by Ref. 13Lenz J.C. Reusch H.P. Albrecht N. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. For confocal imaging of the PKCα-YFP translocation, experiments were performed with an LSM510 inverted laser scanning microscope and a ×63/1.4 Plan-Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). CFP was excited with the 458-nm line of an argon laser, and emitted light was collected with a 470–500-nm band pass filter. YFP was excited with the 488-nm laser line, and emission was recorded with a 530–560-nm band pass filter. To obtain a measure for the membrane translocation of PKCα-YFP, regions of interest were defined over the cytosol of the cell (Fcyt). To detect agonist-induced changes in the plasma membrane association, the resulting ratios were normalized to the initial values. In each imaging experiment, 20–40 individual cells were analyzed and averaged. Means of the indicated number of individual experiments were calculated and expressed as mean ± S.E. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of TRPA1 were investigated in a heterologous expression system. TRPA1 was either transiently expressed in HEK293 cells or stably expressed in a HEK293TRPA1 cell line. There were no differences in TRPA1 characteristics detectable apart from a higher TRPA1 current density in the stable cell line when compared with transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Trinitrophenol Induces Ca2+ Influx through Recombinant Human TRPA1—We initially used ratiometric single cell calcium imaging to investigate the effect of trinitrophenol on TRPA1 gating. The basal level of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the basal Mn2+ influx (data not shown) were higher in HEK293 cells transiently expressing TRPA1 when compared with non-transfected cells on the same coverslip or mock-transfected HEK293 control cells, indicating a basal activity of TRPA1 (Fig. 1A). The addition of 500 μm trinitrophenol induced a rapid and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i similar to responses elicited by 10 μm AITC (Fig. 1, A and B). The rise in [Ca2+]i could be almost completely reversed by the addition of 10 μm ruthenium red, a broad spectrum TRPV and TRPA1 channel blocker. A trinitrophenol-induced calcium entry was not present in non-transfected control cells (Fig. 1, A and B) or in HEK293 cells transiently expressing the sensory TRP channels TRPM8 or TRPV1 (Fig. 1B). One should mention that calcium imaging experiments were hampered by the fact that, upon the addition of trinitrophenol, UV illumination at 340 and 380 nm led to a decrease in fura-2 fluorescence. To verify TRPA1 activation by trinitrophenol without UV illumination of the probe, we used a PKCα-YFP fusion protein bearing a Ca2+-sensitive C2 domain as a cellular read-out sensor for intracellular calcium that is excited at longer wavelengths. Under resting conditions of the cell, PKCα is located in the cytoplasm and is targeted to the plasma membrane in response to a rise in [Ca2+]i (14Cannell M.B. Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1942-1956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In unstimulated TRPA1-expressing HEK293 cells, PKCα-YFP exhibited a homogenous cytoplasmic fluorescence. Within 20 s after the addition of trinitrophenol, a PKCα-YFP translocation to the cell membrane was visible (Fig. 2A), which was absent in Ca2+-free bath solutions and, thus, most likely reflects a Ca2+-influx through activated TRPA1 channels. Translocation of PKCα-YFP could be partially reversed by the addition of ruthenium red (Fig. 2, A and C). When TRPA1-expressing cells were preincubated with ruthenium red, the PKCα-YFP distribution was unaltered by the addition of trinitrophenol (data not shown). This was also the case in control experiments with HEK293 cells expressing PKCα-YFP alone but no TRPA1, which did not show any PKCα-YFP translocation in response to trinitrophenol addition (Fig. 2D). The activation of TRPA1 by noxious cold remains a controversial topic. When we exposed the cells to 8 °C cold Hepes-buffered solution, we did not observe a translocation of PKCα-YFP to the plasma membrane (n = 4, data not shown), indicating no significant cold activation of TRPA1 in our hands.FIGURE 2Trinitrophenol-induced activation of TRPA1 causes translocation of PKCα-YFP to the plasma membrane. A and B, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding TRPA1 (1 μg) and PKCα-YFP (0. 5 μg) (A) or TRPV4 (1 μg) and PKCα-YFP (0.5 μg) (B). Confocal images were taken after the sequential addition of 100 μl of solvent (control), TNP (500 μm), and ruthenium red (30 μm RR); for B, TRPV4 cells were sequentially stimulated with trinitrophenol and 4α-phorbol didecanoate (1 μm 4α-PDD). Representative examples of confocal microscopy images are shown. C, time-lapse experiment showing the cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity of PKCα-YFP in four individual TRPA1-expressing cells during the addition of TNP and ruthenium red as indicated by the bars. D, statistical analysis of experiments such as in C. Cytoplasmic fluorescence was normalized to the initial cytoplasmic fluorescence (averaged over the first 5 s after starting the experiment for each individual cell). Filled circles represent single cells expressing TRPA1 and PKCα-YFP, and open circles represent control cells expressing PKCα-YFP only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether other TRP channels are also sensitive to trinitrophenol in this assay, we conducted experiments as described above but using heterologously expressed TRPV4. TRPV4 can be activated by hypotonic cell swelling (15Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and is thus another candidate for a mechanosensitive channel (16O'Neil R.G. Heller S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells transiently expressing both PKCα-YFP and TRPV4, trinitrophenol failed to induce a translocation of PKCα-YFP to the plasma membrane, indicating an absence of trinitrophenol activation of TRPV4. As a control for an intact TRPV4 function in our assay, we subsequently activated the channel using 1 μm 4α-phorbol didecanoate (Fig. 2B, 1 μm 4α-PDD), which led to an immediate PKCα-YFP translocation (Fig. 2B). These data, together with the absence of trinitrophenol-induced TRPM8 and TRPV1 activation in calcium imaging experiments, suggest that trinitrophenol is not an unspecific activator of TRP channels. Electrophysiological Characterization of the Trinitrophenol-evoked TRPA1 Current—The addition of trinitrophenol clearly led to an elevation of [Ca2+]i in TRPA1-expressing cells. We next wanted to investigate the electrophysiological properties of the currents evoked by trinitrophenol. All experiments shown were carried out in the absence of extracellular calcium to prevent time-dependent loss of channel activity (17Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the application of 500 μm trinitrophenol to HEK293TRPA1 cells resulted in significant increases in whole-cell currents, which were absent in control parental HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). We tested different concentrations of trinitrophenol for their ability to activate TRPA1. A concentration of 100 μm trinitrophenol failed to activate any significant TRPA1 currents, whereas the addition of 200 μm led to a small increase in channel activity. We could not obtain a full dose-response curve because of solubility problems of trinitrophenol and an increased instability of the patch at trinitrophenol concentrations above 1 mm. The activation of TRPA1 by trinitrophenol was fully reversible, and the reapplication of trinitrophenol repeatedly induced current activation. To confirm that trinitrophenol-activated currents are indeed mediated by TRPA1, we characterized the current-voltage relationship of the evoked current. Voltage ramps from –100 mV to +100 mV confirmed the marked outward rectification and demonstrated a reversal potential close to 0 mV (Fig. 3C) and, thus, were similar to AITC-evoked TRPA1 currents. In accordance with the calcium imaging experiments, trinitrophenol failed to activate currents in TRPV1- and TRPM8-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). We used step protocols to determine gating characteristics of the channel (Fig. 3D). A prepulse of +160 mV was used to fully activate TRPA1 channels in the presence of trinitrophenol. Voltage steps to negative holding potentials then led to an inactivation of the channel, which resulted in distinct tail currents that could be described with a monoexponential function (Fig. 3D, upper graph). The time constant for inactivation varied with the potential applied, from 3.5 ± 0.6 ms (n = 5) for a voltage step from +160 mV to –160 mV to 10.5 ± 1.6 ms (n = 5) for a voltage step from +160 mV to –20 mV. In contrast, a prepulse of –160 mV led to an almost complete inactivation of the trinitrophenol-activated TRPA1 channels and was followed by a slow reactivation after steps to positive holding potentials (Fig. 3D, lower graph). We next wanted to know whether trinitrophenol-induced TRPA1 currents exhibit the same single channel characteristics as when activated by AITC. Fig. 4A illustrates that the basal single channel activity in the on-cell configuration was low and that after the addition of trinitrophenol to the bath solution, channel activity was clearly elevated (Fig. 4B). The activation usually occurred with a delay of about 20 s. Note the strong voltage dependence of the open probability, which was higher at positive potentials. A unitary conductance of 106 pS ± 5.5 pS (n = 6) was calculated from I-V curves as shown in Fig. 4D based on amplitude histograms (like that in Fig. 4C) compiled for channel activity recorded at a range of different voltages. The calculated single channel conductance is very similar to the one that has been previously reported for AITC activation of TRPA1 (98 ± 16 pS, (17Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)). As the I-V relationship of the unitary currents was linear with a reversal potential close to 0 mV, the outward rectification of the whole-cell current is caused by the higher open probability at positive potentials. We can exclude a possible role of the cytoskeleton in the trinitrophenol-induced activation of TRPA1 as the evoked currents were not abolished after incubating the cells for 2–4 h in 2 μm cytochalasin D (data not shown). Modulation of AITC-induced TRPA1 Currents by Chlorpromazine—We next investigated the influence of chlorpromazine on TRPA1 gating. Chlorpromazine is positively charged and has previously been shown to induce a cup-forming of the plasma membrane and might therefore gate TRPA1 channels via exhibiting mechanical stress to the lipid bilayer. Chlorpromazine alone showed little or no effect on TRPA1 gating. In cells that exhibited a constitutive TRPA1 activity, however, an unexpected modification of the gating characteristics was observed upon addition of chlorpromazine (data not shown). These effects were more clearly discernible when TRPA1 was previously activated by AITC. AITC-induced TRPA1 currents are usually characterized by an outwardly rectifying I-V curve. Fig. 5, A and B, depict TRPA1 gating in response to 10 μm AITC. Tail currents were recorded after a prepulse to either –160 mV or +160 mV. Chlorpromazine affected the tail currents in a complex manner. (i) The inactivation at negative potentials was less pronounced, resulting in an increased current density at negative holding potentials, and (ii) chlorpromazine caused a voltage-dependent block of the current at holding potentials between +20 mV and +80 mV (Fig. 5, C–E). The reversal potential of the elicited current remained unchanged. This modified current is most likely carried by TRPA1 as it is absent in control cells and can be blocked by ruthenium red (Fig. 5F). Again, these changes were unaffected by elimination of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D. To further study the nature of the chlorpromazine-dependent modulation of the AITC-induced TRPA1 current, we conducted single channel recordings in the cell-attached configuration. The unitary conductance was unaffected by additional chlorpromazine application (103 ± 2.9 pS; n = 4 before the addition of chlorpromazine versus 104 ± 6.2 pS; n = 3 following chlorpromazine application), but the gating behavior of the single channels changed substantially. Channels exhibited shorter but more frequent opening events at positive holding potentials and an increased open probability at negative holding potentials. This is evident in the example traces (Fig. 6, A and B) in the open time histograms at different voltages (Fig. 6C) and in the open probability of single channels (Fig. 6D). We determined the mean open times of AITC-activated TRPA1 channels at positive and negative holding potentials with topen = 20.9 ± 3.9 ms (n = 5) at +80 mV and topen = 2.9 ± 0.33 ms (n = 5) at –80 mV. The values are in a good agreement with a previous study (topen = 4.4 ± 5.9 ms at –80 mV) (17Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Additional exposure of the AITC-activated TRPA1 cells to chlorpromazine significantly lowered topen to 1.9 ± 0.1 ms (n = 5) at +80 mV holding potential, whereas mean open times at –80 mV remained almost unchanged (topen = 3.9 ± 0.8; n = 5). The closed times of the TRPA1 channel changed also but can only be approximated as the absence of multiple openings during long continuous recordings does not ensure that only one active channel is present in the patch. The acute application of chlorpromazine to cell-attached patches exhibiting AITC-evoked single channel activity led to a decrease in the closed time of the channel by a factor of 9 at both positive and negative holding potentials. We examined the voltage-dependent open probability (Po) of AITC-activated TRPA1 channels in the absence and presence of chlorpromazine (Fig. 6D). At negative and low positive holding potentials, Po was increased about 5-fold in the presence of 50 μm chlorpromazine and was only slightly decreased at positive holding potentials. Thus, under physiological conditions at negative membrane potentials, an exposure of TRPA1-expressing cells to chlorpromazine would lead to an increased excitability of these cells.

We have looked for polyamine-preferential uptake proteins in S. cerevisiae. DUR3 catalyzed the uptake of polyamines together with urea, and SAM3 was found to catalyze the uptake of polyamines together with S-adenosylmethionine, glutamic acid, and lysine. Polyamine uptake was greatly decreased in both DUR3- and SAM3-deficient cells. The Km values for putrescine and spermidine of DUR3 were 479 and 21.2 μm, respectively, and those of SAM3 were 433 and 20.7 μm, respectively. Polyamine stimulation of cell growth of a polyamine requiring mutant, which is deficient in ornithine decarboxylase, was not influenced by the disruption of GAP1 and AGP2, but it was diminished by the disruption of DUR3 and SAM3. Furthermore, the polyamine stimulation of cell growth of a polyamine-requiring mutant was completely inhibited by the disruption of both DUR3 and SAM3. The results indicate that DUR3 and SAM3 are major polyamine uptake proteins in yeast. We previously reported that polyamine transport protein kinase 2 regulates polyamine transport. It was found that DUR3 (but not SAM3) was activated by phosphorylation of Thr250, Ser251, and Thr684 by polyamine transport protein kinase 2.

They include spermidine-preferential and putrescine-specific uptake systems as well as PotE (involved in the excretion of putrescine by a putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity) and CadB (involved in the excretion of cadaverine by a cadaverine-lysine antiporter activity). The former two transport systems function at neutral pH (2Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified four genes that encode polyamine excretion proteins TPO1-TPO4, mainly located on the plasma membrane (10Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y.

We also found that UGA4 (located on vacuoles) can catalyze the uptake of γ-aminobutyric acid and putrescine (13Uemura T. Tomonari Y. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and TPO5 (located on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles) can catalyze the excretion of polyamines (14Tachihara K. Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12637-12642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported that GAP1, located on the plasma membrane, can catalyze the uptake of putrescine and spermidine together with the uptake of amino acids (15Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that AGP2 can selectively catalyze the uptake of spermidine (16Aouida M. Leduc A. Poulin R. Ramotar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24267-24276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), there is also a report that AGP2 functions as an amino acid permease (17Schreve J.L. Garrett J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we looked for proteins that can preferentially catalyze the uptake of polyamines in S. cerevisiae. We found that DUR3 can catalyze the uptake of polyamines together with urea, and SAM3 (which belongs to the family of amino acid polyamine-organocation transporters (18Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)) can catalyze the uptake of putrescine and spermidine together with glutamic acid, lysine, and S-adenosylmethionine. Our results indicate that DUR3 and SAM3 are strongly involved in polyamine uptake in yeast. Plasmids—For construction of YEpDUR3, the gene for the DUR3 open reading frame and its upstream region (19van Vuuren H.J. Daugherty J.R. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7186-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from yeast X2180-1A (MATa SUC2 mal0 gal2 CUP1) genomic DNA as a template using primers DUR3F (5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGCCAAGACCAAAGGTTCT-3′) and DUR3R (5′-CGGGGTACCACGACAGAGATGCAAAAAATG-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and KpnI and inserted into the same restriction sites of the plasmid YEp352 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Plasmid YCp-DUR3-EGFP, which encodes enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 2The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CSD, completely synthetic dextrose; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DUR3, urea transporter; SAM3, S-adenosylmethionine transporter; PTK2, polyamine transport protein kinase 2. at the C terminus of the DUR3 open reading frame, was constructed as follows. The gene for DUR3 lacking the termination codon was amplified by PCR using primers DUR3F and DUR3-StopR (5′-CGGGGTACCAATTATTTCATCAACTTGTCCG-3′), digested with BamHI and KpnI, and inserted into the same sites of plasmid YEpEGFP (14Tachihara K. Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12637-12642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The DNA-encoding DUR3-EGFP fusion protein was amplified by PCR using primers DUR3F and BamHIUGA4-R (5′-CGCGGATCCATCTGCCATTAACATTCCC-3′), digested with BamHI, and inserted into the same site of the single copy plasmid YCp50 (21Burke R.L. Tekamp-Olson P. Najarian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2193-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For construction of YEpSAM3, the gene for the SAM3 open reading frame and its upstream region (22Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28096-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from yeast X2180-1A genomic DNA as a template using primers SAM3F (5′-CGCGGATCCCTTGGAAGTGAAAATATACGC-3′) and SAM3R (5′-CGGGGTACCCTTCGAGCTGTACTTTTCAT-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and KpnI and inserted into the same restriction sites of the plasmid YEp352. Plasmid YCpSAM3-EGFP was constructed as YCpDUR3-EGFP. Plasmid YEp-GAP1 was prepared as described previously (15Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the construction of YEpAGP2, the gene for AGP2 open reading frame and its upstream region (23van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema E.H. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from yeast X2180-1A genomic DNA as a template, using primers AGP2F (5′-AAACTGCAGTGAACCCTCTAACGAATTGC-3′) and AGP2R (5′-CGGGATCCCGGTAAAAGATCATAAAAAGC-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was digested with PstI and BamHI and inserted into the same restriction sites of the YEp352. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae YPH499 (MATa ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 trp1-Δ63 ura3-52)-carrying plasmid was cultured in Mg2+-limited CSD medium (24Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which contains 50 μm MgSO4 instead of 2 mm at 30 °C. In CSD medium, 20 mg/liter Arg, Met, Tyr, and Ile, 50 mg/liter Phe, 100 mg/liter Glu and Asp, 150 mg/liter Val, 200 mg/liter Thr, and 500 mg/liter Ser were included (24Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DUR3 and SAM3 gene-disrupted mutants of YPH499 were generated by one-step gene disruption (25Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 1-143Google Scholar) with the DUR3::hisG-URA3-hisG and SAM3::hisG-URA3-hisG PCR products. The DUR3::hisG-URA3-hisG and SAM3::hisG-URA3-hisG constructs were generated by inserting the DNA fragment encoding the hisG-URA3-hisG gene amplified by PCR from pNKY51 (26Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) using the primer set of HUHF (5′-GGAAGATCTATGTTAGACAACACCCGCTT-3′) and HUHR (5′-GGAAGATCTTCACTCCATCATCTTCTCGA-3′) in the BglII site of the DUR3 and SAM3 genes on YEpDUR3 and YEpSAM3. Plasmid pNKY51 was kindly supplied by Dr. N. Kleckner, Harvard University. DUR3 and SAM3 double gene-disrupted mutant was generated according to the method of Alani et al. (26Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The yeast strain carrying SAM3::hisG-URA3-hisG at the SAM3 locus was cultured in the presence of 0.1% 5-fluoro-orotic acid. Surviving cells showing URA- phenotype were used as the host strain for disruption of the DUR3 gene by the DUR3::hisG-URA3-hisG fragment. Resulting double gene-disrupted mutant was obtained by the selection of a 5-fluoro-orotic acid-resistant mutant, and DUR3 and SAM3 double gene-disrupted cells were obtained as URA- cells. The AGP2 or PTK2 gene-disrupted mutant of YPH499 was similarly generated by one-step gene disruption (25Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 1-143Google Scholar) with the AGP2::HIS3 or PTK2::HIS3 PCR product. AGP2::HIS3 or PTK2::HIS3 was constructed by inserting the XbaI fragment of the HIS3 gene into the same restriction site of AGP2 or PTK2. The XbaI site was introduced into the AGP2 gene in YEpAGP2 by PCR using primers XbaI-YEpAGP2F (5′-GCTCTAGAGGAAACGTGGTAAAGATCAC-3′) and XbaI-YEpAGP2R (5′-GCTCTAGATGACCCAGAAGGTTCCAA-3′). The SPE1 gene-disrupted mutant of YPH499, YPH499 Δdur3, YPH499 Δsam3, YPH499 Δdur3 Δsam3, YPH499 Δgap1 (15Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and YPH499 Δagp2 were generated by the same method using the SPE1::LEU2 construct. The SPE1::LEU2 construct was amplified by PCR using the primer sets of SPE1F (5′-CGCGGATCCTCGCCAAGAAAGCAAGAT-3′) and SPE1R (5′-AAAACTGCAGCAACACTTCGTATCTTTCCA-3′) from genomic DNA of Y363 (MATa ura3-52 his6 leu2 Δspe1::LEU2) (27Balasundaram D. Dinman J.D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7126-7128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. H. Tabor, National Institutes of Health. Correct disruption of genes was verified by PCR. As the occasion demanded, 20 mg/liter of adenine sulfate, uracil, His, Leu, Lys, and/or Trp were added to the medium. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the DUR3 Gene—Site-directed mutagenesis of the DUR3 gene was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the CEQ8000 genetic analysis system (Beckman-Coulter). A list of oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis has not been included but is available from the authors upon request. Sequencing of PTK2 Gene—The DNA fragment encoding the PTK2 gene amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of YTM22-8 cells (28Kakinuma Y. Maruyama T. Nozaki T. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using primer sets of PTK2F (5′-CAGTTTTTTACAGGTTAACCG-3′) and PTK2R (5′-AAGAGGGAATTAAAGAAGTCC-3′) was cloned into pSTBlue-1 cloning vector with the Perfectly Blunt cloning kit (Novagen). The sequence of the PTK2 gene was analyzed by the CEQ8000 genetic analysis system. Transport Assay—Yeast cells were harvested at the exponential growth phase (A540 = 0.5), washed three times with 20 mm Na/MES buffer, pH 5.0, containing 10 mm glucose, suspended at 0.2 mg protein/ml in the same buffer, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by the addition of labeled substrates. After incubation for 20, 40, or 60 min, a 0.5-ml aliquot of reactions was filtered through a cellulose acetate filter (pore size 0.45 μm Advantec) and washed twice with 2 ml of the buffer described above containing 10-fold concentrations of non-labeled substrates. The radioactivity on the filter was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. When substrate specificity was tested, an amino acid mixture or a single amino acid was added to the reaction mixture at the concentration of 0.5 mm. The concentration and specific activities of substrates were as follows: 0.5 mm [14C]putrescine (37 MBq/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and 0.1 mm [14C]spermidine (37 MBq/mmol, GE Healthcare). Where indicated, the SPE1 gene-disrupted mutant was used instead of YPH499 cells. The mutant was cultured in CSD medium in the absence and presence of 1 mm putrescine, 0.05 mm spermidine, or 0.01 mm spermine and harvested at A540 = 0.5. Measurement of Polyamine Contents in Whole Cells—YPH499, Δspe1, Δdur3Δspe1, Δsam3Δspe1, Δdur3Δsam3Δspe1, Δgap1Δspe1, and Δagp2Δspe1 mutants were grown in the CSD medium in the absence and presence of 0.05 mm putrescine and harvested at A540 = 0.25. Polyamines were extracted by treatment with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 70 °C for 1 h. Polyamine contents were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (29Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis of DUR3, SAM3, GAP1, and AGP2 mRNAs—The SPE1 gene-disrupted mutants and YPH499 cells carrying YEpDUR3, YEpSAM3, YEpGAP1, or YEpAGP2 were harvested at the exponential growth phase (A540 = 0.25), washed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 m sorbitol, and then resuspended in the same buffer at 5 × 108 cells/ml. After incubation with 40 μg/ml zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo) at 30 °C for 30 min, RNA was extracted from the spheroplast with an RNAqueous MiDi-Kit (Ambion). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (31Suzuki T. Sadakata Y. Kashiwagi K. Hoshino K. Kakinuma Y. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling and detection system (GE Healthcare) with 20 μg of total RNA. Genes of DUR3, SAM3, GAP1, AGP2, and ACT1 were amplified by PCR using primer sets of DUR3F and DUR3R for DUR3, SAM3F and SAM3R for SAM3, GAP1F and GAP1R for GAP1 (15Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), AGP2F and AGP2R for AGP2, ACT1-P1 (5′-GGAATAAATAGGGGCTTGA-3′) and ACT1-P2 (5′-AAGAAGATTGAGCAGCGGT-3′) for ACT1, respectively, and genomic DNA of X2180-1A as a template. The size of the DUR3, SAM3, GAP1, AGP2, and ACT1 PCR products was 2.9, 2.5, 2.4, 2.0, and 0.9 kbp, respectively. PCR products were used as templates for probes. Chemical luminescence was detected by a LAS-1000 plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film). Western Blot Analysis—YPH499 and YPH499 Δptk2 cells carrying either YEpDUR3-EGFP or YEp352 were cultured and harvested at A540 = 0.5. Membranes were prepared according to the method of Graschopf et al. (32Graschopf A. Stadler J.A. Hoellerer M.K. Eder S. Sieghardt M. Kohlwein S.D. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16216-16222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of protein of the membranes were separated on a 8.5% SDSpolyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore). DUR3-EGFP and phosphoserine and phosphothreonine of DUR3-EGFP were detected by the ECL plus Western blot analysis system (GE Healthcare) using anti-GFP (clone GFP-20; Sigma), antiphosphoserine (Zymed), anti-phosphothreonine (Zymed), respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy—DUR3 and SAM3 gene-disrupted YPH499 cells carrying plasmid YCpDUR3-EGFP or YCp-SAM3-EGFP were grown to the early logarithmic phase (A540 = 0.25) in CSD medium and mounted on the poly-l-lysine-coated slide glass (Muto-Glass). EGFP fluorescence was observed under an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with fluorescence optics U-LH100 HGAPO. Images were acquired directly with a cooled CCD camera DP70 (Olympus). Polyamine Uptake by DUR3 and SAM3—We searched for genes encoding a polyamine-preferential transporter among the genes that code for proteins with at least twelve putative transmembrane segments. These included DUR3 and SAM3. As shown in Fig. 1, cells overexpressing DUR3 and SAM3 had a higher uptake of putrescine and spermidine compared with the parent strain. Conversely, cells in which the DUR3 or SAM3 gene was disrupted had lower uptake of putrescine and spermidine than the parent strain. When both the DUR3 and SAM3 genes were disrupted, putrescine and spermidine uptake activities were clearly decreased compared with the parent strain (Fig. 1). These results indicate that DUR3 and SAM3 are involved in polyamine transport, presumably functioning directly as polyamine transporters, although DUR3 and SAM3 have been reported to be an urea and an S-adenosylmethionine transporter, respectively (22Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28096-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Rousselet G. Simon M. Ripoche P. Buhler J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were then determined. As shown in Table 1, the Km and Vmax values of DUR3 for putrescine and spermidine uptake were 479 and 21.2 μm and 2.27 and 0.85 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The Km and Vmax values of SAM3 for putrescine and spermidine uptake were 433 and 20.7 μm and 1.10 and 0.76 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. These values were similar to those reported for GAP1 (15Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Urea and spermidine inhibited putrescine uptake by DUR3 with Ki values of 60.3 and 23.2 μm, respectively. S-Adenosylmethionine and spermidine inhibited putrescine uptake by SAM3 with Ki values of 26.3 and 39.1 μm, respectively. The results suggest that urea was less effectively recognized than spermidine by DUR3, and S-adenosylmethionine was recognized similar to spermidine by SAM3. Spermine uptake activity by DUR3 and SAM3 was low (data not shown), so the correct Km value for spermine could not be obtained. However, judging from the Ki value of spermine for putrescine and spermidine uptake, the Km value of DUR3 and SAM3 for spermine is probably between 4 and 10 μm.TABLE 1Determination of Km and Vmax values of putrescine and spermidine uptake by DUR3 and SAM3GeneSubstrateKmaData shown are the mean ± S.

As shown in Fig. 2, putrescine transport by DUR3 was not influenced by amino acids each at 0.5 mm. However, putrescine transport by SAM3 was inhibited by five kinds of polar and charged amino acids at 0.5 mm each. Thus, the effects of five individual amino acids on putrescine uptake by SAM3 were tested. It was found that putrescine uptake by SAM3 was inhibited by glutamic acid and to a lesser extent by lysine. The results suggest that DUR3 is a selective polyamine transporter, and SAM3 is a polyamine preferential uptake protein, because urea and S-adenosylmethionine do not normally exist at high levels in the environment. Subcellular Localization of DUR3 and SAM3—Localization of DUR3 and SAM3 was determined by fluorescence microscopy using DUR3-EGFP and SAM3-EGFP fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, strong fluorescence was observed on the plasma membrane with both DUR3-EGFP and SAM3-EGFP. For DUR3, fluorescence was also observed in vacuoles, suggesting that DUR3 may be rapidly degraded. The uptake of putrescine in cells expressing the DUR3-EGFP and SAM3-EGFP constructs was similar to that observed with DUR3 and SAM3 (data not shown). To confirm that DUR3 and SAM3 exist on the plasma membrane but not on the vacuolar membrane, we next compared the effect of azide, an uncoupler of the respiratory chain in mitochondria, with that of bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (34Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, putrescine uptake by DUR3 and SAM3 was strongly inhibited by azide but not by bafilomycin A1. The results confirm that SAM3 and DUR3 are located on the plasma membrane but not on the vacuolar membrane and that polyamine uptake is energy-dependent. Repression of DUR3 and SAM3 mRNAs by Polyamines—It is known that polyamine uptake by E. coli (35Antognoni F. Del Duca S. Kuraishi A. Kawabe E. Fukuchi-Shimogori T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1942-1948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (36Kakinuma Y. Hoshino K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is repressed by intracellular polyamines through the inhibition of mRNA synthesis. In a polyamine-requiring mutant, which is deficient in ornithine decarboxylase (Δspe1 mutant), polyamine uptake by DUR3 and SAM3 was also repressed by polyamines (Fig. 5A). Thus, the level of DUR3 and SAM3 mRNAs in cells cultured in the presence or absence of polyamines was measured. As shown in Fig. 5B, overexpression of DUR3 mRNA or SAM3 mRNA was observed in cells carrying YEpDUR3 or YEpSAM3 and the level of DUR3 mRNA was strongly repressed and that of SAM3 mRNA was weakly repressed by polyamines in both cells, whereas levels of GAP1, AGP2, and ACT1 mRNAs were not affected by polyamines. The decrease in putrescine uptake activity due to the accumulation of polyamines in cells was parallel with the decrease in the expression of DUR3 and SAM3 mRNAs (Fig. 5). These results further support the conclusion that DUR3 and SAM3 are indeed polyamine transporters. Significance of DUR3, SAM3, GAP1, and AGP2 for Polyamine Transport—To date, the existence of four polyamine uptake proteins in yeast, DUR3, SAM3, GAP1, and AGP2 has been reported. Thus, the relative importance of each of these four proteins for polyamine uptake was estimated using cells transformed with each gene. Expression of GAP1 mRNA was slightly higher than that of AGP2, DUR3, and SAM3 mRNAs in YPH499 cells (Fig. 5B). However, polyamine uptake was higher in cells transformed with DUR3 or SAM3 than in cells transformed with GAP1 or AGP2 (Table 2). Furthermore, polyamine uptake in cells transformed with GAP1 or AGP2 was greatly decreased when 20 amino acids at 10 μm each were added to the reaction mixture.TABLE 2Polyamine uptake activity of YPH499 cells transformed with DUR3, SAM3, GAP1 or AGP2GeneAmino acidsPolyamine uptake activityaActivity of YPH499/YEp352 was subtracted from the activity of YPH499 carrying YEpDUR3, YEpSAM3, YEpGAP1, or YEpAGP2.

Open table in a new tab Stimulation of the cell growth of a polyamine-requiring mutant Δspe1 YPH499 by putrescine was then tested. As shown in Fig. 6A, stimulation of cell growth by 0.05 mm putrescine was observed in Δspe1, Δspe1 Δgap1, and Δspe1 Δagp1 mutants, but cell growth of Δspe1 Δdur3 and Δspe1 Δsam3 mutants in the presence of 0.05 mm putrescine was slow. In the Δspe1 Δdur3 Δsam3 triple mutant, stimulation of cell growth by putrescine was negligible. Cell growth was parallel with polyamine content in cells (Fig. 6B). These results confirm that DUR3 and SAM3 are major polyamine uptake systems in yeast. Regulation of the Polyamine Uptake Activity of DUR3 by PTK2—We previously reported that the polyamine uptake activity of a mutant YTM22-8, which has low polyamine uptake activity (28Kakinuma Y. Maruyama T. Nozaki T. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was recovered by transforming the PTK2 gene encoding a Ser/Thr protein kinase (37Nozaki T. Nishimura K. Michael A.J. Maruyama T. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the nucleotide sequence of PTK2 in YTM22-8 was determined. It was found that Gly-735, which is located on a close position of the active site of PTK2 (37Nozaki T. Nishimura K. Michael A.J. Maruyama T. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was mutated to Asp (Fig. 7A), and the mutated PTK2 did not recover the polyamine uptake activity of YTM22-8 (Fig. 7B). Thereafter, it was tested whether polyamine uptake activity of DUR3, SAM3, GAP1, and AGP2 was regulated by PTK2. As shown in Fig. 7C, polyamine uptake activity by DUR3 (but not by SAM3, GAP1, and AGP2) was low in the Δptk2 mutant, indicating that DUR3 activity is regulated by PTK2. Thereafter, phosphorylation site(s) of DUR3 by PTK2 was determined by replacing seven candidate Ser and Thr residues (38Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with Ala (Fig. 8A). It was found that putrescine uptake activity of DUR3 mutants T250A, S251A, and T684A decreased significantly, and the activity was recovered with DUR3 mutants T250E, S251E, T250/S251E, and T684E (Fig. 8B). Because the activity of the double mutant T250/S251E was higher than that of the single mutant T250E or S251E, phosphorylation in both the Thr-250 and Ser-251 sites is necessary for the maximal activity of DUR3. Furthermore, putrescine uptake activity was enhanced with DUR3 mutants T250E, S251E, T250/S251E, and T684E in the Δptk2 mutant (Fig. 8C). Thereafter, it was tested whether DUR3 is phosphorylated in wild-type YPH499 cells (but not in the low polyamine transport mutant YPH499 Δptk2) using DUR3-EGFP fusion protein and antibodies against EGFP, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine. Although almost the same level of DUR3-EGFP fusion protein (83 kDa) was expressed in both cells, phosphorylation of Ser and Thr of the DUR3-EGFP fusion protein was only observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 8D). The results indicate that the activity of DUR3 is regulated by PTK2 through phosphorylation of Thr-250, Ser-251, and Thr-684. These three amino acid residues were located in the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 8A). It has recently been reported that GAP1 (15Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and AGP2 (16Aouida M. Leduc A. Poulin R. Ramotar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24267-24276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) can catalyze the uptake of polyamines together with amino acids in yeast. However, polyamine uptake by these proteins was greatly decreased when amino acids were present in the medium. Thus, we tried to identify polyamine-preferential transporters and found that DUR3 and SAM3 are polyamine-preferential transporters. DUR3 and SAM3 were originally reported as transporters for urea and S-adenosylmethionine (19van Vuuren H.J. Daugherty J.R. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7186-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Rousselet G. Simon M. Ripoche P. Buhler J.-M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, normally urea and S-adenosylmethionine do not exist at high levels outside cells. Thus, DUR3 and SAM3 normally function as polyamine transporters. This became much clearer with the finding that polyamine stimulation of the cell growth of a polyamine-requiring mutant Δspe1 YPH499 was inhibited by disrupting DUR3 and SAM3 genes but not by GAP1 and AGP2 genes. Furthermore, expression of DUR3 and SAM3 mRNAs was repressed in the presence of polyamines. Thus, accumulation of polyamines by DUR3 and SAM3 in the presence of relatively high concentrations of polyamines was reduced. Such autoregulation of the expression of mRNAs for polyamine transporters was also observed in E. coli and mammalian cells (35Antognoni F. Del Duca S. Kuraishi A. Kawabe E. Fukuchi-Shimogori T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1942-1948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Kakinuma Y. Hoshino K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This characteristic is presumably effective in maintaining an optimal concentration of polyamines in cells. In experiments using cells with disruption of both the DUR3 and SAM3 genes, the total uptake of putrescine could be accounted for by the sum of putrescine uptake by DUR3 and SAM3. However, in the case of spermidine, total uptake could not be explained by the sum of uptake via DUR3 and SAM3. Spermidine uptake was not significantly decreased in the presence of 20 amino acids at 10 μm each, indicating that residual uptake of spermidine was not due to the activity of GAP1 and AGP2. Thus, another, as yet unidentified, spermidine uptake protein probably exists in yeast. Experiments are in progress to identify that transporter. It is noted that polyamine uptake by DUR3 is regulated by phosphorylation by PTK2. We previously reported that polyamine transport activity is low with the PTK2-deficient mutant YTM22-8 (37Nozaki T. Nishimura K. Michael A.J. Maruyama T. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This was because of the inhibition of DUR3 activity. PTK2 enhanced the polyamine uptake activity of DUR3 through phosphorylation of Thr-250, Ser-251, and Thr-684 in DUR3. Similarly, polyamine excretion activity of TPO1 was regulated by phosphorylation of Ser-19, Thr-85, and Ser-342 in TPO1 by protein kinase C, casein kinase 1, and cAMPdependent protein kinases 1 and 2 (12Uemura T. Tachihara K. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9646-9652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that optimal concentration of polyamines in cells is regulated by phosphorylation with various protein kinases. The location and activities of polyamine transport proteins thus far identified in yeast are summarized in Fig. 9. Uptake of polyamines is mainly catalyzed by DUR3 and SAM3, and excretion of polyamines is mainly catalyzed by TPO5 on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles (14Tachihara K. Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12637-12642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and TPO1 on the plasma membrane (12Uemura T. Tachihara K. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in cervids are caused by prions, infectious particles thought to be composed only of a misfolded form (PrPSc) 2The abbreviation used is: PrP, prion protein. of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) (1Prusiner S.B.

Several fundamental properties of prion diseases remain poorly understood, including the molecular mechanism through which prions replicate. In the favored model of prion propagation, PrPSc serves the role of a template, sequestering endogenous PrPC and, possibly in the presence of non-PrP auxiliary molecules (4Telling G.C. Scott M.

Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), triggering its conformational rearrangement into nascent PrPSc and prion infectivity. Experimental observations of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy biology strongly suggest that prion replication is a tightly choreographed process. This concept is perhaps best supported by the persistence of different prion strains, each of which exhibits distinct disease phenotypes as defined by incubation times, features of clinical disease, neuropathological targeting, and physicochemical properties, which all remain stable over serial transmission (7Telling G.C. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 222.1-222.3Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Proponents of the protein-only paradigm for prion transmission and pathology argue that relatively subtle differences in the conformation of prions, faithfully preserved through multiple rounds of self-replication, can largely account for strain diversity (8Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S.

Implicit in this view of prion propagation is a direct and specific binding interaction between PrPC and PrPSc. In vitro, PrPC has long been known to bind selectively to PrPSc and, as a consequence, to convert to a protease-resistant state, albeit inefficiently (13Horiuchi M. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). More recently, increasingly effective methodologies for PrPSc-driven conformational conversion of PrPC in vitro have been reported (6Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 14Castilla J. Saa P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). One corollary of the templating model of PrPSc replication is that disrupting the association between heterologous normal and disease-associated PrP conformers should abrogate prion propagation. Indeed, prion propagation is efficiently inhibited both in cultures of prioninfected cells and in vivo by certain PrP-specific antibody molecules or their Fab fragments (15Peretz D. Williamson R.A.

We had previously posited that the most actively inhibitory Fab antibodies are distinguished from less potently inhibitory Fabs in that they bind to distinct regions of PrPC that likely interact directly with PrPSc and, in so doing, most efficiently prevent assembly of the prion replicative complex. To test this supposition experimentally, PrP sequences containing the epitopes recognized by two highly inhibitory PrPC-specific antibodies, Fabs D13 and D18 (15Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), were independently grafted into a recipient antibody scaffold. Binding studies with the resulting hybrid antibody-PrP molecules, denoted as IgG-(89–112) and IgG-(136–158) in accordance with each grafted PrP sequence, indicate that the reagents efficiently recognize infectious fractions of PrPSc but not PrPC (19Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutation or scrambling of the PrP sequence grafts within the antibody scaffold abolishes reactivity with abnormal PrP conformers. The defined specificity of these two PrP motif-grafted antibody reagents has been further demonstrated in immunohistochemical analysis of prion-infected brain tissues (20Moroncini G. Mangieri M. Morbin M. Mazzoleni G. Ghetti B. Gabrielli A. Williamson R.A. Giaconne G. Tagliavini F. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in binding studies differentiating between recombinant PrP conformers mimicking PrPC and PrPSc (21Novitskaya V. Makarava N. Bellon A. Bocharova O.V. Bronstein I.B. Williamson R.A. Baskakov I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15536-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overall, these data strongly suggest that the polypeptide sequences within the 89–112 and 136–158 regions of PrPC, as bound by the prion inhibitory Fabs and as grafted into the antibody scaffold, are critical components of one face of the PrPC-PrPSc prion replicative interface. The finding that grafting selected PrP polypeptide sequences into a recipient antibody scaffold could successfully generate PrPSc-reactive reagents suggested an experimental approach through which it would be possible to perform a complete and systematic molecular analysis of PrP sequence, with the aim of accurately identifying all PrPC regions directly participating in the critically important PrPC-PrPSc binding interaction. Thus, a comprehensive panel of PrP motif-grafted antibodies were prepared that together contained successive and overlapping PrP sequences between residues 23 and 231. The reactivity of these antibodies against disease-associated conformers of PrP identified three distinct binding motifs. These motifs were further characterized by the production of additional grafted antibodies containing mutated and truncated PrP sequence. Preparation of Motif-grafted Antibodies—With the use of overlap extension PCR, sequential 24-mer polypeptides of mouse PrP sequence, collectively representing amino acid residues 19–231, were each grafted into the antibody b12 protein scaffold, replacing native heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) of the original antibody as described (19Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using this approach, a panel totaling over 20 different PrP-grafted antibodies was initially generated. In each consecutive antibody in the series, the grafted PrP sequences overlapped by 15 residues from the C terminus. An additional PrP-antibody was also prepared, composed of PrP residues 172–196, incorporating all of the amino acid determinants of helix C of PrPC in a single graft. When necessary, to avoid unwanted problems of antibody aggregation, free cysteine residues occurring in grafted PrP sequence were mutated to alanine residues. Additional antibodies containing truncations and modifications of the initial PrP peptide grafts were prepared using the same methodology. The sequences of the oligonucleotide PCR primer pairs employed to generate individual PrP-grafted antibodies are provided as supplemental information. Antibody Expression and Purification—Antibody expression was performed by transient transfection of a suspension of 293 human embryonic kidney cells in a serum-free medium (Free-Style 293 Expression System, Invitrogen) with the pDR12 vector containing the b12 light chain gene and PrP-grafted b12 human γ1 heavy chain sequences. Generally, 30 μg of plasmid DNA suspended in FreeStyle 293 expression medium was used to transfect a total of 3 × 107 293 cells at a final cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. If necessary, to enhance antibody expression, 293 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of pAdVantage vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 8% CO2 with rotation at 125 rpm. Cells were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection, and the culture supernatant was cleared by centrifugation. Antibody was purified from clarified supernatant over a clone-dedicated protein A-Sepharose column, eluted from the resin in the presence of 0.1 m citric acid, pH 3.0, brought to neutral pH with the addition of 2 m Tris base (adjusted to pH 8.0 with 37% w/v HCl), dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then passed through a 0.22-μm filter and stored at -80 °C until needed. Immunoprecipitation of PrP—IgG antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate PrP from the brains of RML prion-infected and uninfected mice as described (19Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To facilitate the comparison between different experiments, homogenates prepared from the brains of five different prion-infected mice were pooled, aliquoted, frozen at -80 °C, and used throughout the study. Final concentrations of antibody in the immunoprecipitation experiments varied between 3 and 10 μg/ml as indicated in the text. Throughout this study, to reduce the possibility of nonspecific binding interactions between the PrP-grafted antibodies and PrP, binding studies were performed in the presence of a final concentration of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Nomenclature—The numbering of amino acid residues corresponds to that of Syrian hamster PrP throughout. Constructing a Panel of PrP-grafted IgGs—We have previously described how replacing the HCDR3 portion of the human immunodeficiency virus-1-specific antibody b12 with certain PrP polypeptides can impart upon the recipient protein scaffold specific reactivity with disease-associated PrP conformers but not with PrPC (19Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Moroncini G. Mangieri M. Morbin M. Mazzoleni G. Ghetti B. Gabrielli A. Williamson R.A. Giaconne G. Tagliavini F. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In those earlier studies, two PrP-grafted IgGs were prepared that displayed PrP peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 89–112 or 136–158 and containing the respective binding epitopes of the PrP-specific and prion-inhibitory antibodies D13 and D18. The success of this approach suggested its more broad and systematic application, with the aim of finely mapping all PrP sequences that complex with PrPSc but not with PrPC and that are likely to participate directly in assembly of the prion replicative complex. Thus, a comprehensive series of 20 additional PrP-grafted antibody molecules was prepared. Collectively, as shown in Fig. 1, the grafted antibody panel contained overlapping PrP polypeptides, typically 24 mers, spanning the full-length of the mature PrPC molecule from residue 23 to 231. Each successive PrP graft overlapped 15 residues from the C terminus of the previous graft. Selection of Detergent Environment for PrP Extraction and Binding Studies—Reactivity of the PrP-grafted antibody panel was determined against detergent-extracted disease-associated and cellular PrP conformers. Throughout these binding experiments, we have attempted to reduce the unwanted possibility of identifying nonspecific interactions between the PrP grafted-antibodies and abnormal PrP conformers. This is an important consideration for this study; Shaked et al. (22Shaked Y. Engelstein R. Gabizon R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have clearly demonstrated that an unsuitable detergent environment can promote artifactual binding interactions with disease-associated PrP conformers. These authors posited that the observed non-specific binding derives largely from the propensity of PrPSc to aggregate under detergent extraction conditions that disrupt lipid membrane rafts within which the disease-associated PrP conformers are thought to exist (22Shaked Y. Engelstein R. Gabizon R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, the use of detergents such as Nonidet P-40 in combination with deoxycholate or Tween 20 was observed to promote aggregation of PrPSc, thereby abetting nonspecific binding interactions, possibly through avidity effects resulting from multiple low affinity interactions with individual constituents of the PrP aggregate. In contrast, such nonspecific interactions were absent under experimental conditions in which tissue homogenates were prepared in the presence of Triton X-100, which is believed to preserve membrane microdomain integrity and limit PrP aggregation. Indeed, troublingly, the influence of the detergent environment upon PrP binding interactions was overlooked in subsequent studies in which generalized nonspecific binding between monoclonal antibodies of various specificities and PrPSc in Nonidet P-40/deoxycholate-extracted homogenates of prion-infected tissues were reported (23Morel N. Simon S. Frobert Y. Volland H. Mourton-Gilles C. Negro A. Sorgato M.C. Creminon C. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30143-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have thus sought to minimize the probability of misidentifying regions of PrP sequence with robust affinity for PrPSc by reacting low concentrations of PrP grafted-antibody with PrP extracted from prion-infected tissues in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 rather than Nonidet P-40/deoxycholate. Three High Affinity PrPSc Recognition Motifs Are Located between PrP Residues 23 and 231—The 20 different antibodies that composed our principal PrP motif-grafted IgG panel were individually evaluated in an immunoprecipitation assay for an ability to bind to PrPC, PrPSc, and PrP 27–30 present in detergent-extracted homogenates of RML scrapie prion-infected mouse brain. Precipitated PrP was then detected by Western blot. The results of these binding assays, performed at pH 7.4, are shown in Fig. 2. It is immediately apparent from the immunoprecipitation data that whereas certain PrP sequence grafts bind robustly to PrPSc and PrP 27–30, others do not bind at all. The results identify three binding motifs recognizing PrPSc and PrP 27–30 with apparent high affinity. The first of these occurs at the extreme N terminus of PrP and is represented by a graft of PrP residues 19–33. The second and third of these motifs are equivalent to those we identified and reported previously and are contained within segments of PrP sequence composed of amino acids 89–112 and 136–158 (19Moroncini G.

IgGs containing the 19–33, 89–112, and 136–158 grafts robustly precipitated PrPSc and PrP 27–30 when used at final concentrations of 3 μg/ml (20 nm) and below. Under identical experimental conditions, none of these three grafted antibodies, or indeed any other PrP-grafted IgG, bound to PrPC in brain homogenates equivalently prepared from uninfected normal mice (data not shown). Corroborative evidence also suggesting an important role for the extreme N-terminal region of PrP (residues 23–33) in PrPC-PrPSc interactions is provided by the study of Feraudet et al. (18Feraudet C. Morel N. Simon S. Volland H. Frobert Y. Creminon C. Vilette D. Lehmann S. Grassi J. J. Biol.

In their study, a monoclonal antibody, BR210, specifically recognizing an epitope composed of residues 26–34 of ovine PrP (KRPKPGGGW), which corresponds to mouse PrP sequence 24–31 (KRPKPGGW), is shown to inhibit ovine prion replication in Rov9 cells (18Feraudet C.

The study with the BR210 antibody extends the work of Peretz et al. (15Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M.

Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), where the prion inhibitory capacity of the D13 and D18 antibodies first highlighted a potential role for the 89–112 and 136–158 regions of PrPC in binding to PrPSc during prion replication. IgG scaffolds containing PrP grafts corresponding to the octarepeat region of the protein, specifically residues 49–72, 59–82, 69–92, or 79–102, immunoprecipitated PrP 27–30 only very weakly and PrPSc not at all (Fig. 2). Antibodies containing all other regions of PrP, corresponding approximately to residues 29–62, 110–136, and 158–231, appear to have absolutely no intrinsic affinity for disease-associated forms of PrP and do not precipitate detectable levels of PrPSc or PrP 27–30 (Fig. 2). Next, to more clearly define the nature of the core PrPSc recognition motifs identified from within our initial motif-grafted IgG panel, further series of grafted antibodies were generated. These molecules contained truncations and mutations of the PrP-(19–33), -(89–112), and -(136–158)-grafted polypeptides demonstrated to interact strongly with abnormal PrP conformers. Point Mutations Indicate the 19–33 and 89–112 PrP Polypeptide Grafts Require Positive Charge to Bind PrPSc—A cursory examination of the amino acid composition of the PrPSc-reactive 19–33 and 89–112 PrP sequence grafts indicated that at near neutral pH both of these peptides possess a net charge of +4, whereas under similar conditions the 136–158 graft is uncharged. In the 19–33 PrP peptide, these charges derive from three lysine residues at positions 23, 24, and 27 and an arginine residue at position 25. In the 89–112 peptide, there are four lysine residues, at positions 101, 104, 106, and 110. We have previously shown that collectively substituting each lysine for an alanine residue in the 89–112 graft abolishes antibody binding to PrPSc and PrP 27–30 (19Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution made by each individual positively charged amino acid to the 89–112-PrPSc binding interaction, a series of additional 89–112 antibody grafts were prepared. These molecules contained singular lysine to alanine substitutions at position 101, 104, 106, or 110. As shown in Fig. 3A, the replacement of any single lysine residue was sufficient to severely impair the reactivity of the motif-grafted IgGs with abnormally folded PrP. What little reactivity with PrPSc and PrP 27–30 remained after singular lysine to alanine replacements in the 89–112 graft was totally abrogated by substituting any two of the four lysine residues with alanine (Fig. 3B). Predictably, antibodies containing a 19–33 PrP graft in which the three lysine residues found and single arginine residue in this sequence were also each replaced by alanine residues similarly failed to recognize disease-associated PrP conformers in an immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3C). Further Analysis of the PrP-(89–112) Binding Motif Reveals a Core Recognition Sequence Composed of Amino Acids 98–110—Replacement mutations identified four lysine residues within the 89–112 PrP graft as key elements of the PrPSc binding motif located within this polypeptide. These four positively charged residues are all contained within the 101–110 segment of PrP. To determine whether any sequence outside of this short fragment contributes to PrPSc and PrP 27–30 recognition, a number of additional antibodies were prepared containing truncations of the 89–112 sequence. Reactivity of this modified PrP-grafted IgG panel with PrPSc and PrP 27–30 is shown in Fig. 4. Analysis of antibodies bearing PrP grafts 95–112 or 89–105 indicated that residues between positions 89 and 94 were not important for recognition of misfolded PrP in prion-infected brains, whereas residues between position 105 and 112 did contribute to the robustness of the binding interaction between the 89–112 graft and PrPSc/PrP 27–30. These data were consistent with that presented in Fig. 3, which implied that an important role in PrPSc recognition was performed by lysine residues at positions 106 and 110. In additional support for this conclusion, a PrP-(95–105) graft also bound the abnormal PrP conformers relatively poorly, whereas IgG bearing a PrP-(100–110) graft bound well. In the light of these observations, however, it was unexpected to find that an IgG displaying a PrP-(98–105) graft repeatedly reacted well with both PrPSc and PrP 27–30, despite the loss of the two lysine residues at positions 106 and 110, which was critical to recognition of the disease-associated forms of PrP within the context of the 89–112 graft (Fig. 3). The clone encoding the IgG-(98–105) graft was in fact resequenced, retransfected into 293 cells, and repurified, with the resulting antibody again yielding the same binding results. Nevertheless, when viewed collectively, binding data produced using the various truncations and mutations of the original PrP-(89–112) antibody graft indicate that a core PrPSc recognition motif lies within PrP residues 98–110. Key Components of the PrP-(136–158) Binding Motif—Earlier work indicated that reactivity of a 136–158 PrP antibody graft with disease-associated PrP conformers was abolished following truncation of five N-terminal amino acid residues between positions 136 and 140 (19Moroncini G. Kanu N. Solforosi L. Abalos G. Telling G.C. Head M. Ironside J. Brockes J.P. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, antibody containing a 139–162 graft was nonreactive with abnormally folded PrP in scrapie prion-infected brains (Fig. 5). To identify the importance to PrPSc recognition of individual amino acids lying between positions 136 and 140 of PrP, residues within this segment of a 136–158 antibody graft were collectively and individually replaced by alanine. The resulting six novel grafted antibodies were reacted with PrPSc and PrP 27–30 as shown in Fig. 5. The data illustrate that when PrP residues 136–140 were all replaced by alanine, reactivity with abnormal PrP was abolished. As compared with the level of reactivity seen with IgG-(136–158), individual alanine substitutions at positions 136, 138, and 140 normally occupied by arginine, methionine, and histidine residues, respectively, significantly diminished reactivity to PrPSc and, to a lesser extent, to PrP 27–30. In contrast, alanine substitutions at positions 137 and 139, normally represented by proline and isoleucine residues, had very little impact upon binding to either PrPSc or PrP 27–30 as compared with the original IgG-(136–158) molecule. It also appears clear, however, from the nonreactivity of IgG-(119–142) and –(129–152) that the PrP sequence between residues 136 and 140 is insufficient in and of itself for recognition of disease-associated PrP conformers. Indeed, the data indicate that the PrP sequence between residues 141 and 158 can contribute to PrPSc and PrP 27–30 recognition. Firstly, antibodies bearing a grafted polypeptide composed of PrP residues 136–149 or 136–154 bound more weakly than IgG-(136–158) (data not shown). In addition, an antibody bearing a PrP-(149–172) peptide graft, but not a PrP-(159–182) graft, recognized both PrPSc and PrP 27–30 consistently but relatively more weakly than IgG-(136–158) (Fig. 2). Therefore, some contribution was likely made by PrP residues 149–158 as well as 136–140 to binding of disease-associated forms of PrP by the 136–158 graft. Prion replication is a high fidelity process thought to be driven by the templated self-replication of PrPSc. Central to these events is the sequestration of PrPC by PrPSc and consequent conformational rearrangement of the captured species. The nature of the binding interaction between the diverse PrPC and PrPSc conformers hitherto has been undefined. In this study we present a systematic analysis of regions of PrPC that can interact specifically with disease-associated misfolded PrP molecules found in the brains of prion-infected mice but not with endogenous PrPC. Our approach has been to graft successive and overlapping PrP polypeptide fragments spanning the length of the entire PrP molecule into an IgG molecule that serves as a protein scaffold within which the grafted PrP fragments are displayed. Initially a panel of some 20 PrP-grafted IgGs was prepared and measured for binding in an immunoprecipitation assay to PrPSc, to its proteinase K-resistant core PrP 27–30, and to PrPC. These experiments immediately identified three distinct and well defined PrPSc binding motifs represented within PrP grafts containing residues 19–33, 89–112, and 136–158. PrP grafts containing sequences outside of these three regions imparted little or no detectable reactivity with PrPSc or with PrP 27–30. In particular, using the motif-grafting approach, PrP sequences between amino acid residues 29 and 49, 110 and 136, and 158 and 231 do not appear to interact directly with abnormal forms of PrP. However, within our experimental system, there is no direct evidence that the constrained antibody-grafted polypeptide fragments of PrP assume the same conformations and therefore behave in an equivalent manner as the corresponding sequences within an intact PrPC molecule. Additional binding studies performed with PrP-grafted antibodies containing mutations and truncations of the three PrPSc binding motifs identified by using the initial panel of 20 PrP-grafted IgGs have further defined the core components of these binding regions. For example, the two N-terminal PrPSc recognition peptide motifs 19–33 and 89–112 bear a net positive charge, and elimination or reduction of this charge by exchanging lysine and arginine residues for alanine residues severely reduced or abolished reactivity with misassembled PrP conformers. In addition, the core binding motif within the 89–112 graft appears to lie between residues 98 and 110. Further, the reactivity of IgGs containing truncations and mutations of the original 136–158 PrP graft suggests that PrPSc recognition via this motif is chiefly facilitated through two segments of sequence composed of residues 136–140 and 149–158. Certainly, modest truncations from either the N- or C-terminal ends of the PrP-(136–158) graft severely diminished interaction with PrPSc. Overall, the experimental data presented here suggest that the C-terminal portion of PrPC, incorporating helices B and C, from residue 159–231 does not participate directly in the initial binding interaction with PrPSc. Rather, binding is undertaken by regions of PrPC that conformational studies indicate to be unstructured and by a region of the protein incorporating helix A (24Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Indeed, evidence suggests that the same regions of the PrPC molecule undergo profound conformational rearrangement in the formation of nascent PrPSc and are involved in prion infectivity (25Peretz D.

The presence of multiple, distinct PrPSc binding sites offers the possibility that a single PrPC molecule, with its inherent conformational flexibility (24Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R.

Among these is the potent, non-selective agonist, FTY720-P, whose mechanism of action has been suggested to correlate with S1P1 down-regulation. Discovery of the in vivo active S1P1-selective agonist, SEW2871, has broadened our understanding of minimal requirements for S1P1 function while highlighting differences regarding agonist effect on S1P1 fate, because SEW2871 does not degrade S1P1. To further understand the mechanism of agonist-induced S1P1 down-regulation, we compared signaling and fate of human S1P1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in stable 293 cells, using AFD-R, a chiral analog of FTY720-P, SEW2871, and S1P. Although all agonists acutely internalized S1P1 to late endosomal vesicles and activated GTPγS35 binding and pERK to similar maxima, only AFD-R led to significant S1P1 down-regulation, as shown by GFP immunoprecipitation studies. Down-regulation was time- and concentration-dependent, was partially blocked by proteasomal inhibition and reversed by chloroquine and an antagonist to S1P1. All agonists induced a receptor-associated increase in ubiquitination, with AFD-R inducing 3-fold more accumulation than S1P and being 3–4 logs more potent than SEW2871. The formation of AFD-R-receptor ubiquitin complex was inhibited by antagonist and chloroquine and was enhanced by proteasomal inhibition. Identification of proteins by PAGE liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in cells treated with AFD-R confirmed the co-migration of ubiquitin peptides with those of S1P1 and GFP, relative to vehicle alone. These data suggest that the hierarchy of ubiquitin recruitment to S1P1 (AFD-R > S1P > SEW2871) correlates with the efficiency of lysosomal receptor degradation and reflects intrinsic differences between agonists.

The long term effects of agonists on GPCR fate are dependent on both the nature of the agonist as well as the cellular environment and are believed to be important determinants of agonist effectiveness. Several mechanisms implicated in early GPCR trafficking have been described and involve phosphorylation of agonist-stimulated receptor by GPCR kinases and subsequent binding of arrestin proteins to phosphorylated receptor sites and to adapter proteins such as clathrin and AP-2, which form coated-pit receptor complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Prossnitz E.R.

Based on the stability of the arrestin-receptor complexes, GPCRs have been separated into class A receptors, which favor the recycling pathway, and class B receptors, which recycle slowly and are instead destined for degradation (3Oakley R.H.

Additional studies, intended to compare S1P1 agonist signaling in cell lines stably expressing S1P1, determined that SEW2871 recapitulates S1P effectors signaling and overlaps with S1P for key S1P1 pocket interactions, although at lower potency (17Jo E.

Interestingly, fate of the receptor was significantly different with different agonists, and while stimulation with the physiological ligand S1P or SEW2871 supported S1P1-GFP recycling, FTY-720-P-treated cells did not lead to recycling, suggesting the existence of ligand-dependent differences in receptor fate within the same cellular environment. In the present study, we have investigated whether differences in agonist-induced receptor ubiquitination could account for this discrepancy in fate.Here, we provide biochemical and proteomic evidence that S1P1 agonists induce recruitment of ubiquitin to S1P1, although by different magnitudes depending on the choice of agonist and despite similar ligands' efficacy at acute receptor activation. We found that there is enhanced efficacy of receptor ubiquitination by AFD-R relative to SEW2871 or S1P, and this is strongly associated with receptor sorting to lysosomes and receptor down-regulation. Our model proposes that the extent of ubiquitin recruitment by distinct ligands, and thus receptor degradation, represents a ligand-regulated step in determining the fate of S1P1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—GTPγS35 was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Prior to every experiment, the growth medium was replaced with 0.2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (cs-FBS, HyClone) medium, and the cells were incubated overnight.Detection of S1P1-GFP and Evaluation of Ligand-dependent Down-regulation—Confluent cells expressing S1P1-GFP or vector-GFP control grown in 6-well plates were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysates were obtained by incubation in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton x-100) containing 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 m β-glycerol phosphate and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cellular lysates were cleared by centrifugation (16,500 × g, 15 min), and the protein concentration of lysates supernatants was determined by the BCA (Pierce) method. Equal amounts of protein lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal GFP antibody (1 μg of antibody per 400 μg of protein), followed by incubation (2 h, 4 °C) with protein-A-Sepharose beads. The beads were recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 min) and washing: three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer: PBS (1:1) without protease inhibitors and twice in PBS. The beads were suspended in Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min, and proteins in the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE using either 4–12% gradient NuPage gels (Invitrogen) or 10% linear gels. The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked in 5% milk and subsequently probed with a polyclonal GFP antibody (1:10,000; 1 h at room temperature) for detection of S1P1-GFP. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:5,000) antibodies were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Agonist-induced down-regulation was measured in cells treated with 15 μg/ml CHX to prevent new receptor synthesis. Cells were exposed to either 10 μm SEW2871, 500 nm AFD-R, 500 nm S1P, or vehicle (0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) for the indicated times, and lysed as described above. S1P1-GFP down-regulation was analyzed by comparing the density of immunoprecipitated S1P1-GFP bands in agonist versus vehicle-treated cells, quantified by scanning densitometry using Kodak-1D Application software.The effect of proteasomal inhibition, chloroquine, or the S1P1 competitive antagonist W146 (19Sanna M.G. Wang S.K. Gonzalez-Cabrera P.J. Don A. Marsolais D. Matheu M.P. Wei S.H. Parker I. Jo E. Cheng W.C. Cahalan M.D. Wong C.H. Rosen H. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) on AFD-R-stimulated S1P1-GFP down-regulation was studied by comparing intensity of S1P1-GFP bands in cells incubated with the respective agents (5 μm MG132, 10 μm lactacystin, 80 μm chloroquine, and 10 μm W146) for 30 min prior to and during incubation with AFD-R or vehicle for an additional 4 h.Detection of Ubiquitinated S1P1-GFP—Ubiquitinated S1P1-GFP was probed for in the same lysates used for measuring S1P1-GFP down-regulation. Briefly, aliquots of boiled GFP immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal P4D1 antibody (1:200–1:800) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:5000) secondary antibody.AFD-R-stimulated S1P1 ubiquitination was additionally tested in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with N-terminal-tagged hemagglutinin (HA)-S1P1 (purchased from cDNA.org). Cells were transfected in 6-well plates with either 3, 2, or 1 μg of receptor plasmid for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000. Following transfection, cells were incubated with vehicle or 500 nm AFD-R for 1 h, and cellular lysates were obtained as described above. Receptor expression and AFD-R-stimulated receptor ubiquitination were determined by immunoblotting with an anti-HA (Bio-Rad) antibody at 1:1000 dilution.Acute Receptor Activation Experiments—Activation of ERK phosphorylation (pERK) by S1P1 agonists was determined by incubating cells with either 10 μm SEW2871, 500 nm AFD-R, or 500 nm S1P for the indicated times. The conditions for determining activation of pERK were done as described previously (17Jo E. Sanna M.G. Gonzalez-Cabrera P.J. Thangada S. Tigyi G. Osborne D.A. Hla T. Parrill A.L. Rosen H. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The potency (EC50) and maximal responses of S1P, AFD-R, and SEW2871 in activating GTP binding were determined in S1P1-GFP membranes using GTPγS35. Membrane preparation and conditions for binding were done as reported before (15Sanna M.G. Liao J. Jo E. Alfonso C. Ahn M.Y. Peterson M.S. Webb B. Lefebvre S. Chun J. Gray N. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13839-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), using 40-μg membranes per well. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA).Imaging—Single S1P1-GFP cells grown in 0.2% gelatin-coated coverslips were used to study ligand-induced localization with the late endosomal M6P-receptor marker. Incubation with agonists (500 nm AFD-R, 500 nm S1P, or 10 μm SEW2871) was terminated by removal of medium and washing with PBS. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 30 min, and blocked for 30 min in PBST containing 1% BSA and 5% normal goat serum. Primary antibody incubation (1:1000) was performed in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody (goat-anti-mouse Alexafluor-546) incubation was performed in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted onto slides by using Gel Mount (Biomeda Corp.) mounting media. Cells were scanned with an Olympus BX61 scanning confocal fluorescence microscope. For detecting GFP, fluorescence was excited by using an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm, and the absorbed wavelength was detected at 510–520 nm. For detecting Alexa Fluor 546, fluorescence was excited by using a helium-neon laser at a wavelength of 522 nm. In experiments using Lysotracker® Red (Cambrex) dye (75 nm) was added to the medium 15 min before the end of agonist incubation. Cells were then washed and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. For all experiments, images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0.Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—AFD-R-stimulated ubiquitin recruitment to S1P1-GFP was determined using a scale-up GFP immunoprecipitation using identical conditions as above. Briefly, vehicle and AFD-R lysates isolated from five 150-mm plates per condition (vehicle or 500 nm AFD-R, 1-h incubation) were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP (400 μg of protein to 1 μg of antibody), separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% NuPage gels), and the gel was subsequently stained by Colloidal Blue. In-gel stained proteins derived from three separate gel fragments (bottom, 73–85 kDa; medium, 100–115 kDa; top, 150–170 kDa, see Fig. 8) were cut out from either vehicle or AFD-R lanes and sent for LC-MS/MS analysis. The gel fragments were chosen by imaging against a matched AFD-R-induced “ladder-like” ubiquitin receptor complex (run in an adjacent well of the same gel and derived from the same lysates). As controls, corresponding vehicle-only gel fragments were analyzed. The gel bands were excised and treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol to reduce disulfide linkages. Alkylation was performed with 55 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) before digestion with trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C using an estimated (1:30) enzyme to substrate ratio in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The LC separation was performed on a laser-pulled 100-μm inner diameter C18 column with a tip of <5 μm that is also used as a nanoelectrospray emitter. Gradient elution was used with 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile as the mobile phases, from 5% to 60% acetonitrile in 90 min, and then maintained for an additional 20 min with flow rates of ∼200 nl/minute. The MS/MS analysis was performed on a linear ion mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoFisher Corp.). Data-dependent scanning was used to maximize the number of peptides sequenced in the highly complex mixture. This mode of operation uses preset criteria to select unique peptides on-the-fly for undergoing MS/MS. Over 10,000 MS/MS spectra were obtained during the run. These were searched using Mascot (Matrix Science, Ltd.) and Sequest (University of Washington, WA) search engine software using the NCBInr (non-redundant data base). To improve searching efficiency, the taxonomic category was limited to mammalian proteins. Only peptides producing good quality fragmentation spectra and scoring higher than the threshold required for 95% confidence level for Mascot were used for protein identification.RESULTSWe have shown previously (17Jo E. Sanna M.G. Gonzalez-Cabrera P.J. Thangada S. Tigyi G. Osborne D.A. Hla T. Parrill A.L. Rosen H. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) that stable HEK293 cells expressing C-terminal GFP-tagged human S1P1 differ in trafficking pattern when stimulated with FTY720-P (which induces receptor degradation), compared with S1P or SEW2871 (which induce receptor recycling). To further investigate agonist-induced receptor fate differences, we used the same HEK293-S1P1-GFP cell line (18Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) to compare three agonists (AFD-R, SEW2871, and S1P) for stimulating 1) receptor down-regulation, 2) acute receptor signaling (GTPγS35 binding and pERK activation), and 3) short- and long-term receptor trafficking. Additionally, we augmented biochemical and pharmacological data with a proteomics identification approach in exploring possible mechanism(s) of agonist-induced S1P1 fate.Agonist-stimulated S1P1-GFP down-regulation was evaluated by immunoprecipitating the receptor with GFP antibodies (Fig. 1A). We could detect S1P1-GFP in transfected S1P1-GFP cells, but not in vector-GFP-expressing cells, as a band that migrated between 64 and 82 kDa, corresponding to the GFP-tagged human S1P1 (44-kDa S1P1 plus 27-kDa GFP). Heavy- and light-IgG chains were visible in both samples, and a GFP band (immediately above the light chain) was detected in vector-GFP-expressing cells.FIGURE 1AFD-R promotes S1P1-GFP down-regulation and enhanced protein ubiquitination. Equal amounts of 293-vector-GFP or 293-S1P1-GFP cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with GFP antibodies to detect S1P1-GFP expression. A, S1P1-GFP expression was detected as a band running between 64 and 82 kDa (lane 2), whereas vector-GFP cells without insert did not express receptor (lane 1). B, vector GFP or S1P1-GFP cells were incubated with S1P1 agonists: AFD-R (500 nm), S1P (500 nm), SEW2871 (10 μm), or vehicle (0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) for 4 h in the presence of CHX. Lower panel, GFP immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting experiments from equivalent protein amounts revealed AFD-R-mediated S1P1-GFP down-regulation versus vehicle (Veh) treatment (n = 3). Upper panel, membranes were subsequently probed with P4D1 antibody for detection of agonist-induced ubiquitination. Note that P4D1 only recognized protein ubiquitination in ligand-stimulated, S1P1-GFP-expressing cells. The positions of molecular mass markers are indicated on the right (in kilodaltons). C, densitometric analysis of S1P1-GFP expression (left graph) and agonist-induced ubiquitinated-receptor complex (right graph) in cells treated with S1P1 agonists for 4 h. *, p < 0.05 relative to vehicle alone (left graph); *, p < 0.05 versus AFD-R treatment (right graph). Bars represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Down-regulation was measured as the loss of receptor band to agonist stimulation in experiments in the presence of CHX. Treatment of S1P1-GFP cells with either AFD-R (500 nm), S1P (500 nm), SEW2871 (10 μm), or vehicle (0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) for 4 h led to the finding that AFD-R down-regulated approximately half (44 ± 2%) of total S1P1-GFP expression versus vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1B, bottom). On the other hand, there were no significant differences in S1P1-GFP expression in cells incubated for the same time with either SEW2871 or S1P.Because protein ubiquitination has been implicated in regulating GPCR trafficking and fate, we employed an antibody that recognizes ubiquitinated substrates (P4D1) and probed the same GFP immunoprecipitates used for determining agonist-induced receptor down-regulation. Fig. 1B shows that agonist incubation was associated with increases in the ubiquitination of high (∼115–180 kDa) molecular mass protein(s), which we have referred to as the “ubiquitinated receptor complex.” Ubiquitinated receptor complex was dependent upon agonist stimulation in receptor-transfected cells only, because it was not found to be associated with either vehicle-treated S1P1-GFP cells or vector-GFP stimulated (using 500 nm S1P) cells. Interestingly, at the 4-h agonist incubation studied, the ubiquitinated receptor complex was found to differ in magnitude depending on agonist utilized, with AFD-R stimulating significantly (1.8- and 2.5-fold) higher ubiquitination relative to S1P and SEW2871, respectively.A time course (0–6 h) of agonist-induced receptor down-regulation and associated ubiquitinated receptor complex is shown in Fig. 2. Again, depending on choice of agonist, two main differences in the measures were observed. First, only cells receiving AFD-R (500 nm) displayed significant receptor down-regulation relative to untreated cells. Down-regulation by AFD-R was apparent at 4 h (with a loss of approximately half of the total S1P1 expression), and continued at 6 h. In contrast, SEW2871 (10 μm) or S1P (500 nm) incubations did not significantly alter S1P1-GFP expression up to 6 h, relative to unstimulated cells, respectively. Second, and consistent with results from Fig. 1, AFD-R stimulated the highest magnitude of ubiquitinated receptor complex throughout the entire time course, relative to SEW2871 or S1P treatments, respectively. For all agonists, the time courses of ubiquitin receptor complex were biphasic, and of similar onsets (30 min), yet AFD-R induced sustained higher ubiquitination levels throughout most of the study, in comparison to SEW2871 or S1P.FIGURE 2Time course of agonist-stimulated ubiquitin receptor complex and receptor down-regulation. 293-S1P1-GFP cells were incubated for the indicated times with either 500 nm AFD-R, 500 nm S1P, or 10 μm SEW2871 in the presence of CHX. A, equal amounts of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with a GFP antibody, and the membranes were immunoblotted (IB) with either anti-GFP (lower panels) to detect receptor-GFP expression or P4D1 (upper panels) for determination of agonist-induced ubiquitinated receptor complex. B, densitometry analysis of receptor-GFP and ubiquitinated receptor complex following either AFD-R (▪), SEW2871 (▴), or S1P (▾) stimulation. Time courses were plotted as the fraction of each agonist maximum, relative to unstimulated (time 0) cells. The graphs are from a representative experiment that was repeated twice with identical conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time course indicated that the agonist's maximal ubiquitination of cellular substrate(s) occurred at ∼1-h incubation; thus we compared the concentration dependence of agonist-induced ubiquitinated signaling in cells treated for 1 h with each agonist. Fig. 3 shows that AFD-R was 1,000- and 10,000-fold more potent in stimulating ubiquitin receptor complex formation than S1P and SEW2871, respectively, whereas no effect on amount of receptor (aside from the 50 nm S1P lane, which reflects a minor loading defect) was apparent at the 1-h incubation time. The potencies for AFD-R, S1P, and SEW2871 in stimulating ubiquitination at 1 h were 0.5 nm, 0.3 μm, and 2.5 μm, respectively. In addition, Fig. 3B indicates that AFD-R was a full agonist in activating receptor-complex ubiquitination relative to S1P and SEW2871 responses.FIGURE 3Ubiquitination of cellular substrates by distinct agonists displays vast differences in potency. 293-S1P1-GFP cells were i"

Stimulation through TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) leads to TRAF2 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Here we show that TNFR2 signaling also leads to selective ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation in proteasomes. c-IAP1 was identified as the ubiquitin protein ligase for ASK1 ubiquitination, and studies with primary B cells from c-IAP1 knock-out animals revealed that c-IAP1 is required for TNFR2-induced TRAF2 and ASK1 degradation. Moreover, in the absence of c-IAP1 TNFR2-mediated p38 and JNK activation was prolonged. Thus, the ubiquitin protein ligase activity of c-IAP1 is responsible for regulating the duration of TNF signaling in primary cells expressing TNFR2.

Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). TNF binds to two distinct transmembrane receptors, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1; p55) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2; p75). TNFR1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNFR2 is found primarily on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated (2Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). TNFR1 is the more widely studied of this receptor pair, and its functions include signaling for apoptosis (activation of caspases) and inflammation (activation of NF-κB and inflammatory gene products). The role of TNFR2 in biological processes is less well defined. Unlike TNFR1, TNFR2 lacks an intracellular death domain, and therefore its occupancy does not cause caspase activation. Nevertheless, expression of TNFR2 in cell lines potentiates TNFR1-induced death (3Duckett C.S. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 4Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mice deficient in TNFR1 or TNFR2 are resistant to TNF-mediated toxicity and highly susceptible to infectious challenge (5Rothe J.

Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). TRAF2 in particular is a key upstream component in the pathway leading to TNF-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 and JNK (8Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). ASK1, one of the MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) upstream of p38 and JNK, associates with TRAF2 following TNF stimulation (9Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In fact, the duration of p38 and JNK activation in response to TNF is impaired in ASK1-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (10Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Other proximal MAPKKKs, such as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (11Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) and germinal center kinase-related (GCKR) (12Shi C.S. Leonardi A. Kyriakis J. Siebenlist U. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3279-3285PubMed Google Scholar), have also been implicated in the induction of MAPK signaling in response to TNF, although their role is less well described.The cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (c-IAP1 and c-IAP2) are also recruited to TNFR signaling complexes through their association with TRAF2 (13Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In addition to their baculovirus internal repeat-dependent caspase inhibitory effects (14Shi Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 have ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) activity, conferred by their C-terminal RING domains (15Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 16Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). c-IAP1, in particular, has been found to play an important role in TNF signaling, being activated by occupancy of TNFR2 and mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TRAF2 (17Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Given that TRAF2 is degraded and TNF-induced JNK is prematurely terminated in TNFR2-expressing Jurkat cells, we asked whether upstream MAPKKKs might also be targets of ubiquitination and degradation. Here we show that ASK1, but not NIK or GCKR, is ubiquitinated in TNFR2-expressing cell lines and resting B cells in a process dependent on the E3 activity of c-IAP1. Furthermore, absence of this process in c-IAP1–/– B cells results in failure to terminate TNF-induced MAP kinase signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Plasmids, and Cell Lines—Antibodies used for immunoblotting include anti-β-actin and anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-ASK1, anti-ubiquitin, anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-TRAF2, anti-NIK, and anti-GCKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Thr-180/Tyr-182-phosphorylated p38, anti-p38, and anti-Thr-183/Tyr-185-phosphorylated JNK (Cell Signaling), and anti-JNK1/JNK2 (BD Biosciences).

Briefly, GST or the GST-c-IAP1 fusion protein were coated onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with in vitro translated (IVT) [35S]Met-labeled ASK1 at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing, the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed by adding 1 μl of IVT [35S]Met-labeled ASK1 in 25 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) in the presence of IVT [35S]Met-labeled c-IAP1 or IVT [35S]Met-labeled c-IAP1-mut, 200 nm ubiquitin-activating enzyme, 1 μm UbcH5b, and 10 μg of ubiquitin (Boston Biochem). After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, the reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Mouse B Cell Isolation—Small resting lymphocytes from wild type or c-IAP1-deficient mice (22Conze D.B.

Ryan P.E. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4010-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). B cells were purified by negative selection using the Mouse B Cell Recovery Column kit (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd). After experimental manipulation, B cells were lysed in 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8, and 10% 2-Me).Immunoprecipitation—4E3 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and fresh protease inhibitors (lysis buffer). To disrupt noncovalent intermolecular interactions, lysates were heated in the presence of 1% SDS and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 95 °C for 5 min before immunoprecipitation. The heated lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation. Lysates were incubated with the immunoprecipitating antibody for 1 h on ice, protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the tubes were rotated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer.Immunoblotting—Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved on 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by either enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) or infrared fluorescence (Odyssey Infrared Imaging System) following the manufacturer’s instructions.RESULTSTNF Induces TNFR2-dependent ASK1, but Not NIK or GCKR, Ubiquitination and Degradation—We have previously shown that c-IAP1 mediates TNFR2-dependent TRAF2 ubiquitination and there is premature termination of TNF-induced JNK activation in Jurkat cells expressing TNFR2 (17Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). ASK1, NIK, and GCKR are TRAF2-interacting MAPKKKs upstream of p38 and JNK (9Nishitoh H. Saitoh M.

Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 12Shi C.S. Leonardi A. Kyriakis J. Siebenlist U. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3279-3285PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that TRAF2 is degraded in cells expressing TNFR2, we asked whether ASK1, NIK, or GCKR are also subject to degradation upon TNFR2 occupancy. Jurkat T cells that express TNFR1 and TNFR2 (4E3 cells) (4Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were treated with TNF for 4 h, at which time TRAF2, ASK1, NIK, and GCKR levels were determined (Fig. 1A). As previously shown, stimulation with TNF resulted in a substantial decrease in TRAF2 expression. Notably, expression of ASK1, but not NIK or GCKR, also decreased in response to TNF. To assess whether TNFR2 signaling is required for this decrease, ASK1 levels were determined in Jurkat T cells (TNFR1+/TNFR2–) and 4E3 cells stimulated with TNF (Fig. 1B). Unlike the TNFR2+ 4E3 cells, the level of ASK1 was unaffected by TNF treatment in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, the loss of ASK1 in TNF-treated 4E3 cells was prevented by MG-132, indicating that it was undergoing proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with non-lymphoid epithelial cells expressing TNFR2 (Fig. 1, D and E). Therefore, as with TRAF2, signals downstream of TNFR2 induce proteasome-mediated ASK1 degradation.Proteasome-mediated degradation of ASK1 implies that it is a target for TNFR2 signaling-induced polyubiquitination. To determine whether this is the case, 4E3 cells were stimulated with TNF in the presence of MG-132. After lysis of the cells, protein-protein interactions were disrupted by heating to prevent co-immunoprecipitation of putative ASK1-interacting and ubiquitinated molecules. The lysates were then diluted in lysis buffer without SDS, and ASK1 was immunoprecipitated and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 2, high molecular weight bands representing extensively polyubiquitinated ASK1 were markedly elevated 20 min after TNF stimulation. Together, these data demonstrate that ASK1 is a target for TNF-induced polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.FIGURE 2TNF induces ASK1 ubiquitination. 4E3 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml recombinant TNF in the presence of 10 μm MG132 for 20 min. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and heated at 95 °C in the presence of 1% SDS and 5 mm dithiothreitol to disrupt protein-protein interactions. ASK1 was immunoprecipitated, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and ubiquitinated ASK1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin (upper panel). Total ASK1 levels were determined by immunoblotting the cell lysates with anti-ASK1 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)c-IAP1 Mediates ASK1, but Not NIK or GCKR, Ubiquitination and Degradation—c-IAP1 is a TNFR2-associated ubiquitin protein ligase that ubiquitinates TRAF2 upon stimulation with TNF (17Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-IAP1 was responsible for ASK1 ubiquitination, 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged ASK1 and either Myc-tagged c-IAP1 or an E3-inactive c-IAP1 that has single amino acid substitution in the RING domain (c-IAP1-mut). After 24 h the cells were lysed and the levels of the transfected gene products were determined by immunoblotting. Co-transfection of wild-type c-IAP1, but not E3-inactive c-IAP1 markedly reduced the level of ASK1 (Fig. 3A). Because TRAF2 can also act as a RING-dependent ubiquitin protein ligase (24Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19433-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that it too could be responsible for ASK1 ubiquitination. To test this, 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged ASK1 and myc-tagged c-IAP1 or FLAG-tagged TRAF2. After 24 h the cells were lysed and amount of ASK1 was determined. Expression of c-IAP1, but not TRAF2, reduced ASK1 levels (Fig. 3B), suggesting that c-IAP1 is the specific E3 for ASK1. To determine whether NIK or GCKR could be degraded by overexpressed c-IAP1, Myc-tagged c-IAP1 was expressed in 293 cells along with FLAG-tagged TRAF2, HA-tagged ASK1, Myc-tagged NIK, or FLAG-tagged GCKR. After 24 h the cells were lysed and protein levels were determined (Fig. 3C). Co-expression of c-IAP1 reduced the level of TRAF2 and ASK1, but not NIK or GCKR. Thus, unlike TRAF2 and ASK1, NIK and GCKR are unlikely to be c-IAP1 substrates in vivo.FIGURE 3c-IAP1 mediates ASK1, but not NIK or GCKR, ubiquitination and degradation. A, 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-ASK1, Myc-c-IAP1, or Myc-c-IAP1-mut in the indicated combinations. After 24 h the cells were lysed and the amount of ASK1 and c-IAP1 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-Myc, respectively. Anti-β-actin was used as loading control. B, 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-ASK1, Myc-c-IAP1, or FLAG-TRAF2 in the indicated combinations. After 24 h ASK1 and c-IAP1 levels were detected by immunoblotting. The levels of TRAF2 were determined with an anti-FLAG antibody. C, 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-ASK1, FLAG-TRAF2, Myc-NIK, FLAG-GCKR, or Myc-c-IAP1 in the indicated combinations. After 24 h the transfected gene products were detected by immunoblotting for the appropriate peptide tag. D, 293-TNFR2 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding HA-ASK1. After 16 h the cells were incubated with or without MG-132 for 3 h and then treated with TNF. ASK1 and TRAF2 levels were determined by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the rate of ASK1 and TRAF2 down-regulation, HA-ASK1-transfected 293-TNFR2 cells were treated with TNF and ASK1 and TRAF2 levels were monitored over time. The levels of both proteins were reduced as early as 5 min after treatment and were substantially decreased by 30 min (Fig. 3D). The decreases were largely prevented by MG-132, indicating that they were due to proteasome-mediated degradation.c-IAP1 Interacts with ASK1 and Induces Its Ubiquitination in Vitro—To test whether c-IAP1 can directly bind and ubiquitinate ASK1, beads coated with GST or GST-c-IAP1 were incubated with IVT [35S]Met-labeled ASK1. Beads coated with GST-c-IAP1, but not with GST alone, pulled down ASK1 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, IVT [35S]Met-labeled ASK1 was ubiquitinated by c-IAP1 in vitro in an E2-dependent fashion, as indicated by a decrease in the amount of input unmodified protein (Fig. 4B). A RING mutant of c-IAP1 that lacks E3 activity had no effect on ASK1. Taken together, these results show that c-IAP1 can bind and ubiquitinate ASK1.FIGURE 4c-IAP1 binds ASK1 and induces its ubiquitination in vitro. A, IVT [35S]Met-labeled ASK1 were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads coated with GST or GST-c-IAP1, and the pulled down material was detected by autoradiography. B, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed with or without the E2 UbcH5b, and the material recovered after 60 min was analyzed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Maintenance of ASK1 and TRAF2 Levels in TNFR2-stimulated c-IAP1–/– Resting B Cells—The preceding results were obtained using recombinant proteins and cultured cell lines. To determine the physiologic relevance of these findings, cells from mice with targeted disruption of the c-iap1 locus were studied. The major manifestation of this genetic manipulation is a marked up-regulation of c-IAP2 levels, which is a consequence of the failure of c-IAP1 to ubiquitinate c-IAP2 and cause its degradation (22Conze D.B. Albert L. Ferrick D.A. Goeddel D.V. Yeh W.C. Mak T. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3348-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because c-IAP1, but not c-IAP2, has been shown to ubiquitinate TRAF2 (17Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), cells from c-IAP1–/– animals should provide a suitable environment for testing the hypothesis that c-IAP1 is the major effector of TRAF2 and ASK1 ubiquitination downstream of TNFR2 signaling. B cells constitutively express TNFR2, and the levels expressed on wild type and c-IAP1–/– B cells are similar (25Bishop G.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 3Y. Zhao, D. C. Conze, and J. D. Ashwell, unpublished data. Purified B cells from wild type and c-IAP1-deficient mice were treated with agonistic anti-TNFR2 antibodies for 6 h, at which time the amounts of TRAF2 and ASK1 were determined (Fig. 5A). Signaling through TNFR2 induced a decrease in TRAF2 that was abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Importantly, and in agreement with results obtained by overexpressing the dominant negative c-IAP1-mut in 4E3 cells (17Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), TRAF2 expression was not affected by TNFR2 signaling in the absence of c-IAP1. Analysis of ASK1 protein levels in TNFR2-stimulated cells yielded similar results: signaling via TNFR1 had no effect on ASK1 levels, but ASK1 was degraded in wild type but not c-IAP1–/– TNFR2-stimulated resting B cells (Fig. 5B). Therefore, c-IAP1 has a nonredundant role downstream of TNFR2 in the regulation of levels of mediators of MAPK signaling.FIGURE 5c-IAP1 deficiency prevents TNFR2-induced TRAF2 and ASK1 degradation and prolongs p38 and JNK MAP kinase signaling. A, B cells purified from wild type and c-IAP1-deficient mice were treated with 5 μg/ml agonistic anti-TNFR2 antibodies with or without lactacystin for 6 h. The cells were lysed in 2× sample buffer, and TRAF2 and β-actin levels were determined by immunoblotting. B, B cells purified from wild type and c-IAP1-deficient mice were treated with agonistic anti-TNFR1 or anti-TNFR2 antibodies for 6 h. ASK1 and β-actin levels were determined by immunoblotting. C, B cells purified from wild type and c-IAP1-deficient mice were stimulated with agonist anti-TNFR2 antibodies for the indicated times. Dual-phosphorylated p38 and total p38 were detected by immunoblotting. D, B cells purified from wild type and c-IAP1-deficient mice were treated as in panel C. Phosphorylated JNK1/JNK2 and total JNK1/JNK2 were detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TNFR2-dependent p38 and JNK Activation Are Prolonged in c-IAP1–/– B Cells—Reasoning that activation of the MAPK cascade downstream of TNFR2 should depend on the continued expression of ASK1, we analyzed the activation of p38 and JNK in wild type and c-IAP1–/– B cells. p38 and JNK become phosphorylated by upstream MAPK kinases as a consequence of TNFR occupancy (17Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 26Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). ASK1 is required for the maintenance of p38 and JNK activation, and the duration of both p38 and JNK phosphorylation is impaired in ASK1–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (10Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). When wild type B cells were stimulated with the agonist anti-TNFR2 antibody, p38 dual phosphorylation and phosphorylated JNK were detected at 5 min and rapidly declined thereafter (Fig. 5, C and D). p38 and JNK in c-IAP1–/– B cells were phosphorylated to the same extent 5 min after stimulation. However, unlike in wild type cells, p38 and JNK phosphorylation persisted for at least 60 min after stimulation in IAP1–/– B cells. Therefore, c-IAP1-mediated down-regulation of TRAF2 and ASK1 is a critical event for limiting the duration of p38 and JNK activation in TNFR2-signaled primary B cells.DISCUSSIONASK1 is so-named because it was found to cause apoptosis when overexpressed in mink lung epithelial cells (18Ichijo H.

It is an evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase that is responsible for activation of MAPKs in Caenorhabditis elegans (Neuronal symmetry 1 (Nsy1)) (27Sagasti A. Hisamoto N. Hyodo J.

Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, ASK1 participates in the JNK and p38 MAP signaling cascades by phosphorylating MKK4/MKK7 and MKK3/MKK6, respectively (9Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). ASK1 is activated in response to various extracellular and intracellular stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide, reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and signaling through such as Fas and TNFR (30Matsukawa J. Matsuzawa A. Takeda K. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TRAF2 strongly activates ASK1, and in the case of TNF an interaction between ASK1 and TRAF2 is essential for activation of the MAPK cascade (9Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Binding of TRAF2 to ASK1 requires the N-terminal RING domain of the former and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of the latter (9Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Notably, both truncated (RING-deleted) TRAF2 and catalytically inactive ASK1 down-regulate TNF-induced MAPK activation, and although ASK1–/– mice have no obvious developmental abnormalities, ASK1–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts have sustained activation of JNK and p38 in response to TNF and are resistant to TNF-induced cell death (10Tobiume K.

Therefore, TNF-induced p38 and JNK activation requires and is downstream of ASK1.This report demonstrates that c-IAP1 is responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TRAF2 and ASK1.

The approximately 4,000 co-translationally translocated (CTT) proteins – representing the vertebrate secretome – are important for such vertebrate-critical processes as organogenesis. However, the role(s) for most of these genes is currently unknown. Results We identified 585 putative full-length zebrafish CTT proteins using cross-species genomic and EST-based comparative sequence analyses. We further investigated 150 of these genes (Figure 1) for unique function using morpholino-based analysis in zebrafish embryos. 12% of the CTT protein-deficient embryos resulted in specific developmental defects, a notably higher rate of gene function annotation than the 2%–3% estimate from random gene mutagenesis studies. Conclusion(s) This initial collection includes novel genes required for the development of vascular, hematopoietic, pigmentation, and craniofacial tissues, as well as lipid metabolism, and organogenesis. This study provides a framework utilizing zebrafish for the systematic assignment of biological function in a vertebrate genome."

In this study, we present evidence that overexpression of mitochondria-located thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) attenuated hypoxia-evoked HIF-1α accumulation, whereas cytosolic thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) enhanced HIF-1α protein amount. Transactivation of HIF-1 is decreased by overexpression of Trx2 but stimulated by Trx1. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α in Trx2-overexpressing cells did not fully restore HIF-1α protein levels, while HIF-1α accumulation was enhanced in Trx1-overexpressing cells. Reporter assays showed that cap-dependent translation is increased by Trx1 and decreased by Trx2, whereas HIF-1α mRNA levels remained unaltered. These data suggest that thioredoxins affect the synthesis of HIF-1α. Trx1 facilitated synthesis of HIF-1α by activating Akt, p70S6K, and eIF-4E, known to control cap-dependent translation. In contrast, Trx2 attenuated activities of Akt, p70S6K, and eIF-4E and provoked an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. MitoQ, a mitochondria specific antioxidant, reversed HIF-1α accumulation as well as Akt activation under hypoxia in Trx2 cells, supporting the notion of translation control mechanisms in affecting HIF-1α protein accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2120658521,"Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus undergoes an irreversible conformational change at acidic pH, mediating viral fusion with the host endosomal membrane. To unravel the molecular basis of the pH-dependent stability of HA, we demonstrate by mutagenesis of the prototype HA of virus strain X31 (H3 subtype) that salt bridges, especially a tetrad salt bridge within the monomers, are crucial for folding and stability of the trimeric ectodomain. This complex (tetrad) salt bridge is highly conserved among influenza virus subtypes. Introducing additional sites of electrostatic attraction between monomers in the distal region enhanced the stability of ectodomain at low pH mimicking the natural variant H2 subtype. We propose that distinct salt bridges in the distal domain may contribute to the enhanced stability of HA of natural virus variants. This hypothesis may provide clues to understanding adaptations of virus strains (for example, avian influenza viruses) in order to preserve stability of the protein in the host-specific environment."

To test this hypothesis, we have studied targeting of sortilin, one of the major IRV constituents.

Unlike Glut4 that has 12 transmembrane domains, both sortilin and IRAP are correspondingly type I and type II single pass transmembrane proteins. It is likely that each IRV compartmentalizes several copies of Glut4, IRAP, (15Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, probably, sortilin. The mechanism of IRV biogenesis is not known. Available data suggest that IRVs may be formed from syntaxin 6-positive donor membranes of the TGN/endosomal origin localized in the perinuclear region of the cell (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Li L.V. Kandror K.V. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and GGA-binding protein sortilin (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) play important roles in vesicle biogenesis. Under basal conditions, IRVs may exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the donor membranes, which is maintained by multiple cycles of budding and fusion (19Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, what signal sequences in the IRV component proteins target them to the perinuclear donor membranes and to insulin-responsive vesicles. To approach this problem, we prepared reporter molecules that comprise the luminal domain and the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin and stably expressed these proteins (mSorN and EGFP-SORTILINtail respectively, see Fig. 1) in 3T3-L1 cells. In agreement with our previous results (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we found that EGFP-SORTILINtail was co-localized with ectopically expressed Glut4 in undifferentiated pre-adipocytes. However, upon cell differentiation, EGFP-SORTILINtail does not acquire insulin responsiveness and loses its co-localization with Glut4. At the same time, the luminal domain of sortilin alone is partially co-localized with ectopically expressed Glut4 in undifferentiated cells and is targeted to the IRVs upon cell differentiation. These results suggest that protein-protein interactions in the vesicular lumen may play an essential role in protein sorting and recruitment into the IRVs. Antibodies—In the present study, we used the monoclonal anti-V5 antibody from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), the monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody and the polyclonal anti-Myc tag antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), the monoclonal anti-syntaxin 6 and anti-sortilin (neurotensin receptor 3) antibodies from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma-Aldrich, the monoclonal anti-Glut4 antibody 1F8 (20James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin (Ac-CQNVETTEGYQPPPVY-OH) that has been raised and affinity-purified by BioSource International (Camarillo, CA), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IRAP (a kind gift from Dr. Paul Pilch, Boston University School of Medicine). cDNA Constructs—The pLenti6/V5 Directional TOPO cloning kit was purchased from Invitrogen. Two oligonucleotides (5′-CACCGAATTCGTTTAAACTGTCGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACAGTTTAAACGAATTCGGTG-3′) were annealed and ligated in the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector. This modified vector is called the pLenti vector. Two more oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCGTTAACGAATTCTCGCTCGAGCCAGTGTGGTGGGTTTAAACTCTGCAGACTAGTGTCGACAGGGGCCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCCTGTCGACACTAGTCTGCAGAGTTTAAACCCACCACACTGGCTCGAGCGAGAATTCGTTAACG-3′) were annealed and ligated with the BamHI- and SacII-cut pLenti vector. This vector is called pLenti-m1. Full-length sortilin was released from mLNCX2-sortilin-Myc/His (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) by XhoI and PmeI and ligated in the corresponding sites of the pLenti-m1 vector, creating pLenti-m1-sortilin-myc/His. The fragment (nucleotides 1816–2349) of human sortilin was amplified with two primers: 5′-GATTTTAAAGATATCCTTGAAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-TTGTGAAGAAATATGTCTGTCATCATCACCATCACCATACTAGT-3′ (encoding the His tag) digested with EcoRV and SpeI and ligated in the corresponding sites of pLenti-m1-sortilin-Myc/His. This vector (pLenti-m1-mSorN) encodes sortilin with the His/V5 tag instead of the original C terminus starting from the sixth amino acid after the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). EGFP was amplified from the pEGFP-C2 template using two primers 5′-ACGACGTCAGGATCCGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCTGGAATTCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′. This fragment was digested by BamHI and SalI and ligated in the corresponding sites of pLenti-m1. The resulting vector is called pLenti-m1-EGFP-C2. The EGFP fragment was amplified from the pEGFP-N3 template using two primers 5′-ACGACGACAGTCGACATCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGAGTCTGCCGCGGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′. This fragment was digested sequentially by SalI and SacII and ligated in the corresponding sites of pLenti-m1. The resulting vector is called pLenti-m1-EGFP-N3. The C terminus of human sortilin (nucleotides 2243–2496) was amplified using two primers 5′-CAGCAGTCACTCGAGgactacaaggacgatgacgacaagGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAGAAACAGAATTCCAAGTCAAATTCT-3′ (containing 2 FLAG tags) and 5′-TCGAGTCTGACTAGTCTATTCCAAGAGGTCCTCATCT-3′. This fragment was cut with XhoI and SpeI and ligated in the corresponding sites of pLenti-m1-EGFP-C2 vector, creating pLenti-m1-EGFP-SORTILINtail (Fig. 1). Stable Cell Lines—G and S+ cells were stably transfected with pBabe-Myc7-Glut4 and mLNCX2-sortilin-Myc/His correspondingly as described previously (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Pooled clones of G cells were infected with the lentiviral constructs described in the previous section according to the Invitrogen protocol. The selection of cells was performed with blasticidin (8 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, and pooled stable clones were used for further experiments. All cell lines were cultured, differentiated, and maintained as described previously (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation of 3T3-L1 Cells—Prior to harvesting, cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed three times with serum-free DMEM heated to 37 °C and starved in the same medium for 3 h. Where indicated, cells were treated with 100 nm insulin or carrier (5 mm HCl at ×1000 dilution) in DMEM for 5 or 15 min at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed three times with warm HES buffer with protease inhibitors (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH7.4, 1 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were harvested in HES buffer, homogenized by 10 strokes up and down using a teflon pestle, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Plasma membrane (PM), heavy microsomes, light microsomes (LM), and nuclear/mitochondrial fraction were obtained by differential centrifugation as described previously (21Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Fractions were resuspended in HES buffer, and protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Measurements of Protein Stability—At time 0, 50 μg/ml of aqueous solution of cycloheximide or 10 μm emetine were added to plates. At the indicated time intervals, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and harvested in ice cold 1% Triton X-100 in HES buffer with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were vortexed, rotated at 4 °C for an hour, and spun for 30 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The presence of the individual proteins in the supernatants was analyzed by Western blotting. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—For velocity gradient centrifugation, samples of light microsomes (0.2 ml, 500 μg) were loaded onto a 3.8-ml linear 10–30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in HE buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and centrifuged for 65 min in a Sorvall TST60.4 rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products, Asheville, NC) at 48,000 rpm. Each gradient was separated into 20–25 fractions starting from the bottom of the tube. The protein profile was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce), and the linearity of the gradients was confirmed by measuring the refractive index of fractions. The fractions were further analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Immunoadsorption of Glut4-containing and Cellugyrin-containing Vesicles—Protein A-purified 1F8 antibody and nonspecific mouse IgG (each 2 μg) were coupled to 30 μl of Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dynal Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively affinity-purified polyclonal anti-cellugyrin antibody and nonspecific rabbit IgG (each 2 μg) were coupled to 30 μl of Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG. Before usage, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Light microsomes (500 μg) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated separately with each of the specific and nonspecific antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C with rotating. The beads were washed three times with PBS, and then eluted with 40 μlof1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, the beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 solution, and the remaining proteins were eluted with 30 μlof1× non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer. An aliquot (usually 100 μg) of post-absorptive supernatant was analyzed by PAGE along with 100% of the eluate. 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose Uptake—This assay was performed in 6-well plates. Cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 2 more hours. Cells were then washed twice with warm Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer without glucose (121 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgS04, 0.33 mm CaCl2, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and treated with either 100 nm insulin or carrier (5 mm HCl at ×1000 dilution) at 37 °C for 15 min. Radioactive 2-deoxyglucose (0.1 mm, 0.625 μCi/ml) was added for 4 min to adipocytes and for 15 min to confluent pre-adipocytes. The assay was terminated by aspirating the radioactive media, and the cells were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold KRH containing 25 mm d-glucose. Each well was then extracted with 400 μl of 0.1% SDS in KRH buffer without glucose, and 300-μl aliquots were removed for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Under these conditions, glucose uptake was linear for at least 30 min. Measurements were made in duplicates and corrected for specific activity and nonspecific diffusion (as determined in the presence of 5 μm cytochalasin B), which was <10% of the total uptake. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and was used to normalize counts. In Vitro Reconstitution of Cellugyrin-containing Vesicles— Cytosol and the donor membranes were isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, and the assay was performed as described earlier (9Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The vesicle fraction along with the donor fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. The yield of small vesicles was linear when heavy membrane fraction was used at a concentration of 0.2–1.6 mg/ml. To compare different experiments, we used arbitrary units defined as: [Intensity of cellugyrin in the vesicle fraction - intensity in the “no cytosol” control lane] × [volume of the vesicle fraction] [Intensity of cellugyrin in the donor fraction] × [volume of the donor fraction]. The average of duplicate reactions and the deviation is plotted on the graph. Immunofluorescence—3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were grown in a 60-mm dish. The night before the experiment, cells were reseeded onto Nunc LAB-TEK II 4-well chamber slides. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown and differentiated in a 60-mm dish. On day 5 of differentiation, cells were lifted up by trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C and reseeded to 4-well chamber slides. After growing on chamber slides for two more days, adipocytes (day 7) were used for staining. Cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes or pre-adipocytes were washed three times with serum-free DMEM, heated to 37 °C, and starved in the same medium for 3 h. Then, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with PBS with 5% donkey serum and 5% bovine serum albumin, and stained with primary anti-Myc monoclonal antibody or anti-syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). For double staining of G/mSorN cells, permeabilized cells were first stained with the mixture of anti-Myc polyclonal antibody and anti-V5 monoclonal antibody followed by the mixture of Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Each incubation with antibody lasted for 60 min at room temperature and was followed by six quick washes with PBS. A SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting cells on slides that were examined by fluorescence microscopy using Axiovert 200 m (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Pictures were taken with the help of the Axiovision 3.0 program (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Cross-linking was performed according to Ref. 22Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8832-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar with minor modifications. S+ cells were washed twice with PBS and once with KRP buffer (12.5 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4), and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was added to final concentration 2 mm for 30 min at room temperature. Then quenching buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) was added for 15 min at 4 °C followed by two washes with the same buffer. The cells were lysed in 500 μl of quenching buffer with 1% Triton X-100, and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. This material (1.5 mg) was incubated with the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and nonspecific mouse IgG (2 μg each) along with 30 μl of protein G beads overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in quenching buffer. Elution was carried out with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. Yeast Two-hybrid Interactions—The matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) was used for these experiments. The sortilin luminal Vps10p domain without the signal sequence and pro-peptide was amplified using two primers: 5′-CTAGACCTGCCATGGAG AGCGCGCCGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-ACGACATCACTGCAGGATTTGACTTGGAATTCTGTTTTTC-3′. The PCR product was digested by NcoI and PstI and ligated into the pGBKT7 vector that encodes GAL4 DNA binding domain. The IRAP luminal domain (IRAP LD) was amplified using two primers 5′-ACGACGTCACATATGCCTAGATGTACCTTTACCAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGACAAGGGATCCCTACAGCCACAGTGTCAGAG-3′. The PCR product was digested by NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the correspondingly cut pGADT7 that encodes the GAL4 transcription activation domain. The first extracellular loop of Glut4 (Glut4 loop 1) was amplified using two primers 5′-CTAGACCTGGAATTCAATGCCCCTCAGAAGGTGATT-3′ and 5′-ACGACGTCAGGATCCCCCAGAGGGTGGTGAGGGTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the pGADT7 vector that encodes GAL4 transcription activation domain. Transformation was done according to the manual of YEASYMAKER yeast transformation system 2 from Clontech. Co-transformants (100 μl) were plated in parallel on SD -Leu/-Trp, SD -Leu/-Trp/-His, and SD -Leu/-Trp/X-α-Gal plates. In parallel, cells transformed with pGADT7-IRAP LD (100 μl) were plated on SD -Leu/-His and SD -Leu/X-α-Gal plates, and cells transformed with pGBKT7-Sortilin LD (100 μl) were plated on SD -Trp/-His and SD -Trp/X-α-Gal plates. The number of colonies growing on the selection medium (SD -Leu/-Trp/-His) was quantified after 4 days at 30 °C using MACE software from Weiss Associates (Branford, CT) and expressed as normalized mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), but without reducing agents, and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C. The blots were probed with specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Kodak Image Station 440CF (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The signals were quantified using Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software. Previously, we have shown that full-length sortilin is faithfully targeted to the IRVs upon ectopic expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here, we decided to test whether or not the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin is sufficient for its targeting as it has been reported for another IRV protein, IRAP (24Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Glut4 itself (17Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37505-37511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To this end, the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin was conjugated to EGFP and two FLAG epitopes, and this molecule (EGFP-SORTILINtail) was expressed in 3T3-L1 cells stably transfected with Myc7-Glut4 (G cells in Ref. 7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We have reported earlier that an analogous molecule, mSorC (Fig. 1), co-localizes with Myc7-Glut4 in undifferentiated G cells and confers some degree of insulin responsiveness to co-expressed Myc7-Glut4 (7Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We now confirm this result using a novel reporter molecule, EGFP-SORTILINtail (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, we have found that, upon cell differentiation, EGFP-SORTILINtail loses its perinuclear localization and becomes randomly distributed throughout the intracellular space (Fig. 2, B and C). Naturally, in differentiated adipocytes, EGFP-SORTILINtail shows very little overlap with either Myc7-Glut4 or with syntaxin 6 that represents an endogenous marker of the perinuclear Glut4-containing compartment (Fig. 2, B and C). Sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3A) demonstrates that the sedimentation distribution of EGFP-SORTILINtail in differentiated adipocytes is different from that of endogenous sortilin, IRAP, and Glut4 but largely overlaps with cellugyrin, which is localized in ubiquitous intracellular transport vesicles with random intracellular localization and no insulin response (15Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To confirm this result, we have immunoadsorbed cellugyrin-positive vesicles using the polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin. In these experiments, we sequentially elute immunoadsorbed material with 1% Triton X-100 and then with SDS-containing Laemmli sample buffer. Triton solubilizes vesicular membrane and elutes proteins that do not bind directly to the immobilized antibody. Importantly, Triton practically does not elute antibody from the beads, which makes it easier to detect various proteins in this fraction by Western blotting. On the contrary, SDS elutes immobilized antibody and vesicular proteins that directly interact with this antibody. We found that a significant fraction of EGFP-SORTILINtail is co-immunoadsorbed with cellugyrin (Fig. 3B) suggesting that these two proteins are co-localized in the same vesicular population. The presence of EGFP-SORTILINtail in cellugyrin-positive vesicles may help to explain differentiation-related changes in the intracellular localization of this reporter protein. Therefore, in the following experiment, we analyzed the rate of biogenesis of cellugyrin-positive vesicles in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. To this end, we have performed vesicle budding assay in vitro using the donor membranes and cytosol from undifferentiated and differentiated cells in different combinations. Results of the budding reaction were expressed as the ratio between cellugyrin in the vesicle fraction and in the donor fraction. Our results show that the formation of cellugyrin-containing vesicles from “undifferentiated” donor membranes is significantly stimulated by the cytosol obtained from differentiated cells suggesting that some unidentified cytosolic factor which stimulates the formation of cellugyrin-containing vesicles is induced during differentiation (Fig. 4). When “differentiated” donor membranes are used in this assay, formation of cellugyrin-containing vesicles was even higher regardless of the source of cytosol (Fig. 4). These results support the notion that the rate of formation of cellugyrin-containing vesicles is greatly increased with cell differentiation. This, in turn, implies that, in differentiated cells, EGFP-SORTILINtail may be spread out from the perinuclear compartment to random intracellular loci by rapidly forming cellugyrin-positive vesicles. In any case, we have to conclude that the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin does not play the major role in protein targeting in differentiated adipocytes. Therefore, we decided to explore the role of the luminal N-terminal domain of sortilin. For these experiments, we substituted the cytoplasm"
https://openalex.org/W2144692179,"Signal transduction via the endothelial receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a key role in vascular inflammation. Recent observations have shown that the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system of activated phagocytes is highly up-regulated under inflammatory conditions where hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is formed as the major oxidant. Albumin, an in vivo carrier for myeloperoxidase is highly vulnerable to oxidation and a major representative of circulating advanced oxidized proteins during inflammatory diseases. Immunohistochemical studies performed in the present study revealed marked colocalization of HOCl-modified epitopes with RAGE and albumin in sections of human atheroma, mainly at the endothelial lining. We show that albumin modified with physiologically relevant concentrations of HOCl, added as reagent or generated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system, is a high affinity ligand for RAGE. Albumin, modified by HOCl in the absence of free amino acids/carbohydrates/lipids to exclude formation of AGE-like structures, induced a rapid, RAGE-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and up-regulation of the proinflammatory mediator monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Cellular activation could be blocked either by a specific polyclonal anti-RAGE IgG and/or a specific mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase inhibitor. The present study demonstrates that HOCl-modified albumin acts as a ligand for RAGE and promotes RAGE-mediated inflammatory complications."

Stopped-flow spectrophotometric experiments under single turnover conditions showed that trHbO reacts with H2O2 to give transient intermediate(s), among which is an oxyferryl heme, different from a typical peroxidase Compound I (oxyferryl heme π-cation radical). EPR spectroscopy indicated evidence for both tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals, whereas redox titrations demonstrated that the peroxide-treated protein product retains 2 oxidizing eq. We propose that Compound I formed transiently is reduced with concomitant oxidation of Trp(G8) to give the detected oxoferryl heme and a radical on Trp(G8) (detected by EPR of the trHbO Tyr(CD1)Phe mutant). In the wild-type protein, the Trp(G8) radical is in turn reduced rapidly by Tyr(CD1). In a second cycle, Trp(G8) may be reoxidized by the ferryl heme to yield ferric heme and two protein radicals. In turn, these migrate to form tyrosyl radicals on Tyr55 and Tyr115, which lead, in the absence of a reducing substrate, to oligomerization of the protein. Steady-state kinetics in the presence of H2O2 and the one-electron donor 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) indicated that trHbO has peroxidase activity, in accord with the presence of typical peroxidase intermediates. These findings suggest an oxidation/reduction function for trHbO and, by analogy, for other Group II trHbs.

These findings suggest an oxidation/reduction function for trHbO and, by analogy, for other Group II trHbs. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the glbO gene encodes truncated hemoglobin O (trHbO). 3The abbreviations used are: trHbO, truncated hemoglobin O; Mb, myoglobin; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); HRP, horseradish peroxidase. The function of trHbO is unknown. Its very high affinity for O2 (nanomolar range) due to a very slow release of O2(0.004 s-1) makes it unlikely that its function is the delivery of O2. In addition, the slow oxidation of NO by oxy-trHbO (0.6 μm-1 s-1) in comparison with that observed for oxygenated truncated hemoglobin N (745 μm-1 s-1) and oxy-Mb (35-45 μm-1 s-1) also makes an NO detoxification role for trHbO unlikely (1Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M.

A. 2002; 99: 5902-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of trHbO reveals the presence of three potentially oxidizable residues, Tyr23(B10), Tyr36(CD1), and Trp88(G8), in the vicinity of the heme, with Tyr(CD1) and Trp(G8) within H-bonding distance from the bound ligand (Fig. 1) (3Milani M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5766-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Studies of trHbO variants suggest that Tyr(CD1) and Trp(G8) control O2 association and dissociation rates, with Tyr(B10) playing a minor role (1Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, O2, NO, and CO all combine with deoxyferrous trHbO at similar very slow rates (1Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These slow ligand-independent combination rates indicate that the electronic factors that give rise to the large ligand-specific differences in most Mbs and Hbs are not dominant in trHbO. Instead, these observations are most consistent with limited access of ligands to the heme iron. Similarly, the comparable slow rate for the reaction of NO with heme-bound O2 of oxy-trHbO demonstrates that access of small molecules to heme-bound ligands is also limited. Three observations suggest that trHbO may be designed to perform redox reactions. First, there is the presence of the electron-rich oxidizable residues Tyr(B10), Tyr(CD1), and Trp(G8) in the vicinity of the heme, which is quite unusual for a globin. Second, the crystal structure of the cyanomet derivative of M. tuberculosis trHbO revealed the presence of a presumably posttranslational Tyr(B10)-Tyr(CD1) cross-link in the heme active site of one-half of the molecules (3Milani M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5766-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Tyr-Tyr cross-link adds trHbO to a growing list of hemoproteins that have aromatic amino acids covalently modified in their active sites: cytochrome c oxidase (His240-Tyr244), catalase HPII (His392-Tyr415), catalase-1 (Cys356-Tyr379), the catalase-peroxidases (KatG; Met255-Tyr229-Trp107), and a cytochrome c peroxidase mutant (Trp51-Tyr52) (4Bertrand T.

Third, oxy-trHbO is reduced by dithionite to deoxyferrous trHbO without prior dissociation of the oxygenous ligand (1Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is an unusual reaction for an oxyferrous globin, which has also been reported for trHbO of Bacillus subtilis (13Giangiacomo L. Ilari A. Boffi A. Morea V. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9192-9202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of dithionite to reduce hemebound O2 without the prior dissociation of the O2 and the presence of oxidizable residues in the immediate heme vicinity points to the possibility that highly sequestered ligands may be especially prone to redox reactions. In this regard, substitutions of Phe(CD1) with either Tyr or Trp in Mb have been shown to promote changes in redox properties (14Hara I. Ueno T. Ozaki S. Itoh S. Lee K. Ueyama N. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36067-36070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Ozaki S. Hara I. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a first approach to evaluate the redox properties of trHbO, we investigated its reactivity with H2O2 and its ability to catalyze oxidation reactions using H2O2.H2O2 binds to ferric hemeproteins in a deprotonated form (16Nagano S. Tanaka M. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14251-14258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In many cases (detailed below), once the H2O2 anion is bound to the heme iron (Compound 0), the oxygen-oxygen bond undergoes heterolytic cleavage, generating a two-electron oxidized species (2 oxidizing eq greater than ferric) called Compound I, which consists of an oxoferryl heme π-cation radical. Compound I can perform either a two-electron oxidation reaction to regenerate the ferric resting state, as observed in catalases, or a one-electron oxidation reaction (peroxidase activity) to generate Compound II, which consists of oxoferryl heme. Compound II can perform a second one-electron oxidation, which returns the enzyme to its ferric state. In some cases such as yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, fungal lignin peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase, Compound I is unstable, leading to the formation of a protein radical and oxoferryl heme (17Blodig W.

Acta. 2005; 1707: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We show here that trHbO reacts with H2O2 to give a putative transient Compound I intermediate that is rapidly converted through oxidation of Tyr(CD1) and Trp(G8) to a species with heme in the ferric state and two protein radicals. Optical stopped-flow experiments revealed a transient oxoferryl intermediate, whereas EPR spectroscopy of rapidly frozen samples provided evidence for both tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals, the latter clearly identified in the mutant Tyr(CD1)Phe. In absence of a reducing substrate, the protein radicals lead to oligomerization of the protein involving Tyr55 and Tyr115. The steady-state kinetics in the presence of H2O2 and the one-electron donor ABTS indicate that trHbO has peroxidase activity. These findings may provide insights into the function of trHbO and other Group II trHbs. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—Amino acid substitutions were carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the recommended protocol. The cloned M. tuberculosis glbO gene was used as a template with the following complementary oligo-nucleotide primers: Tyr(B10)Phe, 5′-GTGTCGCGTTTCTTTGCGCAGGTCGCC-3′ with 5′-GGCGACCTGCGCAAAGAAACGCGACAC-3′; Tyr(CD1)Phe, 5′-CTGCGGCGGGTGTTCCCCGAAGATGAC-3′ with 5′-GTCATCTTCGGGGAACACCCGCCGCAG-3′; and Trp(G8)Phe, 5′-GAACGCGACGCCTTTCTGCGGTGCATG-3′ with 5′-CATGCACCGCAGAAAGGCGTCGCGTTC-3′. The expression and purification of the recombinant proteins were performed in accordance with a previously published method (25Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Chemicals—H2O2 (30%, v/v) was obtained from BDH. The concentration of the stock solution was determined spectro-photometrically at 240 nm (ε = 43.5 m-1 cm-1). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), ferricytochrome c, ABTS, (hexa)amine ruthenium III, sodium ascorbate, NADH and KCN were obtained from Sigma. Buffer—Except when noted, all solutions were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 μm EDTA. Optical Absorption Spectroscopy—Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 3E spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Mississauga, Canada) equipped with a temperature-controlled multicell holder. Ferric trHbO samples were prepared in buffer. All spectra were recorded at 5 μm trHbO and 23 °C and analyzed using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software). Determination of H2O2 Concentration—H2O2 concentration was determined using a peroxidase assay. H2O2 consumption was detected by the HRP-catalyzed formation of ABTS oxidation product at 414 nm in a mixture containing 1 mm ABTS, 10 nm HRP, and 2.5 μm trHbO that was reacted or not with H2O2 (1 and 2 eq). H2O2 concentration was calculated from the increase in the absorbance at 414 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (26Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). A standard curve was made using known concentrations of H2O2 (0-20 μm). Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Protein samples for the resonance Raman experiments were used at a concentration of 50 μm in buffer. The trHbO/H2O2 (1:1) reaction product was obtained by manually mixing ferric trHbO with 0.01 volume of 5mm H2O2. trHbO Compound III was formed by reacting 100 μm ferric protein with 2 mm H2O2 on ice for 2 min. The excess H2O2 was rapidly removed by gel filtration on a P-6DG column equilibrated with buffer, and the protein concentration was then adjusted to 50 μm. The oxyferrous form of trHbO was produced by the reduction of the ferric derivative with sodium ascorbate (1 mm) and the mediator (hexa)amine ruthenium III (5 μm) and was directly transferred in a Raman quartz cell after 10 min. The resonance Raman spectra were obtained as described previously (27Chartier F.J. Couture M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1939-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 413-nm line of a krypton ion laser (Innova 302, Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was used to probe the ferric and H2O2-treated ferric and ferrous oxygenated forms of trHbO. The resonance Raman spectra were calibrated with the lines of indene in the 200-1700 cm-1 range. All measurements were made at room temperature. Cosmic ray lines were removed from the spectra by a routine of WinSpec software (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Several 5-min spectra were acquired over a 30-min period and analyzed using GRAMS/AI software (Thermo Scientific). Titration with Ferrocytochrome c—A stock solution of ferrocytochrome c was prepared by reducing ferricytochrome c with 10 mm ascorbate. The progress of the reduction reaction was followed by optical absorption spectroscopy in the visible region. Excess ascorbate was then removed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-6DG column (10 ml) equilibrated with buffer. The concentration of the stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically at 550 nm (ε550 = 27.6 mm-1 cm-1) (28Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4509-4514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stock solution was kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until used. To determine the number of oxidizing equivalents in the product formed by the reaction of ferric trHbO with 1 eq of H2O2, increasing amounts of ferrocytochrome c were premixed with 5 μm ferric trHbO in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reactions were started by the addition of H2O2 toa5 μm final concentration and followed at 550 nm. The extinction coefficient Δε550 (ferrocytochrome minus ferricytochrome c = 19.6 mm-1 cm-1) was used to calculate the yield of oxidized cytochrome c (28Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4509-4514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was performed twice with trHbO and once with HRP. The graph presented in Fig. 3 represents one set of data obtained with each of the two proteins. A control experiment in which 5 μm ferrocytochrome c was mixed with 5 μm H2O2 showed that <5% of the ferrocytochrome c was oxidized in the absence of trHbO. Oligomerization and SDS-PAGE of Protein Samples—Cross-linking experiments were performed in buffer at 23 °C for 5 min. Ferric trHbO (20 μm) was reacted with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 eq of H2O2 in a total volume of 75 μl. Following incubation, excess H2O2 and other low molecular weight substances were removed by gel filtration on a Microspin P-6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 6.8). SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the protein samples and heated at 65 °C for 5 min prior to loading onto 15% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (ICN). The effect of NADH, ascorbate, mannitol, and KCN was checked by including these agents separately (1 mm) in the reaction mixture before the addition of H2O2 (H2O2/trHbO molar ratio of 5). Separation and Quantification of trHbO Cross-linked Products by Gel Filtration Chromatography—Protein samples (100 μm) in buffer were exposed to 0, 1, and 3 molar eq of H2O2 for 5 min at 23 °C. Following incubation, excess H2O2 was removed by gel filtration on a Microspin P-6 column equilibrated with buffer containing 300 mm KCl. Protein samples were subjected to size exclusion chromatography at 23 °C on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in buffer containing 300 mm KCl. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad catalog no. 151-1901) were used to calibrate the column. The standards were dissolved in 100 μl of buffer containing 300 mm KCl. Elution of the protein was followed at 280 nm. The area under the peaks was determined and used to estimate the proportion of cross-linked proteins. Measurement of Catalytic Oxidation Activities—The peroxidase catalytic pathway of trHbO and horse heart myoglobin was investigated by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (SX. 18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer, Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) at 23 °C in buffer. At least two experiments were performed for each experimental point. Steady-state kinetic constants for the oxidation of ABTS were obtained by measuring the initial rates while varying the H2O2 concentration. Vmax and Km values were determined by fitting data with the Levenberg-Marquardt robust method (SoftZymics, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The formation rate of the ABTS oxidation product was determined from the increase in the absorbance at 414 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (26Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 nm protein, 1 mm ABTS, and 0.1-100 mm H2O2. Kinetics Study of the Formation of trHbO Higher Oxidizing Intermediates—Stopped-flow experiments were carried out with the SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a photodiode-array detector. The integration time was 2.5 ms. Ferric proteins (5 μm) were reacted with 1 molar eq of H2O2. 1600 spectra were collected on time scales ranging from 4 to 524 s. Singular value decomposition and global analysis were performed using the ProK program (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). Kinetics constants obtained from fitting had uncertainties of ≤5%. The results shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9 and 10 are representative of at least two experiments.FIGURE 8Spectral change of the ferric Tyr(B10)Phe mutant in reaction with 1 molar eq of H2O2 at 4 °C.

Low temperature spectra were recorded using an Oxford Instruments Spectrostat continuous-flow cryostat and ITC503 temperature controller for temperatures from 4 to 20 K. A finger Dewar flask inserted into the microwave cavity was used for recording spectra at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The spectra of ferric proteins (200 μm) were recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at 4 K. For spectra of intermediates, ferric proteins (167 μm final concentration) were reacted with 3 molar eq of hydrogen peroxide, both in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for 10 s and then rapidly frozen in precision bore EPR tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen. The samples were examined at 77 K (microwave frequency of 9.3910 GHz), 4 K, and 20 K (microwave frequency of 9.4940 GHz). Simulation of EPR data was performed using SimFonia software (Bruker Daltonics Inc.). Electron transfer coupling factors were calculated by PATHWAYS analysis (29Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and the HARLEM program based on coordinates from the wild-type trHbO crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1NGK) (30Liang Z.X. Kurnikov I.V. Nocek J.M. Mauk A.G. Beratan D.N. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2785-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This analysis provides the optimal donor-acceptor electron transfer pathway between tryptophan or tyrosine residues and the heme or between particular residues. Fig. 2A shows the UV-visible spectra of wild-type ferric trHbO and the products of its reaction with 1 and 2 eq of H2O2. The latter spectra recorded after 10 min had elapsed after the addition of peroxide are very similar to that of the initial ferric form, suggesting either that H2O2 did not react with the protein or that the heme iron atom of the product after turnover of peroxide had returned to the ferric state. The former possibility was ruled out because the addition of HRP and the peroxidase substrate ABTS after 10 min resulted in the barely detectable oxidation of the substrate (data not shown), consistent with the absence of unreacted peroxide in the solution. However, when the same reactions were performed in the absence of trHbO (but in the presence of HRP), 2 mol of oxidized ABTS were produced for each mole of added H2O2. The finding that all of the added H2O2 had been exhausted during the reaction indicated that trHbO was able to absorb at least 2 oxidizing eq and that a new product indeed was formed. In contrast, the spectra of the products of the reaction of HRP with H2O2 are those of Compounds I and II, as expected (Fig. 2B) (31Blumberg W.E. Peisach J. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1854-1862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the reaction of trHbO with H2O2 was investigated further by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The high frequency region (1300-1700 cm-1) of the resonance Raman spectra of hemeproteins is composed of several porphyrin inplane vibrational modes, which are sensitive to the oxidation state, coordination number, and spin state (ν3 and ν2)of the heme iron (32Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Vol. 3. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1988: 39-46Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, the resonance Raman spectra of untreated trHbO and H2O2-treated trHbO are nearly identical, consistent with the UV-visible spectroscopic observations above, suggesting that the heme iron is in the ferric state after incubation with peroxide. To demonstrate that the reaction with hydrogen peroxide generates a new oxidation state and to evaluate how many oxidizing equivalents are stored, we titrated the protein product of the reaction of trHbO and 1 eq of H2O2 with the one-electron donor ferrocytochrome c. We chose ferrocytochrome c as reductant for two reasons: 1) it does not reduce ferric trHbO to ferrous trHbO, which avoids possible side reactions involving molecular O2; and 2) it does not react with H2O2 under the conditions used. When 5 μm ferric trHbO was incubated simultaneously with 1 eq of H2O2 and ferrocytochrome c, a maximum of 10 μm ferrocytochrome c could be oxidized to ferricytochrome c (Fig. 3). Thus, both oxidizing equivalents from H2O2 were retained in the trHbO product, although, as shown above, the iron was found in the ferric state when observed after manual mixing with peroxide. Titration of HRP under these conditions indicated that the expected 2 oxidizing eq were retained in the product. Most peroxidases and many Hbs and Mbs form Compound III at high H2O2 concentration (33Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Nature. 1950; 166: 513-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Keilin D.

As shown in Fig. 2A, mixing ferric trHbO with 100 molar eq of H2O2 gave a stable species with an absorption spectrum identical to that of oxy-trHbO. To confirm the identity of the trHbO species, we used resonance Raman spectroscopy. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1B, the spectrum of H2O2-treated trHbO is nearly identical to that of oxy-trHbO, with ν4, ν3, and ν2 mode lines at 1379, 1506, and 1582 cm-1, respectively, indicating a reaction with heme iron, but no modification or break-down of the macrocycle. These results demonstrate that, in common with many Hbs and peroxidases, trHbO forms Compound III readily at high H2O2 concentrations. The preceding results led us to hypothesize that 2 oxidizing eq, initially resident on the heme and its ligand, may have been transferred to amino acid residues near the heme to form radicals. These primary protein-based radicals may have then led, via internal electron transfer, to the formation of surface-exposed amino acid radical(s) with subsequent cross-linking of the protein. Such reactions have been observed in several hemeproteins, including sperm whale Mb, when reacted with H2O2 in the absence of an exogenous electron donor (37Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F.

https://openalex.org/W2114017269,"We explored the possibility that circulating glutamine affects gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in rat striatal tissue and GABA concentrations in striatal extracellular fluid (ECF). Striatal microdialysates, each collected over a 20 min interval, were obtained after no treatment, oral L-glutamine (0.5 g/kg), or glutamine followed by NMDA (administered via the microdialysis probe). GABA concentrations were measured by HPLC using a stable OPA/sulfite precolumn derivatization and an electrochemical detection method. L-Glutamine administration significantly increased ECF GABA concentrations by 30%, and enhanced the response evoked by NMDA alone (70%) to 120% over baseline (all P<0.05). Striatal GABA levels increased significantly 2.5 h after oral L-glutamine (e.g., from 1.76 +/- 0.04 micromol/g in vehicle-treated rats to 2.00 +/- 0.15 micromol/g in those receiving 2.0 g/kg of glutamine). Striatal glutamine levels also increased significantly, but not those of glutamate. These data suggest that GABA synthesis in, and release from, rat striatum may be regulated in part by circulating glutamine. Hence, glutamine administration may provide a useful adjunct for treating disorders (e.g., anxiety, seizures) when enhanced GABAergic transmission is desired. Moreover, the elevation in plasma and brain glutamine associated with hepatic failure may, by increasing brain GABA release, produce some of the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy."

A large number of coactivators for TR have been isolated and characterized in vitro. However, their roles and functions in vivo during development have remained largely unknown. We have utilized metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis to study the role of these coactivators during post-embryonic development. Metamorphosis is totally dependent on the thyroid hormone, and TR mediates a vast majority, if not all, of the developmental effects of the hormone. We have previously shown that TR recruits the coactivator SRC3 (steroid receptor coactivator-3) and that coactivator recruitment is essential for metamorphosis. To determine whether SRCs are indeed required, we have analyzed the in vivo role of the histone acetyltransferase p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), which was reported to be a component of the SRC·coactivator complexes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that p300 is recruited to T3-responsive promoters, implicating a role of p300 in TR function. Further, transgenic tadpoles overexpressing a dominant negative form of p300, F-dnp300, containing only the SRC-interacting domain, displayed arrested or delayed metamorphosis. Molecular analyses of the transgenic F-dnp300 animals showed that F-dnp300 was recruited by TR (displacing endogenous p300) and inhibited the expression of T3-responsive genes. Our results thus suggest that p300 and/or its related CBP is an essential component of the TR-signaling pathway in vivo and support the notion that p300/CBP and SRC proteins are part of the same coactivator complex in vivo during post-embryonic development.

TR regulates transcription by forming a heterodimer with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and binding to T3 response elements (TREs) on T3-responsive promoters. In the absence of T3, the TR heterodimer represses transcription by recruiting corepressors, whereas in the presence of T3, TRs recruit coactivators to facilitate transcription (3Rachez C.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) and play central roles in diverse cellular processes such as cell cycle control, transformation, differentiation, and apoptosis (31Goodman R.H.

Although numerous studies have addressed the roles of these coactivators in vitro, their utilization by TR and other nuclear receptors in different tissue and cell types in vivo is yet to be elucidated. Information on the functional interplay of different coactivators, especially with reference to particular genes in vivo during post-embryonic development, remains scarce. We have utilized metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis, the African clawed toad, as a model system to study the role of coactivators in TR function. Anuran metamorphosis exhibits remarkable similarity to post-embryonic development in mammals and is totally dependent on T3 (33Tata J.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology.

The process involves integration of complex spatial and temporal gene regulatory networks that underlie de novo morphogenesis, remodeling, and complete regression of some organs, culminating in the transformation of an aquatic herbivorous tadpole to a terrestrial carnivorous frog. The metamorphic effects of T3 are essentially all mediated by TR (35Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Fu L. Shi Y.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Buchholz D.R. Hsia V.S.-C. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The system affords an added advantage in that the process can be induced by adding exogenous T3 to the tadpole-rearing water or blocked by using specific inhibitors of T3 synthesis (34Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 39Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. The Biology of Metamorphosis. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Google Scholar). Moreover, tadpoles are free-living and thus their development is not complicated by maternal influences. To correlate gene expression and function with metamorphic transformations, we have focused our studies by using intestinal remodeling as a model. The premetamorphic tadpole intestine is a very simple tubular organ made of mostly a single monolayer of larval epithelial cells surrounded by sparse connective tissue and muscles (40Shi Y.-B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 205-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During metamorphosis, essentially all larval epithelial cells die and are eventually replaced by adult epithelial cells developed de novo. Concurrently, connective tissue and muscles also develop extensively. Thus, during the early stage of intestinal remodeling (the first few days of T3 treatment of premetamorphic tadpoles or natural metamorphosis), the entire organ behaves largely as a single cell type, the larval epithelial cells, making it possible to carry out molecular analysis of gene regulation mechanisms in vivo. Using this model system, we have shown earlier that the steroid receptor coactivator SRC3 is up-regulated during metamorphosis (41Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5712-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is recruited to T3-responsive promoters in a geneand tissue-dependent manner (43Paul B.D. Buchholz D.R. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27165-27172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). More importantly, transgenic expression of a dominant negative SRC3 containing only the TR-interacting domain inhibits T3-dependent gene expression and metamorphosis, demonstrating an essential role for coactivator recruitment in this post-embryonic process. Because the dominant negative SRC3 blocks all coactivator binding to liganded TR, it remains possible that coactivators other than SRC family members play the essential role in gene regulation by TR and metamorphosis. To determine whether and how SRCs participate in metamorphosis, we have investigated here the role of SRC-binding protein p300 during metamorphosis. We have shown here that Xenopus p300 is recruited to T3-responsive promoters in a T3-dependent manner. Furthermore, using a dominant negative form of p300 that contains only the SRC-binding domain, we have demonstrated an essential role of p300·SRC complex or related complexes in gene regulation by TR and metamorphosis. Constructs—A dominant negative form of p300, F-dnp300, comprising the SRC interaction domain of X. laevis p300 (amino acids 1995–2166) (44Fujii G. Tsuchiya R. Itoh Y. Tashiro K. Hirohashi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from total RNA isolated from stage 54 X. laevis tadpoles using primers designed to incorporate a FLAG tag and cloned into pCRT7NTTOPO vector (Invitrogen), which has the Xpress and His tags. The clone was verified by sequencing. Next, the p300 fragment was digested with NdeI (filled in with Klenow polymerase) and EcoRI and subcloned into the BglII (filled in with Klenow) and EcoRI sites of the vector pT7Ts under the control of the T7 promoter. This construct has the 5′- and 3′-UTR of the β globin gene and was used for generating mRNA for the oocyte microinjection experiments. For verifying the specificity of the anti-p300 antibody by using in vitro translation followed by Western blotting, a construct encoding a p300 fragment containing the peptide TLPQVAVQNLLRALRSP, which was used for immunization, was amplified using RT-PCR from total RNA using the forward and reverse primers 5′-ATGAACCCAATGCCGCCCATAGGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGGAAATAGGGGGCTGTTGTGG-3′, respectively, and cloned into pCRT7TOPO-NT vector (Invitrogen). For transgenesis, the F-dnp300 transgene was placed under the control of the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter in the vector pCGCG (45Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), replacing the original green fluorescent protein (GFP) fragment at this location, resulting in the double promoter construct pCF-dnp300CG, which also has the gene for GFP driven by the eye lens-specific γ-crystallin promoter to facilitate the identification of transgenic animals. Antibodies—The anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody was purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. The anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma.

For the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays performed to study the recruitment of wild type p300 in wild type and transgenic animals, we used affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies generated against the peptides KSEPVELEEKKEEVKTE (amino acids 1033–1049) and KPKRLQEWYKKMLDKSVSER (amino acids 1487–1506) (48Havis E.

(Dexter, MI), and developmental stages were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (50Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis.1st Ed. North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). Adult female frogs used for oocyte preparation were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI). Stage 54 premetamorphic tadpoles at a density of 2 tadpoles/liter of dechlorinated water were treated with the indicated amount of T3 for 2–3 days. Histological Analysis of the Intestine—The intestines of the tadpoles were dissected out and fixed for 2 h at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde and 60% phosphate-buffered saline, cryoprotected in 0.5 m sucrose in 60% phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in O.C.T. compound (TissueTek). The intestines were sectioned in a cryotome at 7.5 μm. Sections were visualized using methyl green pyronin Y (Muto, Tokyo, Japan) (51Ishizuya-Oka A. Li Q. Amano T. Damjanovski S. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and T7Ts-FLAG-dnp300 were used to synthesize, in vitro, the corresponding mRNAs with the T7 or SP6 in vitro transcription kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion). The mRNA (5.75 ng/oocyte) was microinjected into the cytoplasm of 20 X. laevis stage-VI oocytes. The reporter plasmid DNA (0.33 ng/oocyte), which contained the T3-dependent TRβA promoter driving the expression of the firefly luciferase (52Amano T. Leu K. Yoshizato K. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was injected into the oocyte nucleus together with a control construct that contained the Herpes simplex tk promoter driving the expression of the Renilla luciferase (Promega, WI) (0.03 ng/oocyte). Following incubation overnight at 18 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nm T3, the oocytes were prepared for luciferase assay using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RT-PCRs were carried out using the Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The expression of the ribosomal protein L8 (rpl8) was used as an internal control (53Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used were (5′-3′): CGTGGTGCTCCTCTTGCCAAG and GACGACCAGTACGACGAGCAG for rpl8 (53Shi Y.-B. Liang V.C.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), CACTTAGCAACAGGGATCAGC and CTTGTCCCAGTAGCAATCATC for T3/bZIP (54Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol.

U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PCR was also done on RNA samples without reverse transcription as a control for genomic DNA contamination (data not shown). 0.5 μg of total RNA was used in a 25-μl reaction and with the following reaction conditions: 42 °C for 30 min for the RT reaction followed by 21–25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The resulting products were analyzed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Preparation of Tadpole Tissues for Western Blot Analysis— Tadpoles were sacrificed by decapitation on ice. The dissected organs were sliced into small pieces and homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein in the supernatant was quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on an 8–16% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assays using oocytes and tissues from tadpoles was performed as described previously (56Tomita A. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in the assay: anti-Xenopus TR (46Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY), and anti-Xenopus p300. After reverse cross-linking, DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was carried out with a ChIP DNA sample in duplicate on an ABI 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using promoter-specific primers and FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)-labeled TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) (38Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To ensure the validity of the PCR, for each assay, six 2-fold serial dilutions from a large batch of ChIP input DNA, prepared from intestines isolated especially for the purpose of serving as standards, were used for the quantification of the experimental samples. The calculated standard curves ranged in slope from -3.30 to -3.50, where theoretical amplification has a slope of -3.32. Also included was a no-template control where double-distilled water was added instead of sample DNA as a control for PCR product contamination. Results from the experimental samples were within the range of the standard curve (not shown). The primers used for the quantitative PCR were (5′-3′): CCCCTATCCTTGTTCGTCCTC and GCGCTGGGCTGTCCT, for the TRE region of the TRβA promoter and GGACGCACTAGGGTTAAGTAAGG and TCTCCCAACCCTACAGAGTTCAA for the TRE region of the T3/bZIP promoter. The FAM-labeled probes were (5′-3′) CCTAGGCAGGTCATTTC and ATGAGGCTGAGCATTCA for the TRβA and the T3/bZIP promoters, respectively. p300 Is Recruited to Target Promoters in the Tadpole Intestine upon T3 Treatment of Premetamorphic Tadpoles—We have previously shown that p300 is constitutively expressed in whole tadpoles as well as in the intestine and tail throughout metamorphosis (41Paul B.D. Shi Y.-B. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate whether p300 is utilized by TR during intestinal remodeling, we generated a polyclonal antibody against two peptides of the X. laevis p300 (Fig. 1A) and used it for ChIP assay to determine the association of p300 with T3 target genes in vivo. For this purpose, we treated premetamorphic tadpoles at stage 54 with 10 nm T3 for 2 days at room temperature, a condition known to induce metamorphosis (34Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 39Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. The Biology of Metamorphosis. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Google Scholar). Intestinal nuclei were isolated and subjected to ChIP assays using antibodies against p300, TR, or acetylated histone H4. The binding of p300 to two T3-responsive promoters, TRβA and T3/bZIP, was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B, Xenopus p300 was found to be recruited in a ligand-dependent manner to both promoters in the intestine. As a positive control for the ChIP assay, we showed that the levels of histone H4 acetylation, a marker associated with gene activation, was enhanced in T3-treated animals at both promoters (Fig. 1B), as seen in our earlier reports (42Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5712-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 43Paul B.D. Buchholz D.R. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 13138-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, TR was bound to both promoters with its binding to the T3/bZIP promoter increased after T3 treatment, again in agreement with earlier findings (47Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41222-41228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 57Sachs L.M. Shi Y.-B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results suggest that p300 plays a role in T3-signaling events during metamorphosis by participating in gene regulation by TR. Generation of a Dominant Negative Form of p300 to Inhibit T3-induced Transcription—To study the role of p300 in the TR-signaling cascade during development, we reasoned that a dominant negative form of p300 targeting gene regulation by TR should interfere with gene regulation by TR whe"

Many current small molecule calpain inhibitors also inhibit other cysteine proteases, including cathepsins, and need improved selectivity. The specificity of inhibition of several calpains and papain was profiled using synthetic positional scanning libraries of epoxide-based compounds that target the active-site cysteine. These peptidomimetic libraries probe the P4, P3, and P2 positions, display (S,S)- or (R,R)-epoxide stereochemistries, and incorporate both natural and non-natural amino acids. To facilitate library screening, an SDS-PAGE assay that measures the extent of hydrolysis of an inactive recombinant m-calpain was developed. Individual epoxide inhibitors were synthesized guided by calpain-specific preferences observed from the profiles and tested for inhibition against calpain. The most potent compounds were assayed for specificity against cathepsins B, L, and K. Several compounds demonstrated high inhibition specificity for calpains over cathepsins. The best of these inhibitors, WRH(R,R), irreversibly inactivates m- and μ-calpain rapidly (k2/Ki = 131,000 and 16,500 m–1 s–1, respectively) but behaves exclusively as a reversible and less potent inhibitor toward the cathepsins. X-ray crystallography of the proteolytic core of rat μ-calpain inactivated by the epoxide compounds WR γ-cyano-α-aminobutyric acid (S,S) and WR allylglycine (R,R) reveals that the stereochemistry of the epoxide influences positioning and orientation of the P2 residue, facilitating alternate interactions within the S2 pocket. Moreover, the WR γ-cyano-α-aminobutyric acid (S,S)-complexed structure defines a novel hydrogen-bonding site within the S2 pocket of calpains.

Calpains form a family of calcium-dependent proteolytic enzymes found in the cytosol and at the cell and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, where they modulate signal transduction pathways by converting transient calcium influxes into a proteolytic signal. The major calpain isoforms, μ- and m-calpains (also known as calpains 1 and 2), cleave a wide variety of proteins in the cell, including the cytoskeletal proteins α-spectrin, integrin subunit β3 and filamin A, the CDK5 regulator p35 (1Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial membrane permeability factor Bax (2Toyota H. Yanase N. Yoshimoto T. Moriyama M. Sudo T. Mizuguchi J. Cancer Lett. 2003; 189: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), supporting their involvement in a wide variety of cellular processes ranging from cell motility (3Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 46-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and cell cycling (4Janossy J. Ubezio P. Apati A. Magocsi M. Tompa P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14162-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). When a cell loses its ability to control calcium levels following an ischemic episode or acute neural/cerebral injury, calpains are constitutively activated and contribute to furthering cell damage by degrading nontarget proteins such as other cytoskeletal components, resulting in apoptosis or necrosis and irreversible tissue damage (6Kambe A. Yokota M. Saido T.C. Satokata I. Fujikawa H. Tabuchi S. Kamitani H. Watanabe T. Brain Res. 2005; 1040: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In a similar manner but on a different time scale, calpain overactivation also contributes to the development of cataracts and Alzheimer disease. Other calpain isoforms are linked to the development of specific pathologies such as calpain 3 in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type IIA (7Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F.

Guncar G. Podobnik M. Turk B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), has been a major obstacle in the development of therapeutic calpain inhibitors (16Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 117-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Many calpaininhibitory compounds that are currently in use, like calpeptin, MDL-28170, and ALLN, can cross-react with cathepsins, papain, and even, to some degree, with the proteasome (17Figueiredo-Pereira M.E.

Indeed, the normal physiological roles of calpains remain poorly defined, partly because calpain-specific inhibitors are not available. Therefore, the development of calpain inhibitors with improved specificity is necessary both to further the understanding of this protease family in cell regulation and disease and as potential leads for therapeutic agents.Mini-calpains, recombinant fragments of the full-length enzyme composed exclusively of the proteolytic domains I and II, can be used as surrogates to study the proteolytic activity of calpains (21Moldoveanu T.

These isolated proteolytic cores offer advantages over their native enzyme counterparts because they are not subject to autolysis, subunit dissociation, and aggregation. Perhaps most importantly, mini-calpains can be crystallized in the presence of Ca2+ with inhibitors bound at the active site, which has permitted a structure-guided approach to studying active-site-directed inhibitors of calpains (25Moldoveanu T.

Mechanistically, epoxide inhibitors inactivate their target enzyme by irreversibly alkylating the nucleophilic active-site cysteine, with a peptidyl moiety serving to position the epoxide group close to the cysteine (29Greenbaum D.

Peptidyl compounds, with basic amide chemistries, lend themselves well to such types of synthesis. Therefore, libraries of peptidyl compounds can be made with a variety of both natural and non-natural amino acids in the recognition region using combinatorial peptide-based solid-phase synthesis.We have applied such a library of positional scanning epoxide-based compounds in conjunction with a medium-throughput SDS-PAGE-based screening assay to profile m-calpain, the mini-calpains μI–II and mI–II engineered with the stabilizing mutation G203A, and the related cysteine protease papain. These preference profiles demonstrate the differences in the specificity between the proteases, including some differences in the active-site specificity between mini and full-length calpains. The observed calpain-oriented preferences were applied to design potent inhibitors of calpain that demonstrate a high degree of specificity relative to members of the cathepsin family. The most calpain-specific compound, WRH(R,R), was demonstrated to exclusively inactivate calpain irreversibly, supporting the usefulness of positional scanning libraries in the design of inhibitors and leads for activity-based probes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The proteases m-calpain (active and C105S inactive mutant), μI–II, and mI–II G203A from rat were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (21Moldoveanu T.

The structures and names of the non-natural amino acids used in the P2 position are given in the supplemental Table 1.Screening of the Positional Scanning Libraries, Calpains—A solution containing 1 mg/ml inactive m-calpain C105S (m-calpain with an inactivating C105S mutation) was prepared in calpain reducing buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8) and 10 mm DTT), along with either 0.18 mg/ml μI–II or 0.35 mg/ml mI–II G203A or 50 μg/ml m-calpain (for trans autolysis). For cis autolysis of m-calpain, the solution contained solely 1 mg/ml active m-calpain in the reducing buffer. Digestion was initiated by addition of an equal volume of calpain reducing buffer containing either 0.5–2 mm crude inhibitor pools and 100 mm CaCl2 (μI–II or mI–II G203A) or 50–200 μm crude inhibitor pools and 2 mm CaCl2 (m-calpain). The reactions were allowed to proceed at 35 °C for 30 min (m-calpain), 60 min (μI–II), or 120 min (mI–II G203A) prior to being quenched by addition of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue).Papain—A solution containing 1 mg/ml of inactive m-calpain C105S and 20–160 μm crude inhibitor pool was prepared in papain reducing buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 6.8) and 10 mm DTT). Digestion was initiated by the addition of an equal volume of papain reducing buffer containing 10 μg/ml papain and 10 mm CaCl2. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min prior to being quenched by addition of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 μm E-64. For all calpain and papain digests, the final reaction contained <5% Me2SO. The digests were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using triple-wide 12% polyacrylamide gels with a 65-well comb that can accommodate 5–10 μl of each digest sample per well. The 80-kDa subunit of m-calpain was quantitated densitometrically using the free open source software ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The background intensity corresponding to the signal immediately above the 80-kDa band was subtracted from every lane.Synthesis of the Epoxide Compounds—Single epoxide compounds were made on a Rink Amide solid support following similar protocols as described previously (38Verhelst S.H. Bogyo M. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, peptides were elongated making use of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide to remove Fmoc-protecting groups and a combination of 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (3 eq), hydroxybenzotriazole (3 eq) to couple the desired amino acid (3 eq). After the final Fmoc deprotection, the free amino terminus was capped with the epoxide warhead using a nitrophenyl-activated epoxysuccinate synthon. The inhibitors were cleaved from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/tri-isopropylsilane 18:1:1 and evaporated under reduced pressure prior to HPLC purification.Specificity Determination of the WRX Epoxides by a Fluorometric End Point Assay—The fluorometric assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates in a final volume of 100 μl, with concentrations of inhibitor ranging from 32 nm to 320 μm. The end point fluorescence intensity in each well was measured in a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the IC50 values were obtained by three-parameter sigmoidal fitting of the logarithmic concentration-inhibition curves using the data graphing software Sigma-Plot (Systat Software Inc.). Calpain inhibition was assayed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7) in the presence of 5 μm (EDANS)-EPLFAERK-(DABCYL) (23Cuerrier D. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40632-40641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol using 30–40 nm calpain. The reaction was initiated by the addition of inhibitor, substrate, and CaCl2, allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min, and then stopped by addition of EDTA to 5 mm. Fluorescence intensities were determined using 335 nm excitation and 505 nm emission wavelengths. Cathepsin inhibition was assayed in 0.1 m NaOAc-HCl (pH 5.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 300 pm cathepsin B, 10 pm cathepsin L, or 100 pm cathepsin K using the substrate Z-FR-AMC (20 μm for cathepsin B, 5 μm for cathepsin L, and 10 μm for cathepsin K). The cathepsins were reductively activated by preincubation in assay buffer for 20–30 min prior to initiating the reaction by addition of substrate and inhibitor. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min and then stopped by addition of E-64 to 10 μm. Fluorescence intensities were determined using 360 nm excitation and 450 nm emission wavelengths.Inhibition Kinetics of WRH(R,R) against Calpains and Cathepsins—Proteolytic activity was monitored in real time using a 1.5-ml quartz cuvette and an LS50-B luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Final Me2SO concentrations were less than 1%, and the total substrate consumed during the assay was always below 5%. All reactions were performed at room temperature. To maintain pseudo-first order conditions, the inhibitor concentration was at least four times the enzyme concentration at all times. Calpain activity was assayed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 2.5 μm (EDANS)-EPLFAERK-(DABCYL) (23Cuerrier D. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40632-40641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using 25 nm m- or μ-calpain. The reaction was initiated by the simultaneous addition of a fresh mixture of calcium and the inhibitor WRH(R,R) and monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 335 and 500 nm, respectively. Inhibitor concentrations were assayed in the range of 0.1–4.0 μm. To determine inactivation kinetic constants, a pseudo-first order rate constant (kobs) was first calculated from the progress curves using the Guggenheim method as described previously (39Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 23-51Google Scholar, 40Crawford C. Mason R.W. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The background inactivation rate (because of calpain autolysis) was calculated in the absence of inhibitor and subtracted from the rates obtained in the presence of inhibitor. The first order inactivation rate constant (k2) and binding constant (Ki) were calculated by the linear regression (slope = Ki/k2, y-intercept = 1/k2) of a 1/kobs versus 1/[I] plot as shown in Fig. 6B (41Powers J.C. Asgian J.L. Ekici O.D. James K.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4639-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Cathepsin activity was assayed in 0.1 m NaOAc-HCl (pH 5.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 730 pm cathepsin B, 6.25 pm cathepsin L, or 136 pm cathepsin K and the substrate Z-FR-AMC (20 μm for cathepsin B, 2 μm for cathepsin L, and 10 μm for cathepsin K). Product formation was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 440 nm, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of reductively pre-activated enzyme and the activity allowed to stabilize prior to addition of an aliquot of WRH(R,R). Inhibitor concentrations were assayed in the range of 4.0–50 μm (cathepsin B and K) or 1.0–20 μm (cathepsin L). The apparent inhibition constant (Kapp) was calculated as the reciprocal of the slope of a (V0/Vi) – 1 versus [I] plot, where V0 and Vi are the uninhibited and inhibited steady-state rates, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6D. This apparent rate constant was corrected for substrate competition to yield the inhibition constant (Ki) using the substrate concentration ([S]), Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), and the following equation: Ki = Kapp/(1 + [S]/Km). The Km values used were 150 μm for cathepsin B (42Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Cathepsin B. Cathepsin H. Cathepsin L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), 9.1 μm for cathepsin K (43Wieczerzak E. Jankowska E. Rodziewicz-Motowidlo S. Gieldon A. Lagiewka J. Grzonka Z. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Bromme D. J. Pept. Res. 2005; 66: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and 2.4 μm for cathepsin L (44Mason R.W. Green G.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Crystallographic Determination of the μI–II-Epoxide Complex Structures—HPLC-purified inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO to a concentration of 50 mm. To form the enzymeinhibitor complexes, 26 μl of a working stock solution of 25 mg/ml μI–II in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7) and 10 mm DTT was added to 26 μl of a fresh complexing solution containing 4% Me2SO, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7), 1 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm inhibitor. The reaction was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h prior to addition to the crystallization drop. Crystals of the complex were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing the above solution with an equal volume of precipitant solution using conditions expanding around 1.1–1.7 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 m MES (pH 5.5–6.25). The crystals obtained were cryo-protected prior to data collection by soaking in a solution of the mother liquor containing 20% glycerol. Data were collected on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator (50 kV, 100 mA), with an Osmic mirror system and a 300-mm image plate detector (MAR Research). The crystals were maintained at 100 K during data collection by a cryo-cooling system (Oxford Cryosystems). Data processing and manipulation were performed using the programs Mosflm (45Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) and Scala of the CCP4 program suite (46Potterton E. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Cowtan K. Noble M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The inhibitor-complexed structures were determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (47Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with the polypeptide moiety of the μI–II-SNJ-1945 complex (chain A of Protein Data Bank code 2G8J) as the input model. The refinement of the model was done using REFMAC5 (48Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), whereas XtalView/XFit (49McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) was used for model building. The Dundee PRODRG2 server (50Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar) was used to generate the molecular topology description of the ligand. All structure diagrams were generated in PyMOL (51DeLano W.L. PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 0.99rc6. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2003Google Scholar).Structure Coordinates—Coordinates for the WR18(S,S)- and WR13(R,R)-inactivated structures have been deposited with the RCSB protein Data Bank under the accession codes 2NQG and 2NQI, respectively. The P2 positions designated by 18 and 13 refer to γ-cyano-α-aminobutyric acid and allylglycine, respectively.RESULTSSpecificity Profiling Using Positional Scanning Libraries—The combinatorial epoxide libraries used here profile cysteine proteases based on their amino acid preferences at positions P2, P3, and P4 of the peptide recognition region. These libraries were previously synthesized and successfully used for profiling cathepsins (34Greenbaum D.C. Arnold W.D. Lu F. Hayrapetian L. Baruch A. Krumrine J. Toba S. Chehade K. Bromme D. Kuntz I.D. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), to generate a cathepsin B-specific inhibitor (52Greenbaum D. Baruch A.

In brief, each pool within a library contains a fixed amino acid (1 of 19 natural amino acids: no Cys, no Met, plus norleucine) at P2, P3, or P4 and a mixture of amino acids at the other positions (Fig. 1). The P2-scanning library is expanded to also incorporate 41 non-natural amino acids into the selection at this fixed position (supplemental Table 1). Additionally, the P2-scanning libraries (both natural and non-natural) exhibit either an (R,R)- or (S,S)-epoxide stereochemistry. Therefore, a total of 158 different pools, 120 of which form the P2-scanning library, were used in the screening. The larger size of the P2-scanning library is intended to reflect the importance of this position in generating specificity for clan CA proteases.FIGURE 1Structural representation of the mixture-based posi"
https://openalex.org/W2077099598,"Complex sphingolipids in yeast are known to function in cellular adaptation to environmental changes. One of the yeast complex sphingolipids, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC), is produced by the redundant inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) mannosyltransferases Csg1 and Csh1. The Ca2+-binding protein Csg2 can form a complex with either Csg1 or Csh1 and is considered to act as a regulatory subunit. However, the role of Csg2 in MIPC synthesis has remained unclear. In this study, we found that Csg1 and Csh1 are N-glycosylated with core-type and mannan-type structures, respectively. Further identification of the glycosylated residues suggests that both Csg1 and Csh1 exhibit membrane topology with their C termini in the cytosol and their mannosyltransferase domains in the lumen. After complexing with Csg2, both Csg1 and Csh1 function in the Golgi, and then are delivered to the vacuole for degradation. However, uncomplexed Csh1 cannot exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated that Ca2+ stimulates IPC-to-MIPC conversion, because of a Csg2-dependent increase in Csg1 levels. Thus, Csg2 has several regulatory functions for Csg1 and Csh1, including stability, transport, and gene expression.

An. Acad. Bras. Cienc. 2004; 76: 553-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are also involved in the formation of membrane lipid microdomains (lipid rafts), which serve as platforms for effective signal transduction (2Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). In mammals, several hundred GSLs differing in number and/or type of sugar chains constitute some of the complex sphingolipids. In contrast, the sphingolipid composition in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is quite simple, existing as only three myo-inositol-containing complex sphingolipids. The simplest of the yeast sphingolipids, inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), which is essential for cell growth (3Heidler S.A. Radding J.A. Antimicrob.

There are five IPCs (IPC-A, -B, -B′, -C, and -D), which differ in the position and/or number of hydroxyl groups within the ceramide moiety (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M.

Mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC) is formed by the addition of mannose to IPC, and addition of another phosphoinositol generates mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide (M(IP)2C). MIPC synthesis is catalyzed by either of two homologous IPC mannosyltransferases, Csg1 and Csh1, which prefer different IPC species as substrates (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J.

We recently demonstrated that the Ca2+-binding protein Csg2 (14Beeler T. Gable K. Zhao C. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7279-7284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Takita Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), interacts with both Csg1 and Csh1 (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our Δcsg1 Δcsg2 cells had no MIPC synthase activity, and introduction of a Δcsg2 mutation into the Δcsh1 cells also resulted in a significant reduction in activity (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction with Csg2 is essential for the activity of Csh1 and is quite important for that of Csg1. The existence of the Ca2+ binding regulatory subunit Csg2 and two different catalytic subunits, Csg1 and Csh1, implies that IPC-to-MIPC conversion is a highly regulated process. However, the exact functions of Csg2 and Ca2+ in MIPC synthesis remain unclear. In the present study, we report that Csg2 functions in the production, stability, and transport of Csg1 and/or Csh1. In addition, we found that Ca2+ treatment increases Csg1 levels in a Csg2-dependent manner and enhances MIPC synthesis. Yeast Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table 1. The Δcsg2::URA3 cells were constructed by replacing the 0.41-kb EcoRI-HincII region in the CSG2 gene with the URA3 marker.

To produce the DNA fragment used for this homologous recombination, a ∼1-kb region of chromosomal DNA covering the 3′-half and 3′-downstream region of the CSG1 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GGAAGCAGTACAAAAGATGGCGC-3′ and 5′-CCCACACACGGTTGTTATCCTAG-3′. The amplified DNA was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), generating the pSU74 plasmid.

Finally, the 1.8-kb SpeI fragment of pAK453 containing the 3xFLAG tag and the HIS3 marker was inserted into the XbaI site of pSU78. The generated CSG1–3xFLAGHIS3 construct was amplified by PCR and used for homologous recombination. The CSH1 and CSG2 genes were similarly tagged with 3xFLAG. Plasmids—The pSU8 (CSG2–3xHA, LEU2 marker, 2 μ), pSU30 (CSG1-HIS6-MYC, HIS3 marker, 2 μ), and pSU41 (CSH1-HIS6-MYC, HIS3, 2 μ) plasmids, encoding Csg2 C-terminally tagged with triple HA (3xHA) (Csg2–3xHA), Csg1 C-terminally tagged with His6 and Myc (Csg1-His6-Myc), and Csh1-His6-Myc, respectively, have been described previously (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glycosylation mutants of CSG1 (CSG1-N224Q-HIS6-MYC, pSU145) and CSH1 (CSH1-N51Q-HIS6-MYC, pSU108; CSH1-N247Q-HIS6-MYC, pSU109; CSH1-N51/247Q-HIS6MYC, pSU193) were created from a pSU30 or pSU41 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit. Two complementary oligonucleotides were used to construct each mutant. The sequences of the sense oligonucleotides (with mutated nucleotides underlined) were 5′-TGGCGCATACCTAAGCAGGGGACAGTAAGAATC-3′ (CSG1-N224Q-HIS6-MYC), 5′-CCCAATGGCTTCCAGTCAACATTCTATGAG-3′ (CSH1-N51Q-HIS6-MYC), and 5′-GATTATAAAATGCATCAGAATTCTTTTTTCTC-3′ (CSH1-N247Q-HIS6-MYC). Immunoprecipitation—Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C to 1.0 A600 unit. Cells were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 4 m urea, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)) and vigorously mixed with glass beads for 10 min at 4 °C. After removal of cell debris and glass beads by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (total cell lysates) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The precipitates (integral membrane proteins) were suspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-tetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× Complete™) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-FLAG M2 or anti-Myc (A7470) agarose conjugate (Sigma). The agarose beads were then washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), and bound proteins were eluted with 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue). The immunoprecipitates were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration, 5%) and boiled for 5 min. Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed as described elsewhere (17Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, ∼4 × 109 cells were harvested, suspended in 10 ml of buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4 and 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 1.2 m sorbitol), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 1 mg of Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The resulting spheroplasts were washed with 10 ml of buffer D and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.8 m sorbitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 × Complete™, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by passaging through a 27-gauge needle four times. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recovered and saved. This lysis step was repeated two more times. All of the supernatants were pooled and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min), yielding a final supernatant. The cell supernatant (0.4 ml) was loaded onto a step sucrose gradient (22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 60, and 75% (w/v) sucrose, each in 0.35 ml of buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1× Complete™, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After samples were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C, 8 fractions (0.53 ml each) were collected from top to bottom. Each fraction was diluted with two volumes of lysis buffer, and membrane proteins were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The proteins were suspended in 2× sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. Deglycosylation by Peptide N-Glycosidase (PNGase) F—Removal of N-glycans was performed on integral membrane proteins or on the immunoprecipitates using PNGase F (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG antibody M2 (1.4 μg/ml; Stratagene), anti-Myc antibody PL14 (2 μg/ml; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), anti-Dpm1 antibody 5C5 (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and an anti-Anp1 antiserum (1:4000 dilution; a gift from Dr. Sean Munro, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) (19Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (both from GE Healthcare BioSciences, Piscataway, NJ, and diluted 1:5,000) was used as the secondary antibody. Labeling was detected using ECL™ (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), ECL™ plus kit (GE Healthcare BioSciences), or Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the YeaStar RNA Kit™ (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) according to the manufacturer's manual. cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (AMV) (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using a TaqMan PCR kit on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan universal PCR master mix, primers (CSG1, 5′-GAACGGGACAGTAAGAATCCTACAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAAGAGCCTTTAGTAATGGAGAA-3′; CSH1, 5′-GAGGGCGGATGCAATACG-3′ and 5′-CAACCATCATCCAAGTCAATGTAAA-3′; CSG2, 5′-AACGGCGACAACGGAAACT-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCACGAAGCAAAATACA-3′; ACT1, 5′-TGGATTCCGGTGATGGTGTT-3′ and 5′-AAATGGCGTGAGGTAGAGAGAAA-3′), and probes (CSG1, 5′-CTGCTTACTACAAGATGCATAGTTATTCAT-3′; CSH1, 5′-TTTCATCCTTTCGCATTATGGT-3′; CSG2, 5′-AAGTTCATTAACCTTCTATCTGACCTTT-3′; ACT1, 5′-CTCACGTCGTTCCAATTTACGCT-3′) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The 50-μl PCR mixtures included 5-μl reverse transcription product, 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 0.25 μm TaqMan probe, 0.9 μm forward primer, and 0.9 μm reverse primer. The reactions were incubated in a 96-well plate at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. All reactions were run in triplicate. In Vivo [3H]Dihydrosphingosine (DHS) Labeling—[3H]DHS labeling assay was performed as described previously (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation in Csg1 and Csh1—To detect endogenous Csg1 and Csh1, we inserted a 3xFLAG tag into the 3′-termini of the endogenous CSG1 and CSH1 genes, generating SUY69 and SUY73 cells, respectively. The tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. Csg1–3xFLAG (predicted molecular mass, 47 kDa) was detected as two bands, a major 46-kDa band and a weak 48-kDa band (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a previous report (13Lisman Q. Pomorski T. Vogelzangs C. Urli-Stam D. de Cocq van Delwijnen W. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1020-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the upper 48-kDa band was determined to be an N-glycosylated form, because it shifted to 46 kDa upon treatment with PNGase F. Similarly, Csh1–3xFLAG (predicted molecular mass 47 kDa) was detected as several bands of 47.5, 49, and a broad band of 55–70 kDa (Fig. 1B). All bands converged at 46 kDa upon treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that both Csg1 and Csh1 carry N-glycans. Effects of Csg2 on the Glycosylation Status of Csh1—Recently, we reported that Csg2 forms a complex with Csg1 or Csh1 (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45049-45055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effects of Csg2 on the glycosylation status of Csg1 and Csh1. Neither the gel mobility nor protein levels of Csg1–3xFLAG differed in the Δcsg2 cells compared with those in cells bearing the wild-type CSG2 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the broad bands of 55–70 kDa representing Csh1–3xFLAG were completely converted in the Δcsg2 mutant to the 49-kDa band (Fig. 2A), which may have the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) “high mannose-type” glycan as discussed below. We also investigated the glycosylation status of overproduced Csg1 and Csh1. Both proteins were expressed as C-terminally His6-Myc-tagged proteins under their own promoters from multicopy (2 μ) plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2B, their glycosylation status was similar to the endogenously expressed proteins. Csg1-His6-Myc was detected as 46 and 48-kDa bands. PNGase F treatment demonstrated that the 48-kDa band but not the 46-kDa band again represented a glycosylated form (data not shown). Csh1-His6-Myc was observed as 49 kDa and broad, 55–70-kDa bands (Fig. 2B), all of which shifted to 46 kDa with PNGase F treatment (data not shown). Next, we investigated the effects of co-overproduction of Csg2–3xHA on the glycosylation status and protein levels of Csg1-His6-Myc and Csh1-His6-Myc. Although overproduction of Csg2–3xHA had little effect on the ratio of glycosylated to nonglycosylated forms of Csg1-His6-Myc, it did cause increases in the protein levels of both forms (Fig. 2B). In contrast, Csg2–3xHA overproduction significantly affected the glycosylation status of Csh1-His6-Myc. The 49-kDa band of Csh1-His6-Myc was diminished, and, concomitantly, the broad 55–70-kDa band was enhanced. These results suggest that interaction with Csg2 affects the protein level and glycosylation of Csg1 and Csh1, respectively. Modification of Csh1 with the Mannan-type Glycosylation— Two different N-glycan structures have been found in yeast proteins (20Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One is the mannan-type structure, which consists of a backbone of about 50 mannose residues with short side branches. Several cell wall and periplasm proteins carry this type of modification. On the other hand, proteins localized in the ER, Golgi, endosomes, vacuole, or plasma membrane often have a much smaller core-type structure with only a few mannoses (Fig. 3A). The much higher molecular mass of Csh1–3xFLAG (55–70 kDa and Fig. 1B) compared with the predicted mass (47 kDa) is characteristic of mannan-type modification with dozens of sugars. To confirm this, we expressed Csh1-His6-Myc and Csg1-His6-Myc in mutants lacking Van1, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of mannan-type structures (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the gel mobility of Csg1-His6-Myc was unchanged in the Δvan1 cells. In contrast, the broad 55–70-kDa bands of Csh1-His6-Myc observed in the wild-type cells were diminished in the Δvan1 mutants, but a 51-kDa band appeared, which may carry an incomplete mannan-type structure (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Csh1 is N-glycosylated with a mannan-type structure, whereas Csg1 may be modified with core-type glycosylation. Defective Trafficking of Csh1 from the ER to the Golgi by CSG2 Deletion—In Δcsg2 cells, Csh1–3xFLAG, normally a broad 55–70-kDa band, appeared as a 49-kDa band (Fig. 2A). It is highly likely that the 49-kDa band carries N-glycans of the high mannose-type, which are found in the ER and are the precursors of the mannan-type structure. Mannan-type modification is known to occur in the Golgi apparatus (21Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), so the loss of the mannan-type modification on Csh1 in the Δcsg2 cells suggests that Csh1 cannot exit the ER without interacting with Csg2. To test this further, we examined the subcellular distribution of Csh1 in wild-type (CSG2+) and Δcsg2 cells by sucrose gradient fractionation. As shown Fig. 4, Csh1–3xFLAG carrying N-glycans of the mannan-type (Csh1–3xFLAG (M)) and high mannose-type (Csh1–3xFLAG (H)) were co-fractionated with the Golgi marker Anp1 and the ER marker Dpm1, respectively, in wild-type cells (CSG2+). In contrast, most of Csh1–3xFLAG in the Δcsg2 mutant cells carried N-glycans of the high mannosetype (Csh1–3xFLAG (H)) and co-fractionated with Dpm1 (Fig. 4). These results indicate that Csh1 cannot exit the ER without Csg2. The Effects of Csg2 on the Degradation and Transport of Csg1 and Csh1—Integral membrane proteins like Csg1 and Csh1 can be degraded either by the proteasome, after dislocation from the ER membrane (ER-associated degradation (ERAD)) (22Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), or by vacuolar proteases, after transport to the vacuoles. To further examine the effect of Csg2 on the stability and transport of Csg1 and Csh1, we constructed a double null mutant for PEP4 and PRB1, which each encodes a major vacuolar protease. In the Δpep4 Δprb1 mutant, the amount of endogenously expressed Csg1–3xFLAG was increased (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Csg1 is delivered to the vacuole for degradation. In addition, the pattern and intensity of this band were similar in the Δcsg2 Δpep4 Δprb1 mutant, indicating that free Csg1 follows the same fate as that of Csg1 complexed with Csg2. The Csh1 level was also increased in the Δpep4 Δprb1 mutant (Fig. 5B), but strikingly so, implying that it is normally degraded in the vacuole. However, introduction of the Δcsg2 mutation into the Δpep4 Δprb1 cells greatly reduced the Csh1–3xFLAG to levels similar to those observed in wild-type (PEP4+ PRB1+ CSG2+) cells. This supports the contention that free Csh1 cannot exit the ER, because mutations in the vacuolar protease had no effect on Csh1 levels in the absence of Csg2. Free Csh1 may instead be subjected to rapid degradation by ERAD. In summary, Csg2 exerts different effects on the transport of Csg1 and Csh1. Determination of N-Glycosylation Sites in Csh1 and Csg1— Csh1 and Csg1 exhibit similar hydrophobic profiles and are predicted by the TopPredII 1.1 program (23Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) to be integral membrane proteins with up to three transmembrane segments (Fig. 6A; H1–H3). In addition, Csh1 and Csg1 contain two (Asn-51 and Asn-247) and six (Asn-224, Asn-295, Asn-298, Asn-370, Asn-379, and Asn-380) potential N-glycosylation sites, respectively (Fig. 6A). To determine which of the Csh1 sites are N-glycosylation sites, Asn to Gln mutants (N51Q, N247Q, and N51Q/N247Q) were constructed and overexpressed in yeast cells as His6-Myc-tagged proteins. Both N51Q and N247Q mutants exhibited faster migration than that of the wild-type protein, and the N51Q/N247Q double substitution resulted in a single 46-kDa band, corresponding to the nonglycosylated form (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that both Asn-51 and Asn-247 in Csh1 are modified by glycosylation. N-Glycosylation occurs only in the ER lumen. Therefore, our results indicate that both Asn-51 and Asn-247 are localized in the luminal side and, thus, the H2 region must not traverse the membrane. The proposed topology model is illustrated in Fig. 6C. Because Csg1 shares high similarities with Csh1 in amino acid sequence and hydrophobic profile, it is reasonable to consider that Csg1 exhibits similar transmembrane topology. Of the six potential N-glycosylation sites, only Asn-224 is predicted to be in the lumenal domain. Thus, we created an N224Q mutant and examined its glycosylation status. The N224Q mutant Csg1 was detected as a single 46-kDa band, in contrast to wild-type Csg1-His6-Myc, which was detected as two bands (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that Asn-224 in Csg1 is indeed modified by glycosylation. Thus, it is highly likely that Csg1 exhibits the same transmembrane topology as Csh1 (Fig. 6C). Enhanced Synthesis of MIPC in the Presence of Ca2+—Because Csg2 has a Ca2+ binding domain, we next examined whether Ca2+ treatment caused changes in the protein levels of Csg1, Csh1, and Csg2. Cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 mm CaCl2, and endogenously expressed Csg1–3xFLAG, Csh1–3xFLAG, and Csg2–3xFLAG were examined by immunoblotting following PNGase F treatment to remove N-glycans. Treatment with Ca2+ did result in dose-dependent increases in Csg1–3xFLAG (Fig. 7A). However, treatment was less effective in the Δcsg2 cells, suggesting that Csg2 is involved in this process. In contrast, endogenously expressed Csh1–3xFLAG and Csg2–3xFLAG were nearly unchanged by treatment with Ca2+ (Fig. 7A). To investigate whether the increases in protein levels were because of enhanced gene expression, we performed real-time PCR analyses. The mRNA levels of CSG1 were increased upon treatment with Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B). Again, however, Ca2+ treatment had no significant effect on CSH1 and CSG2 mRNA levels. Thus, the increases in Csg1 protein levels could be explained by enhanced gene expression. Next, we investigated whether the up-regulation of these proteins by Ca2+ affects MIPC synthesis. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ then labeled with [3H]DHS. As reported previously (12Uemura S. Kihara A. Inokuchi J. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2083619020,"The N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that respond to proinflammatory N-formylated bacterial peptides (e.g., formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, fMLF) and, thus, contribute to the host response to bacterial infection. Paradoxically, a growing body of evidence suggests that some members of this receptor family may also be targets for certain anti-inflammatory molecules, including annexin A1 (ANXA1), which is an important mediator of glucocorticoid (GC) action. To explore further the potential role of FPRs in mediating ANXA1 actions, we have focused on the pituitary gland, where ANXA1 has a well-defined role as a cell-cell mediator of the inhibitory effects of GCs on the secretion of corticotrophin (ACTH), and used molecular, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to address the question in well-established rodent models. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis identified mRNAs for four FPR family members in the mouse anterior pituitary gland, Fpr-rs1, Fpr-rs2, Fpr-rs6, and Fpr-rs7. Functional studies confirmed that, like dexamethasone, ANXA1 and two ANXA1-derived peptides (ANXA1(1-188) and ANXA1(Ac2-26)) inhibit the evoked release of ACTH from rodent anterior pituitary tissue in vitro. Fpr1 gene deletion failed to modify the pituitary responses to dexamethasone or ANXA1(Ac2-26). However, lipoxin A4 (LXA4, 0.02-2 microM, a lipid mediator with high affinity for Fpr-rs1) mimicked the inhibitory effects of ANXA1 on ACTH release as also did fMLF in high (1-100 microM) but not lower (10-100 nM) concentrations. Additionally, a nonselective FPR antagonist (Boc1, 100 microM) overcame the effects of dexamethasone, ANXA1(1-188), ANXA1(Ac2-26), fMLF, and LXA4 on ACTH release, although at a lower concentration (50 microM), it was without effect. Together, the results suggest that the actions of ANXA1 in the pituitary gland are independent of Fpr1 but may involve other FPR family members, in particular, Fpr-rs1 or a closely related receptor. They thus provide the first evidence for a role of the FPR family in the regulation of neuroendocrine function."
https://openalex.org/W2123359348,"The insect order of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, sawflies, and wasps) consists almost entirely of haplodiploid species. Under haplodiploidy, males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, whereas females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. Although diploid males commonly occur, haploid females have never been reported. In analyzing the phenomenon of gynandromorphism in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, we found a line that generates complete phenotypic females from unfertilized eggs. These females have ovaries, can lay eggs, and are haploid, as shown by cytological and flow cytometric analyses. The data show that diploidy is not necessary for female development."
https://openalex.org/W2049702089,"The epithelial Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE3, was found to activate slowly following an acute cytosolic acidification. The sigmoidal course of activation could not be explained by the conventional two-state model, which postulates that activation results from protonation of an allosteric modifier site. Instead, mathematical modeling predicted the existence of three distinct states of the exchanger: two different inactive states plus an active form. The interconversion of the inactive states is rapid and dependent on pH, whereas the conversion between the second inactive state and the active conformation is slow and pH-independent but subject to regulation by other stimuli. Accordingly, exposure of epithelial cells to hypoosmolar solutions activated NHE3 by accelerating this latter transition. The number of surface-exposed exchangers and their association with the cytoskeleton were not affected by hypoosmolarity. Instead, NHE3 is activated by the membrane deformation, a result of cell swelling. This was suggested by the stimulatory effects of amphiphiles that induce a comparable positive (convex) deformation of the membrane. We conclude that NHE3 exists in multiple states and that different physiological parameters control the transitions between them.

We conclude that NHE3 exists in multiple states and that different physiological parameters control the transitions between them. The activity of sodium-proton exchangers (NHEs) is fundamental to the maintenance of both intracellular and systemic [Na+] and pH. Multiple isoforms of NHE have been identified that differ in their tissue distribution and subcellular localization. Some isoforms function primarily in cytosolic cation homeostasis, whereas others are thought to regulate organellar cation transport, accounting for their differential subcellular localization. Similarly, differences in the pattern of expression likely underlie the functional roles of various NHEs; widely expressed isoforms, such as NHE1, have housekeeping activity, whereas those restricted to defined tissues have specialized functions. One such specialized isoform is NHE3, which is expressed almost exclusively on the apical pole of epithelial cells. In the gut and kidney, NHE3 mediates the (re)absorption of salt, bicarbonate, and water (1Lorenz J.N. Schultheis P.J. Traynor T. Shull G.E. Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F447-F453PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of their precise function, the activity of all the isoforms studied to date is highly sensitive to the intracellular pH (pHi) (2Aronson P.S. Nee J.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43580-43585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). According to this two-state model, protonation of the allosteric site converts the exchanger from an inactive to an active form. In addition to pHi, some NHE isoforms are sensitive to alterations in osmolarity (9Ritter M. Fuerst J. Woll E. Chwatal S. Gschwentner M. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The best studied example, NHE1, is activated by extracellular hyperosmolarity and inhibited by hypoosmolarity (10Garnovskaya M.N.

The activation of NHE1 induced by hyperosmolarity is felt to be a compensatory response to cell shrinkage, because it causes net salt and water intake, leading to volume restoration. In contrast, hyperosmolarity inhibits epithelial NHE3 activity (12Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

The response of NHE3 to hypoosmolarity has been studied less extensively (13Good D.W. Di Mari J.F. Watts 3rd, B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1443-C1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Watts 3rd, B.A. Good D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effect of reduced extracellular osmolarity on NHE3 activity. During the course of these studies, we found that the conventional two-state model of NHE activation was insufficient to account for the behavior of NHE3. We report that an additional inactive state of the exchanger is required to explain its kinetics of activation. The transition between the two inactive (or poorly active) states is pHi-independent and limits the rate of activation. Importantly, hypoosmotic stress was found to stimulate NHE3 by accelerating the rate-limiting transition between inactive states. This effect was not caused directly by the hypoosmolarity of the bathing solution but by the curvature imposed on the membrane upon cell swelling.

Phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride were from Sigma. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mouse antibody and F(ab) fragment were from BabCo. Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Monoclonal anti-phosphoserine-552 NHE3 antibody was generated as described (18Kocinsky H.S.

Isotonic Na+-rich medium contained 70 mm NaCl, 50 mm N-methylglucammonium chloride, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). Hypotonic Na+-rich medium contained 70 mm NaCl, 10 mm N-methylglucammonium chloride, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). Isotonic and hypotonic K+-rich medium had similar composition except that NaCl was replaced by KCl. Cells and Constructs—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II and opossum kidney cells were obtained from ATCC. The MDCK-II cells were stably transfected with NHE3 containing three tandem copies of the influenza virus HA epitope (YPYDVPDYAS) inserted between the first and second membrane-spanning domains, between Arg38 and Phe39 (NHE3′38HA3), generated as described (19Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To select a stable line (MDCK-NHE3′38HA3), the cells were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 and screened by immunofluorescence for expression of HA-tagged NHE3. MDCK and opossum kidney cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with 5% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The experiments were performed at least 72 h after the monolayers had reached confluence. Measurement of Na+/H+ Exchange Activity—NHE3 activity was assessed in MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells as the rate of Na+-induced pHi recovery after an acid load. Dual excitation ratio determinations of the fluorescence of BCECF were used to measure pHi, as previously detailed (12Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown to confluence on 25-mm glass coverslips, placed into Attofluor cell chambers, and mounted on the stage of the microscope. Next, they were loaded with 5 μg/ml BCECF acetoxymethyl ester and prepulsed with 50 mm NH4Cl in HEPES-buffered RPMI at 37 °C for 10 min for subsequent acid loading. Extracellular dye and NH4Cl were then washed away with Na+-free solution, and Na+/H+ exchange was initiated by reintroduction of Na+ in either the hypoosmolar or isoosmolar solution. Measurements of NHE3 activity were performed in the presence of 5 μm EIPA to obviate the contribution by NHE1. Intracellular pH (pHi) was calibrated by equilibrating the cells with K+-rich medium titrated to defined pH values and containing 10 μg/ml nigericin (20Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Calibration was performed immediately after the recovery of pHi for each experimental condition/osmolarity tested. Fields of cells were therefore not exposed to multiple rounds of acidification and recovery of pHi. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—The experiments were performed essentially as described previously (21Alexander R.T. Furuya W. Szaszi K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12253-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells were labeled with mouse anti-HA F(ab) fragment (1:300 dilution in RPMI) and then with secondary Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab) fragment (1:500 dilution). The samples placed in Attofluor chambers were mounted on the stage of a confocal laser microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) and bathed in either isoosmolar or hypoosmolar solution. The apical plane was brought into focus, and two equal areas (2 μm in diameter) were defined. After acquiring two base-line fluorescence measurements, one of the selected areas was irreversibly photobleached, and then the fluorescence of both areas was measured over time. The fractional fluorescence recovery of the bleached area was determined relative to the average of the two prebleach measurements. The unbleached area was used to estimate possible bleaching incurred during image acquisition. Kinetic Modeling—Theoretical models of the potential states of NHE3 activation were generated as detailed in the supplemental material. These models were then used to predict the rate of recovery of pHi over time. Software developed at the Centre for Computational Biology of the Hospital for Sick Children was used for this purpose. NHE3 Quantification—Determination of surface-exposed and total cellular NHE3 was performed by an immunoperoxidase method, as detailed in Ref. 22Touret N. Furuya W. Forbes J. Gros P. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25548-25557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. Briefly, to quantify the amount of surface NHE3, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% donkey serum for 30 min, and incubated with anti-HA epitope antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, they were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. A similar protocol was used, in parallel, to quantify total NHE3, except that the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 after fixation. After washing the excess secondary antibodies, the cells were incubated with 1 ml of o-phenylenediamine reagent for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 250 μl of 3 m HCl. The supernatant was collected, and absorbance was measured at 492 nm (A492) using a U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). In the range studied, A492 varied linearly with the amount of peroxidase bound. Background A492 was determined in parallel for every experiment by omission of the primary antibodies and was subtracted from each experimental determination. Other Methods—Immunostaining of surface and total cellular NHE3 was performed essentially as described in Ref. 23Hayashi H. Szaszi K. Coady-Osberg N. Furuya W. Bretscher A.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. The cells were visualized using a spinning disk inverted fluorescence microscope (Quorum), and image acquisition, quantitation, and deconvolution were performed using Volocity™ V3.6 (Improvision) software. Extraction with Triton X-100 and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szaszi K. Ramjeesingh R. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29843-29849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the number of determinations specified. Hypoosmolarity Activates NHE3—A line of MDCK-II cells stably expressing an external HA-tagged form of NHE3, characterized previously in Ref. 21Alexander R.T. Furuya W. Szaszi K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12253-12258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and hereafter referred to as MDCK-NHE3′38HA3, was used to study the osmotic regulation of NHE3. The activity of NHE3 in media of varying osmolarity was assessed from measurements of pHi. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the addition of Na+ to cells that had undergone acid loading by an NH4Cl prepulse induced a recovery toward the steady state pHi (≈7.3), which was complete within 400 s under isotonic conditions. Because MDCK cells express NHE1 on their basolateral membrane, these and all subsequent measurements using MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells were performed in the presence of 5 μm EIPA, unless indicated otherwise. EIPA is an isoform-specific inhibitor that, at the concentration used in the Na+-containing medium, virtually eliminates NHE1 (and NHE2) activity, without appreciably affecting NHE3 (4Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of hypoosmolarity on NHE3 activity was assessed next. Care was taken to impose a comparable acidification and to maintain the concentration of Na+ constant (70 mm), to make osmolarity the sole variable. Reducing the osmolarity to 200 mosM markedly increased the rate of pHi recovery (Fig. 1B). When assessed over the initial 30 s, the rate of Na+-induced alkalinization was 3-fold greater in hypoosmolar medium, compared with isoosmotic controls (Fig. 1C). Two lines of evidence suggest that the stimulation of transport was attributable to NHE3 and not to incompletely inhibited NHE1. First, we tested the effect of osmolarity on endogenous NHE activity in the parental wild-type MDCK line in the absence of EIPA. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), hypoosmolar treatment reduced the rate of pHi recovery, which is largely mediated by NHE1 in this case. This was validated by the addition of 5 μm EIPA, which practically eliminated the Na+-induced alkalinization in these cells (not shown). Second, we also tested the effect of reduced osmolarity in opossum kidney cells, a line known to express NHE3 but not NHE1 (26Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. Cano A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C126-C133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hypoosmolarity also stimulated native NHE3 activity in opossum kidney cells (not illustrated). The rate of proton (equivalent) extrusion is a function of both the change of pHi and the buffering power. It was conceivable that, rather than altering the activity of NHE3, hypoosmolarity reduced the buffering power of the cells, accelerating the pHi recovery at constant activity of the exchangers. This possibility was discounted by direct measurements of the cellular buffering power under conditions of varying osmolarity. In three determinations, the buffering power of MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells averaged 10.6 ± 1.6 and 10.2 ± 3.0 mm/pH unit, respectively, under iso- and hypoosmolar conditions. A Two-state Model Cannot Account for the Activation of NHE3— Perusal of Fig. 1B provides some clues of the mechanism underlying the osmotic activation of NHE3; the course of pH recovery from an acid load is distinctly sigmoidal under isoosmotic conditions, whereas it is hyperbolic following hypoosmolar exposure. The most noticeable effect of hypoosmolar swelling is to obviate the activation lag observed in normal cells. These observations appear to be at odds with the conventional assumption that NHE3 exists in two predominant states; at physiological pH, the exchangers are thought to be in an inactive (or poorly active) unprotonated form, NHE3(I); acidification of the cytosol leads to protonation of the putative “modifier site(s)”, converting the exchangers to an active form, NHE3(A) (Fig. 2A), that can effectively exchange Na+ for H+ (Fig. 2B). To assess the validity of these assumptions, we used a mathematical model to predict the activity of NHE3 as a function of time and pH. For a simple two-state model the rate of change of pHi following an acid load, ΔpH/Δt, is proportional to the fraction of the exchangers in the active configuration and to the concentration of the substrate ions (Fig. 2B, equation 2). The concentration of NHE3(A) is itself dependent on pHi, and the rate at which it accumulates when pHi is altered is dictated by the rate constant of the reversible NHE3(I) to NHE3(A) conversion reaction (Fig. 2B, equation 7). Using these principles, as explained in more detail in the supplemental material, we modeled the time course of pHi recovery caused by Na+/H+ exchange following a rapid acidification, such as that accomplished by ammonium removal following a prepulse. These calculations assume that protonoation/deprotonation reactions of exposed side chains of membrane proteins are extremely fast (in the submicrosecond range (28Prod'hom B. Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1987; 329: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)). As is evident from Fig. 2C, the model predicts an initial rate of pH recovery that is proportional to the degree of acidification. Moreover, the slope of the calculated curves is greatest immediately upon acidification. The suitability of the model was tested by comparing these predictions to the experimental results obtained in MDCK cells, under conditions where either NHE1 or NHE3 were the predominant functioning antiporters. As before, the activity of NHE1 was measured in untransfected wild-type cells, whereas NHE3 was assessed in MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells in the presence of EIPA. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the predictions made by the model fit well the behavior of NHE1 in MDCK cells, which resembles that reported for this isoform in a variety of other cell types (16Nath S.K. Hang C.Y. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Montrose M.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G431-G441PubMed Google Scholar, 29Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of transport (estimated over 30 s) is highest immediately after acidification (Fig. 2D) and increases with the magnitude of the acid load (Fig. 2, D and F). In contrast, because of the activation lag described above, the activity of NHE3 is not greatly affected by pHi immediately after acidification (Fig. 2, E and F). Instead, the rate of transport increases gradually, attaining a maximum ≈30–60 s after the pHi is changed. Thus, although the two-state model is well suited to explain the behavior of NHE1, it does not predict the sigmoidal response observed for NHE3. Kinetic Modeling of NHE3 Activation Is Consistent with a Three-state Model—Our modeling data demonstrate that a two-state model is insufficient to describe the behavior of NHE3 and suggests therefore that additional states of this isoform exist. Specifically, the existence of an activation lag following acid loading implies that protonation of the allosteric site is not the step limiting the activation sequence and that one or more slower, pH-independent transition(s) exist. We therefore tested more complex models to overcome the limitations of the two-state paradigm. The next level of complexity is illustrated in Fig. 3A. This three-state model postulates the existence of two distinct inactive states, NHE3(I1) and NHE3(I2), plus one active state, NHE3(A). The transition between inactive states is considered to be rapid and pH-dependent, and the conversion from NHE3(I2) to NHE(A) the active conformation is slow and rate-limiting. We proceeded to test the newly proposed model in a similar fashion, by generating recovery curves and comparing them with actual results obtained from experiments in acid-loaded cells. Fig. 3B shows the predicted pHi recovery curves following varying degrees of acid loading, generated using the three-state model. By introducing a slow transition reaction between NHE3(I2) and NHE3(A), the course of alkalinization in this case is calculated to be sigmoidal, more closely resembling the behavior of NHE3. Moreover, because the slow transition between NHE3(I2) and NHE3(A) was assumed to be pH-insensitive, the initial rate of transport is largely independent of the magnitude of the acid load, as found for NHE3, but not for NHE1(Fig. 2). We conclude that, when studied under isoosmotic conditions, the characteristic kinetics of activation of NHE3 are best explained by a model consisting of at least three distinct activation states. Hypoosmolar Activation Accelerates the Rate-limiting Transition between Inactive States—Having developed a model that predicts the behavior of NHE3 under isoosmolar conditions, we proceeded to investigate the means by which hypoosmolarity activates this isoform. As noted above, hypoosmolar challenge appeared to abrogate the lag time normally observed when cells are acid-loaded under isoosmolar conditions (Fig. 1). Because this lag is attributed in the model to the slow conversion between NHE3(I2) and NHE3(A), the effect of reduced osmolarity must be due to an acceleration of this transition. Two predictions can be made on the basis of this interpretation; first, if the conversion is accelerated sufficiently, the initial rate of recovery from an acid load in hypoosmolar medium would become pHi-dependent, and second, if measured at longer times after acid loading, the activity of NHE3 would be minimally affected by changes in osmolarity. These predictions were tested in the experiments shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4A, the activity of NHE3 was measured immediately after imposition of acid loads of varying magnitude under iso- or hypoosmolar conditions. Clearly, hypoosmolarity unmasks a pHi dependence of the initial rate of recovery, which is not apparent in isoosmotic controls. This differential behavior, however, is abrogated when a sustained intracellular acidification is imposed (accomplished by removal of ammonium using aNa+-free solution) before the activity of the exchanger is initiated by the addition of extracellular Na+. The time dependence of the response is illustrated in Fig. 4 (B and C). When measured at an identical pHi within the first 2 min of acidification, the activity of NHE3 is greater in hypoosmolar medium than in isoosmolar medium (Fig. 4B). However, when the cells were maintained at an acidic pHi for a longer period of time (i.e. 4 min), the rate of pHi recovery was rapid and not significantly different in both iso- and hypoosmolar media. Note that the sigmoidicity normally observed in isotonic medium was absent in this case, ostensibly because the prolonged acidification allowed the gradual conversion of most of NHE3(I2) to NHE3(A). The time-dependent alteration in the shape of the recovery can be replicated by theoretical curves applying the three-state but not the two-state model (Fig. 2B versus Fig. 3B), validating the use of the more complex paradigm. Importantly, application of the three-state model suggests that hypoosmolar treatment activates NHE3 by accelerating the transition between NHE3(I2) and NHE3(A). This implies that, although the conversion between NHE3(I2) and NHE3(A) is pH-independent, it is sensitive to the osmolarity of the bathing solution or to a consequence thereof, such as changes in cell size or molecular crowding of the cytosol. Investigation of the Molecular Basis of NHE3 Activation—We next investigated the molecular basis of the volume-induced stimulation of NHE3. This isoform is present not only at the plasma membrane but also in intracellular storage sites, and redistribution between compartments has been suggested as a mechanism to modulate the transport rate (30Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Lee E.M. Pollock C.A. Drumm K. Barden J.A. Poronnik P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F748-F757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether reducing the osmolarity altered the surface expression of NHE3. We took advantage of the exofacial location of the HA epitope introduced into NHE3′38HA3 to determine the distribution of exchangers by immunofluorescence microscopy (21Alexander R.T. Furuya W.

Comparison of intact and permeabilized MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells yielded information of the fraction of NHE3 that was surface-exposed following incubation in hypoosmolar or isoosmolar medium. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, there was no striking difference visually in the distribution of NHE3′38HA3 in the two media. A more precise quantitation was made using a colorimetric immunoperoxidase assay. In three similar experiments we found the number of surface-exposed NHE3 to be invariant between isoosmolar and hypoosmolar conditions (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation is another means of regulating the activity of NHE isoforms. In the case of NHE3, phosphorylation of Ser552 by protein kinase A is associated with an alteration of exchange activity (32Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R.L. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We used a phospho-specific antibody to assess whether medium osmolarity influences the state of NHE3 phosphorylation. MDCK-NHE3′38HA3 cells exposed to iso- or hypoosmolar medium were solubilized, and the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies developed earlier that recognize the phosphorylated form of Ser552 (18Koc"

Activation of S6K1 involves the phosphorylation of its multiple Ser/Thr residues, including the proline-directed sites (Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424) in the autoinhibitory domain near the C terminus. Phosphorylation at Thr-389 is also a crucial event in S6K1 activation. Here, we report that S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411 is required for the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of Thr-389 and the subsequent activation of S6K1. Mutation of Ser-411 to Ala ablated insulin-induced Thr-389 phosphorylation and S6K1 activation, whereas mutation mimicking Ser-411 phosphorylation did not show any effect. Furthermore, phosphomimetic mutation of Thr-389 overcame the inhibitory effect of the mutation S411A. Thus, Ser-411 phosphorylation regulates S6K1 activation via the control of Thr-389 phosphorylation. In nervous system neurons, Cdk5-p35 kinase associates with S6K1 via the direct interaction between p35 and S6K1 and catalyzes S6K1 phosphorylation specifically at Ser-411. Inhibition of the Cdk5 activity or suppression of Cdk5 expression blocked S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411 and Thr-389, resulting in S6K1 inactivation. Similar results were obtained by treating asynchronous populations of proliferating cells with the CDK inhibitor compound roscovitine. Altogether, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the CDK-mediated phosphorylation regulates the activation of S6K1.

Similar results were obtained by treating asynchronous populations of proliferating cells with the CDK inhibitor compound roscovitine. Altogether, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the CDK-mediated phosphorylation regulates the activation of S6K1. The 40 S ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) 2The abbreviations used are: S6K, S6 kinase; rpS6, ribosomal protein S6; TOS, TOR signaling; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: S6K, S6 kinase; rpS6, ribosomal protein S6; TOS, TOR signaling; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA. p70 (α2 isoform) and the alternative translation variant p85 (α1 isoform), collectively termed S6K1, play an important role in the control of cell growth. p70 S6K1 is identical to p85 S6K1 in the protein sequence except that it lacks the N-terminal 23 amino acids, which contains a nuclear localization signal. Thus, p85 S6K1 localizes in the nucleus, while p70 S6K1 appears predominantly in the cytoplasm (1Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G.

Recently, S6K2 was identified with a high homology to S6K1, and partially compensated for the loss of the S6K1 function (3Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V.

It was proposed that S6K1 and S6K2 catalyze ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) phosphorylation to initiate the selective translation of mRNAs containing a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine-rich tract and also primarily encoding ribosomal proteins and translational elongation factors of the protein translation apparatus (6Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, this model has been questioned in recent studies (7Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell.

Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). S6K1 has a highly acidic N terminus, followed by the Ser/Thr kinase catalytic domain and a regulatory C-terminal tail. Activation of S6K1 is controlled through a complex mechanism that involves the phosphorylation of at least eight Ser/Thr residues, including Thr-229, Ser-371, Thr-389, Ser-404, Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424, which are located at the catalytic domain and the C terminus (9Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 10Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Current understanding is that multiple phosphorylating events occur in a stepwise manner starting from the Ser/Thr-Pro sites (Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424) located within the autoinhibitory domain adjacent to the C terminus. This step facilitates Thr-389 phosphorylation in the linker region, relieving the autoinhibition and also releasing the kinase from the translation preinitiation complex (11Dennis P.B. Pullen N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Thr-389-phosphorylated S6K1 binds to and is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) at Thr-229 in the catalytic activation loop for activation (14Alessi D.R.

Thr-389 phosphorylation, which is rapamycin-sensitive and is mediated by mTOR/raptor, appears to be a critical and rate-limiting step in the activation (16Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A.

Interestingly, two conserved segments of S6K1, the N-terminal TOR signaling (TOS) motif and the C-terminal RSPRR sequence, participate in regulating Thr-389 phosphorylation (20Schalm S.S. Blenis J.

The TOS motif is required for the phosphorylation and is shown to mediate the binding of S6K1 to the mTOR partner raptor, while the RSPRR sequence suppresses the phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism (17Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol.

Ser-411 within the RSPRR sequence is one of the Ser/Thr-Pro sites situated in the autoinhibitory domain of S6K1. Protein kinases that have been implicated in Ser-411 phosphorylation include ERKs, p38 MAPK, and Cdk1-cyclin B (16Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol.

In this study, we show that Cdk5, in association with p35, phosphorylates S6K1 at Ser-411 in nervous system neurons. Also, Ser-411 phosphorylation is mediated by roscovitine-sensitive CDKs in asynchronous populations of proliferating cells. Although Cdk5 is widely expressed, it displays the kinase activity primarily in neurons of the central nervous system in conjunction with the neuron-specific protein p35 or p39 (24Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). By virtue of phosphorylating diverse substrates with the consensus sequence of Ser/Thr immediately upstream of a proline and a basic residue at the +3 position (S/T-P-X-R/K, X is preferably a basic or neutral residue), Cdk5-p35 plays an important role in the nervous system to mediate various functions including neuronal differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, cell signaling, synaptic plasticity, and cell survival (24Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 25Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Neurotoxins induce the cleavage of p35 by calpain into an N-terminally trun-cated p25 form, which exhibits many cellular characteristics different from those of p35 (26Kusakawa G. Saito T. Onuki R.

Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Moreover, the aberrant regulation of Cdk5 by p25 causes neuronal death and is implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation from several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (24Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 28Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la M.S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). To date, the role of Ser-411 phosphorylation in the regulation of S6K1 activity remains elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that Ser-411 phosphorylation is required for Thr-389 phosphorylation and S6K1 activation. Furthermore, Ser-411 phosphorylation is mediated by the Cdk5-p35 kinase in nervous system neurons and is sensitive to CDK inhibition by roscovitine in proliferating cells. Therefore, Ser-411 phosphorylation, which is mediated by CDKs, is crucial for S6K1-controlled protein synthesis. Plasmid Constructs—Various S6K1 constructs used in the present report were derived from the rat p70 S6K1 sequence. The constructs HA-S6K1/pRK7 and S6K1(S424A) were obtained from Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School) (29Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). S6K1 mutations, S411A, S411D, S411A/S424A, T389E, and T389E/S411A, were created by site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs of Cdk5 and p35 were described previously (30Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol.

Antibodies—Anti-S6K1 (C-18), anti-S6K1(phospho-Ser-411), anti-Cdk5 (C-8), anti-p35 (C-19), anti-HA (F-7 and Y-11), and anti-His6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-S6K1(phospho-Thr-389), anti-S6K1(phospho-Thr-421/Ser-424), anti-rpS6, and anti-rpS6(phospho-Ser-235/236) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-GST, anti-α-tubulin, and anti-FLAG (M2) were from Sigma. Protein Binding Assay—Recombinant proteins tagged with GST or His6 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and were purified as described in earlier reports (30Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol.

To test the binding of S6K1 to p35 fragments, 1 μg of GST-p35 fragments or GST was incubated with 0.5 μg of His6-S6K1 for 1 h at 4 °Cin 500 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The GST proteins were then retrieved using GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), released from the beads by boiling in the SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. S6K1 Protein Phosphorylation and Kinase Assay—The active Cdk5 kinase was reconstituted from GST-Cdk5 and His6-p35 (32Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of His6-S6K1 and its mutants were carried out with the Cdk5 kinase at 30 °C for 30 min in a kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼5000 dpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated by boiling the samples for 5 min in the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Protein phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. To determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation, the reactions were conducted as described above for 60 min. The band corresponding to each S6K1 protein was excised from the polyacrylamide gel for radioactivity determination by scintillation counting. The measured values were subtracted by blanks, which were obtained from measuring the radioactivity of the gel band corresponding to each S6K1 protein phosphorylated in the absence of the Cdk5 kinase. The amount of each S6K1 protein was determined by Coomassie Blue staining and densitometry using bovine serum albumin as standard. The resulting values were used to calculate stoichiometries of phosphorylation. To determine the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated S6K1, the immunoprecipitates were washed with the kinase buffer and were suspended in the buffer supplemented with 50 μm of the S6 kinase substrate peptide (RRRLSSLRA, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The reactions started with the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼500 dpm/pmol) and continued at 30 °C for 20 min. Following the addition of 10% acetic acid to stop the reactions, the assay mixtures were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper squares (Whatman). Phosphate incorporated into the peptide was quantified by scintillation counting. For each experiment, blanks were taken from the reactions performed in the absence of the peptide. These blanks were subtracted from the above values. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T, COS-7, and neuroblastoma Neuro 2A were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of HEK293T and COS-7 was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). Prior to insulin stimulation, HEK293T cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 h and were treated with rapamycin (20 ng/ml) or the solvent for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min. For CDK inhibition, roscovitine was used at 50 μm to treat COS-7 cells for 2 h. Cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from cortices of mouse embryos (embryonic day 16) or rat embryos (embryonic day 18) as reported (31Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 5 days in vitro, neurons were treated with 1 μm of the Cdk5 inhibitor GW8510 (4-([(7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-8H-(1, 3)thiazolo[5,4-e]indol-8-ylidene)methyl] amino)-N-(2-pyridinyl)benzenesulfonamide, Sigma) for various time periods. Two siRNAs were designed to target rat cdk5. The sequence 5′-CCAATGTACCCAGCTACAA-3′ was synthesized in sense and antisense directions with dTdT overhang at the 3′ terminus to generate a double-stranded siRNA (siRNA-1). A scrambled sequence was used as a control siRNA. A pSuper hairpin siRNA construct of cdk5 containing the sequence of 5′-TGCCACGGGGAGAGACCTG-3′ (siRNA-2) was obtained from Dr. Nancy Y. Ip (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). Transfection of neurons was performed at the time of cell preparation using the Nucleofector™ apparatus (Amaxa). 2 μg of plasmids or 2.5 μg of siRNA duplexes was nucleofected according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitation—Lysates were prepared by extracting cells with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40), and extracts were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g; 20 min). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). Proteins expressed with an HA-tag were immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA antibody (Y-11) and protein A/G beads (Invitrogen). To coimmunoprecipitate endogenous p35 and S6K1, differentiation of Neuro 2A was induced with 10 μm retinoic acid in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% fetal calf serum for 48 h. The Neuro 2A cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were treated with the thiol-cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Following the treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were then lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with the Roche mixture protease inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation before anti-p35 immunoprecipitation was performed. Immunoprecipitates were washed in the lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mm NaCl and were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Cdk5-p35 Associates with S6K1—In the brain, Cdk5-p35 appears in various multiprotein complexes, whereas the deregulated form Cdk5-p25 is found mainly as a heterodimeric complex (25Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We carried out biochemical isolation of p35-binding proteins from rat brain (30Lim A.C. Hou Z. Goh C.P. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46668-46673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). During the isolation, S6K1 was identified by using mass spectrometry (data not shown). To investigate the association of S6K1 with Cdk5-p35, HEK293T cells were double-transfected with S6K1 and p35 or p25 (amino acids 99–307) for immunoprecipitation. As seen in Fig. 1A, S6K1 specifically coimmunoprecipitated with p35 but not with p25, revealing the association of S6K1 with p35 and the requirement of the N terminus of p35 for the association. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed S6K1 further confirmed the p35 association (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Cdk5 coimmunoprecipitated with S6K1 only in the presence of p35 (Fig. 1B). Finally, endogenous p35 and S6K1 were coimmunoprecipitated from differentiated Neuro 2A cells (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these results indicate that S6K1 forms a ternary complex with Cdk5 and p35 via associating with p35. To demonstrate the direct binding of S6K1 to the N terminus of p35, we performed pull-down assays using recombinant proteins of S6K1 and two p35 fragments, p10 (amino acids 1–98) and p25, which were purified from bacterial expressions. In the assays, the binding of GST-p10 to S6K1 was readily detected, whereas GST and GST-p25 did not exhibit any pulldown activity with S6K1 (Fig. 1D). This established the direct interaction between S6K1 and the N terminus of p35. Cdk5-p35 Phosphorylates S6K1 at Ser-411—From scanning of the S6K1 sequence, we found that Ser-411 and Ser-424 conform to the consensus motif of Cdk5 phosphorylation. When subjected to protein phosphorylation, the recombinant protein of S6K1 was readily phosphorylated by Cdk5-p35 and about 1.1 mol/mol of phosphate was incorporated into S6K1 in the reaction for 1 h (Fig. 2, A and B). To examine whether Ser-411 and Ser-424 were targeted by Cdk5-p35 in the reactions, S6K1 mutants were generated to substitute either or both of these residues by Ala. The mutation of either Ser-411 or Ser-424 reduced S6K1 phosphorylation, while the double mutation almost completely abolished the [32P]phosphate incorporation into the protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, Cdk5-p35 phosphorylated S6K1 primarily at Ser-411 and Ser-424 in the reactions. Also, Cdk5-p35 displayed a remarkably lower kinase activity toward the protein S6K1(S411A) than the mutant S6K1(S424A) (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Ser-411 is a preferred site over Ser-424 for Cdk5-p35 action. Cdk5 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that depends on the neuron-specific protein p35 or p39 for kinase activity (24Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To demonstrate S6K1 phosphorylation by active Cdk5 in cells, HEK293T cells transiently expressing p35 or the empty vector were serum-starved and were then subjected to S6K1 phosphorylation assessment at various sites. Expression of p35 induced Ser-411 phosphorylation of S6K1, whereas phosphorylation of Thr-421/Ser-424 and Thr-389 was unaffected in the starved cells (Fig. 2B). These results reveal specific Ser-411 phosphorylation induced by Cdk5-p35. S6K1 Activation Requires Ser-411 Phosphorylation—Ser-411 is situated in the conserved RSPRR sequence, which confers an inhibitory effect on mTOR-mediated S6K1 activation (21Schalm S.S. Tee A.R. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11101-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To investigate the impact of Ser-411 phosphorylation on S6K1 activity, Ser-411 was mutated to Ala or Asp to generate a non-phosphorylatable mutant S6K1(S411A) or a phosphomimetic mutant S6K1(S411D), respectively. Upon insulin stimulation, S6K1(S411D) was phosphorylated at Thr-389 and was activated to similar extents as the wild type (Fig. 3, A and B). Thr-389 phosphorylation and activation of the kinase were sensitive to rapamycin (Fig. 3, A and B). However, insulin-induced Thr-389 phosphorylation was almost completely blocked in the mutant S411A (Fig. 3A). S6K1(S411A) also exhibited much lower basal and insulin-stimulated kinase activities than the wild type and S6K1(S411D) (Fig. 3B). We also examined the phosphorylation of the S6K1 mutants in primary cortical neurons. Similarly, the S411A mutation inhibited Thr-389 phosphorylation, whereas the mutation S411D did not show any significant effect (Fig. 3C). These results reveal that Ser-411 phosphorylation is required for Thr-389 phosphorylation and the full activation of the kinase. It was also noted that neither of these mutations affected the Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation, which remained unchanged upon insulin stimulation (Fig. 3, A and C). In short, Ser-411 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for mTOR-mediated Thr-389 phosphorylation, which leads to S6K1 activation. It is noteworthy that the phosphomimetic mutation S411D did not enhance basal Thr-389 phosphorylation and S6K1 activity (Fig. 3), indicating that Ser-411 phosphorylation is insufficient for S6K1 activation. To further explore the role of Ser-411 phosphorylation in S6K1 activation, we substituted Ala for Ser-411 in the context of T389E. As shown previously, the substitution of Glu for Thr-389 to mimic the phosphorylation conferred a high basal activity on S6K1 in serum-starved cells (Fig. 4; Ref. 13Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W.

The T389E mutation significantly enhanced the basal and insulin-stimulated activities of S6K1(S411A), and the activities of S6K1(T389E/S411A) were similar to those of S6K1(T389E) (Fig. 4). Therefore, phosphomimetic mutation of Thr-389 renders the kinase resistant to the inhibitory effect of the S411A mutation. CDK Activities Are Required for Ser-411 Phosphorylation and S6K1 Activation—We explored whether CDKs are involved in Ser-411 phosphorylation in proliferating cells by using roscovitine to selectively inhibit CDK activities. The use of roscovitine on asynchronous cells almost completely eliminated Ser-411 phosphorylation, whereas Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation was not changed (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Ser-411 is specifically targeted by roscovitine-sensitive CDKs. Also, the treatment strongly suppressed Thr-389 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with the idea that Ser-411 phosphorylation is required prior to Thr-389 phosphorylation. Consequently, the kinase activity of S6K1 was inhibited and the phosphorylation of the S6K1 substrate rpS6 dramatically decreased (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, the CDK inhibition blocked Ser-411 and Thr-389 phosphorylation and abolished S6K1 activation. Given the observation that Cdk5-p35 binds to S6K1 and catalyzes Ser-411 phosphorylation, we examined the effect of Cdk5 inhibition and depletion on S6K1 phosphorylation in primary neuronal cultures. GW8510 is a recently developed indolone derivative that specifically inhibits Cdk5 with low cytotoxicity toward cultured neurons (33Johnson K. Liu L. Majdzadeh N. Chavez C. Chin P.C. Morrison B. Wang L. Park J. Chugh P. Chen H.M. D'Mello S.R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The GW8510 treatment of cortical neurons led to a dramatic decrease of Ser-411 and Thr-389 phosphorylation, while Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation remained unchanged (Fig. 6A), indicating the requirement of Cdk5 activity for Ser-411 and Thr-389 phosphorylation in vivo. Next, we reduced levels of the Cdk5 protein by RNA interference. Two non-overlapping siRNA sequences of cdk5 were employed to ensure the specificity of the siRNA effects. The introduction of either cdk5 siRNAs effectively and specifically reduced Cdk5 protein levels, while levels of S6K1 and rpS6 were unaffected (Fig. 6B). Depletion of Cdk5 strongly inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411 and Thr-389, whereas Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation remained unaffected (Fig. 6B). These data are in complete agreement with those from Cdk5 inhibition by GW8510. As a result of the inhibition of Thr-389 phosphorylation, S6K1 was inactivated, as shown by the dramatically reduced phosphorylation of rpS6 (Fig. 6B). Therefore, the kinase activity of Cdk5 is required in nervous system neurons for the phosphorylation and activation of S6K1. By controlling protein translation, mTOR and its effector S6K1 mediate cell growth in response to stimulating signals and modulate neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory (34Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the neuronal kinase Cdk5-p35 physically associates with S6K1 and catalyzes S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411. Similarly, in asynchronous populations of proliferating cells, Ser-411 phosphorylation is sensitive to roscovitine, which selectively inhibits Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk5, Cdk7, and Cdk9 (35Bach S. Knockaert M. Reinhardt J. Lozach O. Schmitt S. Baratte B. Koken M. Coburn S.P. Tang L. Jiang T. Liang D.C. Galons H. Dierick J.F. Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Totzke F. Schachtele C. Lerman A.S. Carnero A. Wan Y. Gray N. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31208-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Prior to this study, the biological role of Ser-411 phosphorylation is obscure, but now we have shown that Ser-411 is a critical phosphorylation site for regulating S6K1 catalytic activity through the control of Thr-389 phosphorylation. Indeed, elimination of Ser-411 phosporylation by either a mutational approach or the suppression of the CDK activities abrogates S6K1 activation. Among the Ser/Thr-Pro sites at the C terminus of S6K1, only the RSPRR sequence encompassing Ser-411 is conserved in S6K2 and across several biological species. Moreover, the RSPRR sequence imparts inhibition to S6K1 by suppressing Thr-389 and Thr-229 phosphorylation (21Schalm S.S. Tee A.R. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11101-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results in this study suggest that Ser-411 phosphorylation is crucial for relieving the negative modulation. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr-Pro cluster including Ser-411 in the autoinhibitory domain disrupts the interaction between the N and C termini of S6K1, rendering the kinase to adopt a partially open conformation (11Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ser-411 phosphorylation is required for the unmasking of the Thr-389 site for action of the Thr-389 kinase (e.g. mTOR/raptor). In addition, nonphosphorylatable mutation of Ser-411 did not affect the kinase activity of the Thr-389 phosphomimetic mutant. Therefore, Ser-411 phosphorylation mediates S6K1 activation via the control of Thr-389 phosphorylation but does not directly participate in the kinase activation. S6K1 contains the conserved TOS motif at the N terminus, which suppresses the inhibitory activity associated with the RSPRR segment (20Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 21Schalm S.S. Tee A.R. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11101-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The F5A mutation within the TOS motif inhibits the phosphorylation of Thr-389 and Thr-229 and hence S6K1 activation (20Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Phosphomimetic mutation of the four phosphorylation sites (Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424) at the C terminus along with the T389E mutation partially rescues the activity of the mutant S6K1(F5A), while the S6K1(F5A/T389E) variants lacking the RSPRR sequence either by C-terminal truncations or by multiple Ala substitutions within RSPRR exhibit the full activity of S6K1 (20Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 21Schalm S.S. Tee A.R. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11101-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that the inhibition conferred by the RSPRR segment cannot be completely overcome by the C-terminal phosphorylation. Therefore, the RSPRR-conferred inhibition may involve multiple mechanisms, some of which cannot be relieved by the C-terminal phosphorylation including the phosphorylation of Ser-411. We show that CDKs are the primary regulators of S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411. Ser-411 phosphorylation is insensitive to rapamycin and remains unaffected by the TOS mutation F5A (Fig. 3A; Refs. 20Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar and 36Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16091-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibits Thr-389 phosphorylation and S6K1 activation. Therefore, Ser-411 phosphorylation is independent from the TOR signaling, which is consistent with the notion that S6K1 activation requires inputs from multiple signaling pathways. S6K1 plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression through G1 into S phase. S6K1 inhibition by using rapamycin or by microinjecting S6K1-neutralizing antibodies blocks cell entry into S phase (37Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G.

Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Our findings in the present report support a direct role of CDKs in initiating protein translation, which is crucial for G1 progression. It has been reported that Cdk1 catalyzes the mitotic phosphorylation of S6K1 at multiple Ser/Thr-Pro sites including Ser-411 (22Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L. Terada N. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is correlated with reduced Thr-389 phosphorylation and S6K1 inactivation. It appears that S6K1 adopts a mitotic regulatory mechanism that is distinct from the regulation in G1 phase. At present, it is unclear how Cdk1 mediates S6K1 inactivation at mitosis. In nervous system neurons, the mTOR-S6K1 pathway controls the synaptic synthesis of proteins that are required for long term synaptic plasticity (34Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Cdk5 has been implicated to regulate synaptic plasticity by a number of mechanisms, including the regulation of vesicle cycling, ion channel conductance, protein clustering, and signal transduction (24Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 40Angelo M. Plattner F. Giese K.P. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We show that the Cdk5 activity is required for S6K1 activation and thus the rpS6 phosphorylation. This process induces translation initiation of 5′-oligopyrimidine tract-containing mRNAs, which encode components of the protein translation apparatus. Therefore, our findings suggest that Cdk5 may participate in the control of protein synthesis, which plays an important role in response to synaptic demands. In summary, we have revealed the function of S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411 in the control of S6K1 activation. Phosphorylation of Ser-411 is mediated by the multifunctional kinase Cdk5-p35 in post-mitotic neurons and by roscovitine-sensitive CDKs in proliferating cells. These findings suggest a link between the CDKs and protein translational control. We thank Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School) for providing S6K1 constructs and for productive discussions and critical review of the manuscript. We are also grateful to Dr. N. Y.

The genome of the photosynthetic and plant-symbiotic Bradyrhizobium sp. strain ORS278 revealed the presence of a genomic island acquired by lateral transfer harboring a bacteriophytochrome gene, BrBphP3.ORS278, and genes involved in the synthesis of phycocyanobilin and gas vesicles. The corresponding protein BrBphP3.ORS278 is phylogenetically distant from the other (bacterio)phytochromes described thus far and displays a series of unusual properties. It binds phycocyanobilin as a chromophore, a unique feature for a bacteriophytochrome. Moreover, its C-terminal region is short and displays no homology with any known functional domain. Its dark-adapted state absorbs maximally around 610 nm, an unusually short wavelength for (bacterio)phytochromes. This form is designated as Po for orange-absorbing form. Upon illumination, a photo-reversible switch occurs between the Po form and a red (670 nm)-absorbing form (Pr), which rapidly backreacts in the dark. Because of this instability, illumination results in a mixture of the Po and Pr states in proportions that depend on the intensity. These uncommon features suggest that BrBphP3.ORS278 could be fitted to measure light intensity rather than color."

Whereas the distal promoter, P1, located upstream of the very short exon 1 (sometimes designated also exon 1a) is active in epithelial cells, the proximal promoter P2 that initiates gene transcription from exon 2 (alternatively known as exon 1b), is utilized by the hematopoietic cells.

This new insight into the structure and regulation of the P2 promoter expression may contribute to a better understanding of the role played by PU.1 and SHP-1 in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. Cells—Immature T-cell, acute leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma-derived Jurkat, mature T-cell, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-expressing SUP-M2 and Karpas 299, mature B-cell, Burkitt’s lymphoma-derived BJAB and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-derived LY18 and VAL, and the breast carcinoma-derived MDA-453 cell lines were cultured in the RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro/Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA). The cells were maintained in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. At the time of transfection the cells were cultured in the serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). Reporter Constructs—Fragments of intron 1 and exon 2 were amplified by PCR using specific primers and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Bioscience). The forward primers recognized sites located -6266 bp, -5266 bp, -4266 bp, -3266 bp, -2266 bp, -1266 bp, -266 bp, and -66 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site, whereas the reverse primer was common and included the nucleotide 97 (+97) downstream form the site. Later, additional fragments starting at -1066 bp, -876 bp, -766 bp, -266 bp, and -166 bp were generated in the same manner. All forward primers contained KpnI restriction site in their 5′-end. The HindIII restriction site was included in the reverse primer. PCR products were first cloned into the pCR4.0 vector (Invitrogen), then subcloned with KpnI and HindIII into respective sites of pGL3Enh plasmid. The resulting constructs were named according to the nucleotide location of the 5′-end of the forward primer used in the PCR reaction. Site-directed Mutagesis—To analyze the functional role of the identified transcription factor binding site in the SHP-1 gene P2 promoter, the selected PU.1b site was mutated by QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the product manual. pGL3Enh -266 +97 construct was used as a template. Plasmids obtained by site directed mutagenesis were purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. Primers used for the mutagenesis reactions were as follows: 5′-GTG CTC TAA AAC ACA CTA CAA GTG AGT TCC CCC (forward) and 5′-GGG GGA ACT CAC TTG TAG TGT GTT TTA GAG CAC (reverse; with the mutated sequence being underlined). Reporter Assays—Jurkat cells were transiently co-transfected with fragments of SHP-1 gene P2 promoter cloned into pGL3Enh vector and pRL-TK vector (both vectors were from Promega, Madison, WI) using 10:1 molar ratios of these DNA, respectively. All transfections were performed in triplicates. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Activity of the firefly and Renilla luciferases was evaluated in 20 μl of the cell lysate using the reagents included in the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminiscence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). The results are presented as the activity ratio of firefly luciferase activity induced by the pGL3-SHP-1-promoter to the activity of the Renilla luciferase induced by the constitutively active pRL-TK vector. Nuclear Protein Extraction—Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Volume of the pelleted cells (pcv) was measured using the graduation on the tube. The cells were next, briefly washed in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with the volume of the buffer being equal to 5 pcv and centrifuged. The pellets were suspended in a 3-fold pcv volume of hypotonic buffer, incubated for 10 min on ice, transferred into a precooled Dounce homogenizer, and disrupted with a type B pestle. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 3300 × g), and their volume (pnv) was determined. Nuclei were then suspended in a 0.5 pnv of the low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 dithiothreitol). Next, 0.5 pnv of the high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 dithiothreitol) was added for a 30-min incubation with continuous, gentle mixing. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation (30 min, 25,000 × g). EMSA—The nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Twenty fmol of biotin-labeled probe was incubated with 6.0 μg of the nuclear extract for 20 min at room temperature. To confirm the specificity of binding, the extract-probe mixtures were either further admixed with a 200-fold excess of the unlabeled, consensus nucleotide or 2 μg of the PU.1-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The formed protein-DNA complexes were resolved from the free probe in the 7% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis, transferred onto positively charged Nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and UV-cross-linked (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The membrane was then subjected to a Lightshift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The nucleotides were custom synthesized by IDT Inc. (Coralville, IA). Probes used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were double-stranded biotin-labeled nucleotides. The sequences of the sense strands, 5′-biotinated, were as follows: 5′-GCT CTG CTT CTC TTC CCC (PU.1a/Ets2) and 5′-TAA AAC GAG AAG TAC AAG (PU.1b). The reverse complementary and unlabeled nucleotides were coupled to form double-stranded probes. Competitor unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides (PU.1a and PU.1b cold probes) were generated in the same manner. ChIP Assay—To cross-link DNA and DNA-binding proteins, 1 × 106 of the Jurkat and BJAB cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and then at 4 °C for 45 min. The fixed cells were lysed with the buffer containing protease inhibitors (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF). The lysate was sonicated on ice to shear the DNA to fragments of about 500 bp. The resulting DNA-protein preparation was incubated with the antibody against PU.1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with the control NPM/ALK antibody (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 12 h. The DNA-protein-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads, washed, and treated with RNase A and protease K. The DNA was recovered by purification using phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. Next, the DNA was PCR-amplified in 25 cycles (20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C). Products of the reaction were analyzed in 2% agarose gel stained with EtBr. Primers used in the reaction permitted amplification of either the -166 to -59 fragment of the P2 promoter (5′-GCCTTTGATTGCAGACGTG and 5′-ACTCACTTGTACTTCTCGT) or exon 16 (5′-CTGACCCTGTGGAAGCATTT and 5′-AGTGATCCCAGGGCTTTATTT) of the SHP-1 gene. siRNA-mediated RNA Depletion—Jurkat and BJAB cells were treated with siRNA directed against PU.1 or non-targeting control siRNA twice at 24 h intervals. Mixtures of four PU.1-specific siRNAs or non-targeting siRNAs (both mixtures were purchased from Dharmacon Inc, Chicago, IL) were transfected into cells using DMRIE-C liposomal reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing a 100 nm concentration of the respective siRNA mixture was mixed with 16 μl of DMI-RIE-C and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. One ml of the resulting RNA-lipid complexes was added to 1 ml of the cells seeded at 5 × 105/1 ml of the Opti-MEM medium. The cells were then incubated for 4–5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere, and the medium was changed to the complete RPMI medium. The procedure was repeated at 24 h, and the cells were harvested 72 h after the initial transfection. Efficiency of the PU.1 depletion was assessed by Western blotting, using expression of β-actin as an internal control. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Purified RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and the reverse transcription was carried out using Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) with random hexamers as the cDNA synthesis primers. PCR was performed with Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) over 25 (for β-actin) 30 (for SHP-1) or 40 (for SHP-1(I) and SHP-1(II)) cycles: 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C (β-actin SHP-1(I), SHP-1(II)) or 55 °C (SHP-1), and 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were visualized by EtBr staining in the 2% agarose gel. The primers used in PCR were: β-actin, 5′-ACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGT (forward) and 5′-GTCTTTGCGGATGTCCACGT (reverse), SHP-1, 5′-GTGACCCATATTCGGATCCAG (forward) and 5′-CTTGAAATGCTCCACCAGGTC (reverse); SHP-1(I), 5′-CACAGCTGTGCCGCTGGCTCA (forward) and 5′-GTGAGTCTGTCCATCGCGA (reverse); and SHP-1(II), 5′-CTGCCTGCCCAGACTAGCTG (forward) and 5′-GTGAGTCTGTCCATCGCGA (reverse). Western Blot—For assessment of the protein expression Jurkat and BJAB cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS) with 50 mm sodium fluoride and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and supplemented with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma-Aldrich). Solubilized protein extract was cleared by centrifugation. For normalization of the protein loading, the extracts were assayed by Lowry method (Dc protein assay, Bio-Rad). Typically, 20 μg of protein per lane were subjected to the SDS-PAGE in a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with the 5% nonfat milk solution in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the blots were probed with the primary and secondary (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) antibodies. The primary antibodies used were against PU.1, SHP-1, β-actin, and phopshotyrosine 4G10 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were washed in TBST buffer, and proteins of interest were detected by ECL Plus chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, intensity of the signal was measured using scanner HP ScanJet3500c and ImageJ 1.32j software developed at the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD. Identification of the P2 Promoter of the SHP-1 Gene—As shown in Fig. 1A, exons 1 and 2 of the SHP-1 gene are separated by an intron that contains almost 6300 bp, which is believed to contain the hematopoietic cell-specific promoter P2. We have confirmed the presence of the P2 promoter in the intron 1 by demonstrating that, in contrast to the epithelial MDA-453 cells, the immature Jurkat T lymphocytes and mature BJAB B lymphocytes express SHP-1 mRNA encoded in part by exon 2 but not exon 1 (Fig. 1B). To determine the exact localization and size of P2, we developed a gene expression reporter system comprised of the promoterless vector pGL3Enh containing fragments of the intron 1 cloned in upstream of the luciferase gene. The constructed twelve fragments varied in length from over 6300 bp that cover essentially the entire intron 1 to ∼160 bp (Fig. 2A). They all contained the transcription initiation site (+1) and the adjacent, 97-bp-long fragment of the coding DNA. The pGL3Enh vector that contained only the luciferase gene but no intronic DNA served as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2A, most of the progressively truncated intron 1 fragments analyzed displayed a very similar, strong transcriptional activity. The only exceptions that generated much weaker signals in a highly reproducible manner were the second longest (-5266 +97) and the shortest (-66 +97) fragments. Whereas the result with the longer fragment suggests the existence of a long range transcriptional repressor, the result with the shortest fragment, in particular when compared with the intact, full transcriptional activity of the second shortest fragment (-166 +97), indicated that the P2 promoter is rather small and located nearby the transcription initiation site. To determine the more exact size of the promoter, we prepared the second set of the intron 1 fragments starting at -141, -116, and -91. The additional fragments starting at -1066 and -166 served as positive controls, and the fragment starting at -66 and the intronless vector served again as negative controls. No fragment that was shorter than the one starting at -66 was prepared based on the premise that the region immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site contains the core promoter that binds the RNA polymerase complex (please see also below). As shown in Fig. 2B, transcriptional activity of the -141 +97 and -116 +97 regions was not significantly diminished when compared with the positive controls. In contrast, the activity of -91 +97 fragment was decreased but still much stronger than that of the -66 +97 core promoter indicating that important regulatory element(s) is (are) contained within the short -116 to -66 region.FIGURE 2Structural delineation of the SHP-1 gene P2 promoter. Progressively truncated fragments of intron 1 of the SHP-1 gene were inserted into the luciferase gene-containing pGL3Enh vector and examined for their ability to activate transcription of the reporter gene in the lymphoid Jurkat cells. As depicted in the figure, the fragments varied in length with the longest covering essentially the entire intron 1 (-6266 +97) and the shortest (-66 +97) containing the RNA polymerase binding complex region located immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site. The construct designated as “promoterless” represents the pGL3Enh vector containing only the luciferase gene but no promoter. The results reflect the calculated ratios of the luciferase activity as compared with activity of the co-transfected renilla gene-containing vector. The depicted data (mean value ± S.E.) are representative of three totally separate experiments performed in triplicates. A, rough characterization of the P2 promoter position using the large, gradually truncated DNA fragments of the intron 1. B, refined analysis of the P2 location and size using the smaller, progressively truncated fragments with the largest one stating at the position -166 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mapping of the Putative Transcription Activator Binding Sites within the SHP-1 Gene P2 Promoter—We next addressed the question of which transcription factor(s) may be involved in activation of the P2 promoter. To accomplish this aim, we performed an “in silico” structural analysis of the identified P2 promoter for potential transcription factor binding sites. Using the transcription element search software, we identified within the key -116 to -66 region three sequences specific for two members of the Ets transcription factor family with two sites potentially binding PU.1 (13O'Prey J. Ramsay S. Chambers I. Harrison P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6290-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and one Ets-2 (14Wen S.C. Ku D.H. De Luca A. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Calabretta B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in contrast to the well established critical role of PU.1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis (15Rosmarin A.G. Yang Z. Resendes K.K. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 131-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Hagman J. Lukin K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the potential involvement of Ets-2 in the process is less well documented (17Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. J. Biol.

Blood. 1996; 88: 2917-2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the potential PU.1 binding sites, designated PU.1a and PU.1b, are located at positions -103 -98 and -75 -70, respectively. The hypothetical Ets-2 site is located at -97 -93, directly adjacent to the PU.1a site. The most proximal region of the P2 promoter contained the BRE-TFIIB and INR-TFIID binding sites consistent with its role as the core promoter responsible for docking the RNA polymerase complex involved in the initiation of gene transcription. Expression and Binding of PU.1 to the P2 Promoter—To confirm the expression of PU.1 by the Jurkat cells, we performed Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, these immature T-cell line expressed substantial amount of the PU.1 protein comparable with the one seen in the mature B-cell line BJAB and, to a lesser degree, two other mature B-cell lines examined. In contrast, two mature T-cell lines did not express the protein. To determine whether PU.1 binds to the identified PU.1a and PU.1b sites within the P2 promoter, nuclear protein extracts from the lymphoid Jurkat cells were evaluated in EMSA for binding the biotin-labeled probes corresponding to the sites (with the PU.1a probe containing also the putative Ets-2 binding site). Unlabeled PU.1a and PU.1b probes served as controls of the binding specificity. As can be seen in Fig. 3C (the left lanes in both panels), each of the labeled PU.1 probes generated single, distinct band. These unique bands were eliminated when the unlabeled “cold” PU.1 probe was added (the middle lanes). To confirm that the PU.1a and PU.1b sites indeed bind PU.1 and not Ets-2 or another transcription factor possibly present in the nuclear extract, we performed a supershift EMSA using a PU.1-specific antibody. As can be seen (the right lanes), addition of the antibody impeded migration of the entire oligonucleotide probe-protein complexes confirming identity of PU.1 as the nuclear factor binding to both identified sites within the SHP-1 gene P2 promoter. PU.1 Binds and Activates SHP-1 Gene P2 Promoter in Vivo—To demonstrate that PU.1 binds to the P2 promoter also in vivo, we performed a ChIP assay using the PU-1-specific antibody as well as an irrelevant (anti-ALK tyrosine kinase) antibody that served as a negative control. Immunoprecipitation of the protein extracts obtained from Jurkat and another lymphoid cell line BJAB was followed by PCR using a set of primers specific for the -166 -59 P2 promoter region with the centrally located -103 -98 PU.1a and -75 -70 PU.1b binding sites. Another set of primers specific for the distal region of the SHP-1 gene coding for exon 16 (5Wu C. Sun M. Liu L. Zhou G.W. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) served as a control. Whereas both sets of primers yielded strong PCR bands from the whole cell lysate (input), a strong band could be obtained from the PU.1 antibody precipitate using only the primers reacting with the P2 promoter but not the primers that recognize exon 16 (Fig. 3A). No band was generated from the precipitate obtained with the control anti-ALK antibody confirming specificity of the PU.1 binding. To provide evidence that the identified PU.1 binding sites are transcriptionally active, we performed a luciferase reporter assay with the P2 promoter constructs that contained mutation of the PU.1a or PU.1b binding site. To preserve the overall structure and spatial relations of the site, we performed substitutions rather than deletions of the target binding site nucleotides leaving intact the remaining sequence of the examined -266 + 97 fragment. As shown in Fig. 4B, the targeted six-base substitution of the PU.1a binding site markedly diminished transcriptional activity of the entire fragment. The effect of substitution of the PU1.b site was even more profound and decreased the transcriptional activity almost to the baseline level of the RNA polymerase-binding core promoter. The combination of both PU.1a and PU.1b binding site substitutions had no additional inhibitory effect. These findings indicate that PU.1 is the transcriptional activator of the P2 promoter. PU.1-dependent Transcription of the SHP-1 Gene—To demonstrate that PU.1 binding to the P2 promoter and activation of the promoter as documented in the luciferase gene reporter assay also impacts on the expression of the endogeneous, native SHP-1 gene, we inhibited expression of PU.1 using the siRNA technology. Treatment of both Jurkat and BJAB cells with the PU.1-specific but not the control, non-targetting siRNA markedly diminished expression of PU.1 in these cells. The inhibition of PU.1 expression resulted in the profound suppression of transcriptional activity of the SHP-1 gene as determined by marked decrease in the amount of the SHP-1 mRNA (Fig. 5A) and protein (Fig. 5B). These observations provided the final evidence for the key role of PU.1 in activation of the SHP-1 gene. Of note, the PU.1 depletion and the related down-regulation of SHP-1 expression were associated with the substantial increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins (Fig. 5B) in agreement with the well defined role of SHP-1 as the tyrosine phosphatase of a number of key proteins in the in the hematopoietic cells (1Shen S.H.

All MCO proteins couple the oxidation of four molecules of a one-electron donor substrate with the reduction of one molecule of dioxygen to 2H2O. Although the substrate specificity of these enzymes is quite broad, the specificity that has been characterized in a cohort of MCO proteins toward Fe(II) as reducing substrate results in what is known as the ferroxidase reaction (1Frieden E.

For example, in yeast, the action of Fet3p on Fe(II) is coupled to the transport of the Fe(III) product into the yeast cell (16Kosman D.J. Mol.

The ferroxidase activity of these copper enzymes explains the large body of literature that has reported on an apparent link between copper and iron metabolism in eukaryotes (15Hellman N.E.

In previous work, we examined the role(s) that Fet3p and hCp might have in managing the copper redox balance as well. We demonstrated that both ferroxidases exhibited a robust activity with Cu(I) as substrate (20Stoj C. Kosman D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity that Fet3p had toward Cu(I) contributed to the overall resistance that yeast exhibited toward copper (21Shi X. Stoj C. Romeo A. Kosman D.J. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50309-50315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This was the first report of cuprous oxidase activity attributable to a eukaryotic ferroxidase; this activity has been reported also in the copper resistance protein in Escherichia coli, CueO (22Roberts S.A.

We have suggested that MCO proteins that exhibit reactivity toward lower valent metal ions be designated metallooxidases (4Stoj C.S. Kosman D.J.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the MCO domain of Fet3p now provides the context for a directed protein engineering approach to delineate the structural elements in Fet3p that support the activity it has toward Cu(I) (14Taylor A.B. Stoj C.S. Ziegler L. Kosman D.J. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15459-15464Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here we provide kinetic data indicating that a methionine residue at the T1 copper site in Fet3p is required for full activity toward Cu(I) in comparison with the activity Fet3p has toward Fe(II) as substrate. The data suggest that although the Fe(II) and Cu(I) binding sites in Fet3p kinetically overlap, the pathways for electron transfer from the two metal ions to the T1 Cu(II) differ. The kinetic defects exhibited in vitro by Fet3 proteins carrying an amino acid substitution at this residue position are reflected in an increased sensitivity to copper when this mutation is made in the form of the enzyme found in the yeast plasma membrane. Methionine thioether ligation of Cu(I) in Fet3p fits the pattern of similar ligation in other cuprous ion-trafficking proteins in pro- and eukaryotes. Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—The strain used in the majority of the studies described was AJS05, which was derived from DEY1457 (MATα can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 ade6) (24Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The AJS05 genotype is MATα can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 ade6 fet3::HIS ftr1::TRP1 aft1::AFT1-1upKAN (25Singh A. Severance S. Kaur N. Wiltsie W. Kosman D.J. J. Biol.

The AFT1-1up allele codes for a constitutively active form of the Aft1p transcription factor that drives expression of the FET3 (and FTR1) locus (26Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this background, expression of episomally expressed wild type and mutant alleles of FET3 and FTR1 was maximized, affording cultures that contained the protein partners in the plasma membrane as described. Early log phase cells (A660 nm = 0.8–2.0) grown in selective media (6.67 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose plus the appropriate drop-out mixture of amino acids) were used for all experiments. Expression and Purification of Soluble Fet3 Proteins—S. cerevisiae strain M2* carrying plasmid pDY148 was used as the expression system for the purification of soluble Fet3p (11Hassett R.F. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This strain is MATα trp1-63 leu2-3,112 gcn4-101 his3-609 ura3-52 AFT1-1up. Plasmid pDY148 is a high copy vector that carries a recombinant FET3 gene truncated at nucleotide +1666 (at amino acid residue 555). This truncation removed the apparent membrane-spanning domain found in the carboxyl-terminal region that is included in residues 559–586. Expression of Fet3p from pDY148 results in a Fet3p that was secreted directly into the growth medium rather than being retained in the plasma membrane. Fet3 protein production and purification have been described in some detail (11Hassett R.F. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Construction of Fet3p Mutants—Mutant FET3 alleles were constructed directly in pDY148 (for secreted, soluble Fet3p) and in pDY133 (for the native membrane-associated Fet3p) by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. Briefly, complementary primers were used in PCR amplification of the appropriate vector to generate Fet3pM281A and M345A single mutants; two sequential rounds of mutagenesis yielded the Fet3pM281A/M345A double mutant. Mutated FET3 sequences were confirmed by automated fluorescence sequencing on an ABI PRISM 377 instrument. Vectors expressing the mutant proteins were transformed into yeast strain M2* for soluble protein expression (11Hassett R.F. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in strain AJS05 for in vivo analyses of protein localization at the plasma membrane and copper sensitivity (25Singh A.

Protein Characterization—Room temperature UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Protein concentration was determined using the standard dye-binding Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Chem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Reduction potentials of the T1 copper were obtained by the poised potential method (12Machonkin T.E. Quintanar L. Palmer A.E. Hassett R. Severance S. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5507-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A 200-μl sample of ∼0.1 mm degassed protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 was placed in a 1-cm path length anaerobic cuvette with a Teflon septum, and degassed K3(Fe(CN)6) was added to yield a final concentration of ∼5 mm. Aliquots of degassed K4(Fe(CN)6) were added, and absorption at 608 nm was monitored at room temperature over time until equilibrium was achieved for each titration point (15–20 min). The absorbance versus solution potential values were fit to the Nernst equation using Prism 4 software from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). Steady-state Turnover Kinetic Analysis—Steady-state kinetic analyses were based on oxygen consumption using an Oxygraph (Hansatech) (20Stoj C. Kosman D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Wang T-P. Quintanar L. Severance S. Solomon E.I. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rates of O2 uptake were evaluated using the OXYG32 software provided by Hansatech. All initial velocity (v) versus [S] data were subsequently analyzed by direct fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism 4 software. Ferrous ammonium sulfate (Sigma) and cuprous chloride (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) were used for kinetic analysis of the metallooxidase activity of Fet3 proteins. Stock solutions of the substrates were freshly prepared in nitrogen-purged 100 mm MES at pH 6.0. All transfers from these stock solutions were done using gas-tight syringes. The buffer used for O2 uptake measurements was air-saturated 100 mm MES at pH 6.0. Type 1 Copper Single-turnover Kinetic Analyses—Single-turnover reduction rates of fully oxidized Fet3p species by 400 μm Cu(I) (for WT Fet3p, 10× Km) were obtained using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a mercury/xenon arc lamp and outfitted with PEEK tubing; the dead time of the instrument was ∼2 ms (12Machonkin T.E. Quintanar L. Palmer A.E. Hassett R. Severance S. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5507-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Quintanar L. Gebhard M. Wang T.P. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 6579-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed at 4 °C in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with a final protein concentration of ∼50 μm; reduction of the four Cu(II) atoms in Fet3p was followed by the decrease in T1 Cu(II) absorbance at 608 nm. The tubing, plungers, and valves were rendered anaerobic by washing with dithionite solution followed by several washes with degassed water or buffer; the system was operated under a positive pressure of N2 to maintain anaerobiosis. A minimum of three reduction-absorbance traces for a given reaction were subsequently fit to equations describing mono- or biphasic first-order reactions using the Prism 4 software. Analysis of Copper Resistance—Strain AJS05, producing episomally encoded wild type or mutant Fet3 proteins along with wild type Ftr1-GFP was used for these experiments; the medium was synthetic complete medium without or with CuSO4 (1 mm). Stock cell suspensions in water of A660 nm = 1.0 (∼2 × 107 cells/ml) were used to prepare three serial dilutions. Cell dilutions (4 μl) were spotted on the solid medium. All plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days and photographed. Confocal Fluorescent Microscopy—The trafficking of Fet3p mutants to the yeast plasma membrane was confirmed by co-expressing Ftr1-GFP in strain AJS05 as above; correct localization of this fusion requires the correct localization of the Fet3p partner species (25Singh A. Severance S. Kaur N. Wiltsie W. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13355-13364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Severance S. Chakraborty S. Kosman D.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells (1 ml) were grown as described, pelleted, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. Confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal system equipped with a 15-milliwatt krypton/argon laser and operating on a Nikon Optiphot upright microscope with an oil immersion ×60 1.4 numerical aperture objective. Optical sections were acquired at 0.5 μm, and the xy resolution was set at 0.2 μm using the instrument’s Lasersharp version 3.0 software. The images were processed using Confocal Assistant version 4.02. Locating Potential Cu(I) Ligands in the Metallooxidase Site in Fet3p—The T1 copper, ferroxidase site in Fet3p is illustrated in Fig. 1. Kinetic analysis has shown that Fe(II) and Cu(I) act as substrates at overlapping sites on Fet3p (i.e. the productive binding of the two reductants to the enzyme is mutually exclusive) (20Stoj C. Kosman D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the Fet3p structure for possible Cu(I) ligands in the vicinity of the three residues that support the ferrous iron reactivity of Fet3p, Glu185, Asp283, and Asp409 (13Quintanar L. Gebhard M. Wang T.P. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 6579-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Stoj C. Augustine T.J. Ziegler L. Solomon E.I. Kosman D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12741-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Specifically, we looked for methionine residues, since Cu(I) prefers soft ligands like sulfur. For example, CueO has a copper-binding site that is methionine-rich (23Roberts S.A. Wildner G.F. Grass G. Weichsel A. Ambrus A. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31958-31963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two such possible copper ligands were located near the T1 copper, Met281 and Met345. These are shown in Fig. 1, with the distances given between the T1 copper and the SD atom of each side chain. These two residues were targeted for mutagenesis. Physicochemical Characterization of Fetp Mutant Proteins—Fet3pM281A, FetpM345A, and the double mutant Fet3pM281A/M345A were produced and purified as described for Fet3p wild type and other mutant forms (11Hassett R.F. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Quintanar L. Gebhard M. Wang T.P. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am.

This result was consistent with the wild type absorbance at both 330 and 608 nm that the mutant proteins exhibited (Fig. 2 and Table 1); the transition at 330 nm is due to the protein’s type 3, binuclear Cu(II) cluster, whereas the transition centered at 608 nm is due to the favorable charge transfer from CysS → Cu(II) at the T1 copper (Cys484 in Fig. 1). The X-band, cwEPR spectra of the mutant proteins were also wild type (i.e. the spin Hamiltonian parameters for both the T1 and T2 Cu(II) in the mutants were unchanged) (data not shown).TABLE 1Copper content, molar absorptivity, and reduction potentials for Fet3 proteinsFetp speciesCopper contentaS.E. values based on propagation of error in both copper and protein determinations. 608 nmT1 copper redox potentialbThe fitted values of 1/slope of the data in Fig. 3 varied from 64 ± 4 (WT) to 52 ± 4 mV (M281A/M345A).g atoms copper/mol Fet3pcm-1 m-1mVWT4.4 ± 0.35773433 ± 5M281A4.1 ± 0.25219433 ± 2M345A4.3 ± 0.45173433 ± 3M281A/M345A4.2 ± 0.34883439 ± 6a S.E. values based on propagation of error in both copper and protein determinations.b The fitted values of 1/slope of the data in Fig. 3 varied from 64 ± 4 (WT) to 52 ± 4 mV (M281A/M345A). Open table in a new tab The T1 copper sites in the three mutants also had reduction potentials that were identical to wild type Fet3p. These potentials were determined by the poised potential method, whereby solution potential was buffered by the ratio of ferri- to ferrocyanide and the ratio T1 Cu(I)/T1 Cu(II) in Fet3p was determined by the absorbance at 608 nm. This latter ratio was then plotted versus the solution potential according to the Nernst equation to yield the midpoint reduction potential of the T1 copper. These plots are shown in Fig. 3 with the corresponding E° values given in Table 1; the slopes of the lines fell in the range 64-52 mV. The absorbance, EPR, and potential data indicate that mutation of either or both of these methionine residues had little if any effect on the electronic structure of the T1 copper or upon its inherent (thermodynamic) reactivity as an acceptor (oxidant) in an electron transfer process. Steady-state Kinetic Characterization of Fet3p Mutant Proteins—This reactivity was determined in two ways. First, the kinetic constants for steady-state turnover with either Cu(I) or Fe(II) as substrate were determined by quantifying O2 uptake using an oxygen electrode. The data obtained in this analysis are presented in terms of molecular velocities (vmeasured/[Fet3p]) in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. The kinetic constants corresponding to the nonlinear fits of the primary data to the Michaelis-Menten equation are given in Table 2. The data for wild type Fet3p show that Fet3p has a more robust activity toward Fe(II) in comparison with Cu(I); the difference is reflected primarily in Km values and in the resulting specificity constants, or kcat/Km values. These latter values for Cu(I) and Fe(II) are 2.1 and 9.4 μm–1 min–1, respectively, indicating that Fe(II) is favored as substrate by a factor of 4.5. The data indicate that Met281 does not play a significant role in the reactivity that Fet3p has toward either metal ion, although a fractional decrease in kcat is seen with both substrates. In contrast, the M345A substitution had a much more pronounced effect on Cu(I) turnover than it did on the reaction with Fe(II) as substrate. In Fet3pM345A, the Km for Cu(I) increased nearly 2-fold, whereas kcat was reduced by a factor of 2.5; the latter value in the double mutant was reduced even further. A similar decrease in the kcat for Fe(II) turnover was seen in the double mutant; nonetheless, with respect to the specificity constants for this mutant, Fe(II) is now favored by a factor of 26 (3.6 for Fe(II) versus 0.14 for Cu(I)). We conclude that Met345 contributes specifically to the cuprous oxidase reactivity exhibited by Fet3p.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic constants for Cu(I) and Fe(II) turnover by Fet3 proteinsFet3p speciesKinetic constants for Cu(I)Kinetic constants for Fe(II)KmkcatKmkcatμmmin-1μmmin-1WT38 ± 3.679 ± 2.74.7 ± 0.744 ± 1.7M281A45 ± 5.658 ± 2.65 ± 1.330 ± 1.7M345A71 ± 10.231 ± 1.64.4 ± 0.428.5 ± 0.6M281A/M345A77 ± 7.610.6 ± 0.44.3 ± 0.715.6 ± 0.6E185A34 ± 4.636 ± 1.236 ± 2.824.3 ± 0.6D409A100 ± 14.960 ± 3.119 ± 1.648 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab The kinetic behavior of Fet3pM345A with Cu(I) and Fe(II) as substrates was compared with the differential reactivity that these two substrates exhibited with the Fet3pE185A and D409A mutants. Both carboxylate side chains play multiple roles in defining the reactivity that Fet3p has with Fe(II) (13Quintanar L. Gebhard M. Wang T.P. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12741-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We tested whether these residues were specificity elements solely for Fe(II) oxidation as Met345 appeared to be for Cu(I) turnover. The kinetic constants for these two mutants with both substrates are given in Table 2 (last two lines). The 2-fold decrease in kcat exhibited by Fet3pE185A was seen with both substrates; in contrast, the ∼3-fold increase in Km for Cu(I) as substrate was observed only in the D409A mutant, whereas Fet3pE185A was wild type in this respect. These data indicate that Asp409 plays a more significant role in Cu(I) turnover than Glu185. Kinetic Analysis of Single-turnover, T1 Cu(II) Reduction in Fet3p Mutant Proteins—The rate of intermolecular, outer sphere electron transfer (ET) from the reducing substrate to the T1 Cu(II) is the parameter that explicitly defines the reactivity of the T1 copper with a given reductant (13Quintanar L. Gebhard M. Wang T.P. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 6579-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Stoj C. Augustine T.J. Ziegler L. Solomon E.I. Kosman D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12741-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This rate was obtained by stopped-flow absorbance measurements in which fully oxidized protein (∼50 μm) was mixed anaerobically with 400 μm Cu(I) (for WT Fet3p, 10 × Km), and the redox state of the enzyme’s four copper atoms was monitored by the redox state of the T1 Cu(II) (12Machonkin T.E.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12741-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Absorbance traces obtained at 608 nm for wild type and mutant Fet3p species following mixing with Cu(I) are shown in Fig. 5A. The absorbance change versus time was fit to either a single-phase or two-phase exponential to yield the rate constants given in Table 3. Given the [Cu(I)]/Km values used (≥5 × Km), we have made the reasonable approximation that the Fet3p reduction reaction went to completion under conditions of saturating substrate. In a separate equilibrium experiment, we demonstrated that fully oxidized wild type Fet3p (four Cu(II)) was completely reduced by as little as 4 electron equivalents of Cu(I); these data are shown in Fig. 5B and show that complete reduction of the enzyme was occurring in the stopped-flow experiment.TABLE 3Single-turnover T1 Cu(II) reduction rates with Cu(I)Fet3p speciesT1 Cu(II) reductionFast phaseSlow phases-1WT11.1 ± 0.570.59 ± 0.03M281A16.9 ± 0.620.46 ± 0.02M345A0.21 ± 0.020.02 ± 0.00M281A/M345A0.25 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.00D409A1.88 ± 0.020.41 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab The single-turnover results paralleled the steady-state ones in that Fet3pM345A (and the double mutant) exhibited a marked reduction in intermolecular electron transfer from Cu(I) that was not seen in Fet3pM281A. We conclude that of the two residues targeted here, only Met345 is required for the cuprous oxidase activity in Fet3p. The 50-fold reduction in kET for the Fet3pM345A or the double mutant indicates that Met345 contributes to electron transfer by providing a binding site for Cu(I) (indicated also by the steady-state Km data) and to the pathway by which the electron on the donor Cu(I) is coupled to the T1 Cu(II) acceptor. The carboxylate groups of Glu185 and Asp409 in Fet3p provide the route for electron transfer from Fe(II) to the T1 Cu(I) (13Quintanar L. Gebhard M. Wang T.P. Kosman D.J. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. So"

In recent years, chemokine receptors have been found to play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, including HAD. In a plausible model, HIV-1 enters target cells through a direct fusion process in which HIV/gp120 binds to CD4, the main receptor on the target cell surface, plus one of two chemokine receptors, usually CXCR4 or CCR5 (4Berger E.A.

The predominant pathway is an indirect process that results in the release of toxic factors from immune-stimulated or HIV-infected cells such as macrophages and microglia. HIV-1 can stimulate or infect microglia and macrophages by interacting with chemokine receptors in conjunction with CD4. Macrophages and microglia can also be activated by factors such as shed gp120 released from infected cells (1Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A.

The second mechanism is direct interaction of gp120 with neurons and possibly astrocytes via their chemokine receptors (17Meucci O. Fatatis A. Simen A.A. Bushell T.J. Gray P.W. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14500-14505Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In fact, picomolar concentrations of CXCR4 (or X4)-preferring or CXCR4/CCR5 (or dual)-tropic gp120 are known to induce neurotoxicity through CXCR4 despite the fact that neurons do not express CD4 on their cell surface (18Hesselgesser J.

Also the finding that gp120-induced neuronal damage can be prevented by anti-gp120 antibodies but not by anti-CD4 antibodies not only proves the specificity of the effect of gp120 but also implies that CD4 is not necessary for neurotoxicity (21Dreyer E.B.

Whether or not neuronal damage and apoptosis occur via indirect or direct pathways or both, chemokine receptors are involved in the development of HAD, which suggests that therapeutic interventions at the level of chemokine receptors may reverse or attenuate the symptoms associated with HAD. Because of the profound activities of chemokine receptors in HAD, developing selective, potent inhibitors of chemokine receptors and understanding the physiological or pathological processes of HAD are crucial for devising novel strategies of clinical interventions. As such, we have been working toward the development of a family of unnatural chemokines, termed SMM-chemokines, which have higher receptor selectivity, binding affinity, and/or antiviral activities than natural chemokines. We previously demonstrated how this SMM-chemokine approach could be applied to convert the nonselective vMIP-II into highly selective ligands of CXCR4 or CCR5 in terms of their binding, signaling, and/or antiviral activity (23Kumar S. Choi W.T. Dong C.Z. Madani N. Tian S. Liu D. Wang Y. Pesavento J. Wang J. Fan X. Yuan J. Fritzsche W.R. An J. Sodroski J.G. Richman D.D. Huang Z. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We also used a similar strategy to modify the biological and pharmacological properties of SDF-1α (24Dong C.Z. Kumar S. Choi W.T. Madani N. Tian S. An J. Sodroski J.G. Huang Z. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 7923-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This is of particular importance because SDF-1α, the only known naturally occurring ligand for CXCR4, is neurotoxic in the presence or absence of HIV/gp120 (19Kaul M. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although inhibitors of chemokine receptors may be beneficial for HAD, the true benefit of these compounds remains to be shown. Interestingly, certain natural chemokines have been shown to protect neurons against X4-preferring gp120, but they do so by activating a neuroprotective pathway via non-CXCR4 receptors, including CCR5 (19Kaul M. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and CX3CR1 (25Hesselgesser J. Halks-Miller M. DelVecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is still not known whether the same or different neuroprotective pathway can be initiated via CXCR4, or the direct blockade of CXCR4 by its inhibitors alone can sufficiently reverse gp120-induced neuronal apoptosis. Also the effect of CCR5 inhibition by agents other than its natural agonists has never been examined before. To address these questions, we used rodent cerebrocortical cultures (RCCs) that not only contained the type and proportion of cells found in human brain, i.e. neurons, astrocytes, and macrophages/microglia, but also expressed CXCR4, CCR5, and other chemokine receptor homologues (14Rottman J.B.

We examined the potential neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of CXCR4- and CCR5-selective SMM-chemokines and their mechanism(s) of action in preventing or inducing neuronal apoptosis, which would provide new insights into the distinct signaling pathways of HAD-associated neuronal apoptosis activated by different chemokine receptor ligands that were either agonists or antagonists. Total Chemical Synthesis of SMM-Chemokines—The automated stepwise incorporation of protected amino acids was performed using an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA) with a CLEAR amide resin (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) as the solid support. N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry was employed for the synthesis (23Kumar S. Choi W.T. Dong C.Z. Madani N. Tian S. Liu D. Wang Y. Pesavento J. Wang J. Fan X. Yuan J. Fritzsche W.R. An J.

In certain coupling steps with potentially slow reaction rates, double coupling followed by capping of the unreacted amino functional groups was performed. After incorporation of the 50th residue, 2% v/v of Me2SO was introduced to the solution to enhance the coupling reaction. After removing N-terminal N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl protection, the protein was cleaved from the resin support by adding a cleavage mixture comprised of phenol (4% wt/v), thioanisole (5% v/v), water (5% v/v), ethanedithiol (2.5% v/v), triisopropylsilane (1.5% v/v), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 82% v/v). The protein was precipitated by adding ice-cold tert-butyl methyl ether and washed repeatedly in cold ether. The crude protein was dissolved in 25% CH3CN in water containing 0.1% TFA before being lyophilized, and it was dissolved in water and purified using semi-preparative reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Folding of the purified protein was performed in 1 m guanidinium hydrochloride and 0.1 m trisma base at pH 8.5 (1 mg protein/ml folding buffer) and was monitored by analytical RP-HPLC using a Vydac C-18 column (0.46 × 15 cm, 5 μm) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min; solvent A, water with 0.1% TFA; solvent B, 20% water in CH3CN with 0.1% TFA; and a linear gradient 30–70% B over 30 min. Protein desaltation and purification were then performed. The purified protein was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS). Preparation and Treatment of RCCs—RCCs were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos at days 15–17 of gestation (19Kaul M. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

D10C extra growth media containing 160 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glucose (Sigma, D5671), 20 ml of F-12 growth serum (Sigma, N4888), 20 ml of heat-inactivated bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, SH30072.03), 0.48 ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma), 2.0 ml of 200 mm glutamine (Sigma), and 5 ml of HEPES at pH 7.0 (Omega, Tarzana, CA; HB-20) were used to grow and maintain the RCCs. Treatment with gp120, SMM-Chemokines, and Various Inhibitors of Intracellular Signaling Cascades—Mixed neuronal/glial cells cultured on coverslips were transferred into 24-well plates containing Earle's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 5 μm glycine.

SMM-chemokines were applied for 5 min and intracellular signaling cascade inhibitors for 15 min prior to gp120 exposure. HIV-1/gp120 from X4-tropic strain IIIB was purchased from ImmunoDiagnostics (Woburn, MA); gp120 from the CCR5-preferring strain BAL was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All of the inhibitors of intracellular signaling cascades were purchased from the BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neuronal survival was determined by staining permeabilized cells with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to detect changes in the nuclear morphology of apoptotic cells and with a neuron-specific antibody, anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2, Sigma), to identify cell type. Prior to staining, cells were fixed for 25 min with 4% (wt/v) paraformaldehyde followed by overnight incubation with 0.1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Tween 20/PBS (Sigma). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 30-min incubation with a 10% solution of heat-inactivated goat serum (Invitrogen) in 0.2% Tween 20/PBS. To specifically stain neurons, the cells were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with 1:500 dilution of anti-microtubule-associated protein-2. After three washes with 0.2% Tween 20/PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with 0.2% Tween 20/PBS followed by two washes in PBS. Cell nuclei were subsequently stained with Hoechst 33342 (12 μm) for 5 min in the dark. After washing twice with PBS, coverslips containing the cells were mounted onto glass slides. Ten microscopic fields were counted for each coverslip, and two to three coverslips per treatment were used for each experiment. For each coverslip, the number of cells analyzed ranged from 900–1300. At least three independent experiments were performed for each paradigm. Western Blot Experiments—RCCs were incubated for 24 h with SMM-chemokines and gp120 from X4-tropic strain IIIB, washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) containing one tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture and 5 mm NaF. Equal amounts of protein were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and electrotransferred onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), the membranes were incubated with antibodies against the indicated antigens. An extra sample lane was incubated without the primary antibody as a control. All the antibodies were purchased from the Cell Signaling Technology except anti-phospho-p38 (Promega, Madison, WI), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG, Pierce) and anti-murine IgG (Amersham Biosciences). After visualization by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) or ECL (Amersham Biosciences), the detected proteins were quantified using densitometry (n = 3; statistical comparison by unpaired Student's t test; *, p < 0.05). The Western blot shows one representative example of three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using an analysis of variance followed by a Scheffé or Bonferroni/Dunn post hoc test. Design and Selection of SMM-Chemokines—The SMM-chemokines used for the present study included two CXCR4-selective inhibitors, D-(1–10)-vMIP-II and D-(1–10)-vMIP-II-(9–68)-SDF-1α, and two CCR5-specific ligands, (1–10)-MIP-1β-(11–71)-vMIP-II and D-(1–10)-MIP-1β-(11–71)-vMIP-II. These SMM-chemokines contained various de novo designed sequence replacements or D-amino acid substitutions and displayed enhanced receptor selectivity, binding affinity, and anti-HIV activities compared with natural chemokines (23Kumar S. Choi W.T. Dong C.Z. Madani N. Tian S. Liu D. Wang Y. Pesavento J. Wang J. Fan X. Yuan J. Fritzsche W.R. An J. Sodroski J.G. Richman D.D. Huang Z. Chem.

With the exception of (1–10)-MIP-1β-(11–71)-vMIP-II (designated here RCP188), which can trigger Ca2+ mobilization in CCR5-expressing cell lines at high concentrations (i.e. 1 μm), all other analogs were antagonist ligands of their corresponding target receptors, as they could not mobilize Ca2+ at any concentration. D-(1–10)-vMIP-II (RCP168), (1–10)-MIP-1β-(11–71)-vMIP-II (RCP188), and D-(1–10)-MIP-1β-(11–71)-vMIP-II (RCP189) were generated by modifying only a small N-terminal module of 10 residues of vMIP-II, the most nonspecific and cross-reactive chemokine ligand known to date (34Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Coulin F. Simmons G. Johnsen A.H. Alouani S. Power C.A. Luttichau H.R. Gerstoft J. Clapham P.R. Clark-Lewis I. Wells T.N. Schwartz T.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that RCP168 and RCP188 are selective for CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively, as they show similar or significantly enhanced binding affinities for their corresponding target receptors but drastically decreased or even completely abolished cross-binding activities for other receptors. RCP189 was also shown to maintain its selectivity toward CCR5, although its binding affinity was weaker than that of RCP188. In another study, we replaced the N-terminal (1–8) sequence module of SDF-1α, the only natural ligand for CXCR4, with all D-forms of (1–10) residues of vMIP-II (24Dong C.Z. Kumar S. Choi W.T. Madani N. Tian S. An J. Sodroski J.G. Huang Z. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 7923-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding and antiviral assays showed that D-(1–10)-vMIP-II-(9–68)-SDF-1α (RCP222) was not only a selective CXCR4 ligand but also an effective HIV-1 inhibitor. The natural chemokines, SDF-1α and vMIP-II, were used as positive controls and for comparisons. Their sequences and modifications are provided in Table 1.TABLE 1List of SMM chemokines, their sequences and modificationsa D-amino acids are shown in italic, whereas substituted residues (from vMIP-II, SDF-1α, or MIP-1β) are shown in bold.

Neuroprotective Effects of Antagonist CXCR4-selective SMM-Chemokines—Two CXCR4-specific SMM-chemokines, RCP168 and RCP222, were examined for their potential neuroprotective effects after exposure to the X4-preferring gp120IIIB (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of CXCR4 by gp120 led to 10–20% neuronal apoptosis, which is statistically significant and consistent with the previous reports on gp120-induced neurotoxicity in both RCCs and hippocampal neuronal cultures (1Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 19Kaul M. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The same studies also demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of natural chemokine receptor ligands of CCR5 and CX3CR1, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and fractalkine, which could prevent the toxicity of 10–20% induced by HIV-1 gp120. Note that RCCs, which express CXCR4, CCR5, and other chemokine receptor homologues with good sequence similarities to the corresponding human chemokine receptors (14Rottman J.B. Ganley K.P.

Virol. 1999; 73: 897-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its toxicity was reversed by MIP-1β, RANTES, and fractalkine (1Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A.

In fact, in addition to having homologous chemokine receptors, rats express chemokine ligand homologues that share great sequence similarities with their human counterparts, as shown by rat SDF-1α, which is highly conserved with >99% identity to its known human, feline, and murine forms (37Pillarisetti K. Gupta S.K. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Two natural chemokines, vMIP-II and SDF-1α, were not only incapable of protecting neurons from gp120IIIB-induced neuronal apoptosis but were also neurotoxic on their own (Fig. 1A), which demonstrates the potential problems associated with the use of natural, agonist, or nonspecific chemokines in clinical applications. Therefore, we treated the RCCs with antagonist CXCR4-selective SMM-chemokines chemically engineered for higher target selectivity. As shown in Fig. 1A, RCP168 or RCP222 was able to abrogate gp120IIIB-induced neuronal apoptosis, which demonstrates that inherently neurotoxic, natural chemokines can be sy"
