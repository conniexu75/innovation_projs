https://openalex.org/W1549619413,"Herein we provide a detailed molecular analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of clinically localized, multifocal prostate cancer to delineate new oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We initially determined the copy number aberration (CNA) profiles of 74 patients with index tumors of Gleason score 7. Of these, 5 patients were subjected to whole-genome sequencing using DNA quantities achievable in diagnostic biopsies, with detailed spatial sampling of 23 distinct tumor regions to assess intraprostatic heterogeneity in focal genomics. Multifocal tumors are highly heterogeneous for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), CNAs and genomic rearrangements. We identified and validated a new recurrent amplification of MYCL, which is associated with TP53 deletion and unique profiles of DNA damage and transcriptional dysregulation. Moreover, we demonstrate divergent tumor evolution in multifocal cancer and, in some cases, tumors of independent clonal origin. These data represent the first systematic relation of intraprostatic genomic heterogeneity to predicted clinical outcome and inform the development of novel biomarkers that reflect individual prognosis."

Gene expression studies have been hampered by the presence of multiple HSC subtypes and contaminating non-HSCs in bulk HSC populations. To gain deeper insight into the gene expression program of murine HSCs, we combined single-cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single-cell gene expression assays. Through bioinformatic integration of these datasets, we designed an unbiased sorting strategy that separates non-HSCs away from HSCs, and single-cell transplantation experiments using the enriched population were combined with RNA-seq data to identify key molecules that associate with long-term durable self-renewal, producing a single-cell molecular dataset that is linked to functional stem cell activity. Finally, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this approach for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions in another stem cell system."
https://openalex.org/W1506816544,"Metabolic changes induced by hypoxia and extracellular ATP, acting through the transcription factors HIF1-α and AHR, regulate the differentiation of type 1 regulatory (Treg1) cells. Our understanding of the pathways that regulate lymphocyte metabolism, as well as the effects of metabolism and its products on the immune response, is still limited. We report that a metabolic program controlled by the transcription factors hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1-α) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) supports the differentiation of type 1 regulatory T cell (Tr1) cells. HIF1-α controls the early metabolic reprograming of Tr1 cells. At later time points, AHR promotes HIF1-α degradation and takes control of Tr1 cell metabolism. Extracellular ATP (eATP) and hypoxia, linked to inflammation, trigger AHR inactivation by HIF1-α and inhibit Tr1 cell differentiation. Conversely, CD39 promotes Tr1 cell differentiation by depleting eATP. CD39 also contributes to Tr1 suppressive activity by generating adenosine in cooperation with CD73 expressed by responder T cells and antigen-presenting cells. These results suggest that HIF1-α and AHR integrate immunological, metabolic and environmental signals to regulate the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1516940938,"PICALM is a highly validated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that reduced expression of PICALM in AD and murine brain endothelium correlated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and cognitive impairment. Moreover, Picalm deficiency diminished Aβ clearance across the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accelerated Aβ pathology in a manner that was reversible by endothelial PICALM re-expression. Using human brain endothelial monolayers, we found that PICALM regulated PICALM/clathrin-dependent internalization of Aβ bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1, a key Aβ clearance receptor, and guided Aβ trafficking to Rab5 and Rab11, leading to Aβ endothelial transcytosis and clearance. PICALM levels and Aβ clearance were reduced in AD-derived endothelial monolayers, which was reversible by adenoviral-mediated PICALM transfer. Inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived human endothelial cells carrying the rs3851179 protective allele exhibited higher PICALM levels and enhanced Aβ clearance. Thus, PICALM regulates Aβ BBB transcytosis and clearance, which has implications for Aβ brain homeostasis and clearance therapy."

Here, we report the identification of a neural circuit for top-down control in the mouse somatosensory system. The circuit consisted of a long-range reciprocal projection between M2 secondary motor cortex and S1 primary somatosensory cortex. In vivo physiological recordings revealed that sensory stimulation induced sequential S1 to M2 followed by M2 to S1 neural activity. The top-down projection from M2 to S1 initiated dendritic spikes and persistent firing of S1 layer 5 (L5) neurons. Optogenetic inhibition of M2 input to S1 decreased L5 firing and the accurate perception of tactile surfaces. These findings demonstrate that recurrent input to sensory areas is essential for accurate perception and provide a physiological model for one type of top-down control circuit.

These findings demonstrate that recurrent input to sensory areas is essential for accurate perception and provide a physiological model for one type of top-down control circuit. The capacity for complex behavior requires top-down control (Mesulam, 1998Mesulam M.M. From sensation to cognition.Brain. 1998; 121: 1013-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8428) Google Scholar). In physiological terms, top-down control is defined as the regulation by higher brain areas (i.e., top) of neuronal activity and information processing in lower brain areas (i.e., bottom). Hence, top-down control serves to modulate the neural signals from bottom-up sensory input to refine behavior as a function of an animal’s goal orientation. This regulation can be as simple as the refinement of sensory experience or as complex as executive control of a behavioral program. Given the diverse perceptual and cognitive behaviors governed by top-down control, the range of associated neural signals is vast, including attention, value, and memory (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M.

Thus, top-down control is a major component of complex behavior and in neural systems implementing cognition (Dehaene et al., 2006Dehaene S. Changeux J.P. Naccache L. Sackur J. Sergent C.

Despite the fundamental role of top-down control in animal behavior, the anatomical structure and physiological mechanisms of the responsible neural circuits remain unclear. Anatomically, top-down signals are presumed in mammals to use long-range intracortical horizontal projections between higher and lower brain areas (Cauller et al., 1998Cauller L.J. Clancy B.

Microcircuitry of forward and feedback connections within rat visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 368: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In one example, bottom-up sensory input typically evokes an early and late activity component in primary sensory areas. The late component is believed to involve top-down control and correlate with conscious perception (Del Cul et al., 2007Del Cul A. Baillet S. Dehaene S. Brain dynamics underlying the nonlinear threshold for access to consciousness.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e260Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Kulics and colleagues described touch stimulus responses in monkey (Cauller, 1995Cauller L. Layer I of primary sensory neocortex: where top-down converges upon bottom-up.Behav.

Consistent with these findings, during a whisker-stimulation detection task, inhibition of the late component in barrel cortex correlated with suppression of behavior (Sachidhanandam et al., 2013Sachidhanandam S. Sreenivasan V. Kyriakatos A. Kremer Y. Petersen C.C. Membrane potential correlates of sensory perception in mouse barrel cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest a potential link between the late component of cortical activity and top-down control, but the functional and anatomical neural circuit architecture of the late component remains poorly defined. There are several potential sources of top-down input to S1 primary somatosensory cortex, including motor cortex (Petreanu et al., 2012Petreanu L. Gutnisky D.A. Huber D. Xu N.L. O’Connor D.H. Tian L.

Neurol. 1998; 390: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and second-order thalamic nuclei (Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009Rubio-Garrido P. Pérez-de-Manzo F. Porrero C. Galazo M.J. Clascá F.

According to current models of cortical processing in sensory perception, prefrontal cortical areas receive bottom-up neural signals from primary sensory areas and return feedback to the sensory areas (Gilbert and Sigman, 2007Gilbert C.D.

Brain states: top-down influences in sensory processing.Neuron. 2007; 54: 677-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Among prefrontal cortical areas governing top-down input to somatosensory cortex, secondary motor cortex, called M2, is well positioned. In rodent, motor cortex is divided into primary motor cortex (M1) for direct motor control and located adjacent to S1 and the more rostral M2 (Neafsey et al., 1986Neafsey E.J. Bold E.L. Haas G. Hurley-Gius K.M. Quirk G. Sievert C.F. Terreberry R.R. The organization of the rat motor cortex: a microstimulation mapping study.Brain Res. 1986; 396: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), also called medial agranular cortex (AGm), that is linked to higher brain functions including value-based decision making (Sul et al., 2011Sul J.H. Jo S. Lee D. Jung M.W. Role of rodent secondary motor cortex in value-based action selection.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and self-initiated action (Murakami et al., 2014Murakami M. Vicente M.I. Costa G.M. Mainen Z.F. Neural antecedents of self-initiated actions in secondary motor cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1574-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence that M2 may transmit top-down information to control sensory perception where corollary discharge, an efferent copy of motor input from M2 to sensory cortices, is hypothesized to modulate perception (Schneider et al., 2014Schneider D.M. Nelson A. Mooney R. A synaptic and circuit basis for corollary discharge in the auditory cortex.Nature. 2014; 513: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Moreover, lesions of M2 can produce somatosensation neglect in rodents (Vargo et al., 1988Vargo J.M. Corwin J.V. King V. Reep R.L. Hemispheric asymmetry in neglect produced by unilateral lesions of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in rats.Exp. Neurol. 1988; 102: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), consistent with anatomical data showing reciprocal anatomical connectivity between S1 and M2 (Neafsey et al., 1986Neafsey E.J. Bold E.L. Haas G. Hurley-Gius K.M. Quirk G. Sievert C.F. Terreberry R.R. The organization of the rat motor cortex: a microstimulation mapping study.Brain Res. 1986; 396: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, Reep et al., 1984Reep R.L. Corwin J.V. Hashimoto A.

Topographic organization in the corticocortical connections of medial agranular cortex in rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 294: 262-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Despite this circumstantial evidence, the causal identification of a horizontal circuit from M2 to S1, and whether M2 input is responsible for sensory stimulus-evoked late activity in S1, is unknown. In more general terms, it remains unclear in any sensory system whether top-down projections innervating sensory areas merely modulate perception or are fundamentally involved in perception. In this study, we identify and characterize a top-down control circuit in the mouse somatosensory system. Using wide-field voltage-sensitive dye imaging during somatosensory hindpaw stimulation, we identified a functional top-down projection between M2 and S1 with early and late activity components. The middle anterior part of the hindpaw somatosensory area overlaps with hindpaw primary motor area (M1) in rodents (Ayling et al., 2009Ayling O.G. Harrison T.C. Boyd J.D. Goroshkov A. Murphy T.H. Automated light-based mapping of motor cortex by photoactivation of channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, in this study we define S1 based on recorded neural activity from a lateral posterior part of the hindpaw area where L4 exists and neural activity correlated with sensory input, as well as in the forepaw area (Milenkovic et al., 2014Milenkovic N. Zhao W.J. Walcher J. Albert T. Siemens J. Lewin G.R. Poulet J.F. A somatosensory circuit for cooling perception in mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We studied the anatomical projection from M2 to S1 and measured physiological signals in S1 during hindpaw stimulation using viral tracing and multiunit recordings, respectively. We found that top-down signals to both the upper and lower layers of S1 correlate with sustained dendritic activity in S1 layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons. Two-photon dendritic calcium (Ca2+) imaging and multiunit recordings from these neurons indicated that L5 dendritic activity promotes efficient cortical output. Finally, optogenetic inactivation of the top-down projection from M2 to S1 demonstrated that top-down input does not merely modulate perception but can have a direct role in the formation of accurate somatosensory perception. During mouse hindpaw stimulation, we used wide-field cortical voltage-sensitive dye (cVSD) imaging (Ferezou et al., 2007Ferezou I. Haiss F. Gentet L.J. Aronoff R. Weber B. Petersen C.C. Spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical sensorimotor integration in behaving mice.Neuron. 2007; 56: 907-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A) to search for a reciprocal functional connection between S1 (hindpaw area; hereafter called S1) and M2 (Neafsey et al., 1986Neafsey E.J.

Topographic organization in the corticocortical connections of medial agranular cortex in rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 294: 262-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) associated with somatosensory perception. Under anesthesia, a mild electrical stimulation (single pulse, 0.1 ms duration, 100 V) of the hindpaw evoked early neural activity in S1 followed by a subsequent response in an anterior medial area often referred to as AGm (Figure 1B) (Neafsey et al., 1986Neafsey E.J.

Topographic organization in the corticocortical connections of medial agranular cortex in rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 294: 262-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and also known in mice as the secondary motor area (M2) (Paxinos and Watson, 1998Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). The location of this area could be distinguished from forepaw M2 via forepaw stimulation, and from vibrissal primary and secondary motor cortices (vM1 and vM2) (see Figure S1 available online), indicating somatotopic map within M2, analogous to S1 and M1. Next we examined whether M2 and S1 form a functional connection using a sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX, 3 μM), or an AMPA/kainate receptor blocker, CNQX (100 μM), applied to either S1 or M2 during hindpaw stimulation under anesthesia. The pharmacological inactivation of S1 decreased the early component of cVSD activity in M2 (Figures 1D and 1H), and the inactivation of M2 decreased the late component of cVSD activity in S1 (Figures 1I and 1M). Together, these findings suggest that M2 and S1 form a reciprocal circuit that may be involved in somatosensory processing. Previous studies indicated that top-down corticocortical projections from higher areas to primary areas generally terminate in the upper and lower layers, whereas bottom-up feedforward projections terminate primarily in the middle layers (Cauller, 1995Cauller L.

Cortex. 2013; 24: 2362-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To confirm these axonal projections, we used anterograde viral tracing to examine the anatomical connectivity between S1 and M2. An adeno-associated viral tracer carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) with a CAG-driven promoter, AAV-CAG-GFP (AAV-GFP), was injected into either S1 or M2 to anterogradely label axons (Figures S2A and S3A), and the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) conjugated to Alexa 555 was used to label the somata of projection neurons (Figures S2F and S3D). The M2 axonal innervation pattern estimated from fluorescence density and total intensity showed targeting to layer 1 (L1) and deep cortical layers, with less in the middle layers (Figures S2B–S2E and S2I), suggestive of previously described top-down connections. Boutons from M2 axons were also observed in all layers (Figure S2E). L2/3, L5a, and L6 neurons in M2 sent their axons to S1 (Figures S2G–S2I), similar to a top-down projection from M2 to M1 (Ueta et al., 2013Ueta Y. Otsuka T. Morishima M. Ushimaru M. Kawaguchi Y. Multiple layer 5 pyramidal cell subtypes relay cortical feedback from secondary to primary motor areas in rats.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 24: 2362-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reverse tracing experiments (i.e., AAV-GFP in S1 and CT-B in M2) revealed a predominance of projecting neurons from layers 2/3, 5a, and lower layer 6 of S1 to M2 (Figure S3) that terminated in a feedforward (bottom-up) connectivity pattern (Coogan and Burkhalter, 1990Coogan T.A.

Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar). We confirmed that these long-range projections consisted of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-positive excitatory neurons by using glutamate decarboxylase 67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) knock-in mice to label inhibitory neurons (Figure S4) (Tamamaki et al., 2003Tamamaki N. Yanagawa Y. Tomioka R. Miyazaki J. Obata K. Kaneko T. Green fluorescent protein expression and colocalization with calretinin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin in the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 60-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Anatomically, the M2 axonal projection pattern to S1 indicated termination in upper and lower layers. To examine the functional M2 to S1 projection, we performed multiunit recordings (MUR) from all layers of S1 using a vertical array of up to 16 electrodes (Michigan Probes) during hindpaw stimulation (Figure 2). After hindpaw stimulation under anesthesia, we observed action potential (AP) activity in S1, with two peaks occurring early at ∼23 ms and late ∼110 ms in L5 (Figures 2A–2C). Although more physiological stimulation (air puff) to the hindpaw also induced the firing activity including two or more components (Figure S5A), we used the same mild electrical stimulation protocol throughout the study for precise control of stimulus intensity. APs were first detected in the middle layer (L4, 300–400 μm below the cortical surface), consistent with bottom-up thalamic input (Figure 2B, top) (Armstrong-James et al., 1992Armstrong-James M.

Deep cortical layers are activated directly by thalamus.Science. 2013; 340: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), followed within ∼4 ms by APs in other cortical layers that indicated general activation of the entire cortical column (Figure 2B, bottom). Notably, the propagation of the late activity component was sequential, starting in lower layers followed by upper layers (Figure 2C, top). Hindpaw stimulation evoked AP activity in S1 L5 during the late component and only sparsely in the other layers (upper layers and L6) (Figure 2C, bottom). We next asked whether the late S1 L5 activity was due to the influence of M2 activity as suggested by our cortical VSD imaging data which indicated that the late S1 response was dependent on M2 (Figures 1K–1M). To examine the source of the S1 late activity, we performed MUR in M2 and found that the average peak latency for firing in L5 of M2 was 80.0 ± 6.0 ms (n = 4 mice, Figure 2D), indicating an intermediate time between the early and late components recorded in S1. We further examined how M2 influenced the two activity phases in S1 by injecting TTX or CNQX into M2 and recording from S1 during hindpaw stimulation (Figures 2E–2G). The inactivation of M2 had no effect on the early component but caused a marked decrease in the late component in all layers, especially L5 of S1 (Figures 2E–2G; see Figures S5B–S5D for a summary of other layers and for TTX injection to visual cortex as a control experiment). These experiments also indicated that drug application to M2 did not directly affect the recording site in S1. Our results demonstrated that M2 firing and synaptic activity are necessary for L5 firing in S1 during the hindpaw stimulation-evoked late component. This M2-required L5 firing is, however, inconsistent with the M2 axon projection that targets mainly L6 and L1 of S1. The apparent inconsistency may result from a large synaptic input from M2 to L5 of S1, not evident from the anatomical data. To understand the pattern and strength of M2 synaptic input to S1, we performed current source density (CSD) analysis with linear probes during hindpaw stimulation (Figures 3A–3C). Similar to the observed AP activity, we also found two components of synaptic input (defined as current sinks). The first sink activity observed at L4 was consistent with thalamic input (Figure 3D). Notably, we found that although L5 dominated spike activity (Figure 2C, bottom), sinks corresponding to the late component were found in the lower and upper layers (Figure 3E), consistent with the anatomical tracing data. The averaged overlap period of sinks between 800 μm and 200 μm below from the cortical surface was ∼30 ms (n = 8; Figure S5E). To examine if the lower and upper layer sink activity was due to M2 synaptic input, we used M2 intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) or hindpaw stimulation before and after application of CNQX to the S1 cortical surface (Figure S5F). S1 sink activity was significantly blocked by CNQX application, indicating a dependence on M2 synaptic activity. Our CSD data (Figure 3E, bottom) suggested that more M2 synaptic input arrives at the lower (L6) and upper layers (L1 and L2/3) than at L5, consistent with the anatomical data. However, this finding was inconsistent with the multiunit data indicating the highest firing activity in L5 (Figure 2C, bottom). One explanation for this inconsistency was that synaptic input to the lower and upper layers caused local Ca2+ spikes in L5 apical dendrites and increased firing in L5 neurons (Larkum et al., 1999Larkum M.E.

Nonlinear dendritic integration of sensory and motor input during an active sensing task.Nature. 2012; 492: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To examine this hypothesis, we measured Ca2+ activity in single dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons. Using a transgenic mouse line in which layer 5 pyramidal neurons express the GECI (genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator) G-CaMP7 (Ohkura et al., 2012Ohkura M. Sasaki T. Sadakari J. Gengyo-Ando K.

Abstr. 2013; : 770.10Google Scholar), we performed two-photon imaging of distal apical dendritic Ca2+ activity ∼200 μm below the cortical surface under anesthesia before and after CNQX injection to M2 (Figures 4A and 4B ). Before CNQX application, hindpaw stimulation evoked dendritic activity with either early and small dendritic activity (Figure 4C, light blue arrowhead), followed by late and large activity (Figure 4C, deep blue arrowhead). After CNQX application to M2, the large but not the small component was blocked (Figures 4C and 4D), indicating that the late and large dendritic activity observed S1 L5 neurons required activity from the M2 projection. We further studied cellular mechanisms of the large and small dendritic activity. Dendritic Ca2+ activity can be caused by backpropagating action potentials (BPAPs) or local dendritic spikes; however, only the latter should be affected by glutamatergic blockers in the upper layers (Kondo et al., 2013Kondo M.

Modulation of synaptic plasticity by the coactivation of spatially distinct synaptic inputs in rat hippocampal CA1 apical dendrites.Brain Res. 2013; 1526: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that dendritic spiking induces larger fluorescence changes in distal dendrites than that from BPAPs (Murayama et al., 2007Murayama M. Pérez-Garci E. Lüscher H.R. Larkum M.E.

However, the extent of DNA methylation reprogramming in human germline cells is unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of human prenatal germline cells from 53 to 137 days of development. We discovered that the transcriptome and methylome of human germline is distinct from both human PSCs and the inner cell mass (ICM) of human blastocysts. Using this resource to monitor the outcome of global DNA demethylation with reversion of primed PSCs to the naive ground state, we uncovered hotspots of ultralow methylation at transposons that are protected from demethylation in the germline and ICM. Taken together, the human germline serves as a valuable in vivo tool for monitoring the epigenome of cells that have emerged from a global DNA demethylation event."

Successful vaccines often recapitulate effective immune responses induced by natural infection. In the case of HIV-1, antibodies capable of neutralizing about half of circulating strains develop after years of chronic infection in about half of examined donors (Hraber et al., 2014Hraber P. Seaman M.S. Bailer R.T. Mascola J.R. Montefiori D.C. Korber B.T. Prevalence of broadly neutralizing antibody responses during chronic HIV-1 infection.AIDS. 2014; 28: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Isolation and mapping of these neutralizing responses show that they target most of the exposed surface of the prefusion mature closed state of the HIV-1 Env spike (Julien et al., 2013Julien J.P.

Despite this broad targeting, highly effective antibodies develop preferentially against just a few sites of vulnerability on HIV-1 Env. These “supersites” of vulnerability have been the focus of intense vaccine interest. Each supersite appears to be targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies that arise in many infected individuals, by broadly neutralizing antibodies with diverse modes of recognition, and by broadly neutralizing antibodies with diverse B cell ontogenies (reviewed in Kwong and Mascola, 2012Kwong P.D.

Thus the human immune system has multiple avenues by which to generate effective antibodies against these supersites, thereby providing a rationale for their suitability as focuses of vaccine efforts. One of these supersites, the CD4 supersite, is the site of binding for the CD4 receptor on the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein. All primate immunodeficiency viruses recognize CD4 as the primary attachment molecule on the cell surface (Hoxie et al., 1988Hoxie J.A. Haggarty B.S. Bonser S.E. Rackowski J.L. Shan H. Kanki P.J.

Because an understanding of the variation in binding characteristics of antibodies specific for a supersite is expected to provide insight regarding how such antibodies might be induced in the general population, we sought to study antibody recognition of the CD4 supersite in multiple donors. We used antigen-specific probes to isolate CD4bs antibodies from diverse germline VH genes. We determined co-crystal structures with the HIV-1-Env gp120 glycoprotein for these and for previously identified antibodies HJ16, 1B2530, 8ANC131, and 8ANC134 (Corti et al., 2010Corti D.

The repeated observation of similar CD4bs antibodies in 14 donors provided a means to delineate the repertoire for effective recognition of the CD4 supersite. The results define structural geometries, recognized surfaces, paratope chemistries, and developmental pathways of CD4bs recognition, thereby providing a population-level understanding of antibodies targeting the CD4 supersite as well as a catalog from which to choose optimal templates for vaccine re-elicitation. To provide a more comprehensive view for how human antibodies recognize the CD4 supersite, we sought to identify CD4bs antibodies from additional donors. In particular, we were interested in determining whether highly effective neutralizing antibodies could originate from heavy-chain germline genes other than VH1-2 or VH1-46, the germline origin genes from which virtually all previously identified effective CD4bs antibodies derive. Sera from donors 44, C38, and Z258 showed a substantial reduction in neutralization when adsorbed with the RSC3 probe, a modified core gp120 designed to retain only the outer domain contact of CD4 (Wu et al., 2010Wu X.

VRC13 utilized a VH gene derived from VH1-69 (Figure S1) and neutralized 82% of circulating HIV-1 isolates (Table S1). From donor C38, we isolated two antibodies: C38-VRC16.01 and C38-VRC18.02 (Figure S1). VRC16 utilized a VH gene derived from VH3-23 and neutralized 58% of HIV-1 strains; VRC18 utilized a VH gene derived from VH1-2, was highly similar to an NGS-derived antibody from donor C38 (Zhu et al., 2013Zhu J.

This antibody utilized a VH gene derived from VH1-2 and neutralized 78% of HIV-1 strains (Figure S1 and Table S1). Altogether, we identified four potent and broadly neutralizing CD4bs antibodies, two of which were derived from VH genes not previously observed in effective CD4bs antibodies. To define the structural modes of antibody recognition, we produced antigen-binding fragments (Fab) and crystallized these in complex with extended core versions of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein (Kwon et al., 2012Kwon Y.D.

These eight new structures (Figure 1 and Table S2) from seven distinct B cell lineages nearly double the number of lineages with structurally defined CD4bs antibody-gp120 complex structures (Table S3). Structures of HIV-1 gp120 with antibodies from VH1-2 germline (VRC18 and VRC27) or from VH1-46 germline (1B2530, 8ANC131, and 8ANC134) revealed antibody interfaces dominated by the heavy-chain second complementarity determining region (CDR H2) (Figure 2A). This “type,” or mode, of recognition for both VH1-2- and VH1-46-derived antibodies was very similar, although the binding angles of VH1-46-derived antibodies relative to that of CD4 for 8ANC131 and 8ANC134 were on the outskirts of the strict confines of the VH1-2-derived antibodies (Figure 2B). By contrast, structures of antibodies from germlines other than VH1-2 or VH1-46 (VRC13, VRC16, and HJ16) revealed antibody interfaces dominated by CDR H3, which in each case contributed ∼75% of the heavy-chain interface (Figure 2A and Table S4). Overall, structural analysis revealed broadly neutralizing CD4bs antibodies to fall into two distinct types—CDR H3-dominated or VH-gene-restricted—and also provided characteristic features for each type of antibody recognition (Table S3). Despite type-specific features, gp120-binding orientations of the eight newly defined antibodies were similar to each other and to previously determined structures from eight donors (Georgiev et al., 2013Georgiev I.S.

For the 15 unique broadly neutralizing CD4bs lineages, the heavy chain comprised the major interactive component (77% ± 10% of the interface). For all 15, the light chain was oriented toward the viral membrane (Figures 2D and S2). Antibodies targeting the CD4bs were constrained geometrically both in latitudinal accessibility, which defines freedom between viral and host cell membranes, and in longitudinal accessibility, which defines freedom within the plane of the membrane (relative to the viral spike, the latitudinal axis is perpendicular to the trimer axis, and the longitudinal axis is parallel to this axis). While the VH-gene-restricted antibodies clustered with similar latitudinal angles, the four antibodies of the CDR H3-dominated type each showed latitudes, which were similar to that of CD4 (Figure 2C, left and upper-right panels). The constraint in longitude was also pronounced (Figure 2C, middle and lower-right panels), with most longitudes within 20°. Overall, the restriction in binding orientation appeared to be substantially greater than observed with antibodies against model antigens such as hen-egg white lysozyme (Braden et al., 1994Braden B.C.

https://openalex.org/W2166500841,"Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is the most abundant omega-3 fatty acid in brain, and, although it is considered essential, deficiency has not been linked to disease. Despite the large mass of DHA in phospholipids, the brain does not synthesize it. DHA is imported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (MFSD2A) protein. MFSD2A transports DHA as well as other fatty acids in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). We identify two families displaying MFSD2A mutations in conserved residues. Affected individuals exhibited a lethal microcephaly syndrome linked to inadequate uptake of LPC lipids. The MFSD2A mutations impaired transport activity in a cell-based assay. Moreover, when expressed in mfsd2aa-morphant zebrafish, mutants failed to rescue microcephaly, BBB breakdown and lethality. Our results establish a link between transport of DHA and LPCs by MFSD2A and human brain growth and function, presenting the first evidence of monogenic disease related to transport of DHA in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1533589220,"Neurodevelopmental disorders are frequently associated with synaptic dysfunction. Recent genome-wide association studies associate the gene encoding microRNA-137 with an increased risk for schizophrenia. Using mouse and human models, the authors show that dysregulation of this miRNA leads to presynaptic defects and, consequently, to impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunction. Noncoding variants in the human MIR137 gene locus increase schizophrenia risk with genome-wide significance. However, the functional consequence of these risk alleles is unknown. Here we examined induced human neurons harboring the minor alleles of four disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in MIR137. We observed increased MIR137 levels compared to those in major allele–carrying cells. microRNA-137 gain of function caused downregulation of the presynaptic target genes complexin-1 (Cplx1), Nsf and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), leading to impaired vesicle release. In vivo, miR-137 gain of function resulted in changes in synaptic vesicle pool distribution, impaired induction of mossy fiber long-term potentiation and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. By sequestering endogenous miR-137, we were able to ameliorate the synaptic phenotypes. Moreover, reinstatement of Syt1 expression partially restored synaptic plasticity, demonstrating the importance of Syt1 as a miR-137 target. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism by which miR-137 dysregulation can impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."

Many therapeutic strategies to treat cardiovascular disease are being investigated, including human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which can produce a variety of cell types and which are a potential cell source for transplantation therapy, drug efficiency evaluation, and toxicology testing (Garbern and Lee, 2013Garbern J.C.

In particular, the transplantation of cardiomyocytes derived from hPSCs is a promising strategy for reconstructing damaged myocardium.

Therefore, the purification of distinct target cells, such as cardiomyocytes, is an important step for safe and controllable cell therapy. However, many types of cells, including cardiomyocytes, have no specific cell surface markers that facilitate their identification, thus hindering the clinical applications of hPSC-derived cells. To overcome this problem, several methods have been devised for purifying hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

Some of these methods, such as those that require genetic modification, are likely inappropriate for transplantation therapy. Although cell sorting using antibodies should initially enable enrichment of cardiomyocytes, markers such as SIRPA and VCAM1 are expressed in other cell types (Dubois et al., 2011Dubois N.C. Craft A.M. Sharma P. Elliott D.A. Stanley E.G. Elefanty A.G. Gramolini A. Keller G. SIRPA is a specific cell-surface marker for isolating cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat.

This potential non-specificity could cause contamination by non-cardiomyocytes, affecting the efficacy of the transplantation. Moreover, antibodies on the surface of transplanted cells may be immunogenic and cause local inflammation or graft failure. Therefore, we investigated an alternative purification method that is based on detecting and distinguishing microRNA (miRNA) activities in living target cells from non-target cells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that downregulate gene expression by translational repression or mRNA cleavage (Figure 1A).

However, DNA-based circuits have the potential risk of genome incorporation. To avoid potential genomic damage, modified mRNAs (modRNAs) have been used to reprogram human somatic cells into hPSCs (Warren et al., 2010Warren L. Manos P.D. Ahfeldt T. Loh Y.H. Li H. Lau F. Ebina W. Mandal P.K. Smith Z.D. Meissner A. et al.Highly efficient reprogramming to pluripotency and directed differentiation of human cells with synthetic modified mRNA.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 618-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). The in vivo injection of a modRNA into an ischemic heart also improved cardiac function and long-term survival (Zangi et al., 2013Zangi L. Lui K.O. von Gise A. Ma Q. Ebina W. Ptaszek L.M. Später D. Xu H. Tabebordbar M. Gorbatov R. et al.Modified mRNA directs the fate of heart progenitor cells and induces vascular regeneration after myocardial infarction.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the use of a miRNA-responsive, synthetic modRNA switch (miRNA switch) could enable better purification of desired cell types differentiated from hPSCs in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and safety (Figures 1A and 1B). The miRNA switches were designed such that their translation level was dependent on the target miRNA activity. We also found that the selective induction of apoptosis in non-target cells triggered by the miR-Bim-switch autonomously purified cardiomyocytes without cell sorting, a process that may damage cells. Furthermore, the corresponding miRNA switches efficiently purified endothelial cells, hepatocytes and INSULIN-producing cells differentiated from hPSCs. Thus, this miRNA switch technology could be useful to purify desired cell types for future therapeutic applications and regenerative medicine. We first designed and evaluated the function of miRNA switches in cells from the human HeLa cell line. We initially designed two reporter mRNAs that contained a miRNA target sequence that is completely complementary to the miRNA at either the 5′ UTR or the 3′ UTR based on miRBase 19 (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011Kozomara A. Griffiths-Jones S. miRBase: integrating microRNA annotation and deep-sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D152-D157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). The antisense sequence for a particular miRNA was present as either a single copy or four copies in the 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR of the mRNA, respectively (Figure 1C). To compare the sensitivities in detecting the activity of endogenous miRNA for these two miRNA switch types, we designed both types to be responsive to miR-21-5p and miR-17-5p (both of which are active in HeLa cells) and transfected each mRNA into the cells (Figure 1D). In the absence of an inhibitor for the particular miRNA, the translation efficiency of the reporter EGFP was lower when the antisense sequence was incorporated upstream (5′ UTR) of the ORF than downstream (3′ UTR) of the ORF (Figure 1D, gray bars). The EGFP production level was readily recovered in the presence of the corresponding inhibitor (Figure 1D, red bars). These results indicate that transferred mRNA with a single target site in the 5′ UTR can respond to endogenous miRNAs and repress translation more effectively. Thus, we inserted a single miRNA target site in the 5′ UTR of reporter mRNA and used this product as a platform to design the miRNA switch. We investigated whether the designed miRNA switch could distinguish the HeLa cells from 293FT cells. Using EGFP-mRNA that responds to miR-21-5p (miR-21-5p-EGFP-switch), we compared the translational repression efficiency between HeLa and 293FT cells. The measured translational efficiency in HeLa cells was 17-fold lower than that in 293FT cells, indicating higher miR-21-5p activity in HeLa cells than in 293FT cells (Figure 1E, right). We performed qRT-PCR analysis and confirmed that the expression level of endogenous miR-21-5p in HeLa cells was higher than that in 293FT cells (Figure 1E, left). Next, we co-transfected both miR-21-5p-EGFP-switch and the control, i.e., humanized monomeric Kusabira-Orange 2 mRNA (hmKO2). Interestingly, we observed clearly separated HeLa and 293FT cell populations that were co-transfected with these two mRNAs (Figure 1F). The dot plot shows specific and sharp bands of two cell types in which one reporter fluorescent signal (EGFP or FL1) was in direct proportion to the other (hmKO2 or FL2). This result indicates that the ratio of the two fluorescent proteins translated from the two mRNAs is almost constant in the population of one cell type and is determined by miRNA activity, regardless of the amount of modRNA that each cell receives. This demonstrates that HeLa cells can be identified and separated from 293FT cells using our synthetic miRNA switch approach. We next investigated whether the designed miRNA switch could be used to identify and purify hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. We screened for cardiac-specific miRNAs using a hiPSC line into which a human MYH6 promoter driven-EGFP reporter cassette was integrated (MYH6-EIP4) (S.F., K.M., T.T., C.O., T. Hatani, K. Chonabayashi, M.N., I.T., A.O., M.N., T. Kimura., S.Y., and Y.Y., unpublished data). MYH6-EIP4 hiPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes using the appropriate concentrations of Activin A and BMP4 (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). EGFP-positive (EGFP+) cells appeared from day 8 (Figure S1A), and most of the sorted EGFP+ cells at day 8 and day 20 expressed the cardiac isoform of Troponin T (cTNT), a cardiomyocyte-specific marker (Figure S1B). To select for cardiomyocyte-specific miRNA candidates, we compared the expression profiles of miRNA between EGFP+ cardiomyocytes and EGFP- non-cardiomyocytes derived from the MYH6-EIP4 iPSC line at day 8 and day 20. We identified differentially expressed miRNAs at day 8 (28 candidates) and day 20 (81 candidates; fold change >4). Among them, 14 miRNAs were shared between the day 8 and day 20 differentially expressed miRNA groups (Figures 2A–2C). Accordingly, we synthesized 14 miRNA switches that included the sequence of blue fluorescent protein (BFP) as a reporter (miR-BFP-switch). To evaluate the function of these miR-BFP switches, we individually transfected the switches with control EGFP mRNA into differentiated cells, including hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (201B7 cell line (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14964) Google Scholar), day 19 of differentiation). Interestingly, we found that BFP signals translated from three miRNA (miR-1, miR-208a, and miR-499a-5p) switches clearly separated the cells into two populations within a heterogeneous starting population (Figure 2D), whereas the signal from control BFP mRNA did not, indicating that miR-1-, miR-208a-, and miR-499a-5p-switches repressed BFP translation by interacting with the corresponding miRNAs expressed in the cardiomyocytes. Additionally, miR-143-3p-, miR-490-3p-, and miR-490-5p-switches did not clearly separate the cells into two subpopulations. The other eight miRNA switches did not significantly repress BFP signals compared with control BFP mRNA. Thus, we focused on miR-1-, miR-208a-, and miR-499a-5p-switches as candidates for the purification of cardiomyocytes. To investigate whether miRNA switches could purify hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we collected separated cells with repressed BFP signals (gated cells are enclosed by the red solid line in Figure 2D) by cell sorting on day 20 and analyzed cTNT expression by flow cytometric analysis (Figure S2A). Most of the sorted cells with miR-1-, miR-208a- and miR-499a-5p-switches were cTNT-positive cells (cTNT+; miR-1, 95.73% ± 1.44%; miR-208a, 96.17% ± 1.29%; miR-499a-5p, 95.5% ± 2.28%), whereas those cells sorted with miR-143-3p-switch showed a lower percentage of cTNT+ cells (30.07% ± 10.57%), similar to cells sorted with the deficient miR-490-3p-switch (27.40% ± 9.32%) and to control cells without sorting (24.43% ± 2.16%; Figure 3A and Figure S2A). To compare the purification efficiencies with existing methods, we purified cardiomyocytes from 201B7-derived differentiated cells on day 20 using the cardiac-specific surface marker SIRPA+ LIN− (CD31, CD49a, CD90, and CD140b) (Dubois et al., 2011Dubois N.C. Craft A.M. Sharma P. Elliott D.A. Stanley E.G. Elefanty A.G. Gramolini A. Keller G. SIRPA is a specific cell-surface marker for isolating cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) or VCAM1+ (Uosaki et al., 2011Uosaki H. Fukushima H. Takeuchi A. Matsuoka S. Nakatsuji N. Yamanaka S. Yamashita J.K. Efficient and scalable purification of cardiomyocytes from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells by VCAM1 surface expression.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e23657Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Figures S2B and S2C). The percentages of cTNT+ cardiomyocytes in SIRPA+ LIN− and VCAM1+ cells were 75.27% ± 13.09% and 49.33% ± 4.76%, respectively, indicating that miRNA switches can purify cTNT+ cells more efficiently (Figure 3A). We also compared the false negative rate of the isolation method by sorting the unreacted cells using either miRNA switches or antibodies (SIRPA and VCAM1) to collect a non-targeted cell population (negative fraction). The proportions of cTNT+ cardiomyocytes in the negative fraction were 7.95% ± 2.24% (miR-1), 8.85% ± 5.10% (miR-208), 17.96% ± 10.99% (miR-499a-5p), 11.40% ± 6.32% (SIRPA+ LIN−), and 21.25% ± 6.76% (VCAM1+). In the case of miRNA switches, most of cTNT+ cells in the negative fraction showed no EGFP expression, indicating that these cTNT+ cells were mRNA non-transfected cells (Figure S2D). In addition, hierarchical clustering of the cells sorted by these purification methods demonstrated that the gene expression profiles of miR-208a-switch-sorted cells are similar to MYH-EIP4 EGFP+- or the antibody-sorted cells (Figure S2E). These results verified that the miRNA switches isolated cTNT+ cardiomyocytes with high accuracy and efficiency. To investigate whether the three miRNA switches could detect and purify cardiomyocytes derived from other hPSC lines, we analyzed differentiated cells from three different hiPSC lines (409B2, 606A1, and 947A2) and from one hESC line (KhES1). We analyzed the percentages of cTNT+ cells after sorting the differentiated cells from each of the four hPSC lines using the following three purification approaches: repressed and unrepressed (negative fraction) BFP signals in the miRNA switch-transfected cells, the SIRPA+ LIN− cells, and the VCAM1+ cells. All three miRNA switches showed high purification efficiencies (more than 95%) for all four hPSC lines (Figure 3B and Table S1), whereas the proportion of cTNT+ cells sorted by SIRPA+ LIN− or VCAM1+ cells ranged between 60% and 85%. Immunocytochemistry of the cardiomyocytes purified using miR-1-, miR-208a-, and miR-499a-5p-switches confirmed that most of the sorted cells were positive for cTNT (Figure 3C, top), while the cells in each negative fraction contained a small number of cTNT+ cells (Figure 3C, bottom), most of which were considered non-transfected cells. These results indicate that the miRNA switches have high efficiency and robustness for the purification of cardiomyocytes. To further determine whether miR-1-, miR-208a-, and miR-499a-5p-switches isolate cardiomyocytes during the early phase of cardiomyocyte differentiation, we transfected the miRNA switches into differentiated cells on day 8 instead of day 20, and the cTNT analysis was performed 1 day later (day 9). The miR-208a-switch efficiently purified cTNT+ cardiomyocytes (>95%), whereas miR-1-switch had poor separation and sorting purity (Figure 3D and Figure S3A). miR-499a-5p-switch did not react to day 8 differentiated cells (Figure S3A). When sorting SIRPA+ LIN− cells at day 9, cTNT+ cardiomyocytes were modestly enriched in a manner similar to miR-1-switch sorting, and VCAM1+ cells were not detected in day 9 differentiated cells (Figure 3D and Figure S3A). Taken together, miR-208a-switch had the best performance, isolating even primitive cTNT+ cardiomyocytes with high accuracy. As a representative miRNA switch to purify cardiomyocytes, we further focused on the effect of miR-1-switch and evaluated the corresponding purified cardiomyocytes. We analyzed the gene expression levels and electrophysiological state of the miR-1-switch-sorted cells. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the sorted cells showed significantly higher expression of cardiac markers (MYH6, MYH7, MYL2, MYL7, TNNT2, NKX2.5, and TBX5) and lower expression of non-cardiomyocyte markers (PECAM1, THY1, and PDGFR-beta) compared with negative fraction cells and unsorted cells (Figure S3B). In addition, action potential recordings detected both ventricular-like and atrial-like waveforms in the purified cardiomyocytes (Figure S3C). To assess any possible side effects of the reporter mRNA and miR-1-switch transfection on cardiomyocytes, we analyzed residual levels of the mRNA and protein in EGFP+ cardiomyocytes derived from MYH6-EIP4 hiPSCs. After the transfection of BFP mRNA, the expression level of BFP proteins from modRNA reached a plateau between 12-24 hr and decreased to near background levels in 7 days (Figure 3E). We also analyzed residual EGFP mRNA levels in miR-1-switch-sorted cardiomyocytes derived from 201B7 cells using qRT-PCR and found that transfected mRNAs were immediately degraded within 48 hr (Figure 3F). Next, we investigated whether the transfected miR-1-switch (miR-208a- and miR-499a-5p-switches) could deplete the endogenous miR-1 (miR-208a and miR-499a-5p) in MYH6-EGFP-sorted cardiomyocytes. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the total amount of endogenous miR-1 (miR-208a and miR-499a-5p) underwent only minimal changes between cardiomyocytes before and 24 hr after transfection (Figure 3G) and between cardiomyocytes with and without transfection of the corresponding switches (Figures 3G and S3D). In addition, we investigated whether miR-1-switch transfection affected global gene expression patterns, including those of miR-1 target genes. We performed microarray analysis, and the hierarchical clustering of all genes and miR-1-target genes revealed that the expression profiles of miR-1-switch-transfected cells were similar to non-transfected cells at both one day (day 19) and 7 days (day 25) after transfection (Figure 3H). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis of GATA4 and HAND2, which are known target cardiac genes of miR-1, showed that no significant differences were observed between transfected and non-transfected cells at 24 hr and 72 hr after transfection (Figure S3E). Therefore, miR-1-switch had no significant side effects and maintained normal gene expression profiles in cardiomyocytes. One of the merits when using miRNA switches is the versatility of the ORF used in the mRNA sequence. For example, we could incorporate a desired transgene into the miRNA switches to control the cell phenotype based on miRNA activity. Thus, we investigated whether miR-Bim-switch, which regulates selective cell death, could be employed to concentrate cardiomyocytes from heterogeneous cell populations without cell sorting. Both miR-1- and miR-208a-Bim-switches were constructed; these switches were designed to induce apoptosis selectively in cells other than cardiomyocytes (Figure 4A). To select for the transfected cells, we simultaneously transfected puromycin resistance mRNA (puror-mRNA), which triggered the death of non-transfected cells when culturing in the presence of puromycin (Figure 4A). First, we optimized the concentrations of puromycin and puror-mRNA (Figures S4A and S4B) and then transfected miR-1- or miR-208-switches with puror-mRNA into hPSC-derived cells. Importantly, miR-1- and miR-208a-Bim-switches enabled the highly specific purification of cTNT+ cardiomyocytes without cell sorting (Figure 4B). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that almost all of the surviving cells expressed cTNT proteins (Figure 4C). The recovered proportions of 201B7-, 409B2-, and KhES1-derived cardiomyocytes under 75 ng/ml miR-208a-Bim conditions were 90.0% ± 7.9%, 90.5% ± 2.5%, and 89.0% ± 4.1%, respectively (Figure 4D). These recovery yields were higher than the transfection efficiency (Figure 3E) probably because of the efficient proliferation of the surviving cardiomyocytes. Activating cell death by Bim induction may have potentially harmful side effects on the surviving cardiomyocytes. We therefore investigated the hierarchical clustering of cell death pathway-related genes and revealed that the expression profiles of miR-208a-Bim-switch-transfected cardiomyocytes were similar to non-transfected cardiomyocytes at one day (day 19), 3 days (day 21), and 7 days (day 25) after transfection, indicating negligible harmful side effects of miR-Bim-switch transfection on the surviving cardiomyocytes (F"

Some patients, however, present with and succumb to locally destructive disease. A molecular understanding of these distinct disease manifestations can critically inform patient management. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we show that heterozygous mutation of Dpc4/Smad4 attenuates the metastatic potential of Kras(G12D/+);Trp53(R172H/+) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas while increasing their proliferation. Subsequent loss of heterozygosity of Dpc4 restores metastatic competency while further unleashing proliferation, creating a highly lethal combination. Expression levels of Runx3 respond to and combine with Dpc4 status to coordinately regulate the balance between cancer cell division and dissemination. Thus, Runx3 serves as both a tumor suppressor and promoter in slowing proliferation while orchestrating a metastatic program to stimulate cell migration, invasion, and secretion of proteins that favor distant colonization. These findings suggest a model to anticipate likely disease behaviors in patients and tailor treatment strategies accordingly."

These results will aid development of replication inhibitors of diverse, serious human pathogenic viruses. Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae, the principal families of segmented negative single-stranded RNA viruses (sNSV), each include serious human pathogens such as Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, and influenza viruses, respectively. Orthomyxoviruses have six to eight genome segments, whereas Bunyaviridae (reviewed in Elliott, 2014Elliott R.M. Orthobunyaviruses: recent genetic and structural insights.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have three, and Arenaviridae two. For each segment, transcription, generating capped viral mRNAs, and replication, generating full-length genome or antigenome copies (vRNA and cRNA, respectively), are performed by the same virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). For arena- and bunyaviruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm, the RdRp is the single-chain L protein, whereas for orthomyxoviruses, which replicate in the nucleus, it is a hetero-trimeric complex, formed by the PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits (Fodor, 2013Fodor E.

Cusack S. Kolakofsky D. Segmented negative strand RNA virus nucleoprotein structure.Curr Opin Virol. 2014; 5: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). sNSV polymerases have two unique features. First, they perform transcription by the “cap-snatching” mechanism, whereby short 5′ capped RNA fragments are cleaved from host cell mRNA by an endonuclease intrinsic to the RdRp and then used to prime synthesis of viral mRNAs (Morin et al., 2010Morin B.

Structural insight into cap-snatching and RNA synthesis by influenza polymerase.Nature. 2014; 516: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Second, they recognize each genome segment via their highly conserved, quasi-complementary 3′ and 5′ extremities (over a length of 13–19 nucleotides), known as the promoter (Barr and Wertz, 2004Barr J.N. Wertz G.W. Bunyamwera bunyavirus RNA synthesis requires cooperation of 3′- and 5′-terminal sequences.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Correlated with this, sNSV RNPs are generally circularized, which is thought to occur by base pairing between the genome ends (forming a double-stranded “panhandle”) and/or the simultaneous binding of both ends to the polymerase (Reguera et al., 2014Reguera J. Cusack S. Kolakofsky D. Segmented negative strand RNA virus nucleoprotein structure.Curr Opin Virol. 2014; 5: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). vRNA promoter binding to influenza polymerase was visualized recently for the first time in a co-crystal structure. This revealed that each vRNA extremity binds sequence specifically as a single strand to distinct sites on the polymerase but then come together to form a short duplex of about four base pairs (Pflug et al., 2014Pflug A. Guilligay D. Reich S. Cusack S. Structure of influenza A polymerase bound to the viral RNA promoter.Nature. 2014; 516: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this mode of promoter binding is required for activation of diverse influenza polymerase functions (Fodor, 2013Fodor E. The RNA polymerase of influenza a virus: mechanisms of viral transcription and replication.Acta Virol. 2013; 57: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For bunyaviruses, exact self-complementarity of the genome ends extends for 15–19 nts (except for only one G-U mismatch in the case of orthobunyaviruses [Barr and Wertz, 2004Barr J.N. Wertz G.W. Bunyamwera bunyavirus RNA synthesis requires cooperation of 3′- and 5′-terminal sequences.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Kohl et al., 2004Kohl A. Dunn E.F.

Virol. 2004; 85: 3269-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar]), potentially allowing formation of a much more stable panhandle than for influenza vRNA. However, the exact nature of the vRNA-vRNA and vRNA-L interactions that circularize bunyavirus RNPs are not known. Cross linking suggests that the vRNA ends within bunyavirus RNPs are base paired at least partially (Raju and Kolakofsky, 1989Raju R. Kolakofsky D. The ends of La Crosse virus genome and antigenome RNAs within nucleocapsids are base paired.J.

Virol. 1994; 75: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), between Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae L proteins and Orthomyxoviridae heteotrimeric polymerases also poses the question as to whether all sNSV have a structurally and evolutionary conserved architecture to match their functional similarity. To answer this question and those related to promoter binding, we determined the crystal structure of 77% of the L protein from La Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) in complex with just the 3′ or both 3′ and 5′ conserved genomic RNA ends and the cryo-EM structure of the apo-form. LACV is a potentially serious but rare, mosquito-transmitted human pathogen that causes 50–100 cases of encephalitis per year in the USA (http://www.cdc.gov/lac/) (Elliott, 2014Elliott R.M.

The structure reveals high similarity, but also interesting differences, to the equivalent influenza complex (Pflug et al., 2014Pflug A. Guilligay D. Reich S. Cusack S.

In particular, it shows the structural basis of the specific recognition of the vRNA 3′ end, the allosteric regulation mediated by vRNA 5′ end binding, and the likely path of the template into the polymerase active site cavity and out again. These findings, combined with those gained from the influenza polymerase structures, provide new insight into the common mechanism of action, the conserved features, and the diversity among sNSV polymerases. L1750, a construct comprising residues 1–1750 (out of 2263) of the LACV L protein, was expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity in milligram amounts (Figure S1A, Figures S2A and S2B). In vitro RNA-protein interaction experiments show that the separated single stranded LACV genomic extremities each bind with high affinity and specificity to the polymerase with dissociation constants of 13.8 ± 2.6 nM and 9.3 ± 1.6 nM for the 5′ and the 3′ ends, respectively, whereas the polymerase only has low affinity (∼1.5 μM) for the pre-annealed double stranded panhandle (Figure S3A). However, as shown by mobility shift assays, the polymerase still binds with high affinity to partially double stranded 3′ vRNA provided the first eight nucleotides from the 3′ end are single stranded (Figure S3B). Similar conclusions were previously found for Machupo arenavirus polymerase (Kranzusch et al., 2010Kranzusch P.J. Schenk A.D. Rahmeh A.A. Radoshitzky S.R. Bavari S. Walz T. Whelan S.P. Assembly of a functional Machupo virus polymerase complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 20069-20074Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using these results, co-crystals of L1750 diffracting up to 2.6 Å resolution were obtained with nucleotides 1–16 of the genomic 3′ vRNA (3′OH-UCAUCACAUGAUGGUU), to which was annealed a complementary 8-mer (5′OH-GCUACCAA), corresponding to nucleotides 9–16 from the 5′ vRNA extremity. The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (Figures S1B–S1D). Soaking the first 10 nucleotides of the 5′ vRNA (5′p-AGUAGUGUGC) into the crystals gave a new structure at 3.0 Å resolution that revealed the 5′ end in a distinct binding site. Crystallographic statistics are given in Table S1 and a sequence alignment of representative orthobunyavirus polymerases, annotated with the secondary structure, is shown in Data S1. The L1750 model contains 1652 residues (94.4% complete) with several connecting loops missing, some of which become ordered upon 5′ vRNA binding (Figure 1, Data S1). The structure of apo-L1750 was determined from cryo-EM images by single particle 3D reconstruction at 8.3 Å resolution and allows visualization of secondary structure elements in most of the protein (Figure 2, Figure S2).Figure S2Electron Microscopy of Apo-L1750, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Negative stain EM micrograph of purified L1750.

https://openalex.org/W1813348106,"Pain perception has evolved as a warning mechanism to alert organisms to tissue damage and dangerous environments. In humans, however, undesirable, excessive or chronic pain is a common and major societal burden for which available medical treatments are currently suboptimal. New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis. We determined that Prdm12 is expressed in nociceptors and their progenitors and participates in the development of sensory neurons in Xenopus embryos. Moreover, CIP-associated mutants abrogate the histone-modifying potential associated with wild-type Prdm12. Prdm12 emerges as a key factor in the orchestration of sensory neurogenesis and may hold promise as a target for new pain therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W363554780,"Interdisciplinary research is increasingly recognized as the solution to today's challenging scientific and societal problems, but the relationship between interdisciplinary research and scientific impact is still unclear. This paper studies the association between the degree of interdisciplinarity and the number of citations at the paper level. Different from previous studies compositing various aspects of interdisciplinarity into a single indicator, we use factor analysis to uncover distinct dimensions of interdisciplinarity corresponding to variety, balance, and disparity. We estimate Poisson models with journal fixed effects and robust standard errors to analyze the divergent relationships between these three factors and citations. We find that long-term (13-year) citations (1) increase at an increasing rate with variety, (2) decrease with balance, and (3) increase at a decreasing rate with disparity. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity also affects the process of citation accumulation: (1) although variety and disparity have positive effects on long-term citations, they have negative effects on short-term (3-year) citations, and (2) although balance has a negative effect on long-term citations, its negative effect is insignificant in the short run. These findings have important implications for interdisciplinary research and science policy."
https://openalex.org/W1496487857,"Coordination of stem cell activity with inflammatory responses is critical for regeneration and homeostasis of barrier epithelia. The temporal sequence of cell interactions during injury-induced regeneration is only beginning to be understood. Here we show that intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are regulated by macrophage-like haemocytes during the early phase of regenerative responses of the Drosophila intestinal epithelium. On tissue damage, haemocytes are recruited to the intestine and secrete the BMP homologue DPP, inducing ISC proliferation by activating the type I receptor Saxophone and the Smad homologue SMOX. Activated ISCs then switch their response to DPP by inducing expression of Thickveins, a second type I receptor that has previously been shown to re-establish ISC quiescence by activating MAD. The interaction between haemocytes and ISCs promotes infection resistance, but also contributes to the development of intestinal dysplasia in ageing flies. We propose that similar interactions influence pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1538241732,"Genetic epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases are two common neurological disorders that are conventionally viewed as being unrelated. A subset of patients with severe genetic epilepsies who have impaired development and often go on to die of their disease respond poorly to anticonvulsant drug therapy, suggesting a need for new therapeutic targets. Previously, we reported that multiple GABAA receptor epilepsy mutations result in protein misfolding and abnormal receptor trafficking. We have now developed a model of a severe human genetic epileptic encephalopathy, the Gabrg2(+/Q390X) knock-in mouse. We found that, in addition to impairing inhibitory neurotransmission, mutant GABAA receptor γ2(Q390X) subunits accumulated and aggregated intracellularly, activated caspase 3 and caused widespread, age-dependent neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that the fundamental protein metabolism and cellular consequences of the epilepsy-associated mutant γ2(Q390X) ion channel subunit are not fundamentally different from those associated with neurodegeneration. Our results have far-reaching relevance for the identification of conserved pathological cascades and mechanism-based therapies that are shared between genetic epilepsies and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2119717274,"Cyclophilin A, secreted by bone marrow endothelial cells, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloma cells, which helps explain their homing to the bone marrow and suggests a potential new therapeutic strategy. B cell malignancies frequently colonize the bone marrow. The mechanisms responsible for this preferential homing are incompletely understood. Here we studied multiple myeloma (MM) as a model of a terminally differentiated B cell malignancy that selectively colonizes the bone marrow. We found that extracellular CyPA (eCyPA), secreted by bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs), promoted the colonization and proliferation of MM cells in an in vivo scaffold system via binding to its receptor, CD147, on MM cells. The expression and secretion of eCyPA by BMECs was enhanced by BCL9, a Wnt–β-catenin transcriptional coactivator that is selectively expressed by these cells. eCyPA levels were higher in bone marrow serum than in peripheral blood in individuals with MM, and eCyPA-CD147 blockade suppressed MM colonization and tumor growth in the in vivo scaffold system. eCyPA also promoted the migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells, two other B cell malignancies that colonize the bone marrow and express CD147. These findings suggest that eCyPA-CD147 signaling promotes the bone marrow homing of B cell malignancies and offer a compelling rationale for exploring this axis as a therapeutic target for these malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W390434406,"Androgenetic alopecia, known in men as male pattern baldness (MPB), is a very conspicuous condition that is particularly frequent among European men and thus contributes markedly to variation in physical appearance traits amongst Europeans. Recent studies have revealed multiple genes and polymorphisms to be associated with susceptibility to MPB. In this study, 50 candidate SNPs for androgenetic alopecia were analyzed in order to verify their potential to predict MPB. Significant associations were confirmed for 29 SNPs from chromosomes X, 1, 5, 7, 18 and 20. A simple 5-SNP prediction model and an extended 20-SNP model were developed based on a discovery panel of 305 males from various European populations fitting one of two distinct phenotype categories. The first category consisted of men below 50 years of age with significant baldness and the second; men aged 50 years or older lacking baldness. The simple model comprised the five best predictors: rs5919324 near AR, rs1998076 in the 20p11 region, rs929626 in EBF1, rs12565727 in TARDBP and rs756853 in HDAC9. The extended prediction model added 15 SNPs from five genomic regions that improved overall prevalence-adjusted predictive accuracy measured by area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUC). Both models were evaluated for predictive accuracy using a test set of 300 males reflecting the general European population. Applying a 65% probability threshold, high prediction sensitivity of 87.1% but low specificity of 42.4% was obtained in men aged <50 years. In men aged ≥50, prediction sensitivity was slightly lower at 67.7% while specificity reached 90%. Overall, the AUC=0.761 calculated for men at or above 50 years of age indicates these SNPs offer considerable potential for the application of genetic tests to predict MPB patterns, adding a highly informative predictive system to the emerging field of forensic analysis of externally visible characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1495352559,"The character of EGFR signals can influence cell fate but mechanistic insights into intestinal EGFR-Ras signalling are limited. Here we show that two distinct Ras nucleotide exchange factors, RasGRP1 and SOS1, lie downstream of EGFR but act in functional opposition. RasGRP1 is expressed in intestinal crypts where it restricts epithelial growth. High RasGRP1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) patient samples correlates with a better clinical outcome. Biochemically, we find that RasGRP1 creates a negative feedback loop that limits proliferative EGFR-SOS1-Ras signals in CRC cells. Genetic Rasgrp1 depletion from mice with either an activating mutation in KRas or with aberrant Wnt signalling due to a mutation in Apc resulted in both cases in exacerbated Ras-ERK signalling and cell proliferation. The unexpected opposing cell biological effects of EGFR-RasGRP1 and EGFR-SOS1 signals in the same cell shed light on the intricacy of EGFR-Ras signalling in normal epithelium and carcinoma."

In this article we present the START-Register and give cross section baseline data focusing on non valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Participants are asked to insert prospectively consecutive patients recorded as electronic file on the web-site of the registry. Required data are: demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, associated risk factors for stroke and bleeding, laboratory routine data, clinical indication for treatment, expected therapeutic range (in cases of treatment with vitamin K antagonists -VKAs). The follow-up is carried out to record: quality of treatment (for patients on VKAs), bleeding complications, thrombotic events, and the onset of any type of associated disease. To date 5252 patients have been enrolled; 97.6% were on VKAs because direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been available in Italy only recently. The median age was 74 years [interquartile range (IQR) 64-80]; males 53.7%. This analysis is focused on the 3209 (61.1%) NVAF patients. Mean CHADS2 score was 2.1±1.1, CHADSVASc score was 3.1±1.3;median age was 76 years (IQR 70-81); 168 patients (5.3%) had severe renal failure [Creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 ml/min]. Moderate renal failure (CrCl 30-59 ml/min) was found in 1265 patients (39.5%).

https://openalex.org/W331533279,"Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4H-I, C-P4H-II, and C-P4H-III) catalyze formation of 4-hydroxyproline residues required to form triple-helical collagen molecules. Vertebrate C-P4Hs are α2β2 tetramers differing in their catalytic α subunits. C-P4H-I is the major isoenzyme in most cells, and inactivation of its catalytic subunit (P4ha1−/−) leads to embryonic lethality in mouse, whereas P4ha1+/− mice have no abnormalities. To study the role of C-P4H-II, which predominates in chondrocytes, we generated P4ha2−/− mice. Surprisingly, they had no apparent phenotypic abnormalities. To assess possible functional complementarity, we established P4ha1+/−;P4ha2−/− mice. They were smaller than their littermates, had moderate chondrodysplasia, and developed kyphosis. A transient inner cell death phenotype was detected in their developing growth plates. The columnar arrangement of proliferative chondrocytes was impaired, the amount of 4-hydroxyproline and the Tm of collagen II were reduced, and the extracellular matrix was softer in the growth plates of newborn P4ha1+/−;P4ha2−/− mice. No signs of uncompensated ER stress were detected in the mutant growth plate chondrocytes. Some of these defects were also found in P4ha2−/− mice, although in a much milder form. Our data show that C-P4H-I can to a large extent compensate for the lack of C-P4H-II in proper endochondral bone development, but their combined partial and complete inactivation, respectively, leads to biomechanically impaired extracellular matrix, moderate chondrodysplasia, and kyphosis. Our mouse data suggest that inactivating mutations in human P4HA2 are not likely to lead to skeletal disorders, and a simultaneous decrease in P4HA1 function would most probably be required to generate such a disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1422075380,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable connective tissue disease characterized by bone fragility and increased risk of fractures. Up to now, mutations in at least 18 genes have been associated with dominant and recessive forms of OI that affect the production or post-translational processing of procollagen or alter bone homeostasis. Among those, SERPINH1 encoding heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a chaperone exclusive for collagen folding in the ER, was identified to cause a severe form of OI in dachshunds (L326P) as well as in humans (one single case with a L78P mutation). To elucidate the disease mechanism underlying OI in the dog model, we applied a range of biochemical assays to mutant and control skin fibroblasts as well as on bone samples. These experiments revealed that type I collagen synthesized by mutant cells had decreased electrophoretic mobility. Procollagen was retained intracellularly with concomitant dilation of ER cisternae and activation of the ER stress response markers GRP78 and phospho-eIF2α, thus suggesting a defect in procollagen processing. In line with the migration shift detected on SDS-PAGE of cell culture collagen, extracts of bone collagen from the OI dog showed a similar mobility shift, and on tandem mass spectrometry, the chains were post-translationally overmodified. The bone collagen had a higher content of pyridinoline than control dog bone. We conclude that the SERPINH1 mutation in this naturally occurring model of OI impairs how HSP47 acts as a chaperone in the ER. This results in abnormal post-translational modification and cross-linking of the bone collagen.

Among those, SERPINH1 encoding heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a chaperone exclusive for collagen folding in the ER, was identified to cause a severe form of OI in dachshunds (L326P) as well as in humans (one single case with a L78P mutation). To elucidate the disease mechanism underlying OI in the dog model, we applied a range of biochemical assays to mutant and control skin fibroblasts as well as on bone samples. These experiments revealed that type I collagen synthesized by mutant cells had decreased electrophoretic mobility. Procollagen was retained intracellularly with concomitant dilation of ER cisternae and activation of the ER stress response markers GRP78 and phospho-eIF2α, thus suggesting a defect in procollagen processing. In line with the migration shift detected on SDS-PAGE of cell culture collagen, extracts of bone collagen from the OI dog showed a similar mobility shift, and on tandem mass spectrometry, the chains were post-translationally overmodified. The bone collagen had a higher content of pyridinoline than control dog bone. We conclude that the SERPINH1 mutation in this naturally occurring model of OI impairs how HSP47 acts as a chaperone in the ER. This results in abnormal post-translational modification and cross-linking of the bone collagen.

In ∼90% of individuals with the clinical diagnosis of OI, dominant mutations in the type I collagen coding genes COL1A1 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 120150) and COL1A2 (OMIM 120160) are responsible for the disorder (1Rohrbach M.

Over the last 8 years, mutations in several noncollagenous genes involved in the post-translational processing of procollagen I, in osteoblast-specific signaling, or in gene regulation have been characterized in either dominant or recessive forms of OI: CRTAP (OMIM 605497), LEPRE1 (OMIM 610339), PPIB (OMIM 123841), PLOD2 (OMIM 601865), FKBP10 (OMIM 607063), BMP1 (OMIM 112264), CREB3L1 (Entrez ID 90993), IFITM5 (OMIM 614757), PLS3 (OMIM 300131), TMEM38B (OMIM 611236), WNT1 (OMIM 164820), SP7 (OMIM 606633), SERPINF1 (OMIM 172860), SERPINH1 (OMIM 600943) (2Van Dijk F.S.

Type I collagen, the major extracellular matrix component of bone, is a triple helical molecule composed of two pro-α1(I) chains and one pro-α2(I) chain, encoded by COL1A1 and COL1A2, respectively. In the rough ER, folding of the three pro-α chains into a triple helix begins at their C-terminal end and proceeds in a zipper-like fashion toward the N-propeptide (5Engel J. Prockop D.J. The zipper-like folding of collagen triple helices and the effects of mutations that disrupt the zipper.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To allow for the folding of procollagen chains into the triple helix, modifying enzymes such as prolyl hydroxylases and several ER chaperones are needed (6Lamandé S.R. Bateman J.F.

Among them, HSP47 encoded by SERPINH1 acts as a collagen-specific chaperone (7Nagata K. Hsp47: a collagen-specific molecular chaperone.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) that preferentially binds the folded triple helix, thus stabilizing the structure (8Makareeva E. Leikin S.

In the Golgi, the pH drop releases bound HSP47, which is recycled back to the ER by its C-terminal RDEL sequence (13Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K.

In dachshunds, a p.L326P mutation in HSP47 was found to cause a severe recessive form of OI characterized by marked osteopenia, thin bones with inhomogeneous and shallow trabeculation in the entire foreleg, joint hyperlaxity and undermineralization of the teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta) (15Drögemüller C.

A missense mutation in the SERPINH1 gene in dachshunds with osteogenesis imperfecta.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000579Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Previous clinical and histological investigations in OI dachshunds, performed before the mutation had been identified, have revealed bone fragility due to a paucity of cancellous and cortical lamellar bone (16Seeliger F. Leeb T. Peters M. Brugmann M. Fehr M. Hewicker-Trautwein M. Osteogenesis imperfecta in two litters of dachshunds.Vet. Pathol. 2003; 40: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In humans, a single case with a severe form of OI due to a homozygous missense mutation (p.L78P) rendering the HSP47 protein instable has been reported (17Christiansen H.E. Schwarze U. Pyott S.M. AlSwaid A. Al Balwi M. Alrasheed S. Pepin M.G. Weis M.A. Eyre D.R. Byers P.H. Homozygosity for a missense mutation in SERPINH1, which encodes the collagen chaperone protein HSP47, results in severe recessive osteogenesis imperfecta.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2010; 86: 389-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In mice, the knock-out of Hsp47 resulted in embryonic lethality around day 11 post-coitum, suggesting a pivotal role during development (18Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Embryonic lethality of molecular chaperone Hsp47 knockout mice is associated with defects in collagen biosynthesis.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although previous studies in humans and mice have demonstrated the importance of HSP47 for the formation of type I collagen, the underlying pathomechanism leading to OI is not well understood. Therefore, we set out to biochemically characterize this naturally occurring OI dog model, to further understand the role of HSP47 in procollagen processing and bone formation, and thereby to enhance our understanding of the pathology of OI. Primary fibroblast cultures were established from skin biopsies of an affected 10-week-old dachshund (OI) and two control dogs, a Bernese mountain dog (Contr. 1) and a 3-year-old mongrel (Contr. 2), by explant culture. Cells were grown in standard cell culture medium composed of DMEM (Gibco, 31966) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml of amphotericin B (Gibco). For steady-state analysis of collagen produced in vitro by cultured fibroblasts, the cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates (250,000 cells/well). After 24 h, the cell culture medium was replaced by serum-free minimum Eagle's medium (Gibco, 41090) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbate, 50 μg/ml catalase, 10 μCi of [2,3-3H]proline, and 10 μCi of [2-3H]glycine (PerkinElmer) for 16 h. The medium and cell layers were harvested, digested with 25 μm pepsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco) for 2 h, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 m urea. After fixation in sulfosalicylic acid/trichloroacetic acid, the gel was impregnated with 2,5-diphenyloxazole (43.4 g in 200 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide) and subjected to fluorography. For the pulse-chase analysis, fibroblasts were seeded into 3.5-cm tissue culture plates at 250,000 cells/dish, allowed to settle overnight, and then incubated in cell culture medium supplemented with 50 μm ascorbate for 24 h. The cells were pulse-labeled in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μm ascorbate, 30 μCi of [2,3-3H]proline, and 30 μCi of [2-3H]glycine for 20 min. The cells were then chased for 0, 20, 40, and 80 min in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm unlabeled proline and 2 mm unlabeled glycine. At the end of each chase, the medium and cell layers were harvested separately, digested with pepsin, and subjected to fluorography. The quantification was done using the Gel Logic 6000 PRO Imager (Carestream) and the Carestream Molecular Imaging Software. The experiment was performed twice with similar results. Fibroblasts were seeded into T75 flasks and grown to confluency. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) for 45 min on ice. For the induction of ER stress or proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with 0.5 μm thapsigargin (Sigma) for 4 h or 50 μm MG-132 (Enzo Life Sciences) for 16 h, respectively, prior to harvesting. 50 μg of protein were analyzed on a 10% SDS gel, followed by Western blot. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-HSP47 (ADI-SPA-470-D; Enzo Life Sciences) at 1:1000; rabbit anti-GRP78 (Abcam) at 1:1000; phospho-eIF2α-(Ser-51) (9721; Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000; mouse anti-actin (A1978; Sigma) at 1:3000; goat anti-mouse HRP (sc-2302; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:3000; and goat anti-rabbit HRP (sc-2301; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:3000. The blots were developed using the ECL system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and quantified using the Gel Logic 6000 PRO (Carestream) and the Carestream Molecular Imaging Software. For the calculation of standard deviations, three independent experiments were combined. Fibroblasts were split from a confluent T75 flask and seeded onto glass coverslips in 12-well tissue culture plates. After 24 h, the cells were fixed either in ice-cold methanol for 5 min (for anti-HSP47) or in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by incubation in ice-cold methanol for 1 min (for anti-Col I). Cells were washed three times in PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) and incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 10% FCS, 0.3 m glycine, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with the respective primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using SlowFade Gold antifade mountant (S36939, Molecular Probes) containing DAPI for nuclear staining. Images were taken on a fluorescence microscope (Leica HC DMIL equipped with a Leica DFC420 digital camera). Primary antibodies were: mouse anti-HSP47 (M16.10A1, ADI-SPA-470) from Enzo Life Sciences (1:100); rabbit anti-GRP78 (ab32618) from Abcam (1:100); mouse anti-collagen I (ab6308) from Abcam (1:100); and rabbit anti-GM130 (ab52649) from Abcam (1:100). Secondary antibodies were: goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (ab175471) from Abcam (1:500) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (A11017) from Molecular Probes (1:500). Fibroblasts were seeded into T75 flasks and grown to confluency (two flasks per sample). Then, the cells were washed twice in 8 ml of ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (Gibco) and fixed in 3 ml of fixation solution (3% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) for 16 h at 4 °C. The fixation solution was removed, and the cells were harvested using a rubber policeman in 1 ml of 0.1 m cacodylate buffer into 2-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was washed three times in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, post-fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in glycidether 100 (Carl Roth) (formerly Epon 812). Semithin and 70–80-nm ultrathin sections were cut with a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Zeiss EM900, equipped with a CCD camera from Troendle Restlichtverstaerker-Systeme (TRS). Stored frozen tissues from an affected dachshund pup (10 weeks old) and two control dogs (9-year-old large breed dog and 14-year-old small breed dog) were used for analysis. Mid-shaft cortical bone and skin were scraped clean and defatted with chloroform/methanol (3:1 v/v); bone was demineralized in 0.1 m HCl, and all steps were carried out at 4 °C. Collagen was solubilized from each tissue by heat denaturation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 90 °C without DTT. Demineralized bone was also extracted with pepsin in 3% acetic acid at 4 °C and then precipitated by adding NaCl to 0.8 m. The method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) was used with 6% gels for extracts of tissue collagen. Bone was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, dried, dissolved in 1% (v/v) n-heptafluorobutyric acid, and analyzed by C18 reverse-phase HPLC as described (20Eyre D. Collagen cross-linking amino acids.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Demineralized bone was digested with bacterial collagenase as described (21Hanson D.A. Eyre D.R. Molecular site specificity of pyridinoline and pyrrole cross-links in type I collagen of human bone.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and collagenase-generated peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (C8, Brownlee Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm × 25 cm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile:1-propanol (3:1 v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (22Wu J.J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. Identification of cross-linking sites in bovine cartilage type IX collagen reveals an antiparallel type II-type IX molecular relationship and type IX to type IX bonding.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrospray MS was performed on individual fractions using an LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with in-line liquid chromatography using a C4 5-μm capillary column (300 μm × 150 mm; Higgins Analytical RS-15M3-W045) eluted at 4.5 μl/min. The LC mobile phase consisted of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water) and buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 3:1 acetonitrile:propanol-1 (v/v)). The LC sample stream was introduced into the mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization with a spray voltage of 4 kV. The Proteome Discoverer search software (Thermo Scientific) was used for peptide identification using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database. Proline and lysine modifications were examined manually by scrolling or averaging the full scan over several minutes so that all of the post-translational variations of a given peptide appeared together in the full scan. To test whether the L326P mutation has any effect on the expression and stability of the HSP47 protein, we performed Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining in cultured fibroblasts. In the Western blot analysis, the amount of HSP47 in the mutant fibroblasts was reduced by half when compared with the control (Fig. 1, A and B). Upon proteasome inhibition using MG-132, the amount of protein was not increased further. The immunofluorescent staining of HSP47 showed that the protein was similarly detectable in control as well as in HSP47 mutant fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). The staining pattern was similar in mutant and control cells and co-localized with the ER marker GRP78. We next aimed to investigate whether the mutation in HSP47 impairs its ability to act as a chaperone, thereby affecting type I procollagen folding. To this end, biochemical analyses of procollagen I were performed. The steady-state analysis of pepsinized procollagen separated by SDS-PAGE showed that in both the medium and the cell layers, the bands of the collagen I α chains had decreased electrophoretic mobility in mutant when compared with control fibroblasts, and also had a broader appearance in the cell layer (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, an increased amount of procollagen I, III, and V when compared with the control was detected in the cell layer (Fig. 2A). Similarly, SDS-PAGE of unpepsinized procollagen showed an increased amount of the pro-α1(I) and pro-α2(I) chains in the cell layer and decreased electrophoretic mobility of fully processed α1(I) and α2(I) chains in the medium layer (Fig. 2B). Additionally, in the medium layer, the amount of fully processed α1(I) and α2(I) chains was decreased in mutant dog fibroblasts when compared with control fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that procollagen I is overmodified in the helical part and possibly in the telopeptide region and is less efficiently processed in the extracellular space. The increased amounts of collagen I, III, and V in the cell layer might indicate intracellular retention or decreased secretion of fibrillar collagens in HSP47 mutant cells. We further investigated the secretion of collagen from mutant dog fibroblasts by pulse-chase analysis. In mutant fibroblasts, the secretion of type I and type V collagen from the medium into the cell layer was slightly decreased when compared with the control fibroblasts (Fig. 3, A and B). This was most evident in the 20-min chase for type I collagen and in the 80-min chase for type V collagen. Finally, co-immunofluorescent staining was performed using antibodies against the helical part of type I collagen, the ER chaperone GRP78, and the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. 4, A and B). In agreement with the findings above, mutant cells showed a strong staining for type I collagen (Col I) and only faint staining in two different control cell lines (Contr. 1 and Contr. 2). Furthermore, the staining pattern in control cells overlapped with the Golgi marker (Fig. 4B), but was more spread out in the OI cells overlapping with both the Golgi and the ER marker. Taken together, these observations point toward delayed folding and intracellular retention of procollagen I and raise the question of a possible induction of an ER stress response. To investigate whether the intracellular retention of collagen might cause ultrastructural alterations, transmission electron microscopy was performed on cultured fibroblasts from the HSP47 mutant and a control dog. Dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum in the mutant fibroblasts was more pronounced than in the control cells (Fig. 5). To test for the activation of an ER stress response, GRP78 and phospho-eIF2α, which are induced upon accumulation of unfolded proteins, were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 6, A–D). In HSP47 mutant cells, the amount of GRP78 (Fig. 6, A and B) as well as phospho-eIF2α (Fig. 6, C and D) was increased when compared with control cells. Exposure to the ER stress inducer thapsigargin led to an increase in control cells, whereas it remained at a high level in the HSP47 mutant cells. Induction of autophagy was not observed in Western blot analysis testing for LC3B lipidation (data nor shown).FIGURE 6ER stress markers are up-regulated in HSP47 mutant fibroblasts. A–D, Western blot analysis (A and C) and quantification (B and D) of three independent experiments of GRP78 and phospho-eIF2α (P-eIF2α). The amount of both ER stress marker proteins is increased in untreated (-) HSP47 mutant fibroblasts (OI) when compared with the level in control cells (Contr. 2). Induction of ER stress by treating cells with thapsigargin (Thap.) leads to an increase in control cells, whereas remaining on a high level in HSP47 mutant cells. GRP78 is detected as a double band, probably due to post-translational modification.

Chain mobilities were clearly slower from mutant when compared with control dog tissues. Individual collagen chains were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to trypsin digestion, and lysine hydroxylation was assessed by tandem mass spectrometry in targeted peptides from bone collagen of an HSP47 mutant dog and two control dogs. The tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed an increase in helix and telopeptide lysine modification (Fig. 8). Residue Lys-87 was overglycosylated as glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine (glcgalHyl) in the mutant when compared with galactosyl-hydroxylysine (galHyl) in the controls, and Lys-930 was essentially all Hyl in the mutant but mostly Lys in control bone. From the same trypsin digests, 3-hydroxylation of Pro-986 was found to be essentially complete and indistinguishable from that in controls.FIGURE 8Overmodification of lysine residues at cross-linking sites in HSP47 mutant bone collagen revealed by tandem mass spectrometry. A, peptides from the four molecular sites of cross-linking in collagen type I prepared by bacterial collagenase digestion of decalcified bone were identified by LC-MS. Their post-translational profiles are compared between HSP47 mutant and control (9-year-old dog) bone. N-telo, N-telopeptide; C-telo, C-telopeptide. B and C, spectra from the two helical sites (Lys-87 and Lys-930) (B) and two telopeptide sites (C) show that Lys-87 is mostly glcgalHyl, Lys-930 is mostly Hyl, and both telopeptides are essentially all Hyl from mutant bone, whereas from control bone Lys-87 is mostly galHyl, Lys-930 is highly underhydroxylated, and both telopeptides are about 50% hydroxylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further analysis of pyridinoline cross-links in total hydrolysates of bone collagen showed an increase in the total pyridinoline content (HP+LP moles per mole of collagen) and in the ratio of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) to lysyl pyridinoline (LP) in the mutant bone when compared with bone of two control dogs (Table 1). Furthermore, pyrrole cross-links were not detectable on reaction of decalcified mutant bone with Ehrlich's reagent but strongly reactive in control dog and human bone (data not shown).TABLE 1Cross-link analysis of dog boneDog bone sample typeMutationResidue/collagenHP/LPHPLPHP+LPControl 14 year0.110.030.143.7Control 9 year0.130.050.182.6OI dog 10 weekSERPINH1 p.L326P0.360.050.417.2 Open table in a new tab SERPINH1, encoding HSP47, is a chaperone essential for efficient folding of collagen triple helices in the ER, thereby possibly preventing their aggregation in the ER and facilitating their transport into the Golgi (7Nagata K.

https://openalex.org/W1486102412,"Human myosin VIIA (HM7A) is responsible for human Usher syndrome type 1B, which causes hearing and visual loss in humans. Here we studied the regulation of HM7A. The actin-activated ATPase activity of full-length HM7A (HM7AFull) was lower than that of tail-truncated HM7A (HM7AΔTail). Deletion of the C-terminal 40 amino acids and mutation of the basic residues in this region (R2176A or K2179A) abolished the inhibition. Electron microscopy revealed that HM7AFull is a monomer in which the tail domain bends back toward the head-neck domain to form a compact structure. This compact structure is extended at high ionic strength or in the presence of Ca2+. Although myosin VIIA has five isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) motifs, the neck length seems to be shorter than the expected length of five bound calmodulins. Supporting this observation, the IQ domain bound only three calmodulins in Ca2+, and the first IQ motif failed to bind calmodulin in EGTA. These results suggest that the unique IQ domain of HM7A is important for the tail-neck interaction and, therefore, regulation. Cellular studies revealed that dimer formation of HM7A is critical for its translocation to filopodial tips and that the tail domain (HM7ATail) markedly reduced the filopodial tip localization of the HM7AΔTail dimer, suggesting that the tail-inhibition mechanism is operating in vivo. The translocation of the HM7AFull dimer was significantly less than that of the HM7AΔTail dimer, and R2176A/R2179A mutation rescued the filopodial tip translocation. These results suggest that HM7A can transport its cargo molecules, such as USH1 proteins, upon release of the tail-dependent inhibition.Background: Regulation of myosin VIIA (HM7A) has been studied in Drosophila but not in humans.Results: The tail domain inhibits HM7A ATPase activity and translocation to filopodial tips.Conclusion: The tail domain inhibition mechanism of HM7A is operating both in vitro and in vivo.Significance: The results provide a clue to understand the mechanism of human Usher syndrome.

The motor function of myosin VIIA was first shown for rat myosin VIIA (4Udovichenko I.P. Gibbs D. Williams D.S. Actin-based motor properties of native myosin VIIa.J.

The N-terminal domain of the heavy chain is a conserved motor domain, followed by the neck domain containing five IQ motifs that bind light chains. The tail domain consists of a proximal segment of short predicted coiled-coil domain followed by a globular domain, which contains two large repeats, each incorporating a myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) domain and a band 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain (6Chen Z.Y. Hasson T. Kelley P.M. Schwender B.J. Schwartz M.F. Ramakrishnan M. Kimberling W.J. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P.

There is an SH3 domain between the two repeats that could be involved in the protein-protein interaction. Because of the presence of the coiled-coil domain, it was originally assumed that myosin VIIA is a dimer, i.e. a two-headed structure. However, recent biochemical and structural studies have revealed that Drosophila myosin VIIA is monomer (7Yang Y. Baboolal T.G. Siththanandan V. Chen M. Walker M.L. Knight P.J. Peckham M.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Between the IQ domain and the short coiled-coil domain, there is a stable single α helix domain (7Yang Y. Baboolal T.G. Siththanandan V. Chen M. Walker M.L. Knight P.J. Peckham M. Sellers J.R. A FERM domain autoregulates Drosophila myosin 7a activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The stable single α helix domain was first identified for myosin X (9Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M.

Myosin VIIA is localized at the pericuticular necklace in sensory hair cells, where microtubules end and are rich in membrane vesicles (3Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Unconventional myosins in inner-ear sensory epithelia.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that the pericuticular necklace may be a transit point of cargo movement between the microtubule system and the actin filament system. Myosin VIIA is also found in the two cell types of the retina: photoreceptor cells and pigmented epithelial cells (3Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Unconventional myosins in inner-ear sensory epithelia.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 10Hasson T. Heintzelman M.B. Santos-Sacchi J.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9815-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In both cell types, it is thought that myosin VIIA serves as a transporter (11Liu X. Udovichenko I.P. Brown S.D. Steel K.P.

Supporting this view, it has been found that Drosophila myosin VIIA is a high duty ratio motor that is suitable for a cargo transporting motor (13Watanabe S. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Drosophila myosin VIIA is a high duty ratio motor with a unique kinetic mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7151-7160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the tail-truncated forced dimer of Drosophila myosin VIIA moves processively on actin filaments (14Yang Y. Kovács M. Sakamoto T. Zhang F. Kiehart D.P. Sellers J.R. Dimerized Drosophila myosin VIIa: a processive motor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have found recently that the tail domain functions as an intramolecular inhibitor in vitro and that it inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity of Drosophila myosin VIIA (8Umeki N. Jung H.S. Watanabe S. Sakai T. Li X.D. Ikebe R. Craig R. Ikebe M. The tail binds to the head-neck domain, inhibiting ATPase activity of myosin VIIA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it has been known that the regulation mechanism of mammalian myosin is different from the invertebrate myosin of the same subfamily, such as myosin I and myosin II (15Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Control of nonmuscle myosins by phosphorylation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Sellers J.R. Myosins: a diverse superfamily.Biochim.

Cell Motil. 2007; 28: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An important question is whether the tail-dependent regulation mechanism is operating for human myosin VIIA, which is responsible for USH1B. Here we studied the structural basis of the regulation mechanism of human myosin VIIA. Furthermore, we studied whether the regulation mechanism found in vitro is operating in vivo by monitoring the translocation of myosin VIIA in filopodia. human Usher syndrome type 1B myosin essential light chain myosin regulatory light chain myosin tail homology 4 band 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin isoleucine-glutamine FK506-binding protein calmodulin System for Processing Image Data from Electron microscopy and Related fields. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pfu ultra high-fidelity DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The baculovirus expression system, including the vector pFastBac-HT and Sf9 cells, was from Invitrogen (18Summers M.D. Anderson D.L. Granulosis virus deoxyribonucleic acid: a closed, double-stranded molecule.J. Virol. 1972; 9: 710-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jones I. Morikawa Y. Baculovirus vectors for expression in insect cells.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The vector containing the 3× FLAG tag (MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) was constructed by replacing the hexahistidine tag with the 3× FLAG tag sequence in pFastBac-HT. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction: I: biochemical studies of the interaction of the tropomyosin-troponin complex with actin and the proteolytic fragments of myosin.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant calmodulin was expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (21Maruta S. Ohki T. Kambara T. Ikebe M.

Biochem. 1998; 256: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase were obtained from Sigma. 3× FLAG peptides were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The cDNA fragments encoding nonmuscle myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), MYL12A cDNA, and nonmuscle myosin essential light chain (ELC), MYL6 cDNA were obtained from a human cDNA library. The amino acid sequences were identical with the submitted sequences, NP_006462 and NP_066299, respectively. Both cDNAs were amplified by PCR using each single set of primers containing restriction sites and subcloned into the pET-30a vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) at the NdeI/EcoRI sites, which resulted in eliminating the His6 tag from the pET-30a vectors. These non-tagged RLC and ELC proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The cells were cultured in 2YT (16 g tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to A600 of 0.5, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The packed cells were suspended in 5 volumes of the buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 6 m urea, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mg/ml lysozyme and protein inhibitor mixture, and the proteins were extracted by sonication. After centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 15 min, trichloroacetic acid was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 5%. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min), dissolved with 500 mm Tris base, 5 mm DTT, and 4 m urea and then dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT overnight at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 10 min to remove the insoluble materials. After adding CaCl2 (final concentration 1 mm), the sample was loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. After washing the column with the equilibration buffer, ELC and RLC were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EGTA, respectively. The fractions containing RLC and ELC were dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C. The RLC and ELC protein concentrations were estimated on the basis of the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 5960 m−1 cm−1. The cDNA fragment encoding Myosin VIIA was obtained from a human kidney cDNA library. The amino acid sequence is identical with the submitted sequence (GenBank accession no. NM_000260.3). HM7AFull and HM7AFull (−40) were subcloned into the EcoR I site in the modified pFastBacHT baculovirus transfer vector (Life Technologies) containing a 3× FLAG sequence at the 5′ end or GFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). HM7AΔTail cDNA was amplified by PCR using a single set of primers, including restriction sites, and subcloned into the 3× FLAG pFastBacHT vector or GFP-C1 vector at the EcoR I/KpnI sites. The HM7AFull mutant (R2176A/K2179A) was created by site-directed mutagenesis (22Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Site-directed mutagenesis of double-stranded DNA by the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To make the HM7AFull (coil to GCN4) construct (HM7AFull/LZ), HM7AFull was mutated by inverse PCR methods (23Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. A simple method for site-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction.Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) using a single set of primers containing 5′ phosphorylated ends (gaaagcaattcttcaaccttgtcttcaagttgtttcatcaggcgctcctgatgcttgcgc and gaaagtttatcacttggaaaatgaggttgccagattagagcagatggaaagggcccgcca). DNA fragments having a various number of IQ motifs of myosin VIIA (IQ1, 738–773 amino acids; IQ1-2, 738–796 amino acids; IQ1-3, 738-819 amino acids; IQ1-4, 738–833 amino acids; and IQ1-5, 738–931 amino acids) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a modified PET30a vector (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) containing a GST sequence upstream of the multicloning site. Each PCR-amplified fragment was subcloned in-frame with the C-terminal His tag into PET30a vector. HM7A proteins were produced by the baculovirus expression system according to the protocol of the manufacturer (24O'Reilly D.R. Use of baculovirus expression vectors.Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 235-246PubMed Google Scholar). To express HM7A proteins, Sf9 cells were coinfected with two viruses expressing HM7A proteins and Xenopus calmodulin (25Chien Y.H. Dawid I.B. Isolation and characterization of calmodulin genes from Xenopus laevis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using methods described previously (26Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Functional expression of mammalian myosin I β: analysis of its motor activity.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The infected cells were cultured for 3 days at 28 °C, and the cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MgATP, 50 μg/ml Calmodulin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm DTT). After gentle homogenization with a Wheaton Potter-Elvehjem-type tissue grinder (5 strokes) using a Wheaton overhead stirrer, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and rotated gently for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with lysis buffer and wash buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT), the recombinant proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide, and 10% trehalose. The purified proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the densitometry of SDS-PAGE using BSA as a standard and analyzed with National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. To express GST fusion proteins having various number of IQ motifs of myosin VIIA, recombinant plasmids (PET30a-GST-IQ motifs) were transfected into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and grown up in a 2YT medium. The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.5, and protein expression was induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Pellets were lysed with sonication in lysis buffer (0.5 M KCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and rotated gently for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with lysis buffer plus 25 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with elution buffer containing 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm imidazole, and 10% sucrose. The purified proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The steady-state ATPase activity was measured in buffer containing 20 μm actin, 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin, and 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2 in the presence of an ATPase regeneration system (20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) at 25 °C (27Reynard A.M.

Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentration of HM7A proteins was 0.05 μm, and total volume was 100 μl. The reaction solution was preincubated at 25 °C for 10 min before adding 1 mm ATP to start the reaction. The ATPase activity was calculated from the released Pi (mole) per mole of myosin VIIA per second (28Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. A method for the determination of inorganic phosphate in the presence of labile organic phosphate and high concentrations of protein: application to lens ATPases.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Data fitting and analysis were performed using Prizm. HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed with GeneJammer transfection reagent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen Mini- or Maxi-prep columns. The cells were observed about 16 h after transfection. Fluorescence images were viewed with a Leica DM IRB laser-scanning confocal microscope controlled by Leica TCS SP II systems (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×60 1.40 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). The images were processed using Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed in fix buffer (4% formaldehyde, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with the indicated primary antibodies and anti-HA tag antibodies (C29F4, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and then for 1 h with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody, 1: 400, Invitrogen). For actin staining, Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (1:600, Invitrogen) was used. For negative staining, HM7AFull (300 nm) was mixed with 6 μm of calmodulin (ratio of 1:20 to enhance calmodulin binding) and then 10-fold diluted with low (high) salt buffer containing 50 mm Na acetate (300 mm NaCl), 1 mm EGTA (1.1 mm CaCl2), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS, and 200 μm ATP (pH 7.5). After dilution, 5 μl of the final mixture was applied to a carbon-coated grid that had been glow-discharged (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) for 3 min in air, and the grid was immediately (∼5 s) negatively stained using 1% uranyl acetate (29Jung H.S. Komatsu S. Ikebe M. Craig R. Head-head and head-tail interaction: a general mechanism for switching off myosin II activity in cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3234-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Grids were examined in a Technai G2 Spirit Twin Transmission Electron Microscopy (FEI) operated at 120 kV, and images were recorded at a magnification of 65,000 (0.37 nm/pixel). Single-particle image processing was carried out using SPIDER (System for Processing Image Data from Electron microscopy and Related fields; Health Research Inc., Rensselaer, NY) according to procedures described previously (30Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Thirumurugan K. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Use of negative stain and single-particle image processing to explore dynamic properties of flexible macromolecules.J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Averaged images were produced by alignment and classification of windowed particles (120 × 120 pixels, 701 total particles) from micrographs. Representative averages showing the clearest view of the structures were selected from 25 total class averages. UCSF Chimera was used for visualization and analysis of PDB structures (31Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E.

The purified 5 μm GST or GST fusion proteins having various numbers of IQ motifs of myosin VIIA were incubated with 200 μm calmodulin, ELC, or RLC in 200 μl of buffer containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2. These mixtures were incubated for 1 h on ice and mixed with 20 μl of GST glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator, the beads were washed twice with 400 μl of the same buffer and spun down, and then the supernatant was removed completely using gel loading tips. The beads were resuspended in SDS sample loading buffer at 100 °C for 5 min, and the samples were loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining. Protein amounts were quantified by comparing band density using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). We produced various human myosin VIIA (HM7A) constructs to study the regulation mechanism (Fig. 1A). Each 3× Flag-tagged construct was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. For the expression of constructs having an IQ domain, we coexpressed calmodulin with the heavy chain of human myosin VIIA. The isolated HM7A heavy chain containing the IQ domain was copurified with calmodulin light chain (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular mass of each constructs determined from its mobility in SDS-PAGE was 250 and 120 kDa for HM7AFull and HM7AΔTail, respectively, which is consistent with the calculated molecular masses of these constructs (Fig. 1B). We found that the actin-activated ATPase activity of HM7AFull was significantly lower than that of HM7AΔTail (Fig. 2A). The actin concentration dependence of the ATPase activity showed that the actin-activated ATPase activity of HM7AFull in EGTA was significantly lower than that in the presence of Ca2+. On the other hand, this Ca2+ dependence was not observed for HM7AΔTail (Fig. 2, B and C). The result suggests that the tail domain functions as an intramolecular inhibitor of human myosin VIIA. Although Ca2+ reverses the tail-induced inhibition, the ATPase activity of HM7AFull in Ca2+ (Vmax of 0.15 ± 0.02 s−1) was less than that of HM7AΔTail (Vmax of 0.26 ± 0.03 s−1 in Ca2+ and 0.32 ± 0.04 s−1 in EGTA). This result suggests that the effect of Ca2+, presumably because of the binding to calmodulin light chain, does not completely abolish the tail-dependent inhibition. As shown in Fig. 2D, deletion of the C-terminal 40 residues significantly increased the ATPase activity of HM7AFull to activity similar to HM7AΔTail. It has been shown previously that a cluster of the basic residues Arg-2140/Lys-2143 is involved in the regulation of Drosophila myosin VIIA (7Yang Y. Baboolal T.G. Siththanandan V. Chen M.

Therefore, we examined whether Arg-2176/Lys-2179 of human myosin VIIA, which are within the C-terminal 40 residues, are involved in the tail-dependent inhibition of human myosin VIIA. R2176A/K2179A"

Although it has been suggested to serve as a proton buffer and radical scavenger, its physiological function remains mysterious. The formation of anserine is catalyzed by carnosine N-methyltransferase, recently identified in chicken as histamine N-methyltransferase-like (HNMT-like) protein. Although the HNMT-like gene is absent in mammalian genomes, the activity of carnosine N-methyltransferase was reported in most mammalian species. In the present investigation, we purified carnosine N-methyltransferase from rat muscles about 2600-fold. Three polypeptides of ∼45, 50, and 70 kDa coeluting with the enzyme activity were identified in the preparation. Mass spectrometry analysis of these polypeptides resulted in the identification of UPF0586 protein C9orf41 homolog as the only meaningful candidate. Rat UPF0586 and its yeast, chicken, and human orthologs were expressed in COS-7 cells and purified to homogeneity. Although all recombinant proteins catalyzed the formation of anserine, as confirmed by chromatographic and mass spectrometry analysis, rat UPF0586 was more active on carnosine than other orthologs. Confocal microscopy of HeLa cells expressing recombinant UPF5086 proteins revealed their presence in both cytosol and nucleus. Carnosine and Gly-His were the best substrates for all UPF0586 orthologs studied, although the enzymes also methylated other l-histidine-containing di- and tripeptides. Finally, cotransfection of COS-7 cells with rat or human UPF0586 and carnosine synthase transformed the cells into efficient anserine producers.

Carnosine (β-alanyl-l-histidine) and its methylated derivative, anserine (β-alanyl-N-π-methyl-l-histidine), are dipeptides commonly found in excitable animal tissues, whereas they have never been detected in plants, fungi, or other eukaryotes (for a review, see Ref. 1Boldyrev A.A. Aldini G. Derave W. Physiology and pathophysiology of carnosine.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1803-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In contrast to carnosine, which is present at high concentrations (in the range of 0.6–30 mm) in both skeletal muscles and the central nervous system of almost all vertebrates, including human beings (2Crush K.G. Carnosine and related substances in animal tissues.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 34: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Mannion A.F. Jakeman P.M. Dunnett M. Harris R.C. Willan P.L.

Derave W. Physiology and pathophysiology of carnosine.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1803-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and only traces of this dipeptide have been occasionally detected in brain (4Boldyrev A.A. Carnosine and Oxidative Stress in Cells and Tissues. Nova Scientific Publisher, New York2007: 37-38Google Scholar, 5Tomonaga S. Hayakawa T. Yamane H. Maemura H. Sato M. Takahata Y. Morimatsu F. Furuse M. Oral administration of chicken breast extract increases brain carnosine and anserine concentrations in rats.Nutr. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Anserine was reported as a major l-histidine-containing dipeptide in avian tissues (up to 43 mm in chicken pectoral muscle) (4Boldyrev A.A. Carnosine and Oxidative Stress in Cells and Tissues. Nova Scientific Publisher, New York2007: 37-38Google Scholar), whereas much lower concentrations of this compound have been measured in muscles of mammals, such as rats (2–9 mm), cats (8 mm), and rabbits (17 mm) (1Boldyrev A.A. Aldini G. Derave W. Physiology and pathophysiology of carnosine.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1803-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 6Christman A.A. Factors affecting anserine and carnosine levels in skeletal muscles of various animals.Int. J. Biochem. 1976; 7: 519-527Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, no endogenous anserine has ever been detected in human muscles (1Boldyrev A.A. Aldini G. Derave W. Physiology and pathophysiology of carnosine.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1803-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 3Mannion A.F. Jakeman P.M. Dunnett M. Harris R.C. Willan P.L. Carnosine and anserine concentrations in the quadriceps femoris muscle of healthy humans.Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. Occup. Physiol. 1992; 64: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A great effort has been made to understand the physiological role of both carnosine and anserine. Originally, these two dipeptides were postulated to serve as pH buffers neutralizing lactic acid produced in working muscle due to their abundance and pKa value that is close to the physiological pH (4Boldyrev A.A. Carnosine and Oxidative Stress in Cells and Tissues. Nova Scientific Publisher, New York2007: 37-38Google Scholar). This hypothesis, however, provides no explanation for the synthesis of anserine, which shows buffer capacity similar to that of carnosine. Recently, histidine-containing dipeptides have been postulated to exert a more complex effect on cell and tissue metabolism via their antiglycemic (7Kubomura D. Matahira Y. Nagai K. Niijima A. Effect of anserine ingestion on hyperglycemia and the autonomic nerves in rats and humans.Nutr. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), antiglycation (8Szwergold B.S. Carnosine and anserine act as effective transglycating agents in decomposition of aldose-derived Schiff bases.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and antioxidant properties (9Bae O.N. Serfozo K. Baek S.H. Lee K.Y. Dorrance A. Rumbeiha W. Fitzgerald S.D. Farooq M.U.

Unfortunately, no definitive explanation for their physiological importance has been provided so far. Knowledge of the enzymes catalyzing the formation of histidine-containing dipeptides is rather limited, and only recently have carnosine synthase and chicken carnosine N-methyltransferase been molecularly identified as ATPGD1 (ATP-grasp domain-containing protein 1) and histamine N-methyltransferase-like (HNMT-like) 2The abbreviations used are: HNMT-likehistamine N-methyltransferase-likeHILIChydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographySAHS-adenosyl-l-homocysteineSAMS-adenosyl-l-methionine. protein, respectively (10Drozak J.

Unexpectedly, HNMT-like gene encoding anserine-producing methyltransferase in birds and reptiles was not detected in available mammalian genomes (11Drozak J. Chrobok L. Poleszak O. Jagielski A.K.

Aldini G. Derave W. Physiology and pathophysiology of carnosine.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1803-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This observation led us to hypothesize that (i) the HNMT-like gene has been lost in mammals, and (ii) mammalian carnosine N-methyltransferase must be a different protein from the “HNMT-like” one (11Drozak J. Chrobok L. Poleszak O. Jagielski A.K. Derlacz R.

In the current investigation, we report the identification of mammalian carnosine N-methyltransferase as a protein of unknown function designated UPF0586 protein C9orf41 homolog. We have characterized this enzyme and proved that its overexpression in COS-7 cells results in their transformation into efficient anserine producers. We also provide data suggesting that UPF0596 protein may serve as a novel peptide and/or protein methyltransferase in eukaryotes. Reagents, of analytical grade whenever possible, were from Sigma-Aldrich (Poznań, Poland), Roche Diagnostics (Warsaw, Poland), or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). S-[methyl-3H]Adenosyl-l-methionine and Ultima Gold LSC mixture were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Di- and tripeptides were from Sigma-Aldrich or Caslo Laboratory (Lingby, Denmark) with the exception of GABA-l-His, which was a generous gift of Dr. Maria Veiga-da-Cunha (de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium) and was prepared as described previously (12Veiga-da-Cunha M.

DEAE-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, Superdex 200, HiScreen Blue FF, HisTrap HP (Ni2+ form), and PD-10 columns were obtained from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden). Dowex 50W-X4 (200-mesh) resin was from Sigma-Aldrich, and Vivaspin-500 and -20 centrifugal concentrators were from Sartorius Stedim (Kostrzyn, Poland). All other enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes as well as the TurboFect transfection reagent were obtained from Thermo-Fermentas. Carnosine N-methytransferase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]methyl group from S-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-l-methionine ([3H]SAM) into carnosine. The standard incubation mixture (0.11 ml) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm carnosine (or other acceptors), and 1 μm [1H + 3H]SAM (from about 400 × 103 to 800 × 103 cpm). When the effect of pH on recombinant enzyme activity was investigated, Hepes, pH 7.5, was replaced by MES, pH 6.0; Hepes, pH 7.0; or Tris, pH 8.0, 8.5, or 9.0. Blanks containing no carnosine were included in all assays. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme preparation and carried out at 37 °C for 20 min unless otherwise described. Anserine production was linear for at least 30 min under all conditions studied. The incubation was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of the reaction medium to 0.2 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) HClO4. The samples were diluted with 0.12 ml of H2O and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. After neutralization of the supernatant with 3 m K2CO3, the salts were removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min); the clear supernatant was diluted 5 times with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; and 2 ml were applied to Dowex 50W-X4 columns (1 ml, Na+ form), equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The columns were washed with 5 × 2 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, to remove minor radioactive contaminants of the radioreagent. Anserine and methylated forms of l-histidine were eluted with 5 × 2 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl. To elute a non-consumed [1H + 3H]SAM, the columns were washed with 4 × 2 ml of 1 m NH4OH. In the experiments where Gly-Gly-His, Gly-His-Gly, Ala-His or His-Ala, and His-Gly were used as substrates, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, in the equilibration and elution buffers for Dowex 50W-X4 columns was replaced by 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, or 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, respectively, to obtain retention of the methylated peptides on the cationite. In all cases, the samples to be counted were mixed with 6 volumes of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold), and the incorporated radioactivity was analyzed with a Beckman LS6000 IC liquid scintillation counter. Rat leg muscles (130 g) from four male Wistar rats, aged 4 months, were homogenized with 4 volumes (w/v) of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain) with a Waring blender 7011HS. The homogenate was centrifuged for 40 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (400 ml) was filtered through three layers of gauze to remove fat particles and was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (300-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 850 ml of buffer A and developed with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m in 715 ml) in buffer A, and fractions (6.5 ml) were collected. The most active fractions of the DEAE column (39 ml) were diluted to 220 ml with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (50-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 135 ml of buffer B containing 25 mm NaCl, and the retained protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient (25–500 mm in 350 ml in buffer B), and fractions (5 ml) were collected. The most active fractions (15 ml) were pooled, concentrated to 2.6 ml in Vivaspin-20 ultrafiltration devices, and loaded on a Superdex 200 16/60 column (120-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. One-ml fractions were collected. To obtain more purified enzyme preparation for a tandem mass spectrometry, fractions 44–53 (10 ml) of the Superdex 200 purification step were pooled again, concentrated to 1 ml in Vivaspin-20 ultrafiltration devices, and loaded on a HiScreen blue Sepharose column (4.7-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A and developed with a NaCl gradient (0–1 m in 50 ml) in buffer A, and fractions (1 ml) were collected. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C, and the enzymatic preparation was stored at −70 °C between steps. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to Bradford (13Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Protein content in the most active blue Sepharose fractions were determined following their 10-fold concentration in Vivaspin-500 ultrafiltration devices. Because SDS-PAGE analysis of the peak activity fractions from the HiScreen blue Sepharose revealed a low protein content, resulting in very faint protein bands, fractions were 10-fold concentrated in a Vivaspin-500 ultrafiltration device and reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bands co-eluting with carnosine N-methyltransferase activity in the blue Sepharose purification step were cut from a 10% gel and digested with trypsin. In-gel digestions of the peptides were performed as described previously (14Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). Peptides were analyzed by nano-UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry employing Acquity nano-UPLC coupled with a Synapt G2 HDMS Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters) fitted with a nanospray source and working in MS∧E mode under default parameters. Briefly, products of in-gel protein digestion were loaded onto a Waters Symmetry C18 trapping column (20 mm × 180 μm) coupled to the Waters BEH130 C18 UPLC column (250 mm × 75 μm). The peptides were eluted from these columns in a 1–85% gradient of acetonitrile in water (both containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. The peptides were directly eluted into the mass spectrometer. Data were acquired and analyzed using MassLynx version 4.1 software (Waters) and ProteinLynx Global Server version 2.4 software (Waters) with a false discovery rate of ≤4%, respectively. To identify rat carnosine N-methyltransferase, the complete rat (Rattus norvegicus) reference proteome was downloaded from UniProt, randomized, and used as a data bank of the MS/MS software. Sequences homologous to rat UPF0586 protein C9orf41 homolog (GenBankTM accession number NP_001020145.1) were identified by Protein BLAST searches. A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the Phylogeny.fr platform (15Dereeper A. Guignon V. Blanc G. Audic S. Buffet S. Chevenet F. Dufayard J.F. Guindon S. Lefort V. Lescot M. Claverie J.M. Gascuel O. Phylogeny.fr: robust phylogenetic analysis for the non-specialist.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W465-W469Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (version 3.7) (16Edgar R.C. MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30224) Google Scholar). After alignment, ambiguous regions were removed with Gblocks (version 0.91b) (17Castresana J. Selection of conserved blocks from multiple alignments for their use in phylogenetic analysis.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (7341) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic trees were generated using phylogenetic estimation using maximum likelihood (18Guindon S. Gascuel O. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood.Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14201) Google Scholar) with the WAG model for amino acid substitution (19Whelan S. Goldman N.

TreeDyn: towards dynamic graphics and annotations for analyses of trees.BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 439Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). A confidence level was assessed using the approximate likelihood ratio test (minimum of Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure and χ2-based parametric) (21Anisimova M. Gascuel O.

Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), chicken, and rat total RNA was prepared from 250 mg of cell pellet, 200 mg of pectoral muscle, and 200 mg of leg muscle, respectively, with the use of TriPure reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Thermo-Fermentas), with oligo(dT)18 primer and 2.5 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The open reading frames encoding yeast (GenBankTM accession number NM_001182930.1), chicken (XM_003643032.1), and rat UPF0586 protein (NM_001024974.1) were PCR-amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 m betaine, whereas the ORF coding for the human protein (BC034033.1) was amplified from cDNA clone HsCD00296470 (DNASU Plasmid Repository). UPF05086s were amplified using 5′ primers containing the initiator codon preceded by the Kozak consensus sequence (22Kozak M. An analysis of 5′-noncoding sequences from 699 vertebrate messenger RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar) and an EcoRI site and 3′ primers in which the original stop codon was replaced by an amino acid coding codon flanked by an XbaI site (for primer sequences, see Table 1). The amplified DNA products of the expected size were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes; cloned into the pEF6/Myc-His A expression vector (Invitrogen), which allows the production of proteins with a C-terminal His6 tag; and verified by DNA sequencing. For transfections, COS-7 cells (Cell Lines Service, Eppelheim, Germany) or HEK-293T cells (a kind gift of Dr. Maria Veiga-da-Cunha) were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes at a cell density of 1.7 × 106 or 2.1 × 106 cells/plate, respectively, in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and grown in a humidified incubator under a 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After 24 h, each plate was transfected with 6 μg of either unmodified pEF6/Myc-His A vector or the same vector encoding HNMT-like protein using the TurboFect transfection reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After 48 h, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain. The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen, and after thawing and vortexing, the extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C (20,000 × g for 30 min) to remove insoluble material.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used in PCR and quantitative RT-PCR experimentsPrimerSequenceRestriction sitePlasmidProtein expressedPreparation of UPF0586 protein expression vectors1gtggaattcgccaccATGCAGCGACGACGGCGCEcoRIpEF6/Myc-His AC-terminal His6-tagged rat UPF0586 protein C9orf41 homolog2aOriginal stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.cagtctagaATATTGTGGCTTCCGGACCACXbaI3gtggaattcgccaccATGCAGCGACGGCGTCGCEcoRIpEF6/Myc-His AC-terminal His6-tagged human UPF0586 protein C9orf414aOriginal stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.cagtctagaCCATTGTGGCTTACGGACCACXbaI5gtggaattcgccaccATGTCGGCCGCGTGCGCGEcoRIpEF6/Myc-His AC-terminal His6-tagged chicken UPF0586 protein C9orf41 homolog6aOriginal stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.cagtctagaCCATTCAAAGCACTTCTCTTCTGXbaI7gtggaattcgccaccATGGACGAGAATGAATTTGATAATCEcoRIpEF6/Myc-His AC-terminal His6-tagged yeast UPF0586 protein C9orf41 homolog8aOriginal stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.cagtctagaATATGATTCATTGGTGGGGTTCGXbaISubcellular localization of rat and human UPF0586 protein9CACgaattccacgATGCAGCGACGGCGTCGCEcoRIpEGFP-N1C-terminal EGFP-tagged human UPF0586 protein C9orf4110aOriginal stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.CATgtcgacGATTGTGGCTTACGGACCACSalI11CACgaattccacgATGCAGCGACGACGGCGCEcoRIpEGFP-N1C-terminal EGFP-tagged rat UPF0586 protein C9orf4112aOriginal stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.CATgtcgacGATTGTGGCTTCCGGACCACSalIQuantitative real-time PCRRat UPF0586TAACGCGTTCCGCTACTACGTCCGGATCTTGTCCAAGTGARat GAPDHACCACCAACTGCTTAGCCCCCACAGCCTTGGCAGCACCHuman UPF0586GGGAAAGCAGAAAGGGATGCGCCAGTCTTCCTAGTCCAGCHuman GAPDHTTCCAGGAGCGAGATCCCTCACCCATGACGAACATGGGa Original stop codons were replaced by either ATA and CCA or CGA (shown in italic type and underlined) to allow C-terminal His tag or C-terminal EGFP translation, respectively.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, the culture medium was changed to a fresh one (10 ml) containing 0.1 mm β-alanine, and the cells were left for another 24 h before removing the medium, washing with PBS, and collecting from each plate in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain. The cells were lysed by freezing three times in liquid nitrogen, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min). Part (0.2 ml) of soluble extract was deproteinized by the addition of 0.6 ml of acetonitrile, followed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min) and filtration (Whatman 0.2 μm PVDF filter), and used to determine carnosine and anserine content by HPLC-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) (see “Product Analysis”). Another part (0.3 ml) was used to measure protein concentration and for expression analysis of the recombinant proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (11Drozak J. Chrobok L. Poleszak O.

https://openalex.org/W1597653601,"Cerebral hemorrhage, a difficult issue in clinical practice, is often detected and studied with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, these expensive devices are not readily available in economically underdeveloped regions, and hence are unable to provide bedside and emergency on-site monitoring. The magnetic inductive phase shift (MIPS) is an emerging technology that may become a new tool to detect cerebral hemorrhage and to serve as an inexpensive partial substitute to medical imaging. In order to study a wider band of cerebral hemorrhage MIPS and to provide more useful information for measuring cerebral hemorrhage, we established a cerebral hemorrhage magnetic induction phase shift spectroscopy (MIPSS) detection system. Thirteen rabbits with five cerebral hemorrhage states were studied using a single coil-coil within a 1 MHz-200 MHz frequency range in linear sweep. A feature band (FB) with the highest detection sensitivity and the greatest stability was selected for further analysis and processing. In addition, a maximum conductivity cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MRI was performed to verify and interpret the MIPSS result. The average phase shift change induced by a 3 ml injection of autologous blood under FB was -7.7503° ± 1.4204°, which was considerably larger than our previous work. Data analysis with a non-parametric statistical Friedman M test showed that in the FB, MIPSS could distinguish the five states of cerebral hemorrhage in rabbits, with a statistical significance of p<0.05. A B-F distribution profile was designed according to the MIPSS under FB that can provide instantaneous diagnostic information about the cerebral hemorrhage severity from a single set of measurements. The results illustrate that the MIPSS detection method is able to provide a new possibility for real-time monitoring and diagnosis of the severity of cerebral hemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W273230620,"NADH cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) is critical for reductive reactions such as fatty acid elongation, cholesterol biosynthesis, drug metabolism, and methemoglobin reduction. Although the physiological and metabolic importance of CYB5R3 has been established in hepatocytes and erythrocytes, emerging investigations suggest that CYB5R3 is critical for nitric oxide signaling and vascular function. However, advancement toward fully understanding CYB5R3 function has been limited due to a lack of potent small molecule inhibitors. Because of this restriction, we modeled the binding mode of propylthiouracil, a weak inhibitor of CYB5R3 (IC50 = ∼275 μM), and used it as a guide to predict thiouracil-biased inhibitors from the set of commercially available compounds in the ZINC database. Using this approach, we validated two new potent derivatives of propylthiouracil, ZINC05626394 (IC50 = 10.81 μM) and ZINC39395747 (IC50 = 9.14 μM), both of which inhibit CYB5R3 activity in cultured cells. Moreover, we found that ZINC39395747 significantly increased NO bioavailability in renal vascular cells, augmented renal blood flow, and decreased systemic blood pressure in response to vasoconstrictors in spontaneously hypertensive rats. These compounds will serve as a new tool to examine the biological functions of CYB5R3 in physiology and disease and also as a platform for new drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2262375396,"Background Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotide diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates. The functional enzyme consists of two subunits - one large (RRM1) and one small (RRM2 or RRM2b) subunit. Expression levels of each subunit have been implicated in prognostic outcomes in several different types of cancers. Experimental Design Immunohistochemistry for RRM1 and RRM2 was performed on a lung cancer tissue microarray (TMA) and analyzed. 326 patients from the microarray were included in this study. Results In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RRM2 expression was strongly predictive of disease-specific survival in women, non-smokers and former smokers who had quit at least 10 years prior to being diagnosed with lung cancer. Higher expression was associated with worse survival. This was not the case for men, current smokers and those who had stopped smoking for shorter periods of time. RRM1 was not predictive of survival outcomes in any subset of the patient group. Conclusion RRM2, but not RRM1, is a useful predictor of survival outcome in certain subsets of NSCLC patients."

Questionnaire including information for cough and haemoptysis was completed by face to face interview, and then chest radiography was conducted in all eligible participants. Sputum smear and culture were followed for all TB suspects. We calculated the odds ratios (OR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of using different symptoms for screening to detect bacteriologically positive TB in subpopulations stratified by age 65, to evaluate the performance of symptom screening for TB.Of 315 newly diagnosed bacteriologically positive TB, 131 patients (41.59%) were elderly, and 48.57% of TB patients were asymptomatic. Nearly 50% patients did not present cough of any duration, and less than half present cough more than 2 weeks, a defined suspected symptom in China NTP. Cough of any duration was reported more in patients aged under 65 than those in elderly, especially for the acute cough (9.78% vs 6.87%). Those symptoms defined by China NTP were reported by less than half participants in two subpopulations. Acute cough (<2 weeks) was an independent predictor of TB in people aged under 65 (adjusted OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 2.0-5.5), but not in those aged 65 and above (adjusted OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-2.9). The specificity for each symptom was significantly higher in participants aged under 65 (P<0.01), and sensitivities of most symptoms were significantly higher among elderly (P<0.05 or P<0.01). When compared with cough for 2 weeks and more, using cough of any duration for symptom screening increased the sensitivity from 42.9% to 51. % for all participants, and the AUC increased from 0.70 to 0.74 for participants aged under 65 without significant difference.There is a high percent of asymptomatic TB patients, and those symptoms adopted in China NTP for screening is poorly predictive for TB. The presence of TB symptoms, the sensitivities and specificities of symptoms for TB were distinct between two subpopulations cut by age 65, implying different case finding strategies should be established for them. The current case finding strategy should be improved, and further studies should be done to evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of different symptom screening strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1490689662,"New xenograft models of colorectal cancer exhibit metastasis to the liver, use immunocompetent mice and show improved resistance to chemotherapy. Current orthotopic xenograft models of human colorectal cancer (CRC) require surgery and do not robustly form metastases in the liver, the most common site clinically. CCR9 traffics lymphocytes to intestine and colorectum. We engineered use of the chemokine receptor CCR9 in CRC cell lines and patient-derived cells to create primary gastrointestinal (GI) tumors in immunodeficient mice by tail-vein injection rather than surgery. The tumors metastasize inducibly and robustly to the liver. Metastases have higher DKK4 and NOTCH signaling levels and are more chemoresistant than paired subcutaneous xenografts. Using this approach, we generated 17 chemokine-targeted mouse models (CTMMs) that recapitulate the majority of common human somatic CRC mutations. We also show that primary tumors can be modeled in immunocompetent mice by microinjecting CCR9-expressing cancer cell lines into early-stage mouse blastocysts, which induces central immune tolerance. We expect that CTMMs will facilitate investigation of the biology of CRC metastasis and drug screening."

However, the mechanism of the enzyme remains to be completely elucidated. In this work, we have studied the kinetic mechanism of Na+-NQR with the use of steady state kinetics and stopped flow analysis.

In this conformation, the enzyme is able to capture two sodium ions and transport them to the external side of the membrane. In the last step, ubiquinone is bound and reduced, and ubiquinol is released. Our data also demonstrate that the catalytic cycle involves two redox states, the three- and five-electron reduced forms.

Vohl G. Casutt M.S. Vorburger T. Diederichs K. Fritz G. Structure of the V. cholerae Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase.Nature. 2014; 516: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), contrasting with previous topological models (11Duffy E.B. Barquera B. Membrane topology mapping of the Na+-pumping NADH: quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae by PhoA-green fluorescent protein fusion analysis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The soluble domain contains the binding site of the second covalently bound FMN molecule (13Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Yasui M. Maeda M. Furuishi K. Unemoto T.

The subunits NqrD and NqrE are homologous transmembrane proteins (11Duffy E.B. Barquera B.

Together with NqrB, these subunits participate in the transport of sodium, due to the presence of several conserved acid residues, whose mutants block specifically the sodium sensitive activity (14Juárez O. Athearn K. Gillespie P. Barquera B.

The crystal structure indicates that these subunits might also bear a sixth cofactor, a single iron atom coordinated through four conserved cysteine residues (12Steuber J. Vohl G. Casutt M.S.

Na+-NQR is the only reported enzyme, and perhaps one of the few in nature, that uses riboflavin as a cofactor (27Juárez O. Nilges M.J. Gillespie P. Cotton J. Barquera B. Riboflavin is an active redox cofactor in the Na+-pumping NADH: quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) from Vibrio cholerae.J. Biol.

Although the crystallographic data offers new clues about the location of this cofactor, its binding site remains unidentified. Na+-NQR belongs to a family of membrane-bound redox-driven pumps that has evolved independently from the main families of respiratory enzymes and ion pumps (8Reyes-Prieto A. Barquera B. Juárez O. Origin and evolution of the sodium-pumping NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase.PLoS One. 2014; 9e96696Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and it shows novel characteristics, such as distinctive folding patterns in some of its subunits (12Steuber J. Vohl G. Casutt M.S. Vorburger T. Diederichs K. Fritz G. Structure of the V. cholerae Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase.Nature. 2014; 516: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the use of riboflavin as a cofactor (27Juárez O. Nilges M.J. Gillespie P. Cotton J. Barquera B. Riboflavin is an active redox cofactor in the Na+-pumping NADH: quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) from Vibrio cholerae.J. Biol.

Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. Barquera B. Energy transducing redox steps of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12505-12510Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The studies that have been performed on this enzyme have clarified the stoichiometry of the reactions, the types of side reactions catalyzed by the enzyme, most substrate- and cofactor-binding sites, the pathway of electron transfer, the physicochemical properties of the cofactors, and some ofthe structures involved in sodium transport (4Verkhovsky M.I. Bogachev A.V. Sodium-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase as a redox-driven ion pump.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Juárez O. Barquera B.

Acta. 2012; 1817: 1823-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the kinetic reaction mechanism of the enzyme remains unclear. In this work, the pathways used by Na+-NQR to react with the redox substrates and transport sodium were studied. The data show that the enzyme follows a hexa-uni ping-pong mechanism, in which NADH reduces the enzyme and NAD leaves the binding site. This step is followed by the binding of two intracellular sodium ions, which are subsequently transported to the extracellular side of the membrane. In the last step, ubiquinone is bound, and ubiquinol is released before the next NADH molecule can react with the enzyme. Moreover, the data shown in this report allows the identification of the catalytically active redox states of Na+-NQR. The enzyme can adopt multiple redox states, due to the presence of the five cofactors (many of which can accommodate one or two electrons). To fully understand its reaction mechanism, we followed the pre-steady state pathways of electron transfer in the enzyme exposed to the three substrates. According to our data, the oxidized form of Na+-NQR (which carries one unpaired electron in riboflavin) is not active and reacts with one NADH molecule, producing the three-electron reduced form, which enters the catalytic cycle. The enzyme is then reduced by a second NADH molecule producing a transient five-electron reduced state, which is able to bind sodium. The one-electron reduction of the FMN cofactor in NqrC triggers the closing of the intracellular gates and promotes the transport of sodium. In the last step of the cycle, ubiquinone oxidizes the five-electron reduced form, producing the three-electron reduced state, which can continue the catalytic cycle. The data presented here are essential to understand the mechanism of the enzyme and to clarify different aspects of the current crystallographic structure, such as the number and properties of the conformational states. In these experiments, the full-length Na+-NQR complex produced in its natural host V. cholerae was characterized. The nqr operon was eliminated by homologous recombination, following the protocol described by Marvig and Blokesch (31Marvig R.L. Blokesch M. Natural transformation of Vibrio cholerae as a tool–optimizing the procedure.BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 155Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). O395N1 V. cholerae cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 32 mm MgCl2. The cells were harvested, washed, resuspended, and incubated for 20 h with 50 mg of chitin flakes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the exposure to chitin produces naturally competent V. cholerae cells that are able to uptake external DNA (32Meibom K.L. Blokesch M. Dolganov N.A. Wu C.-Y. Schoolnik G.K. Chitin induces natural competence in Vibrio cholerae.Science. 2005; 310: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The cells were washed one more time and incubated for 24 h with the donor DNA, consisting of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette and enhanced GFP sequence, flanked by 150 bases of the nqr operon (see below). The cells were plated, and the chloramphenicol-resistant fluorescent colonies were selected. The elimination of the operon was confirmed by PCR. To eliminate the nqr operon by homologous recombination, two regions of 150 bp flanking the operon were cloned and added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette and enhanced GFP sequence. The recombinant DNA was assembled together by Gibson cloning and inserted in pUC19 using the primers shown in Table 1. V. cholerae genomic DNA, pDK3 and pIND-GFP plasmids were used as templates, respectively. The recombinant DNA construct was amplified by PCR and used in the transformation.TABLE 1List of primers used in this studyCloned regionPrimers150 bp upstream nqrAForward, 5′-agtcgacctgcaggcatgcaTGATTTGTGATGGGATTTTTAAAAGGATGTTGC-3′Reverse, 5′-gtgccgatcaATTCGAGGCGCACTCCGTTTG-3′150 bp downstream nqrFForward, 5′-gtacaagtaaTCGATAACTCGCTACACTGCG-3′Reverse, 5′-ctatgaccatgattacgccaCTCGbHi8bXhDyMP2m1NDUSiYmznAJdJzX36DDTGG-3′Chloramphenicol resistance cassetteForward, 5′-cgcctcgaatTGATCGGCACGTAAGAGGTTC-3′Reverse, tgctcaccatTCATCGCAGTACTGTTGTATTCATTAAGC-3′Enhanced GFPForward, 5′-actgcgatgaATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′Reverse, 5′-gagttatcgaTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′nqr operonForward, 5′-TGbHi8bXxRWphv2nRe3js3W69CrMinNGtLdWyYrnnKzHR26vu4tF56iz-3′Reverse, 5′-TGbHi8bXxRWphv2nRe3js3W69CrGF8kKXvvmYtT4zNGqicXRjvuAnmmbvPZXCAGTAGG-3′ Open table in a new tab V. cholerae O395N1 cells were grown in LB medium for 12 h. The cells were harvested, and the total genomic DNA was obtained, using the GeneJet Genomic DNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific). The entire nqr operon was cloned by PCR and inserted in-frame into the 5′-XhoI and 3′-KpnI restriction enzyme sites of pBAD/HisB, using the primers listed in Table 1. The forward primer contained a stop codon to eliminate the histidine tag from the N terminus of the resulting protein and a ribosome-binding site. The reverse primer contained a spacer of four glycine residues followed by six histidine residues and a stop codon. The sequence of the cloned operon was confirmed by sequencing. V. cholerae O395N1 Δnqr cells harboring the nqr operon cloned in the pBAD/HisB vector were grown at 37 °C in LB medium and supplemented with 50 mm glucose, in 2-liter culture flasks, under constant agitation. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm PMSF, pH 7.5. The cells were resuspended and sonicated twice, and the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g to eliminate unbroken cells and cell debris, and the supernatant was applied directly to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The purification was performed as described previously (6Juárez O. Shea M.E. Makhatadze G.I. Barquera B. The role and specificity of the catalytic and regulatory cation-binding sites of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26383-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Na+-NQR activity was assayed spectrophotometrically, following the signal of NADH (340 nm) and ubiquinone-1 (CoQ-1, 282 nm), as reported previously (14Juárez O. Athearn K. Gillespie P. Barquera B. Acid residues in the transmembrane helices of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae involved in sodium translocation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9516-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the case of the experiments measuring the product inhibition by ubiquinol-1 (CoQH2-1), the reduction of ubiquinone was followed at 300 nm, due to the high absorption of CoQH2-1 at 282. At 300 nm, NADH and CoQ-1 molar absorptivity is similar (2.2 mm−1 cm−1) and the absorptivity of CoQH2-1 is relatively low (1 mm−1 cm−1). Additionally, we used cuvettes with a path length of 2 mm in these experiments, obtaining a clear signal of the activity, even at high concentrations of substrates and inhibitors. CoQH2-1 was prepared following the protocol described before (33Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A.

In these experiments, the concentrations of two substrates were varied, whereas the concentration of the third substrate was kept fixed and saturating. The data were globally fitted to the next equations, describing three different cases: ping-pong (Equation 1), random (Equation 2), or ordered mechanisms (Equation 3). v[ET]=kcat[A][B]Km,A[B]+Km,B[A]=[A][B](Eq. 1) v[ET]=kcat[A][B]Km,AKm,B+Km,A[B]+Km,B[A]+[A][B](Eq. 2) v[ET]=kcat[A][B]Km,AKm,B+Km,B[A]+[A][B](Eq. 3) A and B represent the two substrates tested in the reaction; kcat represents the catalytic constant of the enzyme; Km, A and Km, B represent the Michaelis constants for the substrates, and v/[ET] represents the turnover rate of the enzyme. To understand the order of reaction of the substrates with the enzyme, inhibition experiments were performed with the ubiquinone analog 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) (34Nakayama Y."

Xyn10C-XBD is folded into two separate CBM22 modules linked by a flexible segment that endows the tandem with extraordinary plasticity. Each isolated domain has been expressed and crystallized, and their binding abilities have been investigated. Both domains contain the R(W/Y)YYE motif required for xylan binding. However, crystallographic analysis of CBM22-2 complexes shows Trp-308 as an additional binding determinant.

Significance: Elucidating the mechanisms regulating specificity through multimodularity is crucial for producing efficient biocatalysts for biomass deconstruction. Plant cell walls are highly complicated constructions containing an intricate network of polymers that are recalcitrant to degradation. Moreover, they are very dynamic and change their structures and composition depending on cell development and environmental conditions. To cope with this extraordinary complexity, nature has created a large variety of enzymes that act synergistically to deconstruct biomass (1Gilbert H.J. The biochemistry and structural biology of plant cell wall deconstruction.Plant Physiol. 2010; 153: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). An interesting molecular mechanism developed by many plant cell wall hydrolases is their modular composition, with additional domains that increase accessibility of its catalytic partner to the substrate. Most of these supplementary domains are carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). 3The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate-binding modulea.u.asymmetric unitr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationRthXyn10BR. thermocellum xylanase 10BITCisothermal titration calorimetryBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPDBProtein Data Bank. Their presence in a broad range of hydrolases clearly highlights their functional importance, although their precise mode of action is still unknown. In fact, the occurrence of several copies of homologous CBMs within some enzymes suggests an additional subtle mechanism of regulation in enzymatic specificity. Structural studies from isolated CBMs have revealed that substrate recognition and binding by these domains are extremely specific. To understand the mechanism by which modularity enhances the interaction of enzymes with their substrate and to determine the functional relationship between carbohydrate binding and catalysis, more structural information on multiplicity is required at the atomic level. carbohydrate-binding module asymmetric unit root mean square deviation R. thermocellum xylanase 10B isothermal titration calorimetry 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol Protein Data Bank. CBMs are generally considered as noncatalytic modules that potentiate the activity of carbohydrate-active enzymes by bringing them in close proximity to their substrates. Most CBMs are part of modular carbohydrate hydrolases, although several examples of CBMs linked to cellulosomal scaffolding proteins or not linked to a hydrolase at all, i.e. the so-called “orphan CBMs,” have been described (2Abbott D.W. van Bueren A.L. Using structure to inform carbohydrate binding module function.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 28: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence similarity, they are classified into different families (CAZy); currently 71 are known, and the number is still increasing (3Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D490-D495Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar). CBMs show substantial differences in their ligand specificity and binding properties (4Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Carbohydrate-binding modules: fine-tuning polysaccharide recognition.Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 5Gilbert H.J. Knox J.P. Boraston A.B.

Biol. 2013; 23: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). They recognize and bind a diversity of plant carbohydrates, including crystalline and noncrystalline cellulose, soluble and insoluble xylan, chitin, β-glucans, mannan, galactan, and starch; moreover, some members of a few CBM families can recognize mammalian glycans (6Ficko-Blean E. Boraston A.B. Insights into the recognition of the human glycome by microbial carbohydrate-binding modules.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CBMs target enzymes to their specific substrates, enhancing carbohydrate degradation as a result of the increased local concentration of each enzyme around its substrate (4Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The frequent occurrence of CBMs with specificity for cellulose in enzymes, such as xylanases, without activity on this polysaccharide, can be explained by the close proximity of these two carbohydrates, cellulose and xylan, in cell wall structure in biomass (7Hervé C. Rogowski A. Blake A.W. Marcus S.E. Gilbert H.J. Knox J.P. Carbohydrate-binding modules promote the enzymatic deconstruction of intact plant cell walls by targeting and proximity effects.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In a similar way, CBMs of scaffolding proteins play an important role in the deconstruction of the plant cell wall by keeping the clustered catalytic components of cellulosomes in close proximity to the cell wall, yielding an enhanced and synergistic degradation of polysaccharides (8Fontes C.M.

Designer cellulosomes for enhanced hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 510: 429-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A previous proposal that CBMs may act by a disruptive mechanism that separates glycan chains from the cell wall (10Shoseyov O. Shani Z. Levy I. Carbohydrate binding modules: biochemical properties and novel applications.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) was supported by the finding of some CBM33s, not attached to enzymes, which disrupted chitin structure and promoted hydrolysis by chitinases (11Vaaje-Kolstad G. Horn S.J. van Aalten D.M. Synstad B. Eijsink V.G. The non-catalytic chitin-binding protein CBP21 from Serratia marcescens is essential for chitin degradation.J. Biol.

However, it has been recently shown that CBM33s constitute a new type of carbohydrate depolymerases that act by an oxidative mechanism and are reclassified in CAZy as auxiliary activity family 10 (12Vaaje-Kolstad G.

An oxidative enzyme boosting the enzymatic conversion of recalcitrant polysaccharides.Science. 2010; 330: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the analysis of some CBM35s showed that they display specificity for Δ4,5-anhydrogalacturonic acid, a signature molecule of plant cell wall degradation by pectate lyases, suggesting that CBMs of this family could direct the enzymes toward regions of the plant cell wall that are being actively degraded or remodeled (13Montanier C. van Bueren A.L.

In addition to targeting the catalytic modules to their substrates, CBMs probably have a more complex role in polysaccharides depolymerization, with additional functions to enable the deconstruction of the cell wall and the catalytic degradation of carbohydrates. CBMs of several families show specificity for xylan (2Abbott D.W. van Bueren A.L. Using structure to inform carbohydrate binding module function.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Xyn10C was previously characterized showing a distinctive modular structure containing an N-terminal tandem of two CBM22s and a duplicated CMB9 at its C terminus (25Blanco A. Díaz P. Zueco J.

In our study, we have solved the three-dimensional structure of the CBM22-1–CBM22-2 tandem, and its binding abilities have been investigated by soaking experiments, affinity gel electrophoresis, and ITC. In addition, the structure and binding features of the individual CBM22-1, CBM22-2, and the catalytic GH10 modules are reported. The results found contribute to deciphering the function of CBM22s and their contribution to xylan degradation. Further studies will be required to fully ascertain the role of CBM22 duplicity in catalytic depolymerization of xylan by their partner enzymes and in deconstruction of biomass. The respective forward and reverse primers used for all constructs are given in Table 1. The cDNA of Xyn10C was amplified from P. barcinonensis BP-23 genomic DNA (UniProt accession number O69230). The resulting plasmid pET28Xyn10C produced the full-length enzyme linked to an N-terminal His6 tag (Xyn10C). To maintain the His tag motif in the N terminus of the expressed protein, the first 28 residues of the sequence were not included in the DNA amplification because they correspond to the signal peptide that is cleaved in Escherichia coli hosts during protein translation. The plasmid vector pET28 was used to clone the GH10 catalytic domain fused to an N-terminal His6 tag (Xyn10C-CD). Both constructs (Xyn10C and Xyn10C-CD) were expressed and purified using a similar protocol. BLR (DE3) E. coli strain was transformed with the corresponding plasmid and grown in LB medium at 37 °C for 4 h until the A600 reached 0.8. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside followed by incubation for 15 h at 16 °C. Cells were disrupted by using a French press. The recombinant His6 tag proteins were purified from cell extracts by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using HisTrap HP columns of 5 ml (GE Healthcare) and eluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 ml of NaCl with a 0–500 mm imidazole gradient. For crystallization, it was necessary to cleave the His6 tag of Xyn10C-CD with thrombin (Sigma).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides employedProteinOrientationSequenceXyn10CF5′-GGAGAACATATGGCAAGCGCAGCG-3′R5′-TGGCGGATCCGAGCTTGAACA-3′Xyn10C-CDF5′-GATTCATATGGAAAAAAATATTCCG G-3′R5′-TGCGGATCCCTAATTTCGATATACG-3′Xyn10C-XBDF5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCAAGCGCAGCGAAGGCGG-3′R5′-GGCCTCGAGTTATTCAATAGCAATCGCTTCGG-3′CBM22–1F5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCAAGCGCAGCGAAGGCGG-3′R5′-GGCCTCGAGTTACGCAGCTTTAACGAGACGAATC-3′CBM22–2F5′-CGC GGATCCGGTGAGCCGGGAGAAGCAGGAC-3′R5′- GGCCTCGAGTTATTCAATAGCAATCGCTTCGG-3′ Open table in a new tab The regions encoding for the N-terminal domain, Xyn10C-XBD, and the CBM22-1 and CBM22-2 modules were also amplified and cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (GE Healthcare). The GST-fused protein expression was performed under similar conditions to those described above, except the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain was employed. All constructs were purified using a similar protocol. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) and disrupted through sonication. The clarified cell lysates were mixed with 10 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the target protein was cleaved from resin-bound GST by incubating with thrombin overnight. Eluted protein was diluted to 50 mm NaCl and loaded to a 5-ml anionic exchange column (HiTrap Q HP; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8). After washing with buffer B, the protein was eluted using a gradient between 50 and 500 mm NaCl. In the case of Xyn10C-XBD, the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. The protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE in all cases. Pure proteins were concentrated and frozen at −80 °C until use. Binding activity to insoluble polysaccharides was assessed as described by Hogg et al. (26Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martín-Orúe S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J.

Briefly, 250 μg of purified Xyn10C, Xyn10C-XBD, or Xyn10C-CD was mixed with 25 mg of Avicel or insoluble oat spelt xylan in a final volume of 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7, in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle orbital mixing. Samples were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants, containing unbound protein, were carefully removed. Pellets were washed three times with 400 μl of the same buffer, before being resuspended in 400 μl of 10% SDS and boiled for 10 min to release bound protein. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8 or 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Affinity gel electrophoresis was performed by following the method of Correia et al. (27Correia M.A. Abbott D.W. Gloster T.M. Fernandes V.O. Prates J.A. Montanier C. Dumon C. Williamson M.P. Tunnicliffe R.B. Liu Z. Flint J.E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. Signature active site architectures illuminate the molecular basis for ligand specificity in family 35 carbohydrate binding module.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6193-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Continuous native polyacrylamide gels containing 10% acrylamide in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.3, were used. Soluble xylan (4 mg/ml) was included in gels before polymerization. Gels, with and without xylan, were polymerized at the same time and run in the same gel tank. About 6 μg of target protein was loaded in each well at room temperature, and gels were run at 10 mA/gel for 2 h. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative noninteracting control. To analyze the electrophoretic homogeneity of purified proteins, SDS-PAGE was performed in 15% (w/v) (for CBM22-1 and CBM22-2) and 12% (w/v) (for Xyn10C-XBD) polyacrylamide gels essentially as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar). For detection of xylanase activity, zymogram analysis was performed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.2% (w/v) birchwood xylan. Samples were heated for 10 min at 45 °C in sample buffer before being applied to gels. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min, washed in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 30 min, and incubated at 45 °C for 2 h in the same buffer. Gels were then stained with 0.1% (w/v) Congo red for 15 min and washed with 1 m NaCl until xylanase bands became visible, as described previously (29Valenzuela S.V. Díaz P. Javier Pastor F.I. Recombinant expression of an alkali stable GH10 xylanase from Paenibacillus barcinonensis.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 4814-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Gels were then immersed in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and photographed. ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCal VP-ITC (GE Healthcare). The samples were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, and ligand solutions were prepared using the same buffer. All samples were thoroughly degassed before use. Titrations were carried out by injecting consecutive aliquots of 10–20 mm oligosaccharide or 4 mg/ml xylan oat spelt polysaccharide into the sample cell loaded with protein at 50–65 μm. For mixed oligosaccharide and xylan oat spelt, two consecutive titrations were carried out with the same protein solution, and the CONCAT32 program (GE Healthcare) was used to concatenate the raw data of both series. Heat developed on ligand dilution was determined separately and subtracted when required. The binding constants (K) and the enthalpies (ΔH) of binding were calculated by analyzing the binding isotherms with the MicroCal ITC Origin software, assuming one carbohydrate-binding site per domain, based on the structural data and xylan binding capacity of the isolated domains. The entropic contribution to ligand binding was calculated using Gibbs equation (ΔG = −RTlnK = ΔH − TΔS). The molar concentration of binding sites in the polysaccharide was set to the value that after iteration gave a number of sites per CBM22 domain equal to 1. The oligosaccharides were purchased from Megazyme. The mixed oligosaccharides used were 1,3:1,4-β-glucotetraose A (Glc-3Glc-4Glc-4Glc), B (Glc-4Glc-4Glc-3Glc), and C (Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc). Sedimentation velocity experiments were run at 45,000 rpm using cells with double sector Epon-charcoal centerpieces. Differential sedimentation coefficients were calculated by least squares boundary modeling of the experimental data with the program SEDFIT. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at different rotor speeds, as described previously (30Monterroso B. Sáiz J.L. García P. García J.L. Menéndez M. Insights into the structure-function relationships of pneumococcal cell wall lysozymes, LytC and Cpl-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28618-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the weight-average molecular weights were calculated using the heteroanalysis program (Biotechnology-Bioservices Center, University of Connecticut). Measurements were performed at 20 °C in an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) using Xyn10C-XBD (5.3–24.3 μm) or CBM22-1 (17.3 μm) in ITC buffer (with and without 3 mm xylotetraose). Partial specific volumes were calculated from the amino acid sequences with the SEDNTERP program. Crystals of Xyn10C-XBD were grown from 47 mg/ml protein, 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m NaCl, 2% (v/v) 1,6-hexanediol, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, using the streak-seeding technique. Very thin plates grew by vapor diffusion at room temperature, as described before (31Sainz-Polo M.Á. González B. Pastor F.I. Sanz-Aparicio J. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the N-terminal domain of Paenibacillus barcinonensis xylanase 10C containing the CBM22-1–CBM22-2 tandem.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2015; 71: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). For data collection, crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions consisting of mother liquor plus 20% (v/v) glycerol before being cooled in liquid nitrogen. Screening of crystallization conditions for the isolated CBM22s and Xyn10C-CD domains was performed with thePACT and the JCSG Suites from Qiagen and INDEX and SALTRXfrom Hampton Research. Crystals from CBM22-1 appeared in solutions containing either PEG 1500 or PEG 3350 with pH 5.5–7.0. Further optimization was performed at room temperature and the vapor diffusion method by mixing 29 mg/ml protein sample (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 125 mm NaCl) and an equal volume of different reservoir solutions in a sitting-drop procedure. Large crystals grew from 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.2 m NaNO3, with a 1.5:1 ratio of protein/precipitant, reaching maximum size in 10 days. Treatment with different cryoprotectants as glycerol, PEG 400, or xylose seemed to greatly affect the crystal integrity, with only a very fast soaking into 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol being tolerated and thus allowing collection of high quality data (Table 2). Soaking with ligand solutions damaged crystals, and co-crystallization experiments were unsuccessful, therefore precluding analysis of complexes.TABLE 2Crystallographic dataCrystal dataXyn10C-XBDCBM22-1CBM22-2CBM22-2/Xyl4CBM22-2/Xyl3CBM22-2/Glc-4Glc-4Glc-3GlcXyn10C-CDSpace groupP 21H3P32P32P32P32P32Unit cella (Å)84.1785.3592.5492.7792.4692.48126.69b (Å)110.3685.3592.5492.7792.4692.48126.69c (Å)118.52108.4648.4048.5748.4348.3857.70γ (°)90.63Data collectionBeamlineID29(ESRF)ID23–2(ESRF)ID23–2(ESRF)ID23–2(ESRF)BL13-XALOC (ALBA)BL13-XALOC (ALBA)ID23–1 (ESRF)Wavelength (Å)0.9792350.87290.87290.87290.97950.97950.9801Resolution (Å)84.16-2.43 (2.48-2.43)30.54-1.70 (1.79-1.70)33.45-1.75 (1.84-1.75)33.55-1.67 (1.76-1.67)48.42-1.95 (2.05-1.95)48.38-1.80 (1.90-1.80)36.57-1.76 (1.86-1.76)Data processingTotal reflections510618 (29165)184811 (26283)272776 (39214)307899 (41596)315365 (44621)393762 (54642)56757"
https://openalex.org/W1535169624,"Post-mitotic neurons are generated from neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at the expense of their proliferation. Molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate neuron production temporally and spatially should impact on the size and shape of the brain. While transcription factors such as neurogenin1 (neurog1) and neurod govern progression of neurogenesis as cell-intrinsic mechanisms, recent studies show regulatory roles of several cell-extrinsic or intercellular signaling molecules including Notch, FGF and Wnt in production of neurons/neural progenitor cells from neural stem cells/radial glial cells (NSCs/RGCs) in the ventricular zone (VZ). However, it remains elusive how production of post-mitotic neurons from neural progenitor cells is regulated in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). Here we show that newborn neurons accumulate in the basal-to-apical direction in the optic tectum (OT) of zebrafish embryos. While neural progenitor cells are amplified by mitoses in the apical ventricular zone, neurons are exclusively produced through mitoses of neural progenitor cells in the sub-basal zone, later in the sub-ventricular zone, and accumulate apically onto older neurons. This neurogenesis depends on Neuregulin 1 type II (NRG1-II)-ErbB signaling. Treatment with an ErbB inhibitor, AG1478 impairs mitoses in the sub-ventricular zone of the optic tectum. Removal of AG1478 resumes sub-ventricular mitoses without precedent mitoses in the apical ventricular zone prior to basal-to-apical accumulation of neurons, suggesting critical roles of ErbB signaling in mitoses for post-mitotic neuron production. Knockdown of NRG1-II impairs both mitoses in the sub-basal/sub-ventricular zone and the ventricular zone. Injection of soluble human NRG1 into the developing brain ameliorates neurogenesis of NRG1-II-knockdown embryos, suggesting a conserved role of NRG1 as a cell-extrinsic signal. From these results, we propose that NRG1-ErbB signaling stimulates cell divisions generating neurons from neural progenitor cells in the developing vertebrate brain."
https://openalex.org/W1561800733,"Highly soluble salts are undesirable in agriculture because they reduce yields or the quality of most cash crops and can leak to surface or sub-surface waters. In some cases salinity can be associated with unique history, rarity, or special habitats protected by environmental laws. Yet in considering the measurement of soil salinity for long-term monitoring purposes, adequate methods are required. Both saturated paste extracts, intended for agriculture, and direct surface and/or porewater salinity measurement, used in inundated wetlands, are unsuited for hypersaline wetlands that often are only occasionally inundated. For these cases, we propose the use of 1:5 soil/water (weight/weight) extracts as the standard for expressing the electrical conductivity (EC) of such soils and for further salt determinations. We also propose checking for ion-pairing with a 1:10 or more diluted extract in hypersaline soils. As an illustration, we apply the two-dilutions approach to a set of 359 soil samples from saline wetlands ranging in ECe from 2.3 dS m(-1) to 183.0 dS m(-1). This easy procedure will be useful in survey campaigns and in the monitoring of soil salt content."
https://openalex.org/W1484073845,"This study investigates whether knee position affects the amplitude distribution of surface electromyogram (EMG) in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle. Of further concern is understanding whether knee-induced changes in EMG amplitude distribution are associated with regional changes in MG fibre length. Fifteen surface EMGs were acquired proximo-distally from the MG muscle while 22 (13 male) healthy participants (age range: 23–47 years) exerted isometric plantar flexion at 60% of their maximal effort, with knee fully extended and at 90 degrees flexion. The number of channels providing EMGs with greatest amplitude, their relative proximo-distal position and the EMG amplitude averaged over channels were considered to characterise changes in myoelectric activity with knee position. From ultrasound images, collected at rest, fibre length, pennation angle and fat thickness were computed for MG proximo-distal regions. Surface EMGs detected with knee flexed were on average five times smaller than those collected during knee extended. However, during knee flexed, relatively larger EMGs were detected by a dramatically greater number of channels, centred at the MG more proximal regions. Variation in knee position at rest did not affect the proximo-distal values obtained for MG fibre length, pennation angle and fat thickness. Our main findings revealed that, with knee flexion: i) there is a redistribution of activity within the whole MG muscle; ii) EMGs detected locally unlikely suffice to characterise the changes in the neural drive to MG during isometric contractions at knee fully extended and 90 degrees flexed positions; iii) sources other than fibre length may substantially contribute to determining the net, MG activation."
https://openalex.org/W1497847102,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious pathogen that jeopardises the world's most important food-security crop. Ten common Malaysian rice varieties were examined for their morphological, physiological and genomic responses to this rice blast pathogen. qPCR quantification was used to assess the growth of the pathogen population in resistant and susceptible rice varieties. The chlorophyll content and photosynthesis were also measured to further understand the disruptive effects that M. oryzae has on infected plants of these varieties. Real-time PCR was used to explore the differential expression of eight blast resistance genes among the ten local varieties. Blast disease has destructive effects on the growth of rice, and the findings of our study provide evidence that the Pikh, Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes are involved in defence responses in the leaves of Malaysian rice at 31 h after inoculation with M. oryzae pathotype P7.2. Both the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis were reduced, but the levels of Pikh gene expression remained constant in susceptible varieties, with a developed pathogen population and mild or severe symptoms. The Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes, however, were simultaneously upregulated in infected rice plants. Therefore, the presence of the Pikh, Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes in the germplasm is useful for improving the resistance of rice varieties."

The potential of mating interference between these species was investigated by reciprocal and homologous mating experiments in cages under laboratory conditions.

Cretinus males in the co-occurrence of Ae. Cretinus females was weaker (4%). Aedes cretinus females from non-choice crossing with Ae. Albopictus or Ae. Cretinus males were paired individually with conspecific males. The percentage of fertile Ae. Cretinus females was 17.5% when had encaged before with Ae. Albopictus males, compared to 100% when Ae. Cretinus females were encaged with conspecific males only. Probable ecological consequences of asymmetric mating between these ecologically homologous species in nature are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1557326806,"Vertebral column resection is associated with a risk of spinal cord injury. In the present study, using a goat model, we aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in spinal cord volume and spinal cord injury due to spinal shortening, and to quantify the spinal cord volume per 1-mm height in order to clarify a safe limit for shortening. Vertebral column resection was performed at T10 in 10 goats. The spinal cord was shortened until the somatosensory-evoked potential was decreased by 50% from the baseline amplitude or delayed by 10% relative to the baseline peak latency. A wake-up test was performed, and the goats were observed for two days postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the spinal cord volume, T10 height, disc height, osteotomy segment height, and spinal segment height pre- and postoperatively. Two of the 10 goats were excluded, and hence, only data from eight goats were analyzed. The somatosensory-evoked potential of these eight goats demonstrated meaningful changes. With regard to neurologic function, five and three goats were classified as Tarlov grades 5 and 4 at two days postoperatively. The mean shortening distance was 23.6 ± 1.51 mm, which correlated with the d-value (post-pre) of the spinal cord volume per 1-mm height of the osteotomy segment (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) and with the height of the T10 body (r = 0.79, p = 0.02). The mean d-value (post-pre) of the spinal cord volume per 1-mm height of the osteotomy segment was 142.87 ± 0.59 mm3 (range, 142.19-143.67 mm3). The limit for shortening was approximately 106% of the vertebral height. The mean volumes of the osteotomy and spinal segments did not significantly change after surgery (t = 0.310, p = 0.765 and t = 1.241, p = 0.255, respectively). Thus, our results indicate that the safe limit for shortening can be calculated using the change in spinal cord volume per 1-mm height."
https://openalex.org/W379443160,"Flooding is a major threat to agricultural production. Most studies have focused on the lower water storage limit in rice fields, whereas few studies have examined the upper water storage limit. This study aimed to explore the effect of waterlogging at the rice tillering stage on rice growth and yield. The early-ripening late japonica variety Yangjing 4227 was selected for this study. The treatments included different submergence depths (submergence depth/plant height: 1/2 (waist submergence), 2/3 (neck submergence), and 1/1 (complete submergence)) and durations (1, 3, and 5 d). The control group was treated with the conventional alternation of drying and wetting. The effects of waterlogging at the tillering stage on root characteristics, dry matter production, nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation, yield, yield components, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) gene expression were explored. Compared with the control group, the 1/1 group showed significant increases in yield, seed-setting rate, photosynthetically efficient leaf area, and OS-ACS3 gene expression after 1 d of submergence. The grain number per panicle, dry weight of the aboveground and belowground parts, and number of adventitious roots also increased. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the panicle number and nitrogen content; however, no significant correlation was found for phosphorus content. If a decrease in rice yield of less than 10% is acceptable, half, 2/3, and complete submergence of the plants can be performed at the tillering stage for 1-3 d; this treatment will increase the space available for rice field water management/control and will improve rainfall resource utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1485061638,"Background TREK-1 deficient alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) secrete less IL-6, more MCP-1, and contain less F-actin. Whether these alterations in cytokine secretion and F-actin content are related remains unknown. We now hypothesized that cytokine secretion from TREK-1-deficient AECs was regulated by cytoskeletal rearrangements. Methods We determined F-actin and α-tubulin contents of control, TREK-1-deficient and TREK-1-overexpressing human A549 cells by confocal microscopy and western blotting, and measured IL-6 and MCP-1 levels using real-time PCR and ELISA. Results Cytochalasin D decreased the F-actin content of control cells. Jasplakinolide increased the F-actin content of TREK-1 deficient cells, similar to the effect of TREK-1 overexpression in control cells. Treatment of control and TREK-1 deficient cells with TNF-α, a strong stimulus for IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion, had no effect on F-actin structures. The combination of TNF-α+cytochalasin D or TNF-α+jasplakinolide had no additional effect on the F-actin content or architecture when compared to cytochalasin D or jasplakinolide alone. Although TREK-1 deficient AECs contained less F-actin at baseline, quantified biochemically, they contained more α-tubulin. Exposure to nocodazole disrupted α-tubulin filaments in control and TREK-1 deficient cells, but left the overall amount of α-tubulin unchanged. Although TNF-α had no effect on the F-actin or α-tubulin contents, it increased IL-6 and MCP-1 production and secretion from control and TREK-1 deficient cells. IL-6 and MCP-1 secretions from control and TREK-1 deficient cells after TNF-α+jasplakinolide or TNF-α+nocodazole treatment was similar to the effect of TNF-α alone. Interestingly, cytochalasin D decreased TNF-α-induced IL-6 but not MCP-1 secretion from control but not TREK-1 deficient cells. Conclusion Although cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide and nocodazole altered the F-actin and α-tubulin structures of control and TREK-1 deficient AEC, the changes in cytokine secretion from TREK-1 deficient cells cannot be explained by cytoskeletal rearrangements in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1534968336,"The anterior-posterior patterning of the vertebrate limb bud requires closely coordinated signaling interactions, including Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-mediated counteraction of the Gli3 transcription factor in the distal and posterior mesenchyme of the limb bud. Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), an intracellular negative regulator of Shh signaling via Gli2 and Gli3, is implicated in early development of the mouse limb bud. However, how Sufu is involved in the genetic regulation of limb bud patterning still remains elusive. In this study, we show that the conditional deletion of Sufu in the mesenchyme of the early limb bud results in polydactyly with loss of digit identity and supernumerary bones in the wrist and the ankle. These pattern alterations are associated with anterior expansion of HoxD genes located at the 5' end of the cluster. By focusing on gene expression analysis of Shh/Gremlin1/Fgf signaling critical for the establishment and maintenance of anterior-posterior patterning, we show that early response to loss of Sufu involves anterior prolongation of Fgf4 and Fgf8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge at E10.5. We also reveal the anterior activation of Shh-dependent posterior markers Ptc1, Gli1 and Gremlin in limb buds lacking Sufu. Furthermore, we find that loss of Sufu leads to attenuated levels of repressor Gli2 and repressor Gli3 in the early limb bud. Moreover, expression of Hand2 is activated in the entire limb bud at the early outgrowth stage in the mutant lacking Sufu. Thus, we provide evidence that Sufu is involved in the genetic network that restricts the posterior expression of Gli2/3/Hand2 and Gremlin/Fgf in limb bud patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1524850305,"This paper presents the application of an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) based on neural networks combined with Fuzzy Logic systems to classify physiological reactions of subjects performing robot-assisted rehabilitation therapies. First, the theoretical background of a neuro-fuzzy classifier called S-dFasArt is presented. Then, the methodology and experimental protocols to perform a robot-assisted neurorehabilitation task are described. Our results show that the combination of the dynamic nature of S-dFasArt classifier with a supervisory module are very robust and suggest that this methodology could be very useful to take into account emotional states in robot-assisted environments and help to enhance and better understand human-robot interactions."
https://openalex.org/W335768012,"Despite observational evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies associating sex hormones with various cardiometabolic risk factors or diseases, pathophysiological explanations are sparse to date. To reveal putative functional insights, we analyzed associations between sex hormone levels and whole blood gene expression profiles.We used data of 991 individuals from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND) with whole blood gene expression levels determined by array-based transcriptional profiling and serum concentrations of total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free testosterone (free T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (AD), estradiol (E2), and estrone (E1) measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immunoassay. Associations between sex hormone concentrations and gene expression profiles were analyzed using sex-specific regression models adjusted for age, body mass index, and technical covariables.In men, positive correlations were detected between AD and DDIT4 mRNA levels, as well as between SHBG and the mRNA levels of RPIA, RIOK3, GYPB, BPGM, and RAB2B. No additional significant associations were observed.Besides the associations between AD and DDIT4 expression and SHBG and the transcript levels of RPIA, RIOK3, GYPB, BPGM, and RAB2B, the present study did not indicate any association between sex hormone concentrations and whole blood gene expression profiles in men and women from the general population."
