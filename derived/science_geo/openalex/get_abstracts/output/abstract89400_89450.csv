https://openalex.org/W1964537647,"Endothelial cells from human blood vessels were cultured in vitro, with doubling times of 17 to 21 hours for 42 to 79 population doublings. Cloned human endothelial cell strains were established for the first time and had similar proliferative capacities. This vigorous cell growth was achieved by addition of heparin to culture medium containing reduced concentrations of endothelial cell growth factor. The routine cloning and long-term culture of human endothelial cells will facilitate studying the human endothelium in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2072884289,"Human neutrophils were found to generate an unusual class of oxidants with a half-life of approximately 18 hours and with characteristics similar to, if not identical with, those of N-chloroamines. These neutrophil-derived N-chloroamines have sufficient oxidizing potential to attack sulfhydryl- or thioether-containing compounds and can react with both a methionine-containing chemotactic peptide and a plasma protease inhibitor. As judged by their stability and selective reactivity, the N-chloroamines generated by stimulated neutrophils may play an important role in the local and systemic regulation of inflammatory events in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1971020206,"One of two mouse monoclonal antibodies (LK2H10) produced by hybridoma technology against a human endocrine tumor (pheochromocytoma) demonstrated specific immunoreactivity for 69 normal and neoplastic endocrine and tissues known to contain secretory granules. This immunoreactivity was specific, since other normal tissues, tumors from endocrine cells without granules, and tumors from other nonendocrine tissues were negative when tested with antibody LK2H10. The antibody reacted with human fetal adrenal medulla and human pancreatic endocrine cells and with adrenal medullary cells from monkeys and pigs. The antigen detected by antibody LK2H10 is associated with cytoplasmic secretory granules, has an estimated molecular weight of 68,000, and may be related to human chromogranin."
https://openalex.org/W1501736937,"In the previous paper (Block, M. A., Dorne, A.-J., Joyard, J., and Douce, R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13273-13280), we have described a method for the separation of membrane fractions enriched in outer and inner envelope membranes from spinach chloroplasts. The two envelope membranes have a different weight ratio of acyl lipid to protein (2.5-3 for the outer envelope membrane and 0.8-1 for the inner envelope membrane). The two membranes also differ in their polar lipid composition. However, in order to prevent the functioning of the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase during the course of envelope membrane separation, we have analyzed the polar lipid composition of each envelope membrane after thermolysin treatment of the intact chloroplasts. The outer envelope membrane is characterized by the presence of high amounts of phosphatidylcholine and digalactosyldiacylglycerol whereas the inner envelope membrane has a polar lipid composition almost identical with that of the thykaloids. No phosphatidylethanolamine or cardiolipin could be detected in either envelope membranes, thus demonstrating that the envelope membranes, and especially the outer membrane, do not resemble extrachloroplastic membranes. No striking differences were found in the fatty acid composition of the polar lipids from either the outer or the inner envelope membrane. The two envelope membranes also differ in their carotenoid composition. Among the different enzymatic activities associated with the chloroplast envelope, we have shown that the Mg2+-dependent ATPase, the UDP-Gal:diacylglycerol galactosyltransferase, the phosphatidic acid phosphatase, and the acyl-CoA thioesterase are associated with the inner envelope from spinach chloroplasts whereas the acyl-CoA synthetase is located on the outer envelope membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1615397418,"Purified isoforms of rat liver apometallothionein were reconstituted in vitro with Cd and Zn ions to study the order of binding of the 7 metal sites in the two separate metal clusters, one containing four metal ions (cluster A) and the other containing three (cluster B). Reconstitution with 7 Cd ions resulted in a metalloprotein similar to induced Cd,Zn-metallothionein by the criteria of electrophoretic mobility, insensitivity to proteolysis by subtilisin, and the pH-dependent release of Cd. Proteolytic digestion of metallothionein reconstituted with suboptimal quantities of Cd followed by separation of Cd-containing polypeptide fragments by electrophoresis and chromatography revealed metal ion binding initially occurs in the 4-metal center, cluster A. Upon saturation of the 4 sites in cluster A, binding occurs in the 3-metal center, cluster B. Samples reconstituted with 1 to 4 Cd ions per protein molecule, followed by digestion with subtilisin, yielded increasing amounts of a proteolytically stable polypeptide fragment identical with the alpha fragment domain that is known to encompass the 4-metal center. Samples renatured with 5 to 7 Cd ions per metallothionein molecule showed decreasing quantities of alpha fragment and increasing amounts of native-like metallothionein. Similar results were obtained in reconstitution studies with Zn ions. Samples reconstituted with 7 Cd eq followed by incubation with EDTA revealed that cluster B Cd ions were removed initially. The binding process in each domain is cooperative. Reconstitution of apometallothionein with 2 Cd ions followed by proteolysis yields a 50% recovery of saturated Cd4 alpha cluster. Likewise, when Cd5-renatured metallothionein was digested with subtilisin, 30% of the molecules were identified as Cd7 metallothionein with the remainder as Cd4 alpha fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1968722941,"Transplantation of embryonic substantia nigra into the adult rat brain decreases the motor asymmetry that is produced by dopamine receptor supersensitivity after a unilateral lesion of the substantia nigra. The authors report that this effect of transplantation is specific to grafts of substantia nigra. They also report that, in conjunction with the decrease in motor asymmetry, these grafts cause postsynaptic dopaminergic binding sites to return to normal density as measured by tritiated spiroperidol autoradiography. Thus, in animals with brain lesions, grafts of substantia nigra produce a long-term alteration in the functional status of host brain cell receptors that is associated with a reduction in the behavioral deficit."

https://openalex.org/W1558285759,"The amino acid sequence of the Mr = 23,000 peptide that is generated by limited tryptic digestion of rabbit skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin was determined. This fragment represents the NH2-terminal 204 residues of the heavy chain of myosin, and its sequence is (formula; see text) This peptide contains the lysine residue (Lys 83) whose reaction with 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzenesulfonate alters the enzymatic activity of myosin, as well as two types of methylated lysines. Position 34 is occupied by epsilon-N-monomethyllysine and lysine in an approximate 60:40 ratio, while position 129 is fully occupied by one of the two epsilon-N-trimethyllysines in myosin heavy chain. There is evidence suggesting that this fragment contains residues that contribute to the ATP-binding site of myosin; the sequence surrounding the epsilon-N-trimethyllysine is devoid of charges and could form a hydrophobic pocket for binding of the adenine moiety while the epsilon-N-trimethyllysine, which carries a positive charge at all pH values, could bind an ATP phosphate group."
https://openalex.org/W1581988395,"A highly unusual endothelial cell collagen (Sage, H., Pritzl, P., and Bornstein, P., (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5747-5755) has been characterized in greater detail. Pulse-chase experiments with bovine aortic endothelial cells revealed two nondisulfide-bonded collagens, of apparent chain Mr = 177,000 and 125,000, with an estimated synthesis and secretion time of 75 min. Stepwise, quantitative processing to stable lower molecular weight forms as described for type I procollagen was not observed. Endothelial collagen was secreted over a temperature range of 24-37 degrees C and, prior to heat denaturation, did not display affinity for a gelatin-binding fragment of fibronectin coupled to Sepharose. The presence of a pepsin-resistant domain (Mr = 50,000) in both the soluble and cell layer-associated forms of this protein was shown by ion exchange chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Endothelial collagen was cleaved by vertebrate collagenase into several discrete fragments that differed in molecular weight from the characteristic alpha A and alpha B fragments generated from the interstitial collagens. Nontriple helical domains corresponding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal propeptides of other procollagen types were not found after incubation of endothelial collagen with bacterial collagenase. Additional evidence for the lack of extended noncollagenous sequences was provided by studies with mast cell proteases, which convert native procollagen to collagen but are unreactive toward native interstitial collagens. Endothelial collagen was not cleaved by these enzymes at 37 degrees C, but, as observed for interstitial collagen alpha chains, required prior heating at elevated temperatures for cleavage to occur. In view of this unique set of structural characteristics, and a distribution that is not restricted to the endothelium, we have designated this protein as type VIII collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1599348190,"Ascorbic acid was found to be secreted from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells coincidentally with catecholamines using a variety of secretagogues, including veratridine, nicotine, acetylcholine, and potassium chloride. Secretion of ascorbic acid was measured by preloading the cells for 3 h with (R)-[14C]ascorbic acid and then quantitating release of the label. The newly transported ascorbic acid constituted nearly 90% of total cellular ascorbic acid. Although chromaffin granules are known to contain endogenous ascorbic acid, only 16% of the total labeled ascorbic acid taken up by cultured cells was localized to the chromaffin granule fraction. Under the same isolation conditions, 95% of the endogenous catecholamines was found in the granule fraction. The secretion of both (R)-[14C] ascorbic acid and catecholamines was calcium dependent. However, only catecholamine secretion was effectively inhibited by the presence in the medium of isethionate, an impermeant ion that inhibits catecholamine secretion from isolated chromaffin granules. Analysis of the ratios of cellular and granular (R)-[14C] ascorbate as well as secreted (R)-[14C]ascorbate and catecholamines revealed that the secreted (R)-[14C]ascorbic acid did not come exclusively from the chromaffin granule fraction but also from a nonsedimenting cytoplasmic compartment. Indeed, for all four agonists, the amounts of (R)-[14C]ascorbic acid secreted were more than 1.5 times greater than could be accounted for by chromaffin granule ascorbate alone. We took these data to indicate that, while ascorbic acid and catecholamines were secreted concomitantly, the sources of the secreted substances were not necessarily identical."
https://openalex.org/W2022266878,"The effects of ionizing radiation on glutamate dehydrogenase and on fluorescein isothiocyanate--tagged glutamate dehydrogenase were analyzed by target theory. Enzymatic activity, fluorescence, and the survival of the 56,000-dalton monomer subunit were determined on frozen samples irradiated at -135 degrees C and on lyophilized samples irradiated at either -135 degrees C or +30 degrees C. The effects of temperature were the same for all three parameters. Enzymatic activity was lost after small doses of high-energy electrons, whereas fluorescence and monomer subunits survived much larger doses of radiation. Target analysis revealed that the functional unit size for enzymatic activity was the hexamer, confirming both the earlier radiation study and conventional biochemical analyses. Target sizes obtained from fluorescence and subunit structure measurements were close to that of the monomer. These results indicate that the primary ionization caused by electron bombardment results in damage to a single polypeptide strand and that there is no massive transfer of radiation energy to other units in the hexamer. The large target size observed for enzymatic activity appears to be a structural requirement for the simultaneous presence of six intact subunits rather than the result of the spread of energy from the initial site to adjacent chains with consequent damage to other subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1973767753,"It is a fundamental principle of vertebrate neuronal organization that sensory fibers are restricted to dorsal roots and motor fibers to ventral roots. Recent evidence, however, indicates that there are many sensory fibers in ventral roots. The present report shows that stimulation of these fibers activates neurons in the dorsal horn. This provides evidence at the single-cell level for the importance of ventral root afferents and provides an explanation for the clinical phenomenon of recurrent sensibility."
https://openalex.org/W1543434098,"Abstract Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation of glycoprotein, has been used here to examine the role of N-linked oligosaccharides in secretion of ZP2 and ZP3, two of the three glycoproteins that constitute the mouse egg's extracellular coat (zona pellucida). In the absence of tunicamycin, growing mouse oocytes cultured in vitro synthesize a 91,000-Mr ZP2 precursor and 53,000 and 56,000 Mr ZP3 precursors. All of these precursors contain high mannose-type oligosaccharides that are processed to complex-type prior to secretion of mature ZP2 (120,000 Mr) and ZP3 (80,000 Mr) (Greve, J. M., Salzmann, G. S., Roller, R. J., and Wassarman, P. M. (1982) Cell 31, 749-759; Salzmann, G. S., Greve, J. M., Roller, R. J., and Wassarman, P. M. (1983) Eur. Mol. Biol. Org. J. 2, 1451-1456). In the presence of 5 micrograms/ml of tunicamycin, growing oocytes cultured in vitro are unable to carry out core glycosylation of nascent ZP2 and ZP3. Consequently, under these conditions, ZP2 and ZP3 appear as 81,000 and 44,000 Mr polypeptide chains, respectively. The apparent rates of synthesis of core-glycosylated ZP2 and ZP3 precursors synthesized in the absence of tunicamycin and of precursors synthesized in the presence of the drug are virtually identical. On the other hand, in the presence of tunicamycin, nascent ZP3 is incorporated into the zona pellucida as an extremely heterogeneous species (approximately equal to 51,000 Mr) at about three times the rate observed for mature ZP3 in the absence of tunicamycin. In the presence of tunicamycin, ZP2 is incorporated into the zona pellucida as 81,000 and 76,000 Mr species at about one-sixth the rate observed for mature ZP2 in the absence of the drug. Results of pulse-chase experiments indicate that the low degree of incorporation of ZP2 lacking N-linked oligosaccharides into the zona pellucida is due to a greatly decreased rate of secretion as compared to the core-glycosylated precursor. ZP2 synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin is relatively stable and accumulates intracellularly. These results suggest that N-linked oligosaccharides are necessary for normal secretion of ZP2, but are probably not necessary for ZP3 secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1601940893,"The ejaculated porcine spermatozoa were fractionated into the cytosol, membrane, midpiece plus tail (flagella) and head fractions, and their adenylate cyclase activities were measured. About 65% of the total activity was located in the flagella fraction. For all the fractions, Mn2+-dependent adenylate cyclase activity was about 20 times higher than Mg2+-dependent activity, and guanine nucleotides, fluoride, and other reagents tested did not activate adenylate cyclase. The results suggest that the GTP-dependent regulatory subunit is absent in porcine spermatozoa. The porcine seminal plasma was found to stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity in spermatozoa. The stimulating factor in porcine seminal plasma was partially purified by gel filtration and the molecular weight of the factor appeared to be between 200 and 300. The partially purified factor is heat stable and is not inactivated by treatment with Pronase, trypsin, phospholipase A2 or D but is inactivated by acid hydrolysis. It is easily soluble in water, partially soluble in methanol, and insoluble in ethanol, ethyl ether, chloroform, or acetone. The activation of sperm adenylate cyclase by the factor occurred without a time lag. The activating effect was dose-dependent, saturated at high dose, and ascribed to the increase of the maximal velocity (Vmax). The effect of the factor appears to be limited to adenylate cyclase in spermatozoa; the factor activated adenylate cyclase both in porcine and bovine spermatozoa but failed to activate those in other porcine tissues. The factor was shown to activate the enzyme not only in the ejaculated spermatozoa but also in the epididymal sperm. The factor was also found to elevate the cAMP level in the intact porcine spermatozoa. The factor enhanced the motility of corpus and cauda epididymal spermatozoa. These findings indicate the possibility that this factor initiates the spermatozoan motility upon ejaculation through directly activating adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1949391242,"Abstract To determine the relative importance of the 2',5'-phosphodiester bond of 2-5A in its binding to and activation of the 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease (RNase L, RNase F), a number of phosphodiester linkage isomers of 2-5A were prepared. These isomers were obtained either by lead ion-catalyzed polymerization of adenosine 5'-phosphorimidazolidate or by T4 polynucleotide kinase-catalyzed 5'-phosphorylation of adenylyl(3' leads to 5')adenylyl(3' leads to 5')adenosine followed by reaction of the corresponding phosphorimidazolidates with tri(n-butylammonium)pyrophosphate. The following 2-5A isomers thus were prepared: ppp5'A2'p5'A3'p5'A, ppp5'A3'p5'A2'p5'A, ppp5'A3'p5'A3'p5'A(3-5A), ppp5'A2'p5'A3'p5'A2'p5'A,and ppp5'A3'p5'A2'p5'-A2'p5'A. The ability of these isomeric 2-5As to interact with the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease was ascertained by three different criteria: (i) ability to prevent the protein synthesis inhibitory effects of 2-5A, (ii) activity as an inhibitor of translation in encephalomyocarditis RNA-programmed L cell extracts, and (iii) ability to prevent binding of the radiolabeled probe, ppp5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A2'p5'A3'[32P]p5'Cp, to the endonuclease of L cell extracts. In certain experiments, degradation of oligonucleotide was minimized or eliminated by altering assay conditions, providing alternate phosphodiesterase substrates, or by using purified endoribonuclease of Ehrlich ascites cells. By all criteria, replacement of 2',5'-bond by a 3',5'-bond led to a substantial decrease in biological activity. Generally, replacement of just one 2',5'-phosphodiester bond with a 3',5'-linkage led to at least a one order of magnitude loss of activity. In accord with this trend, ppp5'A3'p5'A3'p5'A(3-5A) was greater than 10,000 less active than 2-5A in binding to the endonuclease or as an inhibitor of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560333621,"With a specific stimulating factor of mouse DNA replicase for its detection, a novel form of DNA polymerase alpha (DNA replicase) associated with DNA primase activity was partially purified from several vertebrates, i.e. the cherry salmon Oncorhyncus masou, the frog Xenopus laevis, the chick, and human (HeLa cells). Activity similar to DNA replicase was also partially purified from embryos of the sea urchin Anthocidaris crassispina. In all vertebrates examined, two forms of DNA polymerase alpha were separated by chromatography on ion-exchange columns; one form (DNA replicase) was associated with DNA primase activity and could utilize unprimed single-stranded DNAs as template, and the other could not utilize unprimed single-stranded DNAs. The sedimentation coefficient of the former, the novel form, obtained from each vertebrate in a glycerol gradient at high ionic strength was slightly larger than that of the other form which had no primase activity, except in the case of chick embryos where the sedimentation coefficients of the two forms were almost the same. The initiator RNA synthesized with the DNA primase activity associated with DNA replicase obtained from salmon, chick, HeLa cells, and sea urchin was 8 to 10 nucleotides long. The stimulating factor obtained from Ehrlich ascites cells has been found to stimulate both the activities of DNA primase and DNA polymerase in DNA replicase obtained from all the vertebrates examined, when unprimed single-stranded DNA was used as template, while the factor failed to stimulate both the activities of the enzyme of sea urchin embryos. This factor thus should be an effective tool in studies on the mechanism of vertebrate DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1590435621,"Glutamic acid producer Brevibacterium lactofermentum intact cells were used to demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N NMR to follow nitrogen assimilation and amino acid production throughout the growth cycle. The induction of glutamic acid production by different growth conditions was studied. Intracellular and extracellular levels of free metabolites were estimated as function of oxygen supply and biotin concentration. 15N NMR enabled us to distinguish two phases during the fermentation. At the early stage of fermentation, glutamic acid was accumulated intracellularly independent of oxygen supply and no product was excreted. In the late growth phase, the permeability of the cells developed and L-glutamic acid was excreted. The effect of aeration and biotin concentration on cellular contents and excretion was also studied by 15N NMR. Glutamate, N-acetylglutamine, and glutamine were the main nitrogenous pools independent of cell culture conditions. Free ammonia was not accumulated intracellularly although glutamic acid fermentation can be characterized as the process of nitrogen assimilation and the uptake of ammonia is the key step. In conclusion, the application of in vivo 15N NMR spectroscopy unraveled various problems of nitrogen metabolism, in a rapid and nondestructive manner."
https://openalex.org/W1562252146,"The nonspecific lipid transfer protein from beef liver was used to modify the phospholipid composition of intact turkey erythrocytes in order to study the dependence of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity on membrane phospholipid composition. Incorporation of phosphatidylinositol into turkey erythrocytes inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in a linear, concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition was relatively specific for phosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid were from 3 to 7 times less effective as inhibitors of hormone-stimulated cyclase activity. Inhibition by phosphatidylinositol was not reversible when up to 90% of the incorporated phosphatidylinositol was removed, either by incubation with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or a second incubation with transfer protein; possibly adenylate cyclase activity depends on a small pool of phosphatidylinositol that is inaccessible to either phospholipase C hydrolysis or removal by lipid transfer protein. Phosphatidylinositol incorporation inhibits adenylate cyclase activity by uncoupling beta-adrenergic receptors from the remainder of the cyclase complex. Phosphatidylinositol incorporation had no effect on stimulation of cAMP accumulation by either cholera toxin or forskolin, indicating that inhibition occurs only at the level of receptor. Phosphodiesterase activity was not altered in phosphatidylinositol-modified cells. Inhibition of cAMP accumulation was not the result of changes in either membrane fluidity or in cAMP transport out of modified turkey erythrocytes. Phosphatidylinositol inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cyclase activity may serve as a useful model system for hormone-induced desensitization."

https://openalex.org/W1480219844,"The effects of phospholipids on the reaction catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase have been studied with delipidated rat lung microsomes. Deoxycholate-solubilized enzyme was depleted of measurable phospholipid by either gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 or affinity chromatography on pentyl-agarose. The latter procedure also removed nucleotide and sugar nucleotide hydrolases. Delipidated protein fractions were devoid of GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase activity unless supplemented with phospholipids. Maximal recovery of enzyme activity was obtained with an approximate 1:1 weight ratio of phosphatidylglycerol:phosphatidylcholine, with the observed rate being synergistic as compared to rates observed for each individual phospholipid. Variable recoveries of enzyme activity were obtained with mixtures containing other acidic phospholipids and phosphatidylcholine. Enzyme activity in the fraction eluted from pentyl-agarose could be recovered, after removal of Triton X-100, with sedimented phospholipid vesicles. Significant stabilization of enzyme activity associated with the phospholipid vesicles was obtained by the inclusion of dolichol phosphate."

The structures of this and other 4,4′-dinitrocarbanilide complexes have not been determined, but an analogous 2:1 complex of 4,4′-dinitrodiphenylamine with 1,4-diacetylpiperazine has been prepared in which the only possible bonds are hydrogen bonds between the amide carbonyls and amino hydrogens. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that micron-size crystals of nicarbazin disintegrate in water to form much smaller dinitrocarbanilide crystals. Similar complex dissolution in the gut of poultry may account for the greater effectiveness of dinitrocarbanilide when administered as complexed rather than uncomplexed drug. Particle size problems associated with other highly insoluble drugs and pesticides may be resolved by the use of nicarbazin-like complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1596097154,"It was shown earlier that a variety of vertebrate cells could grow indefinitely in sugar-free medium supplemented with either uridine or cytidine at greater than or equal to 1 mM. In contrast, most purine nucleosides do not support sugar-free growth for one of the following reasons. The generation of ribose-1-P from nucleoside phosphorylase activity is necessary to provide all essential functions of sugar metabolism. Some nucleosides, e.g. xanthosine, did not support growth because they are poor substrates for this enzyme. De novo pyrimidine synthesis was inhibited greater than 80% by adenosine or high concentrations of inosine, e.g. 10 mM, which prevented growth on these nucleosides; in contrast, pyrimidine synthesis was inhibited only marginally on 1 mM inosine or guanosine, but normal growth was only seen on 1 mM inosine, not on guanosine. The inhibition of de novo adenine nucleotide synthesis prevented growth on guanosine, since guanine nucleotides could not be converted to adenine nucleotides. Guanine nucleotides were necessary for this inhibition of purine synthesis, since a mutant blocked in their synthesis grew normally on guanosine. De novo purine synthesis was severely inhibited by adenosine, inosine, or guanosine, but in contrast to guanosine, adenosine and inosine could provide all purine requirements by direct nucleotide conversions."
https://openalex.org/W1532085727,"Six cysteine-containing tryptic peptides were isolated and sequenced from rabbit liver mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase. 2 of the 6 cysteine residues were located on the surface of the enzyme. These 2 cysteine residues are sufficiently close to each other that they form a disulfide bond when oxidized by periodate. Another of the cysteine residues is exposed upon removal of the active site pyridoxal phosphate. The remaining three cysteines are buried and react with sulfhydryl reagents only when the enzyme is denatured. Blocking of one of the surface sulfhydryls with any of several sulfhydryl reagents results in increased catalytic activity when allothreonine is the substrate but decreased activity when serine and tetrahydrofolate are the substrates. The activation and inhibition effects are on Vmax and not on the affinity of the enzyme for its substrates. Of the six cysteine peptides from the mitochondrial enzyme, three show substantial homology with cysteine-containing peptides from the cytosolic form of the enzyme. For both enzyme forms, one of these homologous pairs is a cysteine residue on the surface of the enzyme. These results suggest that the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of rabbit liver serine hydroxymethyltransferases are the products of separate genes."

https://openalex.org/W1570951579,"The interaction of tubulin-microtubule poison complexes with anti-tubulin antisera has been investigated using radioimmunoassay. The binding of the major antiserum used in this study to tubulin does not interfere with the binding of colchicine to the tubulin or affect the decay of the colchicine-binding activity of the tubulin. Conversely, if colchicine is incubated with the tubulin, forming tubulin-colchicine complexes, the tubulin-colchicine complexes are less efficient competitors for antibody-binding sites than tubulin alone. This is the result of the formation of specific colchicine-tubulin complexes, since tubulin, incubated with lumicolchicine or isocolchicine, behaves as if the tubulin were incubated alone in the radioimmunoassay. When tubulin is incubated with other microtubule poisons, podophyllotoxin or vinblastine, the tubulin-drug complexes have diminished ability to compete with tubulin as did the tubulin-colchicine complexes. These changes observed in the binding of tubulin-microtubule poison complexes to anti-tubulin antisera in a tubulin radioimmunoassay suggest that the binding of colchicine, podophyllotoxin, or vinblastine to tubulin induces subtle conformational changes on the surface of the tubulin dimer involving antigenic determinant sites."

https://openalex.org/W1572737007,"Mouse myeloma cells were fused with splenocytes from a mouse that had been immunized with RNA polymerase I purified from a rat hepatoma. Hybridoma cells were selected and colonies secreting antibodies directed against the enzyme were detected by analysis of cell culture supernatants in a solid phase radioimmunoassay. Two of these cell lines were grown on a larger scale and the interaction between the immunoglobulins obtained from them and RNA polymerase I was studied in detail. Antibodies from both of the hybridoma cell lines were able to inhibit DNA-dependent RNA synthesis catalyzed by RNA polymerases I and III, but not that catalyzed by polymerase II. The antibodies were also capable of reducing the RNA chain elongation reaction catalyzed either by RNA polymerase I associated with isolated nucleoli or by enzyme preinitiated in vitro on calf thymus DNA. Inhibition of RNA polymerase I activity by the monoclonal antibodies was inversely related to the nucleotide concentration. In contrast, the DNA concentration had relatively little effect on inhibition by the antibodies. Analysis of immune complex formation between the antibodies and isolated individual enzyme subunits demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies were directed against the largest (Mr = 190,000) polypeptide of the polymerase I. These data indicate that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I contains an immunological determinant in common with RNA polymerase III and suggest that the polymerase I polypeptide of Mr = 190,000 contains a catalytic center involved in RNA chain elongation."

S5 crystals are trigonal with the space group P3(1)21 (or P3(2)21) and cell dimensions a = b = 59.3 A and c = 109.8 A. In both cases, there appears to be a single molecule in the asymmetric unit."
https://openalex.org/W1606581253,"A novel nucleohistone particle is generated in high yield when a complex of DNA with the four core histones formed under conditions that are close to physiological (0.15 M NaCl, pH 8) is treated with micrococcal nuclease. The particle was found to contain 102 base pairs of DNA in association with six molecules of histones in the ratio 2H2A:2H2B:1H3:1H4 after relatively brief nuclease treatment. Prolonged nuclease digestion resulted in a reduction in the DNA length to a sharply defined 92-base pair fragment that was resistant to further degradation. Apparently normal nucleosome core particles containing two molecules each of the four core histones in association with 145 base pairs of DNA and a particle containing one molecule each of histones H2A and H2B in association with approximately 40 base pairs of DNA were also generated during nuclease treatment of the histone-DNA complexes formed under physiological ionic strength conditions. Kinetic studies have shown that the hexamer particle is not a subnucleosomal fragment produced by the degradation of nucleosome core particles. Furthermore, the hexamer particle was not found among the products of nuclease digestion when histones and DNA were previously assembled in 0.6 M NaCl. The high sedimentation coefficient of the hexameric complex (8 S) suggests that the DNA component of the particle has a folded conformation."

https://openalex.org/W1547579634,"The composition and structure of three discrete nucleohistone particles produced by micrococcal nuclease digestion of the complex formed when the four core histones are mixed directly with DNA under conditions that are close to physiological have been reported in accompanying articles (Ellison, M. J., and Pulleyblank, D. E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13307-13313; 13314-13320). These include a peak containing a compact hexameric complex composed of one pair of (H3,H4) and two pairs of (H2A,H2B) (P2) and a peak containing complexes with the composition and sedimentation properties of nucleosome cores (P3). We have examined the pathways of assembly of P2 and P3 by determining the effect of order of histone addition on the yields of these species. The assembly of P2 is initiated by the binding of an (H2A,H2B) pair to the DNA which then directs the placement of an (H3,H4) pair. The incorporation of the final (H2A,H2B) pair to complete the particle is probably cooperative. The assembly of P3 is less dependent than the assembly of P2 upon the order in which the histone pairs are added to the DNA. More than one pathway has been implicated in the formation of these particles. P3 contains a component which has many but not all of the properties of nucleosome cores assembled at elevated ionic strength. Alternative pathways of assembly of histone pairs onto DNA are discussed which could lead to the formation of the discrete histone DNA structures that have been isolated here. A model is proposed in which the nucleosome unfolds and refolds into an alternative configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1573991796,"Ferrate anion, an analog of orthophosphate anion, very rapidly inactivates triose phosphate isomerase from chicken muscle. The inactivation can be prevented by the presence of competitive inhibitors. Of the 247 amino acids known to be present in each of the identical monomers of this dimeric enzyme, Trp-168, located in the active site pocket, as well as Trp-191 and His-248 are destroyed. The partial loss of Tyr-164 also occurs. Trp-168 is known from published crystallographic studies to be located in the active site cavity harboring Glu-165. The gamma-carboxylate group of Glu-165 is believed to serve as the nucleophile which catalyzes the isomerization. Tyr-164, Glu-165, and Trp-168 are known to be conserved in all of the triose phosphate isomerases which have been sequenced, including those obtained from mammals, chicken, fish, yeast, and bacteria. It is suggested that the chemical modification of Trp-168 alters its shape and hydrophobic character in a manner that adversely affects the conformation of the active site cavity. When the chicken enzyme is treated with ferrate in the presence of the competitive inhibitor phosphoglycolate, only His-248 is destroyed. Thus, His-248, which is the COOH-terminal amino acid, cannot be essential for activity. This observation is consistent with the knowledge that it is not invariant in the enzyme from various species."
https://openalex.org/W1585518282,"Methyl group turnover rates for specific methyl-accepting membrane proteins in intact irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs) have been determined. The turnover of methyl groups on all methyl acceptor membrane proteins carboxylmethylated in ISCs is not concerted but proceeds in an ordered sequence which is markedly different from that exhibited by unfractionated normal erythrocytes (AA). In ISCs methyl group turnover based on initial demethylation rate constants is most rapid for membrane polypeptides migrating in sodium dodecyl sulfate at 30,000-39,000 Da, 40,000-55,000 Da, polypeptides comigrating with cytoskeletal component band 4.1, and band 4.5. In contrast, initial methyl group turnover rates obtained after less than 20% of the total methyl groups are turned over in (AA) cells show most rapid demethylation rates for membrane polypeptides migrating at 40,000-55,000 Da, polypeptides comigrating with band 4.5, cytoskeletal components bands 2.1 and 4.1. Results also show significant differences between ISCs and most dense fractions from normal (AA) and nonsickle hemolytic anemias in the demethylation of cytoskeletal proteins, bands 2.1 and 4.1. These findings indicate qualitative differences in accessibility of methyl acceptor substrates to the methylating-demethylating enzyme activity in the cytosol of irreversibly sickled cells compared to discocytic control erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1600734192,"Three discrete histone-DNA complexes assemble spontaneously when the four core histones are mixed with DNA under conditions which are close to physiological (0.15 M NaCl, pH 8). These species include the (H2A,H2B) dimeric complex (P1), the (H2A2,H2B2,H3,H4) hexameric complex (P2) and the nucleosome core complex (P3). This report compares several properties of these complexes with the properties of nucleosome cores assembled at high ionic strength (0.6 M NaCl). Based on histone-histone cross-linking studies, CD spectra, and thermal denaturation experiments, P1 is structurally similar to the subnucleosomal (H2A,H2B) fragment isolated from nuclease-digested chromatin. P1, P2, P3, and high salt-assembled nucleosome cores can all incorporate (H2A,H2B) pairs which have been previously cross-linked. Although the CD spectra and thermal denaturation profiles of P2 and P3 are closely related to those of nucleosome cores assembled in 0.6 M NaCl, cross-linking studies indicate that the arrangement of the histones in P2, and in a proportion of the P3 particles assembled in 0.15 M NaCl, are significantly different from their arrangement in nucleosome cores assembled in 0.6 M NaCl. The single cysteine residue on the H3 of P2 is accessible to the solvent. The two fluorescently labeled cysteine residues in a large proportion of the P3 particles assembled in 0.15 M NaCl are in a different orientation with respect to each other than the same residues in nucleosome cores assembled at high ionic strength."
