https://openalex.org/W2019460257,"Seventeen ancient wood-rat middens, ranging in radiocarbon age from 7400 to 19,500 years and to older than 40,000 years, have been uncovered in the northeastern, north-central, southeastern, and southwestern sectors of the Mohave Desert. Excellent preservation of macroscopic plant materials (including stems, buds, leaves, fruits, and seeds) enables identification of many plant species growing within the limited foraging range of the sedentary wood rat ."

https://openalex.org/W2002905914,The infrared spectra recorded by Mariner 6 and 7 show reflections at 4.3 microns. which suggest the presence of solid carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere of Mars.
https://openalex.org/W2018919914,Peat from Keewatin and Manitoba contained macrofossil and palynological evidence of former latitudinal movements of the forest-tundra boundary in response to the changing location of the mean summer position of the Arctic front. Radiocarbon dating demonstrates the synchroneity of these climatic changes with those registered in northwest Europe during the past 6000 years.

https://openalex.org/W2037478984,A new allotropic form of water ice with a density of 2.32 ± 0.15 grams per cubic centimeter has been observed at very low pressures and for temperatures lower than 100°K. It is most likely amorphous.
https://openalex.org/W2052753250,"Visible spectra of solar radiation were recorded during sunset. With the development of twilight, there was an expected decrease in the blue-to-red ratio; but directly upon setting of the sun there was a sharp rise in this ratio (due to the predominance of sky-light) which attenuated rapidly to follow the pattern that it had previously taken."

https://openalex.org/W1990606372,"Photographs taken from Apollo 10 and 11 reveal a number of probable igneous intrusions, including three probable dikes that crosscut the wall and floor of an unnamed 75-kilometer crater on the lunar farside. These intrusions are distinguished by their setting, textures, structures, and brightness relative to the surrounding materials. Recognition of these probable igneous intrusions in the lunar highlands slupports the indications of the heterogeneity of lunar materials and the plausibility of intrusive igneous activity, in addition to extrusive volcanism, on the moon."

https://openalex.org/W4238015548,"In the report ""Selection of social partners as a function of peer contact during rearing"" by C. L. Pratt and G. P. Sackett (3 Mar., p. 1133), the third sentence of the first paragraph should read as follows: ""Monkeys reared in isolation tend to withdraw from other animals and huddle by themselves in social situations. If such animals prefer each other over more normal monkeys, they may not be effectively exposed to the stimuli which lead to some degree of social adjustment."""
https://openalex.org/W1996777913,A motion picture of the electromagnetic field pattern of a prolate spheroid antenna was completely produced by an IBM 7094 computer and an SC 4020 microfilm plotter. The technique of illustrating complex mathematical subjects by means of computer pictures should lead to better understanding in electrical engineering.

https://openalex.org/W2036980167,"In spite of a number of difficulties and shortcomings, this international meeting was relatively effective for this group of respondents. They benefitted from the informal interaction of participants, from information that pertained to current and planned work, and from the prospects of continued exchange with colleagues in other countries. That the meeting could have been even more valuable was also the consensus. Additional data on another such meeting reinforce these findings and suggest that the results obtained are probably not peculiar to one social science or to this specific meeting. Reports of a small group of sociologists, who received grants from the National Institute of Mental Health to attend the Sixth World Congress of Sociology at Evian in September 1966, showed marked concurrence with those of the psychologists who attended the Moscow congress. For both groups there was the same preponderence of United States and Russian presentations on the program, informal interaction was more productive of useful information than were formally scheduled events, and the main type of information obtained was a broader knowledge of research activity and effort in various countries. The sociologists emphasized even more than did the psychologists the importance of acquiring new points of view and perspectives. More than half the sociologists planned to use information obtained in their current or future work, and a fourth planned international collaborative research efforts; in both these respects they surpassed the percentages found in the data on the psychologists. Finally, all the criticisms voiced by Moscow respondents appeared also among the Evian group, though not in sufficient numbers to constitute a trend. These data suggest that international meetings can and do fill certain information needs in spite of organizational difficulties and the problems attendant upon any large gathering in an environment unfamiliar to most of those who participate."
