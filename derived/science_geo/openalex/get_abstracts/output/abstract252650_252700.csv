Yet, how these proteins functionally interact is not known. Here, we reveal that STIM1 and Orai1 expressed together reconstitute functional SOCs. Expressed alone, Orai1 strongly reduces store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) in rat basophilic leukemia cells. However, expressed along with the store-sensing STIM1 protein, Orai1 causes a massive increase in SOCE, enhancing the rate of Ca2+entry by up to 103-fold. This entry is entirely store-dependent since the same coexpression causes no measurable store-independent Ca2+ entry. The entry is completely blocked by the SOC blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate. Orai1 and STIM1 coexpression also caused a large gain in CRAC channel function in rat basophilic leukemia cells. The close STIM1 homologue, STIM2, inhibited SOCE when expressed alone but coexpressed with Orai1 caused substantial constitutive (store-independent) Ca2+ entry. STIM proteins are known to mediate Ca2+ store-sensing and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane coupling with no intrinsic channel properties. Our results revealing a powerful gain in SOC function dependent on the presence of both Orai1 and STIM1 strongly suggest that Orai1 contributes the PM channel component responsible for Ca2+ entry. The suppression of SOC function by Orai1 overexpression likely reflects a required stoichiometry between STIM1 and Orai1.

Ca2+ signals control many cellular functions ranging from short term responses such as contraction and secretion to longer term regulation of cell growth and proliferation (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P.

Receptor-induced Ca2+ signals involve two closely coupled components, rapid, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release from ER 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SOC, store-operated channel; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; ICRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current; fura-2/AM, fura-2 acetoxymethylester; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; F, farad; PM, plasma membrane; wt, wild-type; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. stores, followed by Ca2+ entry through store-operated channels (SOCs) (1Berridge M.J.

The activation of SOCs is key to mediating longer term cytosolic Ca2+ signals and replenishing intracellular stores (4Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J.

In many cell types, including hematopoietic cells, SOCs carry a highly Ca2+-selective, non-voltage-gated, inwardly rectifying current, termed the Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ current or ICRAC (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 5Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat.

Molecular characterization of SOCs and the activation process for store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) have remained elusive (5Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat.

Recently, SOCE and CRAC channels have also been shown to require the plasma membrane four-transmembrane spanning protein, Orai1 or CRACM1 (11Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar, 12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Hence, a naturally occurring R91W mutation in Orai1 led to elimination of ICRAC (11Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar, 12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P.

Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). While expression of Orai1 wild-type (wt) restored CRAC to normal levels (11Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar, 12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), the exact role of Orai1 in CRAC activation was not established. Here we show that expression of STIM1 and Orai1 in combination results in an enormous gain in function of SOCE and CRAC channel activity, indicating that the PM Orai1 protein is likely the channel entity mediating SOC function. DNA Expression Constructs, Mutagenesis, and Transfection—wt human STIM1 and STIM2 were subcloned into pIRESneo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (13Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V. Kazenwadel J.S. Shandala T. Saint R. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The human STIM1 E87A mutation was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Orai1, expressed in pCMV6-XL4, was obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD). Constructs were introduced by electroporation using the Gene Pulser II Electroporation system (Bio-Rad) at 350 V, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance, followed by 48 h in culture. Development of Stable Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) were maintained as described previously (14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). HEK293 stable cell lines were generated by electroporation of the above described wt human STIM1 or STIM2 pIRES constructs. After selection with appropriate antibiotics, cells were cloned and selected based upon expression of the genes and the amount of SOCE. Ca2+ Measurements—Cells grown on coverslips were placed in “cation-safe” medium free of sulfate and phosphate anions (NaCl (107 mgm), KCl (7.2 mm), MgCl2 (1.2 mm), glucose (11.5 mm), HEPES-NaOH (20 mm), pH 7.2) and loaded with fura-2/acetoxymethylester (2 μm) for 30 min at 20 °C, as described elsewhere (15Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 16Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 30 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (17Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Ca2+ measurements were made using an InCyt dual-wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). The concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ was calculated according to the following formula of Grynkiewcz et al. (18Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Wang J.C. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8801-8806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i=Kd×(Fmin/Fmax)×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)(Eq. 1) where R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities measured at 340 and 380 nm during the experiments, and F is the fluorescence intensity measured at 505 nm. Rmin, Rmax, Fmin, and Fmax were determined from in situ calibration of unlysed cells using 40 μm ionomycin in the absence (Rmin and Fmin; 10 mm EGTA) and presence of (Rmax and Fmax) of Ca2+. Kd (135 nm) is the dissociation constant for fura-2 at room temperature. All measurements shown are averages of 35–45 cells and representative of a minimum of three experiments. Electrophysiology—Studies were performed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) and HEK293 cells cotransfected with yellow fluorescent protein to select transfected cells. We used conventional whole cell recordings as described (9Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Immediately after establishment of the whole-cell configuration, voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning the voltage range of –100 to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz. The intracellular solution contained (mm): 145 CsGlu, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA, 8 Na+, 5 Mg2+, 2 Mg-ATP (total 8 mm Mg2+), pH 7.2. 8 mm Mg2+ and ATP were used to inhibit TRPM7 (19Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 487-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The extracellular solutions contained (mm): 145 NaCl, 10 CaCl2, 10 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 2.8 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. We applied 10 mV junction potential compensation. Materials—Orai1 was from Origene (Rockville, MD). Thapsigargin was from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). G418 was from Sigma. Fura-2/acetoxymethylester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). We examined the function of Orai1 by expressing it in HEK293 cells lines stably expressing STIM1 or the control vector-expressing HEK293 cells. Ca2+ entry in fura-2-loaded cells was measured after thapsigargin-induced store depletion in Ca2+-free medium. Despite its necessity in SOCE (11Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar, 12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), Orai1 expressed in vector control cells strongly suppressed SOCE (Fig. 1A; see also Fig. 3A). In STIM1-expressing cells there was a modest enhancement of SOCE, as shown previously (14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Remarkably, Orai1 coexpressed in STIM1-expressing cells resulted in a massive and rapid increase in SOCE (Fig. 1A). No significant change in store content was observed under any of these expression conditions. To reveal the extent of Ca2+ entry, the fura-2 ratiometric data is expressed as free Ca2+ concentrations. Since the ratios reached in STIM1-Orai1-expressing cells (ratios approaching 10) were beyond the linear range of fura-2, the highest Ca2+ levels are only approximate. In vector-control cells, the maximal increase in cytosolic Ca2+ resulting from SOCE was 150 nm. This value decreased to ∼50–70 nm in Orai1-expressing vector control cells. However, using STIM1-expressing cells, the expression of Orai1 resulted in a staggering 25–30-fold increase in the maximal level of cytosolic Ca2+ mediated by store-emptying. In this experiment, Ca2+ rose to ∼3400 nm. Most significantly, the initial rate of Ca2+ entry into Orai1/STIM1-expressing cells was enormously increased in this experiment by 103-fold compared with vector-expressing cells.FIGURE 3STIM2 and Orai1 coexpression results in constitutive Ca2+ entry. Ca2+ concentration was monitored in HEK293 cells stably expressing wt human STIM2 or empty pIRES vector after transient transfection with Orai1 or empty vector. A, HEK293 cells were pretreated with thapsigargin (2 μm) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (10 min) to deplete Ca2+ stores. 1 mm Ca2+ was added at the arrow to assess SOCE. B, the average increase in Ca2+ entry observed after the addition of 1 mm Ca2+ to thapsigargin-pretreated cells overexpressing empty vector, STIM2, Orai1, or STIM2 + Orai1. C, 1 mm Ca2+ was added to store-replete cells that had briefly (∼5 min) been maintained in nominally Ca2+-free medium. D, the average increase in Ca2+ entry observed after the addition of 1 mm Ca2+ to untreated cells overexpressing both STIM2 and Orai1 as compared with STIM2-expressing control cells. “N” represents the number of separate experiments, each including 35–45 individual cells. * indicates p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01; *** indicates p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All of the increased Ca2+ entry due to Orai1/STIM1 expression was dependent on store depletion. Hence, no change in resting Ca2+ levels could be detected with any combination of expression of Orai1 and STIM1 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the huge increase in SOCE was rapidly blocked by application of 50 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), typical of known SOCE and CRAC channel function (20Ma H.T. Venkatachalam K. Parys J.B. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6915-6922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Based on the dramatic gain in Ca2+ entry observed in the presence of coexpressed Orai1 and STIM1, all of which is store-dependent, we considered it likely that the Orai1 protein was increasing the density of store-operated channels. To further assess the possible channel role, we examined the effects of Orai1 and STIM1 expression on the density of CRAC channels measured in the RBL mast cell-derived line. The time course of development of endogenous ICRAC in response to BAPTA-induced store depletion is shown in Fig. 2A. Compared with control cells, the expression of Orai1 was strongly inhibitory, in agreement with the results for SOCE in HEK293 cells shown in Fig. 1. Expression of STIM1 caused a modest enhancement of ICRAC, whereas coexpression of both Orai1 together with STIM1 resulted in a substantial increase in CRAC channel activity. Quantitation of maximal current from multiple experiments (Fig. 2B) revealed that the current density in vector-transfected cells was ∼1.14 ± 0.33 pA/pF (n = 3). This value decreased to 0.19 ± 0.19 pA/pF (n = 3) with expression of Orai1 alone. STIM1 expressed alone approximately doubled current density to 2.22 ± 0.26 pA/pF (n = 3), whereas coexpression of Orai1 with STIM1 increased current some 9-fold to a total of 9.55 ± 0.27 pA/pF (n = 5). As shown in Fig. 2C, the I/V profile in the absence or presence of Orai1 and STIM1 reveals inward rectification and a reversal potential of approximately +50 mV, typical of the highly Ca2+-selective CRAC channel (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 6Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Hence, the results provide compelling evidence that channel density is increased by Orai1/STIM1 expression. The larger relative fold increase in SOCE in HEK293 cells likely reflects both lower basal CRAC levels relative to RBL cells (12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) and greater transfection efficiency. STIM1 and STIM2 are closely related in structure, but STIM2 has an opposing inhibitory action on SOCE (14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). We utilized stable STIM2-expressing HEK293 cells to examine the functional interaction between Orai1 and STIM2 (Fig. 3). The inhibitory actions of either STIM2 (14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) or Orai1 expression on SOCE are clear. Unexpectedly, combined expression resulted in elevated SOCE, especially at later time points (Fig. 3, A and B). In store-replete cells, a substantial increase in constitutive Ca2+ entry was observed with Orai1/STIM2 expression but not with STIM2 expression alone (Fig. 3, C and D). STIM1 and STIM2 are functionally distinct. STIM1 accumulates in near-PM puncta of the ER upon store depletion (8Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar, 14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) where it is believed to activate Ca2+ entry channels. In contrast, STIM2 expressed alone does not change its ER distribution in response to store depletion (14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Puncta are considered preexisting PM-juxtaposed regions of the contiguous ER (8Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). We suspect that a manyfold increase in STIM2 expressed throughout the ER might lead to an increase in STIM2 in puncta, independently of altered luminal Ca2+. Thus, at high levels of STIM2 expression, while it is normally an inhibitor of SOCs, STIM2 may mimic the action of STIM1 and, through interaction with overexpressed Orai1, result in significant constitutive SOC activation. As seen in Fig. 3C, the STIM2-mediated constitutive Ca2+ entry was enhanced by 50 μm 2-APB. This enhancing effect was consistent with our previous observation in store-depleted STIM2-transfected RBL cells (22Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. Xu W. Dziadek M. Gill D.L. Biophys. J. 2006; 90 ((abstr.)Google Scholar). 5M. A. Spassova and D. L. Gill, unpublished observations. Dramatically, overexpression of Orai1 in STIM2-expressing HEK293 cells increased the 2-APB-induced Ca2+ entry to levels approaching Orai1/STIM1-expressing store-depleted cells. Electrophysiological measurements in Orai1/STIM2-transfected HEK293 cells revealed constitutive but otherwise typical CRAC-like current (with I/V relationship similar to Fig. 2C) of 6.9 ± 0.7 pA/pF (n = 4), which increased to 74.7 ± 13.4 pA/pF (n = 4) after 50 μm 2-APB. In Orai1/STIM1-expressing HEK293 cells, we measured thapsigargin-induced CRAC current of 118.3 ± 24.9 pA/pF (n = 3). These remarkable CRAC current values are enormously larger than basal values of <1 pA/pF in HEK293 cells (12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The action of 2-APB on SOCE is biphasic, lower 2-APB (≤10 μm) enhances, while higher levels of 2-APB (50–100 μm) are strongly inhibitory (20Ma H.T. Venkatachalam K. Parys J.B. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Likely, this reflects two distinct sites of action of high and low affinity, respectively (21Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As suggested previously (9Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the inhibitory (low affinity) target of 2-APB on physiological SOC activation may be the STIM1 protein itself. Hence, when STIM2 rather than STIM1 couples to the channel, 2-APB does not inhibit. Instead, the high-affinity 2-APB site dominates, leading to enhanced Ca2+ entry. Notwithstanding the intricacies of the mechanism of action of 2-APB, the high level of Ca2+ entry observed in the presence of overexpressed Orai1 is the predominant effect, consistent again with Orai1 providing the channel component. STIM1 can be mutated to prevent its Ca2+ sensing function resulting in constitutive Ca2+ entry and CRAC channel function (7Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S.

Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar), thereby circumventing the entire store depletion process. We examined whether Orai1 could be directly activated in this manner. Using HEK293 cells stably expressing the STIM1-D76A-E87A EF-hand mutant, we found that Orai1 expression again dramatically enhanced Ca2+ entry (data not shown). Similarly, in RBL cells expressing the STIM1-E87A EF-hand mutant together with Orai1 resulted in an ∼15-fold increase in CRAC channel function (data not shown). Thus, the store-independent STIM1 mutant, together with Orai1, reconstitutes both functional Ca2+ entry and CRAC channel activity. One question is why overexpression of Orai1 results in substantially lower SOCE in HEK293 cells (Figs. 1A and 3, A and B) or decreased CRAC channel activity in RBL cells (Fig. 2). We would explain this by assuming the coupling stoichiometry between channel and sensor is not unity, as predicted by Putney (23Putney Jr., J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, assuming more than one sensor must interact with each channel, the predominance of channels reduces the probability of successful coupling. While we observe a powerful inhibitory action of overexpressed Orai1 on SOCE and ICRAC, the recent report of Vig et al. (12Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) showed little effect of overexpressed Orai1 on CRAC channel activity in HEK293 cells. We would suggest that the extremely low level of endogenous CRAC activity in these cells simply precluded an observable decrease. Based on our results and those previously showing the requirement for STIM1 and Orai1 (7Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S. Safrina O. Kozak J.A. Wagner S.L.

After submission of this manuscript, a paper from Peinelt et al. (24Peinelt C. Vig M. Koomoa D.L. Beck A. Nadler M.J. Koblan-Huberson M. Lis A. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat.

The ER and PM location of STIM1 and Orai1, respectively, are consistent with their roles as ER Ca2+ sensor and PM Ca2+ channel, respectively. It should also be considered that STIM1 has a PM location (14Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. He L.-H. Xu W. Johnstone L.J. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr.

Recently, several thioredoxin binding partners have been identified and proposed to mediate aspects of redox signaling, but the significance of these interactions is unclear in part due to incomplete understanding of the mechanism for thioredoxin binding. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is critical for regulation of glucose metabolism, the only currently known function of which is to bind and inhibit thioredoxin.

Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous disulfide oxidoreductase that, along with the glutathione system, plays a major role in maintaining the cytoplasm in a reducing environment. Thioredoxin activity is mediated by a pair of cysteine thiols at its active site (human thioredoxins C32 and C35) that are oxidized during reduction of the substrate. By maintaining this reducing environment, thioredoxin is a critical defense against excess concentrations of reactive oxygen species, which are deleterious to cells and implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases such as atherosclerosis (1Griendling K.K.

Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the classic reducing activity of thioredoxin, recent evidence suggests that the redox state of thioredoxin may itself be an important component of redox signaling pathways. Thioredoxin reportedly binds a number of transcription factors and signaling molecules, including NF-κB p50 subunit (7Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.M. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M.

One of the better characterized interactions is that of reduced thioredoxin with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), 2The abbreviations used are: ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.2The abbreviations used are: ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. which plays a key role in promoting stress-induced apoptosis (12Saitoh M.

Because only reduced thioredoxin is thought to bind ASK1, the interaction can be controlled by the redox state of the cell: during conditions of oxidative stress, ASK1 is released from thioredoxin and promotes apoptosis. The identification of thioredoxin and ASK1 cysteines required for the interaction (13Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) supports the hypothesis that thioredoxin forms a mixed disulfide complex with ASK1. However, the implications of this interaction are not clear in part due to (i) the lack of direct evidence that thioredoxin can form a stable mixed disulfide and (ii) the lack of a plausible mechanism for formation of this disulfide in the normal reducing environment of the cell. Txnip (thioredoxin-interacting protein, also called “vitamin-D3-up-regulated protein-1” (14Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and “thioredoxin-binding protein 2”), is a 50-kDa protein with structural homology to the arrestins. Despite the arrestin homology, currently the only known function of Txnip is to bind thioredoxin and inhibit thioredoxin-reducing activity (15Yamanaka H. Maehira F. Oshiro M. Asato T. Yanagawa Y.

It is possible that these roles for Txnip are not mediated by inhibition of thioredoxin function alone. Understanding Txnip function will require that the mechanism for the interaction of Txnip and thioredoxin be better defined. In the present work we explored the mechanism of the Txnip-thioredoxin interaction and present evidence that Txnip and thioredoxin form a stable disulfide-liked complex. We identified two Txnip cysteines that are important for thioredoxin binding and showed that this interaction is consistent with a disulfide exchange reaction between oxidized Txnip and reduced thioredoxin. These two critical cysteines are not conserved in the broader family of arrestin domain-containing proteins, suggesting that Txnip is a unique redox-sensitive signaling protein. 293 Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, no sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin). Plasmid-encoded proteins were expressed by transfection with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) using 3% FuGENE and a 1:3 ratio of micrograms of DNA to microliters of FuGENE. Three days after transfection, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and clarified at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Adipocyte Culture—3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (25 mm), penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). Differentiation was induced by adding 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine to the media according to a standard protocol (27Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By 8 days after induction, greater than 95% of cells were mature adipocytes based on morphology and Oil Red O uptake. Adipocyte Transduction—Human Txnip constructs were overexpressed in mature adipocytes by infection with a vector based on replication-deficient human immunodeficiency virus. TXNIP was subcloned into the pCDH1-MCS1-EF1-Puro vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA), and the TXNIP C247S mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis. Pseudoviral particles were made by transfection of TXNIP, TXNIP C247S, or an empty vector into 293TN cells (ATCC). A vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (pSIH1-H1-copGFP, System Biosciences) was co-transfected with each vector in a 1:100 ratio. The multiplicity of infection of the resulting particles was determined by the number of cells expressing GFP on fluorescence microscopy 96 h after transduction. For experimental studies, 8 days after induction cells were cultured in low glucose (5.6 mm), transduced with a multiplicity of infection of 1-2, and allowed to express viral proteins for 96 h. Real-time PCR and Western analysis verified about a 2-fold overexpression of Txnip and Txnip C247S in transduced cells (data not shown). Cloning of Mouse Arrestin Domain-containing Genes—The Arrdc2 gene, with a GC content of 65%, was amplified from gut cDNA by PCR with PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene) in the presence of 1.1 m betaine and 4 mm Mg2+ and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His (Invitrogen). The primers were 5′-caccgcaatgctgttcgataaggt-3′ (forward) and 5′-taccgaagttgtcagcccatggat-3′ (reverse), and the product matched the GenBank® sequence NM_027560. Arrdc4 was amplified from gut cDNA and cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen). Primers were 5′-atgggaggcgaggcgggagcgaat-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcagagaatgaaggatacaggctgggtctc-3′ (reverse) and matched GenBank® sequence AK037198. Txnip was cloned from embryonic fibroblast cDNA into pcDNA3.1/V5/His using primers 5′-accatggtgatgttcaagaagatcaag-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctgcacgttgttgttgttgttgttgtt-3′ (reverse), and it matched GenBank® sequence AK089403. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cysteine-to-serine mutants were introduced into TXNIP (in pcDNA3.1+) and TXN (in pGEX) by whole plasmid PCR with PfuTurbo polymerase, followed by digestion of template DNA with DpnI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Constructs were verified by bidirectional sequencing. GST Binding Assays—TXN (thioredoxin) was cloned from HeLa cell cDNA and subcloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences), carboxyl-terminal to the glutathione S-transferase (GST). GST fusion proteins were induced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cell pellets were lysed in B-PER (Pierce) and 40 units/ml DNase, and the cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Bio-World, Dublin, OH) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by three washes with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline. For GST binding, 293 cell lysates were incubated with beads containing equal amounts of GST protein. Binding proceeded overnight with rotation at 4 °C followed by three washes with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in gel-loading sample buffer. All experiments were replicated at least once, and essentially identical results were obtained to those shown. Western Analysis—Protein samples were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Immunodetection of Txnip was performed with a custommade monoclonal antibody (JY2, available from MBL Intl., Woburn, MA). Monoclonal antibodies to the V5 and Xpress epitopes were from Invitrogen. Thioredoxin Insulin Reduction Activity Assay—Thioredoxin activity in cell lysates was measured by the insulin-reduction assay of Holmgren et al. (28Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated in excess insulin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of guanidine and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid was detected by optical density at 412 nm. Recombinant human thioredoxin-C73S-GST was used as a standard. Statistical Analysis—Differences between groups were tested by t-tests with unequal variance assumed. All tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using α = 1 - (1 - α0)1/n, where α0 = 0.05 and n = total number of comparisons. Wild-type Txnip and Thioredoxin Form a DTT-sensitive Complex—Previous studies have shown that Txnip does not interact with the thioredoxin active-site double-cysteine mutant (C32S,C35S) (15Yamanaka H.

However, there is little direct evidence that wild-type thioredoxin forms stable mixed disulfides with its putative binding partners under physiological conditions. Indeed, thioredoxin is thought to be an active disulfide reductase in large part due to the instability of the intermediate mixed disulfide (29Wynn R. Cocco M.J. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11807-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30LeMaster D.M. Springer P.A. Unkefer C.J. J. Biol.

NMR studies have identified interactions of NFκB and Ref-1 peptides with thioredoxin, but because the peptides were cross-linked to a thioredoxin C35A mutant, they do not provide evidence regarding the physiological relevance of the mixed disulfide complex (7Qin J.

Indirect evidence supports the generation of a mixed disulfide between thioredoxin and ASK1: ASK1 binds selectively to reduced thioredoxin; the interaction requires one thioredoxin active-site cysteine and an ASK1 cysteine; and the interaction is stabilized by single mutation of either thioredoxin Cys-35 or Cys-32 to serine (31Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, despite the structural similarity of the reduced and oxidized thioredoxin forms (32Jeng M.F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 33Qin J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), there is a precedent for selective binding to reduced thioredoxin solely by noncovalent interactions in the E. coli T7 polymerase complex (34Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether we could identify a stable disulfide complex of Txnip and thioredoxin by a thioredoxin-GST binding assay. Human Txnip was overexpressed in 293 cells, which have nearly undetectable levels of endogenous Txnip, and the cell lysates were incubated overnight with thioredoxin-GST bound to glutathi-one-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were released by boiling in non-reducing sample buffer, incubated in a range of dithiothreitol (DTT) concentrations, and subjected to Western analysis with a monoclonal antibody against Txnip (JY2) (Fig. 1). On short exposure, primarily monomeric Txnip at ∼45 kDa was observed (left panel). The intensity of this band increased with increasing concentrations of DTT, consistent with release of the monomeric Txnip from disulfide-linked complexes by DTT. Fainter bands were also visible at the expected size of the Txnip-thioredoxin-GST complex (∼83 kDa). On longer exposure (middle panel), this 83-kDa band was clearly visible with 0-0.1 mm DTT but disappeared in a dose-dependent manner from 0.1 to 10 mm DTT. The 83-kDa band was not visible in the input lysates (right panel). The identification of an 83-kDa JY2-reactive band that is sensitive to DTT is thus consistent with the identification of a stable Txnip-thioredoxin disulfide-linked complex. We also observed that the Txnip monomer showed a mobility shift with increasing levels of DTT (Fig. 1), suggesting that Txnip contains one or more intramolecular disulfides. This observation is similar to the mobility shift seen for the redoxactive disulfide of PTEN (35Kwon J. Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Ahn Y. Kim Y.J. Stadtman E.R. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16419-16424Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, this evidence was limited by the inability of the Western analysis to resolve the Txnip bands that would be expected for separate dithiol and disulfide forms of Txnip. Txnip Cysteine 267 Is Conserved in Four Human/Mouse Homologs—We then hypothesized that if Txnip formed a disulfide bond with thioredoxin, at least one Txnip cysteine would be required for the interaction. Furthermore, if thioredoxin interaction were conserved among Txnip homologs, this cysteine should be conserved. A search of the PubMed mouse and human genome data base revealed five proteins homologous to Txnip of unknown function (Fig. 2A). Txnip and these homologs all contain structural homology to the arrestins, which are intracellular scaffolding proteins that have important roles in modulating receptor endocytosis, ubiquitination, and signaling (36Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). The homologs have been assigned official gene names arrestin domain-containing (Arrdc) 1 through 5. Three have so far been cloned and briefly characterized: human Arrdc4 as “down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma 1 (DRH1)” (37Yamamoto Y. Sakamoto M. Fujii G. Kanetaka K. Asaka M. Hirohashi S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar), rat Arrdc2 as “induced by lysergic acid diethylamide-1 (ILAD-1)” (38Nichols C.D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and most recently, human Arrdc3 as “thioredoxin-binding-protein-2-like inducible membrane protein (TLIMP)” (39Oka S.I. Masutani H. Liu W. Horita H. Wang D. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Yodoi J. Endocrinology. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). The most distantly related protein, Arrdc5, is notable for its sperm-specific expression. The functions of these proteins and the significance of the arrestin domains remain unknown. Alignment of the three proteins (Arrdc2-4) with the most identity to Txnip demonstrated a single conserved cysteine (Txnip C267) (Fig. 2B; full alignments in supplemental Fig. S1A). This cysteine is also largely conserved in arrestin domain-containing homologs through evolution to Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster (Fig. S1B). This suggested that the Txnip cysteine 267 would be required for interaction with thioredoxin and that the arrestin domain-containing proteins describe a family of thioredoxin-interacting proteins. Txnip Cysteine 247, Not Cysteine 267, Is Critical for the Txnip-Thioredoxin Interaction—Using yeast two-hybrid screening, Yamanaka et al. (15Yamanaka H. Maehira F. Oshiro M. Asato T. Yanagawa Y. Takei H. Nakashima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) identified that deletion of the amino-terminal arrestin domain (residues 1-154) did not affect binding to thioredoxin. We therefore generated a Txnip cysteine-to-serine mutant for each of the 7 cysteine residues in the remainder of the protein (residues 155-391) and overexpressed them in 293 cells. Thioredoxin-GST bound wild-type Txnip and six of the mutant Txnips, including the C267S mutant. Surprisingly, thioredoxin-GST instead failed to bind a mutation of Txnip cysteine 247 (Cys-247). Thus Txnip Cys-247, not the conserved Cys-267, is critical for the interaction with thioredoxin. Whereas Txnip Cys-267 is highly conserved through evolution, Txnip Cys-247 was not present in any of the arrestin domain-containing proteins other than Txnip orthologs (Fig. 3B, bottom, and Fig. S1). Even within Txnip orthologs it was not present in the sequenced avian (Gallus gallus) and amphibian (Xenopus laevis) species (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the family of Arrdc proteins is not defined by interaction with thioredoxin. Txnip-like Proteins Do Not Bind to Thioredoxin—To test the hypothesis that the Txnip-like proteins do not interact with thioredoxin, we cloned the three mouse homologs with closest homology to Txnip (Arrdc2, -3, and -4), as well as mouse Txnip, into tagged expression vectors. The vectors were then overexpressed in 293 cells, and detection of the tagged proteins was confirmed in cell lysates (Fig. 4, left panels). Thioredoxin-GST failed to detect an interaction with either Arrdc2 or Arrdc4 under conditions that bound Txnip (Fig. 4, right panels). Consistent with these observations, Oka et al. (39Oka S.I. Masutani H. Liu W. Horita H. Wang D. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Yodoi J. Endocrinology. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that human Arrdc3 also does not bind thioredoxin. These results confirm that the arrestin domain-containing Txnip-like protein family is not defined by thioredoxin binding. The structural homology with the arrestins suggests a role as scaffolding proteins for protein-protein interaction and signaling, as described for the β-arrestins (36Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). It may be that each homolog has evolved for interaction with different substrates and that studies of their binding partners will be important for defining their functions. In addition, because the ability of Txnip to bind thioredoxin is unique, Txnip may retain other conserved scaffolding and/or signaling functions. Effect of Redox Conditions on the Txnip-Thioredoxin Interaction Suggests Txnip Is Redox-active—Our evidence that Txnip forms a DTT-sensitive complex with thioredoxin, together with the identification of a Txnip cysteine critical for the interaction, strongly suggested that the interaction is mediated by formation of a disulfide bond. However, in the reducing environment of the normal eukaryotic cytosol, oxidation by de novo formation of protein disulfides is uncommon in the absence of an electron acceptor to complete the redox reaction (40Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Most protein disulfides are generated in the endoplasmic reticulum in a process that requires both protein disulfide isomerase and endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase-1 (Ero1) to catalyze electron transfer to molecular oxygen (41Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 42Dias-Gunasekara S. Gubbens J. van Lith M. Dunne C. Williams J.A. Kataky R. Scoones D. Lapthorn A. Bulleid N.J. Benham A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33066-33075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that if Txnip formed a disulfide bond with thioredoxin, a disulfide exchange mechanism would be most likely. This suggested two possibilities: either Txnip interacts with oxidized thioredoxin, or Txnip contains a disulfide bond and interacts with reduced thioredoxin. Nishiyama et al. (17Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the interaction of Txnip with thioredoxin is abolished by oxidation of thioredoxin, suggesting that Txnip interacts with reduced thioredoxin. However, oxidation of human thioredoxin in vitro can cause inactivation of thioredoxin by dimerization at cysteine 73, thus preventing binding to Txnip (43Ren X. Bjornstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Andersen J.F. Sanders D.A. Gasdaska J.R. Weichsel A. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13979-13988Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To eliminate this possibility, we tested the effect of redox state on the interaction of thioredoxin-C73S with Txnip. Thioredoxin-C73S-GST beads were preincubated in lysis buffer and either reduced by addition of 100 μm DTT, left untreated, or oxidized by addition of 100 μm H2O2. The DTT or H2O2 was then removed by extensive washing prior to incubation with cell lysates containing overexpressed Txnip. As a negative control, thioredoxin-C73S did not bind Txnip C247S (Fig. 5A, left). Binding of wild-type Txnip was not affected by reduction of thioredoxin-C73S with DTT (Fig. 5A, right). In contrast, oxidation of thioredoxin-C73S strongly blocked binding to Txnip, confirming that thioredoxin must be reduced for efficient interaction with Txnip. We also tested whether manipulating the redox conditions during binding affected the Txnip-thioredoxin interaction. Thioredoxin-GST beads were incubated with 293 cell lysate in the presence of DTT, no additive, or H2O2 (Fig. 5B). Again, Txnip C247S served as a negative control and no Txnip C247S binding was detected (Fig. 5B, left). However, redox manipulation during binding had the opposite effect from redox manipulation of thioredoxin alone: addition of 100 μm H2O2 had no effect while addition of 100 μm DTT inhibited binding (Fig. 5B, right). The results of these two experiments are consistent with a disulfide exchange mechanism and suggest that Txnip is present as either an intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide. Because Txnip interacts with reduced thioredoxin, the disulfide does not come from thioredoxin. Furthermore, addition of DTT during binding inhibits the reaction, suggesting that DTT reduces the putative Txnip disulfide and prevents disulfide exchange. We therefore considered evidence that Txnip might have an intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide. Western analysis for Txnip in fresh lysate from 293 cells overexpressing Txnip (Fig. 1, input lysates) or endogenous Txnip from NIH 3T3 and Thp1 monocytic cell lines (not shown) showed little evidence for JY2 reactivity at sizes larger than the monomer under nonreducing conditions. The absence of evidence for an intermolecular disulfide, taken together with the redox-sensitive mobility shift of Txnip (Fig. 1), was thus most consistent with the hypothesis that Txnip contains one or more redox-active intramolecular disulfides. A Second Txnip Cysteine Is Critical For Efficient Thioredoxin Binding—If an intramolecular Txnip disulfide were required for interaction with thioredoxin, the simplest hypothesis would be that the disulfide involves cysteine 247 and that its partner Txnip cysteine would also be required for interaction with thioredoxin. We therefore generated cysteine-to-serine mutants of the four cysteines in the Txnip N-terminal arrestin domain and tested them for interaction with thioredoxin-GST (Fig. 6). The Txnip C63S mutant nearly abolished binding by thioredoxin-GST, identifying a second Txnip cysteine that is important for thioredoxin interaction. This result therefore supports the hypothesis that Txnip contains an intramolecular disulfide between Cys-63 and Cys-247 that allows interaction with reduced thioredoxin by disulfide exchange. Furthermore, the Western analysis suggested that, although some binding of the Txnip C63S to thioredoxin was still possible, no binding at all of the Txnip C247S was detected. We therefore hypothesized that Txnip Cys-247 is more critical for thioredoxin binding, because it forms the disulfide with thioredoxin, whereas Txnip Cys-63 is required for efficient reaction by disulfide exchange, but mutation of this cysteine does not prevent the interaction completely. This hypothesis is also consistent with the yeast two-hybrid analysis that found a Txnip truncation construct with deletion of the amino-terminal 155 residues still bound thioredoxin (15Yamanaka H. Maehira F. Oshiro M. Asato T. Yanagawa Y. Takei H. Nakashima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Txnip Cys-247 Is Critical For Inhibition of Thioredoxin Activity in Adipocytes—To test whether the Txnip mixed disulfide is important for the inhibition of thioredoxin activity by Txnip, we overexpressed wild-type and Txnip C247S in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes by lentiviral transduction. Because these cells are post-mitotic, any confounding effect of proliferation rate on thioredoxin activity is avoided. Four days after transduction, thioredoxin-mediated insulin-reducing activity in the cell lysates was measured, normalized to total protein content, and then normalized to the mean activity of the control cells (transduced with virus expressing an empty vector) (Fig. 7). In cells transduced with wild-type Txnip, thioredoxin activity was reduced to 48 ± 13% (mean ± S.D.; n = 5) of control levels (p < 0.001). In contrast, in cells transduced with Txnip C247S, thioredoxin activity was 120 ± 2% of control levels (p < 0.001 for comparison with wild-type Txnip; not significantly different for comparison with controls). These data provide evidence that Txnip-thioredoxin mixed disulfide formation is functionally important for the inhibition of the reducing activity of thioredoxin by Txnip. However, because these experiments may involve more than physiological levels of Txnip expression, the effects of the Txnip-thioredoxin interaction in vivo may be different (though the overexpression obtained here was only ∼2-fold). In addition, other functions of Txnip and thioredoxin may not be dependent on or affected by mixed disulfide formation. The evidence shown here for a stable mixed disulfide between Txnip and thioredoxin also strengthens the more general hypothesis that the role of thioredoxin in redox signaling is not limited to involvement in reduction reactions but may also include protein-protein interactions that are regulated by the state of its redox-active cysteines. In particular, several aspects of the Txnip-thioredoxin interaction are similar to the interaction of ASK1 with thioredoxin. Like Txnip, ASK1 does not bind the thioredoxin active-site mutant (C32S,C35S) and binds preferentially to reduced thioredoxin, suggesting the thioredoxin active-site cysteines are involved. Furthermore, mutation of a single thioredoxin active-site cysteine appears to stabilize the complex, consistent with the technique of “trapping” the mixed disulfide complex by C35A mutation (7Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.M. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Finally, mutagenesis of ASK1 has identified a single cysteine-to-serine mutation that is critical for the interaction with thioredoxin. Thus based on the results here we speculate that ASK1 may also bind thioredoxin by a disulfide exchange reaction. However, support for this hypothesis would require evidence to demonstrate either an intramolecular or intermolecular ASK1 disulfide. In summary, the results shown here provide evidence that Txnip and thioredoxin form a stable mixed disulfide by disulfide exchange. We propose that oxidized Txnip contains a disulfide linkage between cysteines 63 and 247, and the oxidized Txnip reacts with thioredoxin to form a disulfide between Txnip cysteine 247 and thioredoxin cysteine 32 (Fig. 8). In this model, either reduction of Txnip or oxidation of thioredoxin would prevent the interaction. We speculate that identification of the mechanism and generation of mutants that do not bind thioredoxin may allow identification of thioredoxin-independent functions of Txnip, based on its arrestin domain structure. These results also support the hypothesis that thioredoxin, in addition to its reducing activity, can participate in redox signaling through the formation of mixed disulfide complexes with other signaling proteins in a redox-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2067659770,"Previous studies have consistently shown that caloric restriction (CR) decreases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) (mitROS) generation and oxidative damage to mtDNA and mitochondrial proteins, and increases maximum longevity, although the mechanisms responsible for this are unknown. We recently found that protein restriction (PR) also produces these changes independent of energy restriction. Various facts link methionine to aging, and methionine restriction (MetR) without energy restriction increases, like CR, maximum longevity. We have thus hypothesized that MetR is responsible for the decrease in mitROS generation and oxidative stress in PR and CR. In this investigation we subjected male rats to exactly the same dietary protocol of MetR that is known to increase their longevity. We have found, for the first time, that MetR profoundly decreases mitROS production, decreases oxidative damage to mtDNA, lowers membrane unsaturation, and decreases all five markers of protein oxidation measured in rat heart and liver mitochondria. The concentration of complexes I and IV also decreases in MetR. The decrease in mitROS generation occurs in complexes I and III in liver and in complex I in heart mitochondria, and is due to an increase in efficiency of the respiratory chain in avoiding electron leak to oxygen. These changes are strikingly similar to those observed in CR and PR, suggesting that the decrease in methionine ingestion is responsible for the decrease in mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative stress, and possibly part of the decrease in aging rate, occurring during caloric restriction."

Using an unbiased global screen for CpG island methylation events, we have identified a non-random pattern of DNA hypermethylation acquired in p16-repressed cells. Interestingly, this pattern included loci located upstream of a number of homeobox genes. Upon removal of p16INK4A activity in primary human mammary epithelial cells, polycomb repressors, EZH2 and SUZ12, are up-regulated and recruited to HOXA9, a locus expressed during normal breast development and epigenetically silenced in breast cancer. We demonstrate that at this targeted locus, the up-regulation of polycomb repressors is accompanied by the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases and the hypermethylation of DNA, an endpoint, which we show to be dependent on SUZ12 expression.

The product of the INK4A locus, p16, encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that functions as a negative regulator of cyclin/CDK complexes.

Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In contrast to the transforming properties of HOXA9 in lymphocytes, it has been reported that HOXA9 expression is necessary for lactational differentiation (22Chen F. Capecchi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and is absent in breast cancer (23Unger M.A. Microarray Analysis Identifies HOXA9 as a Novel Breast Cancer Progression Gene. Ph.D. thesis. University of Pennsylvania, 2002Google Scholar). However, the role of HOXA9 in the mammary gland is unclear. Rare foci of morphologically normal epithelial cells with hypermethylation of p16INK4A promoter sequences and loss of p16INK4A activity have been observed in vivo in disease-free tissue from breast (24Holst C.R.

In the breast, these rare p16INK4A-silenced cells (variant human mammary epithelial cells or vHMEC) can be isolated from breast tissue samples and propagated in culture where they have been shown to exhibit selected pre-neoplastic phenotypes and biomarkers (18McDermott K.M.

In the present study, we show that loss of tumor suppressor p16INK4A activity leads to the up-regulation of polycomb proteins, EZH2 and SUZ12 and DNA hypermethylation. We have identified a non-random pattern of DNA hypermethylation using an unbiased global screen for CpG island methylation events in primary human mammary epithelial cells with loss of p16INK4A activity. We demonstrate that polycomb proteins play a causal role in targeting DNA hypermethylation to the HOXA9 locus. In primary breast tumors, we find HOXA9 is epigenetically silenced. These studies suggest that epigenetic changes, controlled by loss of p16INK4A activity, are some of the earliest events in breast tumor progression. Cell Culture and Plasmids—Isolation and culture of HMEC in modified MCDB 170 (MEGM, Cambrex) has been described (35Hammond S.L. Ham R.G. Stampfer M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), HMF were grown in RPMI1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. We studied HMEC/vHMEC/HMF from reduction mammoplasty specimens from ten individuals: 48 and 240 (kindly provided by Martha Stampfer), RM9, RM13, RM15, RM16, RM18, RM20, RM21, and RM163 (cells derived in our laboratory). vHMEC clones were generated using standard ring cloning procedures. Population doublings (PD) were calculated using the equation PD = log(A/B)/log2, where A is the number of cells collected, and B is the number of cells plated. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by FACS. pBABE-myc-EZH2 has been described (36Caretti G. Di Padova M. Micales B. Lyons G.E. Sartorelli V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The SUZ12 ORF was excised from pCMV-SUZ12 (a kind gift from Dr. Peggy Farnham) and cloned into pBABE-Hygro. The shRNA specific for p16INK4a encoded inverted repeats of 27 bp corresponding to nt 381-407 of the human CDKN2A p16INK4a cDNA (GenBank™ accession No. NM000077), separated by an 8-nt spacer (37Narita M. Nunez S. Heard E. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The shRNA specific for GFP was purchased from Open Biosystems. Constructs were packaged in Phoenix A cells for viral propagation. Retroviral infection of HMEC/vHMEC was carried out using standard methods. Puromycin selection (4 μg/ml) or hygromycin selection (20 μg/ml) was applied 24 h after retroviral infection and continued for 5 d after which cells were harvested. Transient transfection of HMEC with siSUZ12 (SMARTpool M006957) or siControl (D001206) (Dharmacon) was carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). In siRNA/shRNA combination treatment, retroviral infection was followed 12 h later by siSUZ12 or siControl transfection. Another 24 h later, puromycin selection was applied (4 μg/ml) for 5 d after which time the cells were harvested. In order to induce demethylation, we incubated vHMEC with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (1 μm) and drug-containing media was replaced every 24 h for 3 days. Bisulfite Treatment, PCR Analysis, and Western Blotting—We isolated genomic DNA (Promega) from cells and performed bisulfite treatment basically as described (38Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). We digested 2 μg of genomic DNA with EcoRV and then denatured it in 0.3 m NaOH for 20 min at 37 °C. We used an 8-h incubation at 55 °C followed by removal of free bisulfite using a Wizard Clean Up kit (Promega). PCR was performed using primers to amplify region gb/AC004080: 43040-42674 (MR1) or 40432-40134 (HOX promoter). Nested PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) followed by nucleotide sequencing using the Big-Dye Termination method (ABI). Methylation-specific PCR primers to the HOXA9 regulatory region were designed by the MethPrimer program (39Li L.C. Dahiya R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) and identified methylated or unmethylated alleles (A9MS: 5′-TCGGGGTTAGATAGGGAGTCGGGA-3′, A9MA:5′-AAAATAAAAACGAAAAACAAACGAA-3′, A9US:5′-TTGGGGTTAGATAGGGAGTTGGGA-3′, A9UA:5′-AAAAATAAAAACAAAAAACAAACAAA-3′). Total RNA was isolated from cells and cDNA synthesized using standard methods. Quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan) was performed on cDNA (40Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar) using the standard curve method with primer/probe sets for HOXA9 (ABI: Hs00365956_m1), p16INK4A (ABI: Hs00233365_m1) SUZ12 (ABI: Hs01093658_m1), EZH2 (ABI: Hs00544830_m1), EED (ABI: Hs00243609_m1), PCNA (ABI: Hs00427214_g1), and for GUSB (ABI: Hs99999908_m1). The expression of GUSB (external control) was used to normalize for variances in input cDNA. For Western blot analysis, 30 μg of protein from total cell extracts or nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated in gradient (4-20%) polyacrylamide gels (FMC) and transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Biosciences) membrane. Lysates were exposed to rabbit polyclonal anti-p16INK4A (Upstate), anti-SUZ12 (Abcam), anti-HOXA9, anti-EZH2, anti-EED or anti-Myc tag (Upstate), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Calbiochem). Actin, tubulin (Sigma), or Lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as loading controls. RLGS—We carried out RLGS as described (41Hatada I. Hayashizaki Y. Hirotsune S. Komatsubara H. Mukai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9523-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonspecific, sheared ends of genomic DNA (2-5 ug) were blocked in a 10-μl reaction by the addition of nucleotide analogues (αS-dGTP, αS-dCTP, ddATP, ddTTP) with DNA polymerase I (2 units; 37 °C, 20 min) followed by enzyme inactivation (65 °C, 30 min). The buffer was then adjusted and the DNA was digested (37 °C, 2 h) with 20 units NotI (Promega). We used Sequenase (version 2.0, USB) to fill in the NotI ends with [α-32P]dGTP (New England Nuclear) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled DNA was digested (37 °C, 1 h) with EcoRV (20 units; Promega) and a proportion was electrophoresed through a 60-cm long, 0.8% agarose tube gel (first dimension separation). The agarose gel was then equilibrated in HinfI digestion buffer and the DNA digested in the gel with HinfI (700 units; Promega) at 37 °C for 2 h. The agarose gel was then placed horizontally (rotated 90° relative to the first electrophoresis) across the top of a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, the two gels connected with molten agarose and the DNA was electrophoresed in the second dimension. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film in the presence of intensifying screens (Quanta III, DuPont) for 2-10 days. The central portion of the RLGS profile (grid sections 2A through 5E) exhibits the best fragment resolution and was used for methylation analysis. Of greater than 1000 fragments in this region, 762 which were non-overlapping with other fragments, single copy intensity and present on HMECs from three different individuals were included in the analysis. Of these 762 fragments, 24 showed complete or near complete absence in at least one vHMEC population. To test for the presence of heterogeneity in methylation frequencies among islands, we compared methylation frequencies of the islands to what would be expected under null hypotheses of no preferential methylation sites. To avoid making parametric assumptions, a permutation approach was employed. To test for equal methylation frequency among the islands, we emulated the null hypothesis by fixing the marginal number of methylation events for each clone and permuting methylation events, thus randomly assigning methylation events occurring in a given clone to the islands. For each iteration, the proportion of resulting methylation frequency for each island was retained. The procedure was repeated 10,000 times. Unadjusted p values were assigned by calculating the proportion of permutations in which the resulting methylation frequency for a given island exceeded the observed frequency. Under null hypothesis, the p values should follow a Uniform (0, 1) distribution. We used a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the degree of plausibility for the null hypothesis of no differential methylation and obtained a p value of 0. After Bonferroni adjustment for 762 tests, 16 islands were significantly hypermethylated (p value = 0 with upper boundary of 0.0762 because of the limit of 10,000 permutations). Alternatively, by considering maximum frequency observed in each permutation and comparing the observed frequencies to the distribution of the maximum, we obtained a maxT adjusted p value for each island (42Westfall P.H. Young S.S. Resampling-based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for p-value Adjustment. Wiley, New York1993Google Scholar). Sixteen islands were assigned maxT adjusted p value less than 0.01. This insures the probability of less than 1% of having at least one false positive. All calculations were performed in a freely available R statistical environment (43Ithaka R. Gentleman R.J. J. Comp. Graph Stat. 1996; 5: 299-314Google Scholar). Bioinformatics programs were used to find the position of RLGS fragments in the genome. Luciferase Reporter Assays—1 × 105 vHMEC were seeded in 24-well plates. After 24 h of treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (1 μm), 1 μg of the promoter reporter (pGL3, EphB4, EphB4mt) was transfected into vHMEC using a cationic lipid (Invitrogen). Lysates were harvested 48 h later and dual luciferase analysis performed (Promega). Equal amounts of CMV-driven constructs were transfected in each experiment, and cotransfection of a Renilla luciferase reporter (20 ng) was used to allow standardization for transfection efficiency. Drug-containing media was replaced every 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—For chromatin immunoprecipitations, DNA-protein cross-linking was performed as described (44Meluh P.B. Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 414-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mm DSG (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min, then formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. DNA shearing was performed in nuclei lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, Roche) with sonication to achieve an average DNA length of 400-500 bp. Samples were diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of either rabbit polyclonal anti-SUZ12 (Abcam), anti-DNMT3a (Novus), anti-DNMT3b (Abcam), anti-DNMT1 (Immgenex), anti-histone H3 (Upstate), or rabbit IgG (mock IP). Samples were incubated with protein A/G-agarose and bound complexes were eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Samples were incubated 4 h at 65°C to reverse cross-linking, and proteins were digested with Proteinase K. Following purification of DNA fragments (QiaQuick PCR purification kit, Qiagen), promoter sequences were amplified using PCR. The following primer set was used: MR2 nt 42764-42556 of AC004080. Immunohistochemistry—Five-micron sections cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or tissue arrays (Biogenex) were deparaffinized and rehydrated following standard protocols. Sections were incubated with antisera against HOXA9 (Upstate) following the manufacturer's instructions. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the Vectastain Elite avidin-biotin complex kit following standard protocol (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained in hematoxylin dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and mounted in permount. Loss of p16INK4A Activity Up-regulates Selected PcG Proteins—Because cells with loss of p16INK4A activity exhibit increased E2F activity, a known regulator of PcG expression, we wished to use microarray analysis to determine if factors involved in epigenetic silencing show altered expression in vHMEC compared with HMEC. Two members of the polycomb group family of proteins, SUZ12 and EZH2, were among the genes that were up-regulated when vHMEC were analyzed by microarray. To verify the gene expression profiling data, we assessed the mRNA levels of several PRC2 genes (SUZ12, EZH2, and EED) in HMEC and vHMEC populations using quantitative real-time PCR. Both SUZ12 and EZH2 mRNA is increased in vHMEC compared with HMEC, 4-fold and 9-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). These striking differences in PRC gene expression are independent of proliferative differences between HMEC and vHMEC, because both cell populations double with similar kinetics (30 h and 26 h, respectively) and exhibit a similar S phase fraction under the conditions of these analyses (15 and 20%, respectively; data not shown). Additionally the increase in expression of EZH2 and SUZ12 is also observed after normalization of expression to PCNA levels (supplemental Fig. S1A). The levels of a third component of the PRC2 complex, EED, shown to be an E2F target gene in some cell types (5Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Capra M. Prosperini E. Colli E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5323-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), remain unchanged. We verified that the up-regulation of SUZ12 and EZH2 mRNAs was indeed accompanied by an increase in protein expression via Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B) and documented that EZH2 localized to the nuclear compartment, while SUZ12 was localized to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment in vHMEC (supplemental Fig. S1B). SUZ12 and EZH2 protein expression is low in HMEC but is increased significantly in vHMEC, whereas the levels of EED remain unchanged (Fig. 1B). HMEC obtained from nine different individuals all display a low level of EZH2 when compared with their isogenic vHMEC population. The basal levels of EZH2 expression in HMEC vary between individuals and extremes of expression are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. To determine if there is a causal relationship between loss of p16INK4A activity and increased expression of PcG genes in these primary human cells, we assessed lysates from HMEC after infection with retrovirus containing a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to either GFP or p16INK4A by Western blot analysis. Whereas HMEC infected with retrovirus containing a shRNA to GFP (shGFP) have low levels of SUZ12 and EZH2, HMEC infected with retrovirus containing a shRNA to p16INK4A (shp16) show high levels of EZH2 and SUZ12 expression upon decreased p16INK4A levels (Fig. 1C), comparable to the levels of EZH2 and SUZ12 seen in vHMEC (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether p16INK4A expression is sufficient to repress PcG protein expression in vHMEC, we assessed lysates from vHMEC after infection with retrovirus containing empty vector control or wild-type p16INK4A by Western blot analysis. We find vHMEC infected with retrovirus containing wild-type p16INK4A have decreased expression of both SUZ12 and EZH2 when compared with vHMEC infected with retrovirus containing empty vector (Fig. 1C). These determinations were made at a time point when vHMEC expressing wild-type p16INK4A were still engaged in the cell cycle (4 days), a time prior to the eventual proliferative arrest that they enter at day 7. Other CDK inhibitors at the CDKN2 locus, p14ARF and p15, are expressed in both HMEC and vHMEC ((33Romanov S.R. Kozakiewicz B.K. Holst C.R. Stampfer M.R. Haupt L.M. Tlsty T.D. Nature. 2001; 409: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and data not shown). We also assessed the expression of PcG proteins in human mammary fibroblasts (HMF). There is no expression of SUZ12 and EZH2 in HMF (Fig. 1C, parent). Furthermore, expression of PcG proteins cannot be induced in HMF infected with retrovirus containing shp16 (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that loss of p16INK4A activity is sufficient to drive overexpression of SUZ12 and EZH2 in mammary epithelial cells but not human mammary fibroblasts. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, in HMEC, expression of both SUZ12 and EZH2 can be directly influenced by loss of p16INK4A activity in a manner that is independent of proliferation status. Increased Expression of Selected PcG Proteins Is Accompanied by Targeted DNA Hypermethylation—To determine whether p16INK4A-mediated up-regulation of PcG proteins is associated with DNA hypermethylation, we compared the methylation profiles of populations of primary human mammary cells using RLGS, a technique that allows the unbiased screening of genome-wide CpG island methylation events (45Costello J.F. Fruhwald M.C. Smiraglia D.J. Rush L.J. Robertson G.P. Gao X. Wright F.A. Feramisco J.D. Peltomaki P. Lang J.C. Schuller D.E. Yu L. Bloomfield C.D. Caligiuri M.A. Yates A. Nishikawa R. Su Huang H.

We compared in vivo uncultured breast tissue and organoids, as well as in vitro cultured primary cells (HMEC and HMF) to vHMEC that exhibited overexpressed PcG proteins. The uncultured breast tissue, obtained by biopsy, and the paired organoid sample, partially processed to remove most stromal components and enriched in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, retain the epithelial cells in their physiological environment and allow us to detect potential culture effects.

https://openalex.org/W1542692444,"The host response to fungi is in part dependent on activation of evolutionarily conserved receptors, including toll-like receptors and phagocytic receptors. However, the molecular nature of fungal ligands responsible for this activation is largely unknown. Herein, we describe the isolation and structural characterization of an α-glucan from Pseudallescheria boydii cell wall and evaluate its role in the induction of innate immune response. These analyses indicate that α-glucan of P. boydii is a glycogen-like polysaccharide consisting of linear 4-linked α-d-Glcp residues substituted at position 6 with α-d-Glcp branches. Soluble α-glucan, but not β-glucan, led to a dose-dependent inhibition of conidia phagocytosis. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the phagocytic index occurred when α-glucan from conidial surface was removed by enzymatic treatment with α-amyloglucosidase, thus indicating an essential role of α-glucan in P. boydii internalization by macrophages. α-Glucan stimulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and dendritic cells; again this effect is abolished by treatment with α-amyloglucosidase. Finally, α-glucan induces cytokine secretion by cells of the innate immune system in a mechanism involving toll-like receptor 2, CD14, and MyD88. These results might have relevance in the context of infections with P. boydii and other fungi, and α-glucan could be a target for intervention during fungal infections.

Pseudallescheria boydii is a saprophytic fungus widespread in soil and polluted water and has recently emerged as an agent of localized as well as disseminated infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Clinical observations and data obtained from experimental models indicate the essential role of innate immunity in resistance against infections caused by pathogenic fungi.

TLRs mediate the recognition of a large array of molecules present in pathogens, triggering the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of microbicidal mechanisms, and the induction of adaptive immunity (9Takeda K.

TLR activation initiates a signaling cascade through a conserved pathway shared by IL-1R and IL-18R that requires adaptor proteins such as MyD88 leading to NFκB activation and the induction of different pro-inflammatory genes (12Akira S.

A great variety of pathogen molecules have been described to signal through TLRs, especially for TLR2 and TLR4, the best characterized TLRs. TLR2 recognizes lipoteichoic acid, bacterial lipopeptides, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of protozoan parasites (13Schroder N.W. Morath S. Alexander C.

Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of TLRs in the recognition of fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. A. fumigatus induces cytokine release as well as NFκB activation through TLR2 and TLR4 activation (20Mambula S.S. Sau K. Henneke P. Golenbock D. Levitz S. J. Biol.

Genetic deficiency of TLR4 makes mice more susceptible to an experimental A. fumigatus infection following immunosuppression, and TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice present an increased fungal load in the lungs upon A. fumigatus intranasal challenge (22Bellocchio S. Montagnoli C. Bozza S. Gaziano R. Rossi G. Mambula S.S. Vecchi A. Mantovani A. Levitz S.M. Romani L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3059-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Balloy V.

However, the nature of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns expressed by A. fumigatus that trigger the synthesis of TNF-α, IL-12, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 remains to be established. Resistance to experimental infection with C. albicans requires TLR2 and TLR4 as observed by the increased fungal load on the kidneys of TLR4 mutant mice, C3H/HeJ, and the higher susceptibility of TLR2−/− mice to C. albicans infection (24Netea M.G.

Although the results demonstrate that TLR2 and TLR4 participate in the recognition of pathogenic fungi, the molecules that trigger the activation of the TLR-associated signaling pathway leading to the induction of the innate immune response are largely unknown. In the present study we describe the structural characterization of an α-glucan, a glycogen-like polysaccharide extracted from the P. boydii cell wall, and evaluate its role in the induction of innate immune response. The α-glucan from P. boydii is essential to conidial phagocytosis by macrophages and induces cytokine secretion by cells of the innate immune system in a mechanism involving TLR2, CD14, and MyD88. Mice—C57/BL6, BALB/c, and C57BL/10 mice were obtained from the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz Breeding Unit (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). C57BL/10ScN mice were obtained from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and C57BL/10ScCr mice were obtained from the Universidade Federal Fluminense (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). MyD88, TLR2, and CD14 knock-out mice (on a C57BL/6 background) were kindly provided by Dr. Akira from the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, and Dr. Douglas Golenbock from the University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA. Reagents—LPS (O111:B4), zymosan, and thioglycolate were purchased from Sigma, and Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3Cys) was obtained from EMC Microcollections (Tübingen, Germany). Laminarin from Laminaria digitata was kindly supplied by Prof. Michael Noseda from the Departamento de Bioquímica, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Brazil. Polymixin B was obtained from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH). A detoxifying polymixin column was purchased from Cambrex. RPMI medium for macrophage culture was obtained from Sigma and was supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) obtained from Invitrogen. Microorganism and Growth Conditions—P. boydii, isolated from eumycotic mycetoma, was kindly supplied by Bodo Wanke from Evandro Chagas Hospital, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cells were grown on Sabouraud solid slants, inoculated in liquid culture medium, and incubated for 7 days at 25 °C with shaking. Cultures were then transferred to the same medium and incubated for 7 days at the same temperature with shaking; the mycelium was filtered, washed with distilled water, and stored at −20 °C. For phagocytic assays, conidia were grown on Petri plates containing modified Sabouraud medium at 25 °C. After 7 days in culture, conidia cells were obtained by washing the plate surface with phosphate-buffered saline and filtered through gauze to remove hyphae fragments and debris. Conidial suspensions were heat-killed by autoclaving the preparation at 120 °C, for 15 min, washed, and counted. Extraction and Fractionation of P. boydii Glucan—Hyphae of P. boydii were extracted with 2% KOH for 2 h at 100°C. The alkali extract was neutralized with glacial acetic acid and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. The resulting precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. The crude polysaccharide was fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex S-200 column (30 × 1.0 cm) coupled to an AKTA Purifier liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using phosphate buffer 0.01 m, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0, as eluant pumped at 0.5 ml/min for 60 min. The elution profiles of the gel-filtration chromatography were monitored by refractive index detection, and the collected fractions were assessed for their carbohydrate content. Sugar Analysis—Total carbohydrate was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (26Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39449) Google Scholar) and protein by the Folin phenol reagent method (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucan (1 mg) was hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 3 h, and the solution evaporated to dryness. The resulting monosaccharides were characterized by high performance TLC and quantified by GC as alditol acetate derivatives (28Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 37: 1602-1604Google Scholar) using a capillary column of OV-225 (30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter), with temperatures programmed from 50 to 220 °C at 50 °C/min. Methylation Analysis—Methylation analysis was carried out by the method of Tischer et al. (29Tischer C.A. Gorin P.A. Iacomini M. Carbohydr. Polymers. 2002; 47: 151-158Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using a modification of the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (30Ciucanu I. Kerek F.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). Glucan (1 mg) was dissolved in a drop of H2O, which was diluted with Me2SO (∼1 ml) and then MeI (1 ml). Powdered NaOH (0.3 g) was added, and the mixture was agitated vigorously with a vortex for 30 min and then left overnight. After neutralization with HOAc, the product was then extracted with CHCl3 and washed three times with H2O. Upon evaporation, the resulting per-O-methylated product was converted into partially O-methylated alditol acetates by successive treatments with 3% MeOH-HCl for 2 h at 70 °C, 0.5 m H2SO4 for 14 h at 100 °C, reduction with NaBD4, and acetylation with Ac2O-pyridine. The products were analyzed by GC-MS on a capillary column of DB-225 (31Bjorndal H. Lindberg B. Svennson S. Univ. Stockol. Chem. Commun. 1967; 8: 1-76Google Scholar), programmed from 50 °C (1 min) at 40 °C/min to 210 °C (constant temperature). Treatment with Yeast α-Amyloglucosidase—Glucan (1 mg) was incubated with 1.5 mg of yeast α-amyloglucosidase in 0.05 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) at 37 °C for 22 h. At the end of the incubation period, the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme, centrifuged, and the supernatant was concentrated and applied to a TLC plate. This was eluted with n-BuOH-Me2CO-H2O (4:5:1, v/v) and developed with 0.05% (w/v) orcinol in 10% H2SO4 at 100 °C for 10 min, using 10 μg of glucose as standard. Endotoxin Removal—Glucan (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of apyrogenic saline and then applied to an immobilized polymixin B gel column (Detoxi-Gel™ Endotoxin removing gel, Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) were recorded, using a Varian INOVA spectrometer, for a sample (10 mg) of the glucan in D2O, at 60 °C. Chemical shifts were relative to internal trimethylsilylpropionic acid-d4 sodium salt (TPS) at 0 ppm (1H) and external trimethylsilane (TMS) at 0 ppm (13C). Two-dimensional spectra (COSY, TOCSY, and heteronuclear single quantum coherence) were performed using the pulse sequences supplied by the instrument manufacturer. Phagocytic Assay—Elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained by the intraperitoneal instillation of 2 ml of 3% sterile thioglycollate. After 4 days, mice were sacrificed, and the peritoneal macrophages were harvested and washed with chilled HBSS, and plated. Elicited macrophages (2 × 105cells/ml) were cultured over round glass coverslips (13 mm) in 24-well flat bottom microtest plates. Adherent monolayers were challenged with 500 μl of suspensions of heat-killed conidia containing 106 cells/ml. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% of CO2 for 60 min in RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were rinsed with HBSS for removal of non-internalized conidia. The preparations were fixed in Bouin's fixative and stained with Giemsa. The influence of α-glucan on conidia phagocytosis was evaluated by adding different concentrations of the polysaccharide (25, 50, and 100 μg/ml) and of the polysaccharide (100 μg/ml) after digestion with α-amyloglucosidase to the cultures simultaneously with the addition of conidia. The influence of a different purified glucans in the phagocytosis of conidia was also tested by adding 100 μg/ml selected glucans to the cultures. To determine the phagocytic indexes (PIs), 200 cells were counted and the percentage of cells that ingested at least one particle was multiplied by the mean number of internalized particles (32Popi A.F.F. Lopes J.D. Mariano M. Cell. Immunol. 2002; 218: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of Zymosan Particles—Macrophage monolayers were challenged with 500 μl of suspensions of zymosan particles (106 particles/ml). After incubation at 37 °C in 5% of CO2 for 60 min in RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were rinsed with HBSS for removal of non-internalized particles. The preparations were fixed in Bouin's fixative and stained with Giemsa. The influence of α-glucan and laminarin on the phagocytosis of zymosan was carried out by adding 100 μg/ml of each glucan, simultaneously to zymosan particles. Macrophage Culture and Stimulation—Elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained by the intraperitoneal instillation of 2 ml of 3% sterile thioglycollate. After 4 days, mice were sacrificed and the peritoneal macrophages were harvested, washed with chilled HBSS, and plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% of CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with HBSS. Adherent cells were stimulated for 4 h, in RPMI medium, with the α-glucan, LPS, or Pam3Cys, at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. After this period the supernatant was recovered for TNF determination by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymixin B (1 or 10 μg/ml) was added 5 min before the stimulation with α-glucan, to rule out the possibility that the stimulating activity was due to contaminating lipopolysaccharides. Generation and Stimulation of Murine Bone Marrow-derived Dendritic Cells—Dendritic cells were generated as previously described (33Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, bone marrow was harvested from the tibia and femur of C57/Bl6 or TLR2−/− mice. The cells were resuspended at 106 per milliliter in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with vitamins, amino acids, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, recombinant murine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and recombinant murine IL-4 at 10 ng/ml. After 5 days, fresh medium was added to culture and with 7 days of culture, the cells were collected and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were separated by Optiprep gradient (Sigma) by centrifugation at 600 × g for 30 min at 24 °C. This protocol generated >75% of CD11c+ cells. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were plated in 96 wells at a density of 2 × 105/well and incubated for 16 h with the stimuli, after which the supernatant was recovered for the determination of cytokines by ELISA. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS for Windows (Version 10.0.1, SPSS Inc., 1989–1999). Statistical differences among the experimental groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls correction or with the t test. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Isolation and Characterization of the Glucan from P. boydii—Mycelia of P. boydii were extracted with hot 2% aqueous potassium hydroxide at 100 °C followed by neutralization with acetic acid and precipitation with ethanol. The crude precipitate was applied to a Superdex 200 column, which was eluted with a discontinuous gradient of aqueous NaCl. Carbohydrate-containing fractions F-1, F-2, and F-3 were obtained. Hydrolysis of F-1 followed by TLC examination of the products showed only glucose, confirmed by GC-MS analysis of derived alditol acetates. These results indicate that the F1 fraction contains a glucan. Methylation-GC-MS analysis of the glucan gave rise to partially O-methylated alditol acetates, which corresponded to non-reducing end units of Glcp (13%), 4-O- (63%), and 4,6-di- O-substituted Glcp units (24%) (Table 1). The P. boydii glucan yields 2,3-di-O-methyl glucose, which is characteristic of branch points with glucose units in (1→6) linkage, and a high proportion of 2,3,6-tri-O-methylglucose, indicating the presence of linear portions of (1→4)-linked glucopyranosyl units.TABLE 1Molar percentages of O-methylalditol acetates obtained on methylation analysis of the glucan of P. boydiiO-Methylalditol acetatemolar %2,3,4,6-Me4-Glc132,3,6-Me3-Glc632,3-Me2-Glc24 Open table in a new tab The 1H NMR spectrum of the purified glucan (Fig. 1A) was very similar to that of glycogen from A. fumigatus, Mycobacterium bovis, and rabbit liver (34Bahia M.C.F.S.

An envelope of two α-anomeric signals was seen at 5.39 ppm with a smaller α-anomeric signal at 4.98 ppm. The signals between 3.9 and 3.4 ppm were assigned to ring proton resonances (H-2 to H-6) by means of two-dimensional COSY (not shown) and TOCSY spectra (Fig. 1B). The three residue types to which signals were assigned were designated A (→4-αGlcp-(1→4)-), B (terminal αGlcp- (1→4)-), and C (→4-αGlcp-(1→6)-) by comparison with earlier studies (36Zang L.H.

Open table in a new tab The 13C NMR spectrum of the α-glucan of P. boydii was partially assigned by means of a heteronuclear correlated spectrum (not shown) and is compared with corresponding published values in Table 2. A DEPT-135 spectrum confirmed the assignment of the resonance at 61.3 ppm in the 13C spectrum to C-6, as this methylene carbon signal was inverted with respect to the methine ring carbon signals (Fig. 2A). A small, broad 13C resonance at about 69 ppm was also inverted and may be assigned to C-6 of 6-linked glucose, although no other signals from the branch point, 4,6-linked residues could be identified. Assignments of resonances from 4)-αGlc-(1→4)- (residue type A) and terminal αGlc-(1→4)- (residue type B) were in good agreement with published values (Table 2); limited assignments could also be made for 4)-αGlc-(1→6)- (residue type C). The ratio C-4 (A + C):C-4 (B) = 89:11, by integration of signals in the 13C NMR spectrum, indicates that ∼11% of residues are not glycosylated at the 4-position. These results indicate that the α-glucan of P. boydii is a glycogen-like polysaccharide consisting of linear 4-linked α-d-Glcp residues substituted at position 6 with -α-d-Glcp branches. α-Glucan Has an Important Role in the Phagocytic Process of P. boydii by Macrophages—To investigate whether the α-glucan is involved in the phagocytic process of P. boydii, macrophages were incubated with heat-killed conidia at a ratio of 5:1 for 1 h in the presence or absence of α-glucan. P. boydii conidia were endocytosed by macrophages and heat-killed conidia thoroughly, and similar phagocytic indexes were obtained by challenging macrophages with live conidia (Fig. 3, A and B). The addition of increasing concentrations of α-glucan led to a dose-dependent inhibition of P. boydii phagocytosis (Fig. 3C). The concentration of 100 μg/ml α-glucan consistently caused a 50% inhibition of conidia phagocytosis. To exclude the possibility of contaminants being responsible for the inhibition of conidial phagocytosis, an α-amyloglucosidase-treated α-glucan (100 μg/ml) was added to the culture at time zero of interaction. The phagocytic index of conidia returned to the control level when macrophages were allowed to interact with the digested α-glucan (Fig. 3D). To further characterize the role of α-glucan in the phagocytosis of P. boydii, conidia were submitted to treatment with α-amyloglucosidase for 22 h at 37 °C, and their phagocytic index was compared with that from untreated conidia (Fig. 3E). A significant decrease in the phagocytic index occurred when α-glucan from conidial surface was removed by enzymatic treatment. These results suggest that α-glucan present in the P. boydii surface plays an essential role in the internalization of conidia by macrophages. To define the selectivity of α-glucan in the phagocytosis of P. boydii by macrophages, we performed the phagocytic assays in the presence of purified α-or β-glucans (Fig. 4A). A significant decrease of P. boydii phagocytosis occurred for the cultures treated with different ramified α-glucans, but not with pullulan, a linear α-glucan from the lichen Teloschistes flavicans, or laminarin, a β-glucan isolated from L. digitata.

Platelet recruitment is an important phase of platelet activation at the site of vascular injury, but it has never been investigated whether polyphenols influence platelet recruitment. The aim of the study was to analyze in vitro whether two polyphenols, quercetin and catechin, were able to affect platelet recruitment. Platelet recruitment was reduced by NO donors and by NADPH oxidase inhibitors and was enhanced by L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase. Quercetin and catechin, but not single polyphenol, significantly inhibited platelet recruitment in a concentration-dependent fashion. The formation of superoxide anion was significantly inhibited in platelets incubated with quercetin and catechin but was unaffected by a single polyphenol. Incubation of platelets with quercetin and catechin resulted in inhibition of PKC and NADPH oxidase activation. Treatment of platelets with quercetin and catechin resulted in an increase of NO and also down-regulated the expression of GpIIb/IIIa glycoprotein. This study shows that the polyphenols quercetin and catechin synergistically act in reducing platelet recruitment via inhibition of PKC-dependent NADPH oxidase activation. This effect, resulting in NO-mediated platelet glycoprotein GpIIb/IIIa down-regulation, could provide a novel mechanism through which polyphenols reduce cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020355170,"Although much is known about environmental factors that predispose individuals to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, little information is available regarding the genetic and signaling events involved1,2,3. Indeed, few genes associated with the progression of these pathologies have been discovered despite intensive research in animal models and human populations1,2,3. Here we identify Vav3, a GDP-GTP exchange factor that stimulates Rho and Rac GTPases4, as an essential factor regulating the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. Vav3-deficient mice exhibited tachycardia, systemic arterial hypertension and extensive cardiovascular remodeling. These mice also showed hyperactivity of sympathetic neurons from the time of birth. The high catecholamine levels associated with this condition led to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased levels of kidney-related hormones and the progressive loss of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. Pharmacological studies with drugs targeting sympathetic and renin-angiotensin responses confirmed the causative role and hierarchy of these events in the development of the Vav3-null mouse phenotype. These observations uncover the crucial role of Vav3 in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and cardiovascular physiology, and reveal a signaling pathway that could be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease states involving tachycardia and sympathetic hyperactivity with unknown etiologies2,5,6."
https://openalex.org/W2077828161,"Protein Ser/Thr phosphatases compose a PPP family that includes type-2 PP2A, PP4, and PP6, each with essential functions. The human PP6 gene rescues sit4ts mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Sit4 phosphatase function depends on multiple Sit4-associated protein (SAP) subunits. We report here finding a SAPS sequence domain encoded in only a single gene each in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila but in three distinct open reading frames in Xenopus, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. The SAPS proteins are more divergent in sequence than PP6. Northern hybridization showed differential distribution of the human SAPS-related mRNA in multiple human tissues, named as PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3. Antibodies were generated, distribution of endogenous PP6, PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3 proteins was examined by immunoblotting, and the abundance of mRNA and protein in various tissues did not match. FLAG-tagged PP6R1 and PP6R2 expressed in HEK293 cells co-precipitated endogenous PP6, but not PP2A or PP4, showing specificity for recognition of phosphatases. The SAPS domain of PP6R1 alone was sufficient for association with PP6, and this predicts that conserved sequence motifs in the SAPS domain accounts for the specificity. FLAG-PP6R1 and FLAG-PP6R2 co-precipitated HA-IκBϵ. Knockdown of PP6 or PP6R1 but not PP6R3 with siRNA significantly enhanced degradation of endogenous IκBϵ in response to tumor necrosis factor-α.

Protein phosphorylation by kinases and protein dephosphorylation by phosphatases is the most common mechanism for regulating cellular processes. Protein phosphatases fall into major families based on different structures, specificity and catalytic mechanisms. The protein Ser/Thr phosphatase PPP family comprises the type-1 and type-2A phosphatases that are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. The PP2A, 2The abbreviations used are: PP, protein phosphatase; SAP, Sit4-associated protein; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope tag of sequence YPYDVPDYA; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. PP4, and PP6 phosphatases are sensitive to inhibition by low doses of okadaic acid that distinguishes them from the type-1 phosphatase. The regulation and function of PP2A has been studied the most (1Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszynska G. Acta Biochim.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the function of PP6 is essentially unknown in metazoans. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic studies have implicated the essential Sit4 phosphatase, the homolog of PP6, in regulation of G1 to S progression (4Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Sutton A. Zhong T.

Mammalian PP6 is a functional homolog of Sit4 because human PP6 can rescue a temperature-sensitive mutant of sit4 from arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle, a phenotype that is rescued neither by type-1 phosphatase nor PP2A (14Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mann D.J. Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4833-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sit4 associates with the protein product of the essential S. cerevisiae gene Tap42, which acts as a multicopy suppressor of the sit4 temperature-sensitive mutant (16Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The binding of Tap42 to Sit4 is evolutionary conserved because α4, the human homolog of Tap42, binds to PP6 (18Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Unlike other known regulatory subunits, α4 binding is not specific to one type of phosphatase because it also associates with PP2A and PP4 (18Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The α4 protein is the only subunit that has been identified for mammalian PP6 to date. In yeast, besides Tap42, Sit4 co-precipitates with three other subunits termed Sit4-associated protein 155 (SAP155), SAP185, and SAP190 (21Luke M.M. Della Seta F. Di Como C.J. Sugimoto H. Kobayashi R. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2744-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Deletion of multiple SAPs produced the same phenotype as deletion of Sit4, indicating that Sit4 and SAP functions depend on one another (21Luke M.M. Della Seta F. Di Como C.J. Sugimoto H. Kobayashi R. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2744-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Phenotypic changes in response to deletion or overexpression of different SAP genes in S. cerevisiae suggest distinctive cellular functions for each of these proteins (21Luke M.M. Della Seta F.

Strains lacking SAP185 and SAP190 are hypersensitive to rapamycin and show constitutive phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α (23Rohde J.R. Campbell S. Zurita-Martinez S.A. Cutler N.S. Ashe M. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8332-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Increased expression of SAP155 but not other SAPs conferred resistance to Kluyveromyces lactis zymocin (22Jablonowski D. Butler A.R. Fichtner L. Gardiner D. Schaffrath R. Stark M.J. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of SAP155 decreases K+ efflux, whereas SAP155 deletion increases efflux. In contrast, overexpression of SAP185 increases K+ efflux, whereas deletion of SAP185 decreases efflux (24Manlandro C.M. Haydon D.H. Rosenwald A.G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, specific cellular functions of PP6 are expected to be dependent on subunits related to the yeast SAP proteins. An important biological role for PP6 in mammalian cells is indicated by its recent identification in a genome-wide screen for kinases and phosphatases that affect cell survival (25MacKeigan J.P. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Knockdown of PP6 by siRNA gave one of the highest rates of apoptosis. Here, we report the identification of three human SAPS-related genes (called PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3) and show the distinctive tissue distribution of the mRNA and expression of the proteins that differs from the mRNA distribution. We demonstrate that these putative regulatory subunits specifically associate with PP6 phosphatase compared with PP2A or PP4, and the SAPS domain itself is sufficient for recognition of PP6. Furthermore, we show that PP6R1 and PP6R2 co-precipitate IκBϵ, and using siRNA to knockdown expression of PP6 or PP6R1, we found enhanced degradation of IκBϵ, consistent for it being a substrate for PP6 that would oppose the action of IKK. Antibodies and Chemicals—Antibodies against PP6 were prepared against a peptide corresponding to residues 292–305 at the extreme C terminus of human PP6, affinity purified from chicken egg yolk and used at a 1:5000 dilution. Chickens were immunized with purified recombinant GST-PP6R1 (BC002799) made in bacteria, and the IgY was purified from chicken egg yolk was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant GST-PP6R2 (BC000976) made in bacteria, and antibodies were purified from serum using protein A-agarose and used at a 1:500 dilution.

Rabbit antibodies against the C subunit of PP2A were made previously and were used at a 1:3000 dilution (19Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against α4 were made previously and were used at a 1:3000 dilution. Anti-FLAG and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Anti-PP4 antibodies were purchased from Stratagene and used at a 1:500 dilution. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International and used at a 1:1000 dilution.

Sequence Alignment and Construction of Phylogenetic Tree—Sequence alignment of PP6R1 (KIAA1115, accession number BC0002799), PP6R2 (KIAA0685, accession number BC000976), and PP6R3 (C11orf23, accession number DQ111954) was performed using ClustalW method. PostScript output from aligned sequences was generated using ESPript (26Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). For the phylogenetic tree Clustal alignment of SAPS-related proteins was done using ClustalX 1.83, and un-gapped versions of the alignments were created in MacClade 4.05. The Parsimony Consensus (unrooted) tree was generated using PAUP*4beta10 (the most current version of PAUP) and with a Branch and Bound Search using the degapped Clustal alignment. There were two equally maximum parsimony trees found, and the figure is of a strict consensus of those two. The bootstrap proportions are from 5000 replications, done using a pure heuristic search. The phylogram was generated by using both the Clustal degapped alignment and the PAUP consensus tree in the Phylip 3.62 PROML program (Protein Maximum Likelihood without a molecular clock constraint) and having it compute optimal branch lengths for the provided tree topology given the protein alignment. Sequence identities between metazoan and human SAPS-like proteins were calculated using DNA Star (MegAlign 5.0) after ClustalW alignment of sequences. Plasmids—DNA for human PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3 was amplified by PCR from clones purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL): PP6R1, OBS#60510, GenBank™ accession number BC002799; PP6R2, OBS#875 GenBank™ accession number BC000976; PP6R3, OBS#8642489, Incyte Human cDNA. The PCR primer for amplifying OBS#60510 started at nucleotide 13 to provide an N-terminal methionine for the protein. DNA for part of human PP6R3 (GenBank™ accession number DQ111954) was amplified by PCR from HeLa cDNA generated by Thermoscript poly(dT) reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The primers for PCR of PP6R3 (DQ111954) were 5′-GAA TTC ATG TTA CAA ATT CAG AAC AGT ACA GAG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CTC GAG TCA TAC AGG GCC ATT CAC TG-3′ as the backward primer. The PP6R1, PP6R2, and both PP6R3 inserts were ligated in-frame with the FLAG epitope at the EcoRI/XhoI sites in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-FLAG and, with the exception of PP6R3 Incyte Human cDNA, in-frame with the sequence of GST at the EcoRI/XhoI sites in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1. PP6R3 (DQ111954) was ligated in-frame with maltose-binding protein at the EcoRI/XbaI sites in the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2X. FLAG-PP2A-Aα plasmid was generated as described before (27Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38912-38920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FLAG-α4 plasmid was generated as described before (19Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). DNA for human IκBϵ was amplified by PCR from a clone (catalog number EHS1001–7517588, GenBank™ accession number BC063609) purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and was ligated in-frame with HA3 at the BamHI/EcoRI sites in the mammalian expression vector pKH3. The FLAG-PP6R1 construct was used for PCR to make fragments of PP6R1 using primers 5′-GGA ATT CAT GGT GGC CTG GGT C-3′ as forward and 5′-GCT CGA GTC ACA GGT CCA CCA TGT TCT TCT-3′ as backward for PP6R1 (1–465), the same backward primer and a forward primer of 5′-GGA ATT CAT GGG CAT CCT CAT CAA CCG-3′ for PP6R1 (72–465), and 5′-GGA ATT CAT GGT GGA CCT GGT GAA CAC-3′ as forward and 5′-GCT CGA GCT ATT GGG AGC CTG G-3′ as backward for PP6R1 (462–825). Fragments were ligated in-frame with the FLAG epitope at the EcoRI/XhoI sites in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-FLAG. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cos7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were either transiently transfected using 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or calcium phosphate as the delivery method. For calcium phosphate transfections sterile deionized H2O and 10 μg of plasmid were added to 62.5 μl of 2 m CaCl2 to make up a solution of 500 μl. The calcium/DNA mix was added dropwise to 500 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 12 mm dextrose, and 50 mm Hepes) while continuously bubbling the mixture with air. After 30 min at room temperature, the mixture was added to cells at 40% confluence in 100-mm dishes. The day after transfection cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 10 ml of growth medium was added, and cells were left for 24–48 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Hypotonic lysis of cells was performed by washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline and rinsing briefly with H2O and then adding lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Pefabloc, protease inhibitor mixture set V, EDTA-free (concentration as suggested by manufacturer, Calbiochem catalog #539137), 1 μm microcystin-LR (ALEXIS Biochemicals), 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were left in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice and homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g (4 °C) for 10 min. Supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with a mixture of anti-FLAG beads (M2; Sigma) and CL-4B-Sepharose (Sigma) beads. After rotation with supernatant at 4 °C for 2 h, beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. For co-immunoprecipitation of HA-IκBϵ cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (IGEPAL CA-630) and 1 μm microcystin-LR as described before (27Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38912-38920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done according to Laemmli using Bio-Rad acrylamide/Bis 29:1 (catalog #161–0156). Immunoblots were developed using LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology). This scanner provides quantitative analysis with a linear response over a 3 log range of intensities. Northern Blots—Human poly(A)+ RNA 12 major tissues Northern blot was purchased from Origene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). PP6R1 primers 5′-CAAGCTGGAGCCGCTACAGAT and 3′-TGTCAGGTGACCCATGTAGCCTTT were prepared by IDTdna (Coralville, IA) and used to amplify a PCR product of 401 bp using FLAG-PP6R1 vector, PP6R2 primers 5′-CCAGAAGGCAGCGAGT and 3′-GCCATTTAAGGCAGCTCCT were used to amplify a PCR product of 391 bp using FLAG-PP6R2 vector, PP6R3 primers 5′-AAATGACGTCCAATTTTATTGACCAGTTTGGCT and 3′-TTAGCTGACCAGTTGGGTGGTTCA were used to amplify a PCR product of 400 bp using FLAG-PP6R3 vector, PP6 primers 5′-GGATCAAATTCGAACCATCGAACGGAA and 3′-TCAAAGGAAATATGGCGTTGTCGTTCTG were used to amplify a PCR product of 400 bp using HA-PP6 vector, and β-actin primers 5′-GCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA and 3′-GTGATGACCTGGCCGTCA were used to amplify a PCR product of 407 bp using human β-actin cDNA supplied with Northern blot. PCR products were used to make 32P radioactive DNA probes for Northern blot using Linear Amplification according to manufacturer's instructions in Strip-EZ PCR Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). NucAway Spin Columns (Ambion) were used to remove radioactive nucleotides from DNA probes. The Northern blot was probed following the Northern RNA Blot application guide Version 4.0 from Origene Technologies, Inc. Incubation of Northern blot with probes was done overnight with ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization buffer (Ambion). After exposure (1–3 days) using a PhosphorImager, 445SI (GE Healthcare), probes were removed from the Northern blot following the Strip-EZ PCR Kit instructions, and the blot was subsequently reprobed. siRNA Knockdowns—siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colorado). siRNAs used as controls were designed against luciferase 5′-TAAGGCTATGAAGAGATAC-3′. PP6 siRNAs are CGACAACGCCATATTTCCTTT as the sense sequence for PP6 siRNA 1 and TGGCCTGATCGTATTACACTT as the sense sequence for PP6 siRNA 2. Sequences for PP6R1 siRNAs are TCAATTGGCTCAACGAGGATT as the sense sequence for PP6R1 siRNA 1, GAACGCACCTTTTGACAAGTT for PP6R1 siRNA 2, and CGTCGAAGGATGAGAATCATT for PP6R1 siRNA 3. PP6R1 knockdown in Fig. 7C was performed using siRNA Smart Pool catalog number M-020420-00 (Dharmacon) that contains four different siRNAs. PP6R3 knockdown was performed using siRNA Smart Pool catalog number M-014646-00 (Dharmacon) that contains 4 different siRNAs. Knockdowns were done in HeLa cells plated into either 60-mm dishes (80,000 cells) or 12-well plates (40,000 cells). 24 h later cells were transfected with siRNA (120 nm) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation, fresh media was added to the cells, and 24 h later cells were lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer. Conservation of SAPS-related Phosphatase Subunits among Eukaryotes—Based on sequence similarity to the yeast SAP proteins that are subunits for Sit4 protein phosphatase, we identified three potential subunits for human PP6. We searched genome databases by BLAST using either yeast SAP155, SAP185, or SAP190 full-length protein sequences and identified three human open reading frames: KIAA1115, KIAA0685, and C11orf23, designated here as PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3, respectively. Alignment of the sequences of human PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3 (Fig. 1) showed different N- and C-terminal sequences and a central region of ∼400 residues with common sequence motifs that is predicted to be mostly composed of α helices (28Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar, 29Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). This is referred to as the “SAPS domain” because the sequence motifs are conserved from S. cerevisiae SAP subunits. We note that the Pfam data base (protein families data base of alignments and hidden Markov models (HMM) refers to this as the SAPS domain, different from an unrelated DNA binding domain called SAP (30Bateman A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 138-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found three SAPS-related sequences in mouse and three in Xenopus laevis that aligned with S. cerevisiae (Fig. 2). Although the SAPS domain is conserved, there is not a one to one correspondence between the four SAPs in S. cerevisiae and three vertebrate SAPS-related proteins. Searches for SAPS-related sequences in the genomes of other organisms yielded only a single SAPS gene in Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fig. 2). Construction of an unrooted phylogenetic tree for eukaryotic SAPS proteins shows a separate arm for vertebrate SAPS proteins, with three branches that show nearly equal distances between species (Fig. 2). This indicates separate lines of descent for each of the three vertebrate SAPS and shows that PP6R1 and PP6R3 diverged together on a separate arm from PP6R2. Another arm of the tree includes D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae. The single SAPS sequence in S. pombe (called EKC1) lies between the two SAP185/SAP190 and SAP4/SAP155 clusters in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly the S. cerevisiae SAP4/SAP155 are as closely related to C. elegans as to the Ekc1 protein in S. pombe. The S. cerevisiae SAPs have 23–25% sequence identity to EKC1 but only about 10% identity to the SAPS proteins in metazoans. This contrasts with the 61% sequence identity between Sit4 and human PP6. The third arm of the tree includes multiple SAPS proteins in plants. Based on this phylogenetic analysis we propose that multiple SAP proteins in S. cerevisiae converged to a single SAPS protein in S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, which diverged into multiple SAPS proteins in plants and vertebrates. The functions of all the metazoan SAPS proteins are unknown.FIGURE 2Phylogenetic tree of SAPS-related proteins.

Expression of mRNA for PP6, PP6R1, PP6R2, and PP6R3 in 12 human adult tissues was compared (Fig. 3). A predominant mRNA of 4 kilobases for PP6R1 was present at about equal levels in all the tissues, with the exception of testis, which had a much higher concentration. Several tissues showed a slightly smaller mRNA including testis, which showed two additional smaller species. The relatively equal distribution of the 4-kilobase mRNA among various tissues led us to call this (KIAA1115) PP6R1. For PP6R2 (KIAA0685) there were two mRNAs of about equal amounts expressed in all the tissues with the highest levels in testis followed by liver, heart, and brain. In contrast, the mRNA for PP6R3 (C11orf23) was highly expressed in heart with barely detectable levels in other tissues, including testis. Our observation of a same-sized mRNA for each gene among different tissues indicates a uniform processing of transcripts for PP6R1 and PP6R2. Equal loading of poly(A)-mRNA was demonstrated by hybridization for β-actin mRNA (Fig. 3, bottom panel). For the PP6 catalytic subunit the major mRNA of 1.6 kilobases, consistent with a protein of 36 kDa, was most highly expressed in heart with lower levels in kidney, liver, stomach, brain, and less in skeletal muscle and small intestine (Fig. 3). In agreement with a previous report (14Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also detected a PP6 mRNA of around 4 kilobases in most tissues, with the highest levels in heart and testis (not shown). Distribution of PP6 Protein in Tissues, Cells, and Subcellular Fractions—We produced and affinity-purified a specific PP6 antibody against a peptide corresponding to residues 292–305 at the extreme C terminus of the PP6 catalytic subunit. The specificity of this antibody was demonstrated by comparing equal amounts of recombinant His6PP6 and His6PP2A by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Using this antibody PP6 was detected in all mouse tissues examined at the predicted molecular size of 36 kDa (Fig. 4B), with the highest levels in lung, liver, and spleen and relatively low levels in skeletal muscle and heart. Thus, there were striking differences in the tissue distribution of PP6 between the Northern hybridization and Western blotting, the most obvious being heart, which had the highest levels of PP6 mRNA but relatively low levels of PP6 protein. This might indicate regulation of expression at the level of translation in different tissues and raises a caution about analysis and interpretation of PP6 gene expression by DNA microarray. Comparison of PP6 expression in cultured human cell lines showed the highest levels in breast cancer (MCF7), prostate cancer (PC-3), cervical cancer (HeLa) cells relative to fibroblast HS-68, and retinal epithelial ARPE19 cells (not shown). Subcellular fractionation of PC-3 cells showed that PP6, like PP2A, was predominantly in the cytosol compared with detergent-soluble (membrane) and detergent-insoluble (cytoskeletal) particulate fractions that contained most of cadherin and vimentin, respectively, as markers (not shown).

PTX3 comprises a pentraxin-like C-terminal domain involved in complement activation via C1q interaction and an N-terminal extension with unknown functions. PTX3 binds fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), inhibiting its pro-angiogenic and pro-restenotic activity. Here, retroviral transduced endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing the N-terminal fragment PTX3-(1–178) showed reduced mitogenic activity in response to FGF2. Accordingly, purified recombinant PTX3-(1–178) binds FGF2, prevents PTX3/FGF2 interaction, and inhibits FGF2 mitogenic activity in ECs. Also, the monoclonal antibody mAb-MNB4, which recognizes the PTX3-(87–99) epitope, prevents FGF2/PTX3 interaction and abolishes the FGF2 antagonist activity of PTX3. Consistently, the synthetic peptides PTX3-(82–110) and PTX3-(97–110) bind FGF2 and inhibit the interaction of FGF2 with PTX3 immobilized to a BIAcore sensor chip, FGF2-dependent EC proliferation, and angiogenesis in vivo. Thus, the data identify a FGF2-binding domain in the N-terminal extension of PTX3 spanning the PTX3-(97–110) region, pointing to a novel function for the N-terminal extension of PTX3 and underlining the complexity of the PTX3 molecule for modular humoral pattern recognition.

Pentraxins are a superfamily of proteins characterized by a pentameric structure (1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A. Mantovani A. Annu. Rev.

Pentraxins bind various ligands and are involved in the innate resistance to microbes and scavenging of cellular debris and extracellular matrix components (1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A.

Studies in ptx3−/− mice have shown that PTX3 plays complex non-redundant functions, ranging from the assembly of a hyaluronic acid-rich extracellular matrix and female fertility to innate immunity against diverse microorganisms (8Salustri A.

This is related, at least in part, to the capacity of PTX3 to bind the complement component C1q, the extracellular matrix protein TSG6, and selected microorganisms, activating complement activation and facilitating pathogen recognition by macrophages and dendritic cells (1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A. Mantovani A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 10Mantovani A. Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Vaccine. 2003; 21: S43-S47Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, PTX3 is a soluble pattern recognition receptor with unique non-redundant functions in various pathophysiological conditions (1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A. Mantovani A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 10Mantovani A. Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Vaccine. 2003; 21: S43-S47Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is a potent angiogenic growth factor (11Gerwins P. Skoldenberg E. Claesson-Welsh L. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 34: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). FGF2 modulates neovascularization during wound healing, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and tumor growth (12Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Several molecules sequester FGF2 in the extracellular environment and inhibit its angiogenic activity (reviewed in Ref. 12Presta M. Dell'Era P. Mitola S. Moroni E. Ronca R. Rusnati M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Many of these inhibitors are produced/released locally and/or systemically, thus underlying the complex tuning of the angiogenesis process. PTX3 binds FGF2 with high affinity and specificity. Accordingly, PTX3 inhibits FGF2-dependent EC proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Also, PTX3 inhibits FGF2-dependent smooth muscle cell activation and intimal thickening after arterial injury (14Camozzi M. Zacchigna S. Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Ramirez-Correa G. Bottazzi B. Mantovani A. Giacca M. Presta M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, PTX3 may contribute to the modulation of FGF2 activity in different pathological settings characterized by the co-expression of the two proteins, including inflammation, wound healing, atherosclerosis, and neoplasia (see Refs. 13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 14Camozzi M. Zacchigna S. Rusnati M.

Similar to short-pentraxins, PTX3 binds C1q via the C-terminal pentraxin domain (15Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C.

In contrast, the short-pentraxin C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component are inefficient FGF2 binders/antagonists despite their sequence homology with the 203-amino acid C-terminal portion of PTX3 (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This suggests that the 178-amino acid N-terminal portion of PTX3, absent in short-pentraxins, may mediate the binding to FGF2. At present, no biological functions have been ascribed to the PTX3 N terminus. On this basis, we have investigated the ability of the PTX3 N terminus to interact with FGF2. The results identify a short FGF2-binding domain in the N-terminal extension of PTX3 spanning the PTX3-(97–110) amino acid sequence. Synthetic peptides related to this sequence bind FGF2 and inhibit its angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Chemicals—Human recombinant FGF2 and PTX3 were produced and purified as described (15Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C.

Human embryonic kidney (EcoPack2–293) packaging cells (Clontech) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS. Balb/c murine aortic 22106 ECs (MAE cells) were obtained from R. Auerbach (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium added with 10% FCS. Retroviral Infection—The cDNAs encoding for human PTX3 and for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were obtained as described (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G.

The cDNAs encoding for the N-terminal fragment PTX3-(1–178) (Nterm-PTX3) and the C-terminal fragment PTX3-(179–381) fused to the leader sequence for secretion PTX3-(1–17) (sCterm-PTX3) were generated from pLX-PTX3 (13Rusnati M.

All cDNAs were cloned in the pBABE retroviral vector, thus generating pBABE-PTX3, pBABE-Nterm-PTX3, pBABE-sCterm-PTX3, and pBABE-EGFP that were used to transfect the EcoPack2–293 packaging cells in the presence of Lipofectamine (13Rusnati M.

Transduced cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml; Sigma) for 2 weeks. Clones with a viral titer higher than 106 cfu/ml were used for further experimentation. Confluent cultures of MAE cells were then incubated for 24 h with the conditioned medium from pBABE-PTX3, pBABE-Nterm-PTX3, pBABE-sCterm-PTX3, or pBABE-EGFP packaging cells in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml; Sigma). Infected cells were selected for 7 days with puromycin. Observation of EGFP-infected cells by epifluorescence microscopy (Axiovert S100 microscope, ×10/0.25; Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) showed that retroviral infection efficiency was higher than 80%. To assess the levels of transgene protein expression and release, infected cells were grown under serum-free conditions for 2 days. Then, conditioned medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and concentrated 10-fold using Centricon YM-10 filters (Millipore), and 100-μl aliquots were probed by Western blot analysis. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation assay on ECs was performed as described (18Presta M. Maier J.A. Rusnati M. Ragnotti G. J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 141: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cultures of GM7373 or MAE cells were incubated in medium containing 0.4% FCS plus FGF2 (0.55 nm) in the absence or the presence of different antagonists. After 24 or 48 h, respectively, cells were trypsinized and counted in a Burker chamber. Expression and Purification of PTX3 Fragments—Nterm-PTX3 and Cterm-PTX3 cDNAs were amplified from pLX-PTX3 by PCR with primers containing additional nucleotides (PTX3-N: (+) CACCGAGAACTCGGATGATTATGA; (–) TTAACCTGCCGGCAGCCAGCTCC; PTX3-C: (+) CACCTGTGAAACAGCTATTTTA; (–) TTATGAAACATACTGAGCTCC). These cDNAs were cloned into the pENTR TOPO vector (pENTR Directional TOPO cloning kit; Invitrogen) and sequenced. By using the Gateway© technology (Invitrogen), Nterm-PTX3 and Cterm-PTX3 cDNAs from pENTR TOPO vector were then cloned into the pDEST17 vector, allowing the insertion of a His6 tag at the C terminus of the recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen) were then transformed with the two recombinant plasmids and grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Recombinant protein expression was induced by overnight incubation at 30 °C in the presence of 0.2% l-arabinose. After induction, cells were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and lysed by sonication. Clarified supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a 3.0-ml HiTrap Immobilized Metal Affinity Column (Amersham Biosciences) with nickel for purification according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were probed for the presence of the recombinant protein by immunoblotting, and positive fractions were collected and desalted by gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G25 column PD10; Amersham Biosciences) in PBS. Purity of recombinant proteins was higher than 90%, as assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gel (see Fig. 2A, inset). Alternatively, recombinant Nterm-PTX3 and Cterm-PTX3 fragments were purified from stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cterm-PTX3 was obtained as previously described (15Bottazzi B.

A 570-bp fragment coding for Nterm-PTX3 was subcloned in pSG5 and transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Selection was carried out with G148, and a clone secreting the predicted 17.7-kDa fragment was chosen. Culture supernatant was collected from these cells, concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM membrane, cut off 10.0 kDa; Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and applied on an HR 5/5 Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Nterm-PTX3 was then eluted exactly as described for the purification of intact PTX3 (15Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C.

The fraction containing Nterm-PTX3 was subjected to gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 in PBS. Purity of recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (not shown). Solid Phase Binding Assay—FGF2 (270 nm) was immobilized onto enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplates as described (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A.

Next, 100 μl-aliquots of PBS containing full-length PTX3, recombinant Nterm-PTX3, or Cterm-PTX3 (all at 44 nm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C onto the FGF2-coated wells. Then, wells were sequentially incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PTX3 antibody (1:2000 dilution) that recognizes both PTX3 fragments with similar efficiency in Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown), an anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody (1:2000), and 100 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 100 μl/well of the chromogen substrate 2,29-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) were added. Absorbance values were read at 405 nm. In some experiments, 100-μl aliquots of PBS containing biotin-labeled PTX3 (bPTX3) (22 nm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C onto FGF2-coated wells with or without competitors. Wells were washed, and the amount of bound bPTX3 was evaluated as described (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M.

Alternatively, synthetic PTX3 peptides were immobilized on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplate wells (200 μg/well) as described above. FGF2 (80 nm) was added, and FGF2 bound to immobilized peptides was assessed by 1 h of incubation at 37 °C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-FGF2 antibody (1:7000) followed by immunocomplex detection as described above. PTX3 Epitope Mapping—To identify the amino acid sequence of the epitopes binding to monoclonal anti-PTX3 antibodies, 128 peptides were arrayed onto cellulose membranes by SPOT synthesis technology (19Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were 13 amino acids long with a 3-amino acid frameshift. Membranes were blocked with 2% milk in Tween-TBS (MBS) for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with monoclonal antibodies mAb MNB4 or mAb 16B5 (both at 1:1000 dilution in MBS) and then incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:30,000; Sigma) in MBS. Color reaction was developed as described (19Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar), and intensity of the signal was evaluated by densitometric analysis of the membrane. BIAcore Binding Assay—A BIAcore X apparatus (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) was used. PTX3 (2.2 μm) was allowed to react with a flow cell of a CM4 sensor chip that was previously activated with 50 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. These experimental conditions allowed the immobilization of 5000 resonance units, corresponding to ∼0.1 pmol of PTX3. Similar results were obtained for immobilization of gelatin, here used as a negative control and for blank subtraction. Increasing concentrations of FGF2 with or without synthetic PTX3 peptides were then injected in dilution buffer (PBS plus 0.005% surfactant P20, 5.0 μg/ml CaCl2 and MgCl2) over the PTX3 surface for 4 min (to allow the association of FGF2 with immobilized PTX3). The response (in resonance units) was recorded at the end of injection, and binding data were plotted with an exponential fitting program for a one-site competition model (Prism; GraphPad Software Inc.). Chicken Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay—Alginate beads (5 μl) containing vehicle or 16 pmol FGF2 with or without synthetic PTX3 peptides were prepared as described (20Knoll A. Schmidt S. Chapman M. Wiley D. Bulgrin J. Blank J. Kirchner L. Microvasc. Res. 1999; 58: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and placed on top of the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane of fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs at day 11 of incubation (10 eggs/experimental group). After 72 h, blood vessels converging toward the implant were counted by two observers in a double-blind fashion under a stereomicroscope (STEMI-SR, ×2/0.12; Zeiss). The N-terminal Extension of PTX3 Binds FGF2—PTX3 protein is characterized by a C-terminal 203-amino acid pentraxin domain (Cterm-PTX3) and by an N-terminal 178-amino acid extension (Nterm-PTX3) (5Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J. Peri G. Bottazzi B. Bairoch A. Saccone S. Marzella R. Predazzi V. Rocchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22190-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the attempt to identify the antiangiogenic, FGF2-binding domain(s) of PTX3, the two PTX3 portions were assessed for their capacity to interact with FGF2. Overexpression of full-length PTX3 results in the inhibition of FGF2-dependent proliferation in ECs due to the binding of released PTX3 to the exogenous growth factor and its sequestration in the extracellular milieu (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On this basis, MAE cells were infected with retroviruses harboring human full-length PTX3, the PTX3 N-terminal extension Nterm-PTX3, or the PTX3 C terminus fused to the PTX3 leader sequence for secretion (sCterm-PTX3). Control cells were infected with an EGFP-harboring retrovirus. Infected cells overexpressed and released the corresponding proteins in similar amounts (Fig. 1A) and showed a similar rate of growth under basal conditions (data not shown). However, Nterm-PTX3 overexpression caused a significant decrease in the capacity of infected cells to proliferate in response to exogenous FGF2, similar to full-length PTX3 overexpression (Fig. 1B). No inhibition was exerted by sCterm-PTX3 overexpression when compared with control EGFP-infected cells. In a second set of experiments, conditioned media of infected MAE cells were evaluated for the capacity to affect FGF2-dependent proliferation of GM7373 ECs (Fig. 1C). As anticipated, incubation of GM7373 cells with FGF2 in the presence of the conditioned medium of Nterm-PTX3-infected or PTX3-infected MAE cells caused a significant inhibition of the mitogenic activity of the growth factor, whereas the conditioned media of sCterm-PTX3-infected and EGFP-infected MAE cells were ineffective (Fig. 1C). None of the conditioned media caused a significant inhibition of GM7373 cell proliferation triggered by 10% FCS, thus confirming the specificity of the effect (data not shown). Accordingly, similar to full-length PTX3, purified human recombinant Nterm-PTX3 inhibits GM7373 cell proliferation triggered by FGF2, with no effect on 10% FCS-induced proliferation (Fig. 1D). No effect on FGF2 activity was exerted by the purified C-terminal PTX3 fragment. To confirm that the FGF2 antagonist activity of Nterm-PTX3 was due to its capacity to interact directly with the growth factor, Nterm-PTX3 and Cterm-PTX3 were produced as E. coli recombinant His6-tagged proteins (Fig. 2A, inset). Full-length PTX3 and the recombinant Nterm-PTX3 fragment bind to immobilized FGF2. No interaction was observed with recombinant Cterm-PTX3 (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, a 10-fold molar excess of recombinant Nterm-PTX3 or of full-length PTX3, but not of Cterm-PTX3, prevented the binding of biotinylated PTX3 (bPTX3) to immobilized FGF2 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results implicate the N-terminal region of PTX3 for FGF2 interaction. Inhibition of FGF2/PTX3 Interaction by a Monoclonal Anti-Nterm-PTX3 Antibody—The screening of a set of rat monoclonal antibodies raised against human full-length PTX3 identified antibodies mAb-MNB4 (15Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C. Gianazza E. Tagliabue A. Salmona M. Tedesco F. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32817-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and mAb-16B5 (17Peri G. Introna M. Corradi D. Iacuitti G. Signorini S. Avanzini F. Pizzetti F. Maggioni A.P. Moccetti T. Metra M. Cas L.D. Ghezzi P. Sipe J.D. Re G. Olivetti G. Mantovani A. Latini R. Circulation. 2000; 102: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) that selectively bind Nterm-PTX3 and Cterm-PTX3, respectively (Fig. 3A). To map the PTX3 epitopes recognized by the two antibodies, we took advantage of the SPOT synthesis technique (19Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar) by which 128 overlapping 13-mer peptides spanning the entire human PTX3 sequence were arrayed on a cellulose membrane. When the membrane was probed with the two monoclonal antibodies, immunocomplex detection revealed that mAb-MNB4 recognizes the epitope PTX3-(87–99) present in the N-terminal extension of PTX3, whereas mAb-16B5 recognizes the epitope PTX3-(306–312) located in the C-terminal region of PTX3 (Fig. 3B). When tested for the capacity to affect FGF2/PTX3 interaction, mAb-MNB4, but not mAb-16B5, prevented the capacity of bPTX3 to bind immobilized FGF2, similar to free unlabeled PTX3 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, mAb-MNB4 abolishes the capacity of full-length PTX3 to inhibit the mitogenic activity exerted by FGF2 in GM7373 cells, whereas mAb-16B5 is ineffective (Fig. 4B). Thus, mAb-MNB4 recognizing the N-terminal PTX3-(87–99) epitope neutralizes FGF2/PTX3 interaction. Synthetic Nterm-PTX3-related Peptides as FGF2 Antagonists—To further define the FGF2 binding region in the N-terminal extension of PTX3, we evaluated the FGF2 antagonist activity of the synthetic peptide PTX3-(82–110) that contains the PTX3-(87–99) epitope recognized by the neutralizing mAb-MNB4 (see above) together with three distinct synthetic peptides, PTX3-(31–60), PTX3-(57–85), and PTX3-(107–132), partially spanning the Nterm-PTX3 amino acid sequence (Fig. 5A and Table 1). The four synthetic PTX3 fragments were first assessed for their capacity to interact with FGF2. As shown in Fig. 5B, free FGF2 binds immobilized PTX3-(82–110) but not immobilized PTX3-(31–60) or PTX3-(57–85), showing only a limited interaction with immobilized PTX3-(107–132). Next, surface plasmon resonance was exploited to assess the ability of the four peptides to affect FGF2/PTX3 interaction. FGF2 (0.8 μm) specifically binds to PTX3 immobilized to a BIAcore sensor chip but not to immobilized gelatin (Fig. 5C, upper panel). Also, injection of increasing concentrations of FGF2 (Fig. 5C, lower panel) over the PTX3 surface showed that FGF2/PTX3 interaction occurs with a kinetic dissociation constant (koff) of 6 × 10−5 s−1 and a kinetic association constant (kon) of 0.2 × 103 s−1 m−1, thus resulting in a Kd value equal to 0.3 × 10−6 m. The synthetic PTX3 peptides were assessed for their capacity to sequester FGF2 in the mobile phase, thus preventing its interaction with the PTX3 surface. As shown in Fig. 5D, PTX3-(82–110) inhibits the binding of FGF2 to the PTX3 surface in a dose-dependent manner with a potency 5 times lower than that shown by free full-length PTX3 (ID50 equal to 3.3 and 0.7 μm, respectively). No inhibition was exerted by PTX3-(31–60), PTX3-(57–85), and PTX3-(107–132) peptides (Fig. 5D and data not shown). Also, a scrambled synthetic peptide with amino acid composition equal to PTX3-(82–110) (sPTX3-(82–110), Table 1) showed a limited inhibitory effect (ID50 > 3000 μm) (Fig. 5D), indicating that the primary amino acid sequence in PTX3-(82–110) is of importance for FGF2 interaction. The capacity of PTX3-(82–110) to bind FGF2 prompted us to assess its ability to act as a FGF2 antagonist. When tested on GM7373 cells, both full-length PTX3 and PTX3-(82–110) inhibit the mitogenic activity of FGF2, whereas scrambled PTX3-(82–110), PTX3-(31–60), PTX3-(57–85), and PTX3-(107–132) peptides were ineffective (Fig. 5E). Dose-response curves confirmed that the FGF2 antagonist activity of PTX3-(82–110) is dose dependent (ID50, 30 μm and 30 nm for PTX3-(82–110) and PTX3, respectively) (data not shown). Identification of a Minimal Linear FGF2 Binding Sequence in the N-terminal Extension of PTX3—In an attempt to identify a minimal linear FGF2 binding sequence in the PTX3-(82–110) region, three overlapping synthetic peptides, PTX3-(82–96), PTX3-(82–101), and PTX3-(97–110) (Fig. 6A and Table 1), were evaluated for their capacity to interact with FGF2. As shown in Fig. 6B, free FGF2 binds to immobilized PTX3-(97–110), as well as to parental PTX3-(82–110) and full-length PTX3, without interacting with PTX3-(82–96) or PTX3-(82–101). Accordingly, PTX3-(97–110) binds FGF2 in the mobile phase, preventing its interaction with PTX3 immobilized to a BIAcore sensor chip (Fig. 6C). The inhibitory activity of PTX3-(97–110) was similar to that shown by the parental peptide PTX3-(82–110), whereas PTX3-(82–96) and PTX3-(82–101) were ineffective (Fig. 6C). In keeping with these observations, PTX3-(97–110), but not PTX3-(82–96) or PTX3-(82–101), inhibits the mitogenic activity exerted by FGF2 in GM7373 cells (Fig. 6D). In contrast with PTX3-(97–110), the shorter overlapping peptides PTX3-(97–104) and PTX3-(100–110), spanning the 97–110 amino acid sequence, did not prevent the binding of free FGF2 to PTX3 immobilized to a BIAcore sensor chip and were unable to inhibit GM7373 cell proliferation triggered by FGF2 (data not shown). Thus, PTX3-(97–110) represents a minimal linear FGF2 binding amino acid sequence in the N-terminal extension of PTX3. Synthetic Nterm-PTX3-related Peptides Inhibit the Angiogenic Activity of FGF2—The capacity of Nterm-PTX3-related peptides to affect FGF2-induced neovascularization in vivo was assessed in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay (Fig. 7). Alginate beads adsorbed with FGF2 (16 pmol/embryo) exert a potent angiogenic response when compared with beads adsorbed with vehicle (macroscopic vessels converging toward the implant being equal to 44 ± 7 and 11 ± 5 vessels/embryo, respectively). In keeping with the in vitro observations, the FGF2-dependent angiogenic response was significantly reduced (28 ± 5 vessels/embryo, p < 0.05 by analysis of variance) by the addition of 3.0 nmol PTX3-(82–110) peptide in the FGF2 implants (Fig. 7). Accordingly, 80 nmol PTX3-(97–110) caused a 50% inhibition in the angiogenic response triggered by FGF2; no effect was exerted by PTX3-(82–96) (data not shown). Pentraxins are evolutionary conserved soluble pattern recognition receptors (1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A. Mantovani A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The pentraxin superfamily can be divided in two structural subfamilies: the classic short-pentraxins, which include C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component, and the novel long-pentraxins, their prototypic member being represented by PTX3 (1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A. Mantovani A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 4Goodman A.R. Cardozo T. Abagyan R. Altmeyer A. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PTX3 comprises a pentraxin-like C-terminal 203-amino acid domain and an N-terminal 178-amino acid extension with no significant homology with any other protein. The two domains are encoded by distinct exons in the ptx3 gene (5Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J. Peri G. Bottazzi B. Bairoch A. Saccone S. Marzella R. Predazzi V. Rocchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22190-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous observations had shown that PTX3 binds FGF2 without showing any significant interaction with other growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, including other members of the FGF family (for further discussion see Ref. 13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PTX3 inhibits the angiogenic activity exerted by FGF2 on ECs (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and suppresses FGF2-dependent smooth muscle cell activation (14Camozzi M. Zacchigna S. Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Ramirez-Correa G. Bottazzi B. Mantovani A. Giacca M. Presta M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), thus representing an endogenous FGF2 inhibitor and a candidate for the design of novel FGF2 antagonists. Here we have shown that FGF2 interaction is mediated by the N-terminal extension on PTX3. Also, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and synthetic PTX3-related peptides identify the amino acid linear sequence PTX3-(97–110) as responsible for this interaction. These conclusions are based on the following experimental evidence: (i) the short-pentraxins C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component are inefficient FGF2 binders (13Rusnati M. Camozzi M. Moroni E. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Indraccolo S. Amadori A. Mantovani A. Presta M. Blood. 2004; 104: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) despite their sequence homology with the PTX3 C terminus (4Goodman A.R. Cardozo T. Abagyan R. Altmeyer A. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); (ii) retroviral transduction of the Nterm-PTX3 fragment, but not of sCterm-PTX3, inhibits the mitogenic activity of FGF2 in ECs; (iii) recombinant Nterm-PTX3, but not Cterm-PTX3, binds to immobilized FGF2, prevents PTX3/FGF2 interaction, and inhibits FGF2 activity in ECs; (iv) the monoclonal antibody mAb-MNB4, mapping the linear epitope PTX3-(87–99), prevents FGF2/PTX3 interaction and abolishes the FGF2 antagonist activity of PTX3 in ECs; (v) synthetic peptides PTX3-(82–110) and PTX3-(97–110), but not other peptides based on different regions of the PTX3 N terminus, prevent FGF2/PTX3 interaction by binding FGF2, thus inhibiting FGF2-dependent EC proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. PTX3 binds the complement component C1q via its C-terminal domain (15Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C. Gianazza E. Tagliabue A. Salmona M. Tedesco F. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32817-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Accordingly, C1q does not compete for FGF2 binding to PTX3, 3M. Rusnati and A. Bugatti, unpublished observations. thus confirming that distinct domains are involved in the interaction with the two ligands. PTX3 also binds apoptotic cells, extracellular matrix protein(s), and selected microorganisms, but their binding domain(s) on the PTX3 molecule are still uncharacterized (reviewed in Ref. 1Garlanda C. Bottazzi B. Bastone A. Mantovani A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The possibility that PTX3 fragments with restricted binding specificity and different impact on innate immunity may be generated in vivo will require further experimentation. Modeling of the human PTX3 N terminus is limited by the fact that no structural data are available for the N-terminal portion of long-pentraxins. We performed consensus secondary structure prediction of this region on the PredictProtein server (www.cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein) using different algorithms. They predict four α-helix regions in the PTX3 N terminus spanning amino acid residues 55–75 (α1), 78–97 (α2), 109–135 (α3), and 144–170 (α4). Moreover α2, α3, and α4 have the propensity to be in a coiled-coil structure (as predicted by Coils2; www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html). This structure comprises two or more α-helices that wind around each other to form “supercoils.” The putative minimal linear FGF2 binding region 97–110 is predicted in a loop region that comprises the end of the α2-helix (Glu97), a β-turn on residues Ala104-Pro105-Gly106-Ala107, and the first two residues of the α3-helix (Ala109-Glu110). Interestingly, the same β-turn is predicted for PTX3 protein of different species (data not shown). It seems possible to hypothesize that this exposed region may interact with the FGF2 molecule. The other members of the long-pentraxin subfamily (including apexin, neuronal pentraxins NP1 and NP2, and neuronal pentraxin receptor NPR (4Goodman A.R. Cardozo T. Abagyan R. Altmeyer A. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) show a low level of amino acid sequence similarity in their N-terminal domain (∼10% for PTX3 versus NP1). Accordingly, both genetic and biological features of the different long-pentraxins point to the hypothesis that they exert distinct, unique biological functions (4Goodman A.R. Cardozo T. Abagyan R. Altmeyer A. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the FGF2 binding region PTX3-(97–110), as well as the broader PTX3-(82–110) domain, does not show any significant homology with the corresponding regions in the other members of the long-pentraxin subfamily, thus suggesting that the FGF2 binding capacity is a unique function of PTX3. Further experiments are required to address this hypothesis. The role exerted by FGF2 in various pathophysiological conditions is not limited to its angiogenic activity. Indeed, FGF2 stimulates the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts during wound healing and of smooth muscle cells during atherosclerosis (21Blotnick S. Peoples G.E. Freeman M.R. Eberlein T.J.

Also, it favors neuronal cell survival and glia cell proliferation in the injured central nervous system (24Logan A. Berry M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 337-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In all these conditions, the concomitant production of PTX3 (25Ravizza T. Moneta D. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Garlanda C. Hirsch E. Richards G.J. Mantovani A. Vezzani A. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Rolph M.S. Zimmer S. Bottazzi B. Garlanda C. Mantovani A. Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: e10-e14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may modulate the activity exerted by FGF2. Accordingly, PTX3 inhibits FGF2-dependent smooth muscle cell activation in vitro and intimal thickening after arterial injury in vivo (14Camozzi M. Zacchigna S. Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Ramirez-Correa G. Bottazzi B. Mantovani A. Giacca M. Presta M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that PTX3 N terminus is involved in FGF2 interaction. PTX3 is a multifunctional soluble pattern recognition receptor at the crossroads between innate immunity, inflammation, matrix deposition, and female fertility. The identification of the functional motifs involved in ligand interaction will help to elucidate the mechanism(s) of action and complex functions of PTX3. We thank Dr. Daria Leali for contributions to the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1970219055,"Estrogen receptors (ERs) play critical roles in both normal mammary gland development and in the formation and progression of breast tumors, constituting a major therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. We have previously described that ER transcriptional activity is potentiated by BAF57, a core subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Here we provide evidence demonstrating an important role for BAF57 as regulator of ER functions in breast cancer cells. Different experimental manipulations leading to the abrogation of BAF57 expression and/or function severely reduced the expression of various endogenous ER target genes and blocked estrogen-stimulated proliferation in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Moreover, using a structure-function analysis, we have defined the protein domains required for the functional interaction between ERalpha and BAF57, including a key region within the hinge of ERalpha that is essential for BAF57 recruitment and its function on ER-mediated transcription. Interestingly, we found that BAF57 is an ER subtype-selective modulator that specifically regulates ERalpha-mediated transcription. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting BAF57 could represent a new way to effectively inhibit the action of ERalpha."
https://openalex.org/W2119190151,"Yeast Mrs3p and Mrs4p are evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial carrier proteins that transport iron into mitochondria under some conditions. Yeast frataxin (Yfh1p), the homolog of the human protein implicated in Friedreich ataxia, is involved in iron homeostasis. However, its precise functions are controversial. Anaerobically grown triple mutant cells (Δmrs3/4/Δyfh1) displayed a severe growth defect corrected by in vivo iron supplementation. Because anaerobically grown cells do not synthesize heme, and they do not experience oxidative stress, this growth defect was most likely due to Fe-S cluster deficiency. Fe-S cluster formation was assessed in anaerobically grown cells shifted to air for a brief period. In isolated mitochondria, Fe-S clusters were detected on newly imported yeast ferredoxin precursor and on endogenous aconitase by means of [35S]cysteine labeling and native gel separation. New cluster formation was dependent on iron addition to mitochondria, and the iron concentration dependence was shifted dramatically upward in the Δmrs3/4 mutant, indicating a role of Mrs3/4p in iron transport. The frataxin mutant strain lacked protein import capacity because of low mitochondrial membrane potential, although this was partially restored by growth in the presence of high iron. Under these conditions, a kinetic defect in new Fe-S cluster formation was still noted. Import of frataxin into frataxin-minus isolated mitochondria promptly corrected the Fe-S cluster assembly defect without further iron addition. These findings show that Mrs3/4p transports iron into mitochondria, whereas frataxin makes iron already within mitochondria available for Fe-S cluster synthesis.

The overall structure of frataxin has a unique fold characterized by a platform of six or seven β-sheets and two α-helices situated above the plane. Negatively charged surfaces on the protein have been found to interact with iron in vitro, although the in vivo relevance of this binding remains to be demonstrated (7He Y. Alam S.L. Proteasa V.

Disruption of zebrafish Mrs3/4p ortholog (Mfrn) resulted in hypochromic anemia and erythroid maturation arrest, consistent with a critical role in iron delivery into mitochondria for heme synthesis (25Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19794-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A role of Mrs3/4p in iron delivery for heme synthesis in mitochondria has been shown in yeast, although additional routes of mitochondrial iron entry must exist as evidenced by the mildness of loss of function growth phenotypes. An unusual phenotype was created by combining deletions of Mrs3/4 transporters and deletion of frataxin. In this triple mutant, iron accumulation in mitochondria associated with frataxin deficiency was prevented, but the defect in heme synthesis was exacerbated (26Zhang Y. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A. Lesuisse E. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19794-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here we present assays for parsing the complex phenotypes related to the function of the transporters and frataxin in Fe-S cluster synthesis. The assays show that Mrs3/4p transport iron into mitochondria for Fe-S cluster synthesis, whereas frataxin facilitates use of mitochondrial iron for Fe-S synthesis.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Genotypes—A congenic set of four strains (wild type, Δmrs3/4, Δyfh1, and ΔΔΔ) was constructed in the YPH499 background as described (26Zhang Y. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A. Lesuisse E. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19794-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The triple mutant, including Δmrs3::URA3, Δmrs4::KanMX(4), and Δyfh1::TRP1, was called ΔΔΔ. The Δyfh1 and ΔΔΔ strains were covered by a CEN plasmid containing a genomic copy of YFH1 and CYH2. This plasmid was removed by counterselection with cycloheximide under anaerobic conditions prior to initiating experiments.Media Composition—Rich YPAD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% d-glucose, and 0.01% adenine. YPAR contained 2% raffinose instead of glucose. Defined medium contained 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 0.8 g/liter amino acid supplements, and 1.5% Difco agar as a solidifying agent for agar plates. Iron-buffered plates consisted of modified defined medium to which pH buffer (50 mm MES, 2The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DiSC3(5), 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide; WT, wild type. pH 6.1) and iron chelator (1 mm ferrozine) were added. Different amounts of ferrous iron (0, 20, 50, and 350 μm) were added back to establish windows of available free iron as described (27Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). For anaerobic growth 0.2% Tween 80 and 40 μg/ml ergosterol were added to the medium. For anaerobic growth, agar plates were placed in an anaerobic chamber with a BBL GasPak (BD Biosciences). For anaerobic growth of liquid cultures, argon gas (Airgas) was bubbled through the medium in sealed glass flasks. Cells were grown at 30 °C without (anaerobic) or with circular agitation (aerobic).Aconitase Activity Measurement—Anaerobically grown cells were lysed by vortexing a suspension of glass beads and cells in septum-covered vials under argon. The buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% glucose, 1.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, 1 mm PMSF) was made anaerobic previously by bubbling argon, and the lysates were used immediately for measurement of aconitase activity. The assay follows conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate over time measured by absorbance change at 240 nm. Total protein amounts were measured by bicinchoninic acid (Pierce).Cell Permeabilization and Mitochondria Isolation—Cells were grown anaerobically in sealed flasks containing glucose defined medium supplemented with 0.2% Tween 80 and 40 μg/ml ergosterol bubbled with argon. After 48–72 h, the cultures (with A600 ∼1–2) were washed in water and resuspended in an equal volume of defined media with raffinose as the carbon source. Cultures were grown in air for an additional 4 h at 30 °C with shaking and then harvested. Harvested cells were permeabilized and frozen with liquid nitrogen vapors as described (26Zhang Y. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A. Lesuisse E. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19794-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from permeabilized cells by douncing and differential centrifugation (28Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription and Translation of Mitochondrial Precursor Proteins—pSP64T-Yah1, containing the full-length Yah1p, and pSP64T-Yfh1, containing the full-length Yfh1p open reading frame, were constructed by PCR amplification and subcloning with restriction enzyme sites for NdeI and XhoI. Site-directed mutations were introduced into pSP64T-Yah1 to change Fe-S cluster liganding cysteines to alanines (C104A and C107A). The mutated plasmid was called pSP64T-CysM. Circular pSP64T plasmids (30 μg for each) were then linearized with BamHI, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in nuclease-free water to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. In vitro transcription (Ribomax SP6, Promega) was then used to produce mRNA. Each reaction contained a final concentration 0.1 μg/μl of linearized DNA and was incubated at 37 °C for 3.5 h. Transcribed RNA was purified (RNA clean-up kit, Qiagen) and quantitated on a formaldehyde gel. The proteins were translated from the in vitro transcribed mRNA using an in vitro translation system (rabbit reticulocyte system, Promega) in the presence of [35S]cysteine following the manufacturer's directions. 35S-Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm their molecular weight and purity.Bacterial Expression and Purification of Full-length Yah1p—The open reading frame for Yah1p was amplified and inserted into pET21b between NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites, and the plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells. Protein expression was induced in 20 ml of culture volume at 37 °C by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to LB ampicillin medium and, 15 min later, addition of 100 μg/ml rifampicin. After 2 h and 45 min, cells were harvested, washed, and sonicated in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF. Inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Following several cycles of sonication and centrifugation, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 500 μl of 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF. The solubilized inclusion bodies were centrifuged at 24 °C at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant analyzed by SDS gel showed a single major protein band and was ∼95% pure.Import of Mitochondrial Precursor Proteins into Permeabilized Cells or Isolated Mitochondria—Permeabilized cells or isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 2.5× compensating buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.6 m sorbitol, 40 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 5 mm methionine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm NADH). HS-BSA buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.6 m sorbitol) was added to adjust the total volume to 50 or 100 μl. 5 μl of radioactive protein probe or 1 μl of (2 μg/μl) ureadenatured full-length Yah1p was added for each import reaction. [35S]Cysteine, unlabeled cysteine, valinomycin (5 μm from a 0.5 mm stock made in ethanol), and iron were added in some experiments as indicated in the figure legends. The import assay was incubated at the indicated temperature for 10 or 15 min. In some experiments, trypsin was used to digest unimported precursors. In those cases, 50 μl of 0.4 mg/ml trypsin in HS-BSA buffer was added and incubated on ice for 35 min. After trypsin digestion, 100 μl of 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 2 μl of 200 mm PMSF were added and incubated on ice for 5 min to neutralize trypsin. Ice-cold HS-BSA buffer for mitochondria or hyperosmotic HS-BSA buffer for permeabilized cells (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) was added to stop import. Permeabilized cells or mitochondria were immediately spun down at 15,000 × g for 5–10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm PMSF), sonicated in the cold for 30 s, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were then subjected to SDS-PAGE or native polyacrylamide gel separations. Gels containing radiolabeled polypeptides were fixed with methanol and acetic acid followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Native gels for evaluating Fe-S clusters in holo-Yah1p and aconitase were fixed for 1 h with 20% methanol and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Methanol was washed away with buffer consisting of 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Finally, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.Assessment of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The membrane potential of isolated yeast mitochondria was assessed by measuring the fluorescence quenching of the potentially sensitive dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)). The measurements were performed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation set at 622 nm and emission at 670 nm. The buffer was 0.6 m sorbitol, 1% BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm KPi, pH 7.4. After base-line measurement and addition of 2 μm DiSC3(5), 50 μg/ml mitochondria was added for 4 min followed by 1 μm valinomycin. The changes of fluorescence were recorded, and the difference before and after the addition of valinomycin was determined (29Geissler A. Krimmer T. Bomer U. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3977-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).RESULTSIron-dependent Growth under Anaerobic Conditions—Iron-dependent growth of the wild type parent was observed under anaerobic conditions, with growth and colony size increasing with iron supplementation (Fig. 1). The mutant lacking Mrs3/4p was more severely retarded by iron chelation than the wild type, but colony size recovered and resembled the wild-type growth rate with addition of chelator plus 20 μm iron. The frataxin deletion strain (Δyfh1) exhibited no discernable iron phenotype compared with wild type under anaerobic growth conditions. By contrast, the triple mutant (Δmrs3/4/Δyfh1 or ΔΔΔ) exhibited dramatic iron-dependent growth. For this strain, there was almost no growth under low iron conditions, and colony size only began to approach the wild type on addition of 350 μm iron. The iron concentration of 350 μm exceeds the capacity of the 1 mm chelator (ferrozine, which functions at 3:1 stoichiometry), and so iron is available over and above the contents of standard defined media.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heme is not made under anaerobic conditions, because enzymatic steps in the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway utilize oxygen as an obligatory cofactor. Under anaerobic growth conditions, oxidative stress should be minimal, although some cellular oxidants may still be formed as intermediary metabolites or toxic by-products. Oxidative stress from iron accumulation and Fenton chemistry should not occur under such conditions. By contrast, Fe-S cluster synthesis proceeds even under strictly anaerobic conditions. Thus, the slow anaerobic growth such as was observed for the triple mutant might indicate a problem with Fe-S cluster formation.Aconitase Activity Deficiency under Anaerobic Conditions—Aconitase, an abundant 4Fe-4S cluster protein, requiring an intact cluster for its activity, was studied as an indicator of the status of Fe-S cluster proteins in anaerobically grown cells. Wild type and mutants were grown under strict anaerobiosis, ruptured with glass beads under argon, and rapidly assayed for activity or processed in sample buffer for denaturing gel analysis. The objective of these procedures was to minimize oxidative damage to the protein, such as might occur during air exposure or during processing. Under these conditions, wild type and Δmrs3/4 cells showed similar aconitase enzyme activities. The Δyfh1 mutant exhibited significantly less activity (less than one-third of wild type) and the triple mutant had undetectable activity (Fig. 2B). In general there was good correlation of aconitase activities and protein levels, with Δyfh1 showing less protein and ΔΔΔ showing even less protein (Fig. 2A). In the latter case, this must represent inactive protein because aconitase activity was entirely undetectable in these cells (Fig. 2, A and B). For cultures grown anaerobically and then shifted to aerobic growth conditions for 4 h, aconitase activity was virtually unchanged compared with anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2C). With longer air exposure (18 h), the pattern of aconitase activities was altered, perhaps because of regulatory adaptations and toxic effects related to oxidative stress (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Anaerobic and aerobic aconitase activity. Strains wild type (wt), Δmrs3/4, Δyfh1, ΔΔΔ were grown anaerobically in YPAD/TE for 48 h. Cells were pelleted by a brief centrifugation and broken with glass beads under argon in a septum-sealed vial. The lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm sodium citrate, and 1.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside. An amount equivalent to 250 μg of total protein was tested for aconitase protein or Pgk1 protein by immunoblotting (A). Aconitase activity in the lysate was measured spectrophotometrically (B). Similar experiments were performed with cultures that were shifted to aerobic conditions in YP raffinose for 4(C) or 18 h (D). In these cultures TE was omitted, but cell lysis and assay conditions were the same.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Native Gel Assay of Fe-S Cluster Formation on Imported Yeast Ferredoxin, Yah1p—Ferredoxin (Yah1p), a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein is imported into mitochondria, whereupon the targeting signal of the precursor form is proteolytically processed by matrix proteases, generating a mature form (30Duby G. Foury F. Ramazzotti A. Herrmann J. Lutz T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Lutz T. Westermann B. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307 (Correction (2001) J. Mol. Biol.308, 1091): 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The mature Yah1p is then a substrate for addition of Fe-S clusters within mitochondria. Radiolabeled Yah1p precursor was imported into mitochondria, and Fe-S cluster synthesis was assessed by measuring formation of holoprotein on a native gel as described previously (30Duby G. Foury F. Ramazzotti A. Herrmann J. Lutz T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Lutz T. Westermann B. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307 (Correction (2001) J. Mol. Biol.308, 1091): 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The precursor form of wild-type ferredoxin was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]cysteine, labeling the polypeptide chain. To demonstrate that this method does indeed distinguish Fe-S cluster-loaded ferredoxin from apoprotein, a cysteine mutant (CysM) was constructed. In this mutant Yah1p, cluster-liganding cysteines (Cys-104 and Cys-108) were mutated to alanines, rendering it incapable of binding an Fe-S cluster. This cysteine mutant precursor was tested in parallel with wild-type Yah1p.Following import of radiolabeled full-length or CysM forms of Yah1p into permeabilized cells for 10 min, the mitochondrial matrix fraction was isolated and separated by SDS or native gel electrophoresis. The appearance of a mature processed form resistant to externally added protease indicated that it had been imported into mitochondria (Fig. 3A, m, SDS). The import and processing of Yah1p did not occur in the presence of valinomycin, a potassium ionophore that disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3B, SDS, lane 2). On native gel, imported radiolabeled Yah1p migrated as holoprotein (h) or slower apoprotein (a) species (Fig. 3A), whereas the imported CysM generated only the apoprotein forms (Fig. 3B, lane 1).FIGURE 3Import of radiolabeled Yah1p or Yah1p cysteine mutant precursors into mitochondria of permeabilized cells. Yeast strains were grown anaerobically and shifted to air for 4 h in defined media, and cells from each culture were permeabilized. A, radiolabeled Yah1p was imported into 20 μl of permeabilized cells (0.5 g/ml) for wild type (wt), Δmrs3/4, ΔΔΔ, and Δyfh1 (lanes 1–4, respectively). B, radiolabeled Cys mutant of Yah1p was imported into 20 μl (0.5 g/ml) of wild type-permeabilized cells in the absence (lane 1) or presence of valinomycin (val)(lane 2). Following the import reactions, trypsin digestion was performed as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the mitochondrial matrix fractions were separated on SDS gel or native gel. p, precursor; m, mature Yah1p; a, Yah1 apoprotein; h, Yah1 holoprotein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Anaerobically grown cells were shifted to air for 4 h and permeabilized. Radiolabeled Yah1p precursor was then imported for 10 min. There was no detectable import in the Δyfh1 mutant (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The failure of import was not restricted to ferredoxin; preprotein for Put2p was likewise not imported, suggesting a general defect in mitochondrial protein import (data not shown). Approximately equal amounts of precursor were imported and processed in the other three strains (Fig. 3A, SDS, m).Fe-S cluster forming activities on imported Yah1p were evaluated by native gel. The apoprotein signal in the Δmrs3/4 mutant was slightly increased compared with the wild type. In the triple mutant, the apoprotein was markedly increased, and holo-Yah1p was visibly decreased. As expected from the lack of import activity in the Δyfh1 cells, imported apoprotein or holoprotein were not detected on native gel electrophoresis of these cells (Fig. 3A, native). Similar results were obtained in experiments with isolated mitochondria (not shown).Dependence of New Cluster Formation in Mitochondria on Iron from Outside Mitochondria, Role for Mrs3/4p Transporters—The radiolabeled Yah1p precursor imported into mitochondria was present in very small absolute amounts (estimated at less than 1 ng per 5 μl in each reaction). Experiments designed to examine iron dependence of Fe-S cluster formation were unsuccessful. We reasoned that this might be due to the substoichiometric amounts of substrate and the presence of a small amount of contaminating or stored iron in the mitochondria. Therefore, we tested bacterially expressed urea-denatured precursor with a C-terminal His6"

In addition to being cleared from the circulation by urinary excretion, Hcy-thiolactone is detoxified by the serum Hcy-thiolactonase/paraoxonase carried on high density lipoprotein. Whether Hcy-thiolactone is detoxified inside cells was unknown. Here we show that Hcy-thiolactone is hydrolyzed by an intracellular enzyme, which we have purified to homogeneity from human placenta and identified by proteomic analyses as human bleomycin hydrolase (hBLH). We have also purified an Hcy-thiolactonase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified it as yeast bleomycin hydrolase (yBLH). BLH belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine aminopeptidases, and its only known biologically relevant function was deamidation of the anticancer drug bleomycin. Recombinant hBLH or yBLH, expressed in Escherichia coli, exhibits Hcy-thiolactonase activity similar to that of the native enzymes. Active site mutations, C73A for hBLH and H369A for yBLH, inactivate Hcy-thiolactonase activities. Yeast blh1 mutants are deficient in Hcy-thiolactonase activity in vitro and in vivo, produce more Hcy-thiolactone, and exhibit greater sensitivity to Hcy toxicity than wild type yeast cells. Our data suggest that BLH protects cells against Hcy toxicity by hydrolyzing intracellular Hcy-thiolactone."
https://openalex.org/W2069558973,"Proteasome inhibition occurs during normal aging and in a variety of age-related diseases, with inhibition of proteasome function sufficient to induce physiological and pathological alterations observed in each of these conditions. It is presumed that proteasome inhibition induces cellular alterations by promoting rapid protein accumulation, as the direct result of impairments in protein removal, which assumes protein synthesis remains relatively unchanged during proteasome inhibition. We conducted experimentation using established proteasome inhibitors and primary rat neuron cultures in order to elucidate whether proteasome inhibition had any effect on neuronal protein synthesis. Proteasome inhibition impaired neuronal protein synthesis, with concentrations of inhibitor necessary to significantly inhibit protein synthesis similar to the concentrations necessary to induce subsequent neuron death. The inhibition of protein synthesis was reversible during the first 6 h of treatment, with the neurotoxicity of proteasome inhibition reversible during the first 12 h of treatment. These studies are the first to demonstrate a potentially important interplay between the proteasome and protein synthesis in neurons, and the first to identify that some effects of proteasome inhibition are reversible in neurons. Together these findings have important implications for understanding proteasome inhibition as a potential contributor to aging and age-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W2057811851,"Emerging evidence suggests that supernumerary centrosomes drive genome instability and oncogenesis1,2,3. Human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL)4. ATL cells are aneuploid, but the causes of aneuploidy are incompletely understood5,6. Here, we show that centrosome amplification is frequent in HTLV-I-transformed cells and that this phenotype is caused by the viral Tax oncoprotein. We also show that the fraction of Tax protein that localizes to centrosomes interacts with TAX1BP2, a novel centrosomal protein composed almost entirely of coiled-coil domains. Overexpression of TAX1BP2 inhibited centrosome duplication, whereas depletion of TAX1BP2 by RNAi resulted in centrosome hyperamplification. Our findings suggest that the HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein targets TAX1BP2 causing genomic instability and aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2075483368,"Basal cell carcinomas (BCC), which are the most common form of skin malignancy, are invariably associated with the deregulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway. As such, BCC represent a unique model for the study of interactions of the Shh pathway with other genes and pathways. We constructed a tissue microarray (TMA) of 75 paired BCC and normal skin and analysed the expression of beta-catenin and RUNX3, nuclear effectors of the wingless-Int (Wnt) and bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor-beta pathways, respectively. In line with previous reports, we observed varying subcellular expression pattern of beta-catenin in BCC, with 31 cases (41%) showing nuclear accumulation. In contrast, all the BCC cases tested by the TMA showed RUNX3 protein uniformly overexpressed in the nuclei of the cancer cells. Analysis by Western blotting and DNA sequencing indicates that the overexpressed protein is normal and full-length, containing no mutation in the coding region, implicating RUNX3 as an oncogene in certain human cancers. Our results indicate that although the deregulation of Wnt signalling could contribute to the pathogenesis of a subset of BCC, RUNX3 appears to be a universal downstream mediator of a constitutively active Shh pathway in BCC."
https://openalex.org/W2029528962,"PGC-1alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPARgamma] coactivator-1alpha) activates PPARalpha and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), which regulate proteins, fatty acid and ATP metabolism (i.e., FAT/CD36, MCAD, and COX I). Recently we found that the salutary effects of estradiol (E2) on cardiac function following trauma-hemorrhage (T-H) are mediated via estrogen receptor (ER)beta. In this study we tested the hypothesis that ERbeta-mediated cardioprotection is induced via up-regulation of PGC-1alpha through PPARalpha or Tfam-dependent pathway. Male rats underwent T-H and received ERalpha agonist propylpyrazole-triol (PPT), ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN), E2, or vehicle. Another group was treated with antisense PGC-1alpha oligonucleotides prior to administration of DPN. E2 and DPN treatments attenuated the decrease in cardiac mitochondrial ATP, abrogated the T-H-induced lipid accumulation, and normalized PGC-1alpha, PPARalpha, FAT/CD36, MCAD, Tfam, and COX I after T-H. In contrast, PPT administration did not abrogate lipid accumulation. Moreover, in PPT-treated animals mitochondrial ATP remained significantly lower than those observed in DPN- or E2-treated animals. Prior administration of antisense PGC-1alpha prevented DPN-mediated cardioprotection and increase in ATP levels and Tfam but not in PPARalpha following T-H. These findings suggest that the salutary effects of E2 on cardiac function following T-H are mediated via ERbeta up-regulation of PGC-1alpha through Tfam-dependent pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1977245969,"Gap junctional hemichannels mediate cell-extracellular communication. A hemichannel is made of six connexin (Cx) subunits; each connexin has four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and cytoplasmic amino- and carboxyl-terminals (CTs). The extracellular domains are arranged differently at non-junctional and junctional (gap junction) regions, although very little is known about their flexibility and conformational energetics. The cytoplasmic tail differs considerably in the size and amino acid sequence for different connexins and is predicted to be involved in the channel open and closed conformations. For large connexins, such as Cx43, the CT makes large cytoplasmic fuzz visible under electron microscopy. If this CT domain controls channel permeability by physical occlusion of the pore mouth, movement of this portion could open or close the channel. We used atomic force microscopy-based single molecule spectroscopy with antibody-modified atomic force microscopy tips and connexin mimetic peptide modified tips to examine the flexibility of extracellular loop and CT domains and to estimate the energetics of their movements. Antibody to the CT portion closer to the membrane stretches the tail to a shorter length, and the antibody to CT tail stretches the tail to a longer length.

Gap junctions are intercellular channels that directly couple two apposing cells. They allow diffusion-driven intercellular transfer of ions and small molecules (<1000 Da), synchronize electrical activity, and regulate metabolic homeostasis, cell growth, and differentiation (1Bruzzone R.

Structurally, a gap junction is made of two hemichannels (connexons) aligned head-to-head across an extracellular “gap,” which is roughly cylindrical with a central ion-permeable pore (4Hoh J.H.

There is very limited variation in the sequences of two disulfide-linked extracellular loops, which are crucially positioned for the docking of the connexons to form gap junctions (3Sosinsky G.E. Nicholson B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Docking between connexons involves interactions between the extracellular loops (7Evans W.H. Boitano S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Seul K.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L619-L622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The details of how the extracellular loops are arranged and dock are currently unresolved. Current models based on three-dimensional structural studies suggest that hemichannel docking involves multivalent interactions of subunits between hemichannels. In addition, hemichannels are also present in the non-junctional regions wherein their extracellular loops with many hydrophobic amino acids would require a different conformation to shield the hydrophobic amino acids from the aqueous environment (11Jiang J.X. Gu S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).The opening and closing of hemichannels, in response to both membrane potential and chemical signals, are being examined extensively, and several models, based on structural information from x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, have been proposed for gap junction opening and closing. In the early model by Unwin and Zampighi (12Unwin P.N.T. Zampighi G. Nature. 1980; 283: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 13Unwin P.N.T. Ennis P.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), they proposed that the channel is closed by differential rotations of apposing hemichannels thus narrowing the pore diameter. But, little is known about non-junctional hemichannels present in the free margins of the plasma membrane. Sosinsky and coworkers have reported calcium-induced extracellular conformational changes in Cx26 hemichannels using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (8Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently, Thimm et al. (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have proposed calcium-dependent folding/refolding of extracellular loops leading to altered pore mouth opening or closing. They obtained three-dimensional conformations of the open and closed Cx43 hemichannels reconstituted in lipid bilayer and have provided an estimate of conformational energetics (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Such information is missing about the channel gating from the cytoplasmic side. For both hemichannel and gap junctional gating, especially for connexins with a large cytoplasmic tail such as Cx43, Delmar and coworkers (15Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 16Delmar M. Coombs W. Sorgen P. Duffy H.S. Taffet S.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) proposed the “particle-receptor” hypothesis similar to the “ball and chain” model of potassium channels. According to this, the long cytoplasmic tail “chain” folds into a “ball” (gating particle) and binds to the cytoplasmic loop domain (a possible receptor) and leads to channel closure (16Delmar M. Coombs W. Sorgen P. Duffy H.S. Taffet S.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Sahoo P. Coombs W. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol.

However, little structural or mechanistic data are available to support this model.AFM-based single molecule force spectroscopy is being used as an effective approach to define protein folding and unfolding and three-dimensional conformations. The binding of ligands immobilized on AFM tips to their receptors adsorbed on a surface is examined by applying a force to the receptor-ligand complex until the bond breaks at a measurable unbinding force (18Hinterdorfer P. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 68: 115-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kienberger F. Kada G. Mueller H. Hinterdorfer P. J. Mol.

Antibodies to specific connexin epitopes have been used to provide some qualitative details about the hemichannel structure and subunit interactions (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Martin P.E. Steggles J. Wilson C. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, connexin mimetic peptides, short synthetic peptides to specific sequences in connexins EL and cytoplasmic loop domains, have been used to block the functional gap junction coupling in a variety of systems (26Chaytor A.T. Evans W.H. Griffith T.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Boitano S. Evans W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L623-L630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our results provide distinct signatures of the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of hemichannels reconstituted in bilayer: mimetic peptide recognizes the EL loops, whereas anti-CT antibodies recognize the CT domain. Antibody binding to the CT domain displays typical single interactions and molecular stretches. The extended molecule stretch is consistent with the elongated random coil nature of the Cx43 CT domain and is sensitive to calcium. The extent of stretching the various portions of the carboxyl tail suggests the ball and chain mechanism for hemichannel conformational changes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHemichannel Isolation and Purification—Wild-type BICR-M1Rk (Marshall) cell line expressing Cx43 was grown as described previously (28Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Connexons were isolated as described (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with modification. The entire procedure was carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, confluent cell cultures were harvested and homogenized in Hanks' buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture I (Calbiochem). The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in Hanks' buffer with 0.25 m sucrose, loaded on a 1.2/2.0 m sucrose step gradient, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h. The plasma membrane fraction containing connexons between 1.2 and 2.0 m sucrose gradients was collected and solubilized with buffer S (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm octylglucoside, pH 7.4). The solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-CT360-382 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA)-coupled Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h under gentle stirring. The beads were then transferred onto a column and washed with 50 ml of buffer S containing 1 mg of phosphatidylcholine/ml. Connexons were eluted with buffer S containing 5 μm control peptide to anti-CT360-382 (Chemicon) and 1 mg of phosphatidylcholine/ml. The purity of extracted connexons was evaluated by silver staining and Western blot following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described before (30Yancey S.B. John S.A. Lal R. Austin B.J. Revel J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2241-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Hemichannel Reconstitution into Supported Bilayers—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was dissolved in chloroform, vacuum-desiccated overnight, and then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2-7.4) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Liposomes were formed by extruding DOPC through a set of 0.4-μm pore size filters using a LipoFast device from Avestin Inc. (Ottawa, Canada). To reconstitute connexons into liposome membrane, purified connexons were then mixed with the liposomes (∼1:1000 w/w protein: lipid) and bath-sonicated for 15 min. The liposomes were then deposited on freshly cleaved mica for 20 min, rinsed with PBS, and heated at 37-39 °C for 2-3 min to fuse liposomes into planar bilayers (31Mou J. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3222-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—1, 2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(Lissamine Rhodamine B sulfonyl) was mixed with DOPC at a ratio of 1:1000. Planar bilayers with reconstituted hemichannels were prepared on glass coverslips using the procedure described above. The coverslips were washed with PBS and placed in blocking solution (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with mouse anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain CT252-270 (Chemicon) in PBS (1 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed with PBS for at least five times. They were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml, ZyMax™, Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature (33Lin H. Zhu Y.J. Lal R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11189-11196Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Samples were then washed again with PBS. Fluorescence images were captured using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope with 100× oil lens (numerical aperture, 1.45). Immunofluorescence images were collected with red channel filter set (Ex 482/Em 536 nm) for bilayers and with green channel filter set (Ex 525/Em 585 nm) for connexons. Bilayers reconstituted with connexons but without any antibody incubation, bilayers reconstituted with connexons incubated with secondary antibodies directly, and bilayers without connexon reconstitution but incubated with both primary and secondary antibodies were also imaged as controls.Preparation of Functionalized AFM Tips—Mouse anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain CT252-270 and mouse anti-Cx43 polyclonal antibody against CT360-382 (Chemicon), connexin mimetic peptide GAP26 (VCYDKSFPISHVR) and scrambled GAP26 (PSFDSRHCIVKYV) (SigmaGenosys, Haverhill, UK) were used to functionalize the AFM tips as described (34Riener C.K. Stroh C.M. Ebner A. Klampfl C. Gall A.A. Romanin C. Lyubchenko Y.L. Hinterdorfer P. Gruber H.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2003; 479: 59-75Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, standard 200-μm-long Si3N4 tips (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) and 450-μm-long silicon tips (Applied NanoStructures, Santa Clara, CA) were cleaned with chloroform three times and dried with N2. Tips were then washed with ethanol twice and dried with N2. The tips were incubated overnight in 5.6 m ethanolamine-HCl dissolved in Me2SO over molecular sieve beads (pore size, 0.33 nm) and washed three times with Me2SO followed by two times with ethanol, and then dried with N2. A synthesized hetero-bifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) tether with aldehyde and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) reactive ends (aldehyde-PEG-NHS) was attached to the AFM tip by incubating the tips for 2 h at room temperature in a solution containing 3.3 mg of tether molecule, 0.5 ml of chloroform, and 10 μl of triethylamine. The functionalized tips were then washed twice with chloroform and dried with N2. Finally, the tips were incubated in 200 μl of antibody or peptide (0.2 mg/ml in PBS) for 50 min to link the free NH2- on the antibody or peptide to the functionalized tips. 2 μ l of 1 m NaCNBH3 (32 mg of NaCNBH3, 50 μl of 100 mm NaOH in 450 μ l of H2O) were added to the solution at the very beginning of the reaction. At the end of the reaction, 5 μ l of 1 m ethanolamine (in 20% NaOH) was added to the solution to passivate unreacted aldehyde groups. Functionalized tips were washed and stored in PBS buffer at 4 °C until use.Cantilever Calibration—Cantilever spring constants were measured using two methods. For cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0.06 newton (N)/m (Veeco), the spring constant of the functionalized tip was estimated by measuring the spring constants with standard force calibration cantilevers as described previously (35Tortonese M. Kirk M. Proc. SPIE. 1997; 3009: 53-60Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The spring constant of antibody- or peptide-conjugated tips was measured to be k = 0.063 ± 0.005 N/m (n = 5) and is consistent with published results (36Cleveland J.P. Manne S. Bocek D. Hansma P.K. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 403-405Crossref Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Whenever feasible, we used the same conjugated tip for experiments involving internal control: for example, in mapping interactions between antibody and receptor alone, adding online inhibitor of their interactions. For cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0.02 N/m (Applied Nanostructures), a modified (developed by Ben Ohler from Veeco) thermal noise method (37Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3363) Google Scholar) was used to determine their spring constants. Briefly, the cantilever was withdrawn from the surface and was allowed to oscillate freely at its natural frequency. An AFM image (512 × 512 pixels) recording the cantilever deflection of these oscillations was obtained at a point sampling rate of ∼62.5 kHz (i.e. 61 Hz lines/s). A MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) code was written to obtain the power spectrum density of these oscillations and by application of the equipartition theorem, the cantilever spring constant was calculated. The measured spring constant was ∼0.014-0.016 N/m.AFM and Force Measurement—AFM images were collected using a NanoScope III Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments). The AFM probes were oxide-sharpened silicon nitride (Si3N4) tips and were operated at frequencies of 5-35 kHz with free oscillating amplitudes of ∼20-35 nm. Most of the AFM imaging was carried out in tapping mode with a scanning frequency of 0.5-2 Hz that allowed simultaneous collection of the height and amplitude data. All AFM imaging of lipid bilayers with or without reconstituted Cx43 connexons was conducted at room temp (22-24 °C) in PBS buffer (pH 7.2-7.4) as described (28Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).Force-volume maps were obtained to collect force curves between antibody/mimetic peptide (conjugated to the AFM tip) and connexons reconstituted in the planar lipid bilayer. One complete force curve was recorded at each position while the AFM tip was scanned across the surface of the bilayer in 64 × 64 pixels. The force curves were collected with a z-deflection rate of 1-4 nm/ms, a z-scan size of 400 nm, and a maximum cantilever deflection (relative trigger) of 20 nm.To determine the specificity of the antibody-Cx43 or GAP26-Cx43 interaction, 100 μ l of 50 μg/ml antibody or peptide (the same ligands conjugated on tips) was then added into the imaging solution, and successive force-curves were collected again after 20 min of incubation with the blocking antibody or peptide. As an additional control experiment, force curves were also recorded with a scrambled GAP26-conjugated tip in identical experimental conditions.Data Analysis—A MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) code was used to analyze the force-distance curves obtained in forcevolume map as described (38Arce F.T. Avci R. Beech I.B. Cooksey K.E. Wigglesworth-Cooksey B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 4284-4297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This program identifies unbinding events by searching for all significant local minima in a retraction curve. To differentiate unbinding events from noise, filters were introduced so that unbinding events with adhesion forces below a given threshold were not considered. A small fraction of force-distance curves were identified as corrupt curves, e.g. due to excessive noise or ill-defined approach and/or retraction curves, and were excluded from the analysis. Each retraction curve was analyzed by first finding the horizontal region in the approach curve. The zero force line was determined as the average value of points in the horizontal region. The intersection of this line with the retraction curve identifies the tip-surface contact point and defines the origin from which the polymer extensions and the magnitude of the adhesion/unbinding forces are measured in the retraction curve. For an unbinding event, the adhesion force corresponds to the magnitude of the force in the retraction curve measured from the zero force line. The corresponding separation distance, d, represents the distance traveled by the piezo from the origin of the curve (corresponding to the initial horizontal cantilever position) to the unbinding event. The polymer extension length, L, is simply given by subtracting the cantilever deflection, Δ, from the piezo displacement, L = d-Δ. The unbinding force is determined from the difference between the forces corresponding to a local minimum and the next local maximum in the direction of increasing values of the separation distance. The probability of finding either single or multiple events in a force curve (determined by the number of significant local minimum) was calculated by dividing the number of curves in each category by the total number of force curves acquired. These were represented in a histogram displaying the probability for finding zero events, one event or multiple events in a force curve.Force-extension curves were fitted with the extended FJC model (39Oesterhelt F.

The Kuhn length LK = 0.7 nm, and the segment elasticity KS = 150 N/m are fitted to the experimental data. NS, the number of monomers for each tether (polymer contour length) is the only fitting parameter.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONConnexon Reconstitution in Lipid Bilayer—Hemichannels, when reconstituted in an artificial lipid bilayer, insert into the membrane with almost equal probability for both extracellular and cytoplasmic sides facing outside on a supported system. The differing lengths and amino acid sequences for the two sides, however, enable them to be distinguished with AFM imaging (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 1, we designed our experimental system to utilize the specific interactions either between antibody and Cx43 CT domains or between mimetic peptides and Cx43 extracellular domains in Cx43 hemichannels. Flexible polymer tethers were used to attach antibodies or mimetic peptides to the AFM tip, which spatially isolates nonspecific probe-sample interactions from the specific interactions of the tethered molecules (Fig. 1B). Anti-CT252-270 antibody is used to target the middle region of the Cx43 CT tail, whereas anti-CT360-382 is used to bind the end of the CT tail. Connexin mimetic peptide Gap26 is used to probe the Cx43 extracellular domain EL163-75 (Fig. 1C).The reconstitution of connexons in the supported bilayer was confirmed by immunofluorescence labeling. Fig. 2A1 showed a planar bilayer reconstituted with hemichannels (sample) and exhibited immunofluorescence labeling (green) for Cx43, whereas no fluorescence was detected in the sample without immunofluorescence labeling (Fig. 2A2). Insignificant nonspecific immunolabeling was observed when the sample was incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody directly (without primary anti-Cx43 antibody) (Fig. 2A3), and no fluorescence was observed in bilayers without connexons after both primary and secondary antibody labeling (Fig. 2A4). Fig. 2 (B1-B4) shows the corresponding fluorescence images of Lissamine Rhodamine B-labeled planar bilayers (red) on the coverslip. Some holes in the bilayer, where liposomes did not fuse, are also seen (arrows).FIGURE 2Fluorescence imaging.

Scale bar:5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in an AFM height image (Fig. 3A), the surface topography of the bilayer without any reconstituted connexons appears to be smooth and featureless with the height fluctuation of <0.3 nm (Fig. 3B). The thickness of the bilayer is ∼5.0 nm, as determined from the cross-section along the unfused bilayer holes, consistent with previous results (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S. Lal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Connexons reconstituted in bilayers appear as structures protruding out from the bilayer surface in a randomly distributed pattern. These connexons appear to fall into two groups with distinct extramembranous protrusion heights of ∼0.5-1.0 nm (red circles) and 2.0 nm (white circles) (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D shows crosssections along lines in Fig. 3C: open arrows represent the first group of low protrusion heights (red circles), whereas solid arrowheads represent the second group of high protrusion heights (white circles). The height difference is due to the larger cytoplasmic CT domain protruding from the membrane. Thus, a clear distinction of the sidedness of imaged connexons is achieved that is consistent with previous biochemical and structural studies of Cx43 connexons (14Thimm J. Mechler A. Lin H. Rhee S.

https://openalex.org/W2011571944,"Numerous vertebrate genes are involved in the biology of the oligosaccharide chains attached to glycoconjugates. These genes fall into diverse groups within the conventional Gene Ontology classification. However, they should be evaluated together from functional and evolutionary perspectives in a “biochemical systems” approach, considering each monosaccharide unit's biosynthesis, activation, transport, modification, transfer, recycling, degradation, and recognition. Sialic acid (Sia) residues are monosaccharides at the outer end of glycans on the cell-surface and secreted molecules of vertebrates, mediating recognition by intrinsic or extrinsic (pathogen) receptors. The availability of multiple genome sequences allows a system-wide comparison among primates and rodents of all genes directly involved in Sia biology. Taking this approach, we present further evidence for accelerated evolution in Sia-binding domains of CD33-related Sia-recognizing Ig-like lectins. Other gene classes are more conserved, including those encoding the sialyltransferases that attach Sia residues to glycans. Despite this conservation, tissue sialylation patterns are shown to differ widely among these species, presumably because of rapid evolution of sialyltransferase expression patterns. Analyses of N- and O-glycans of erythrocyte and plasma glycopeptides from these and other mammalian taxa confirmed this phenomenon. Sia modifications on these glycopeptides also appear to be undergoing rapid evolution. This rapid evolution of the sialome presumably results from the ongoing need of organisms to evade microbial pathogens that use Sia residues as receptors. The rapid evolution of Sia-binding domains of the inhibitory CD33-related Sia-recognizing Ig-like lectins is likely to be a secondary consequence, as these inhibitory receptors presumably need to keep up with recognition of the rapidly evolving “self”-sialome.

Sialic acid (Sia) 4The abbreviations used are: Sia, sialic acid; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc, N-glycolylneuraminic acid; Siglecs, Sia-recognizing Ig-like lectins; CD33rSiglecs, CD33-related Sia-recognizing Ig-like lectins; SNA, S. nigra agglutinin; MAH, M. amurensis hemagglutinin; HPAEC-PAD, high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. residues are negatively charged nine-carbon sugars typically occupying the distal ends of glycan chains on the cell-surface and secreted molecules in the deuterostome lineage of animals (1Traving C. Schauer R. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1330-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The two most common forms of Sia in vertebrates are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which differ by a single oxygen atom that is added by the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase enzyme CMAH. A third basic type of Sia is 2-keto-3-deoxynonulosonic acid, which is less common in mammals. Rarely, the amino group of neuraminic acid can remain unmodified. These four forms of Sia are subject to a variety of modifications (most prominently O-acetylation at the 4-, 7-, 8-, or 9-position) and can be presented in many different linkages to the underlying sugar chain (1Traving C. Schauer R. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1330-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Angata T. Varki A. Chem.

Chem. 1979; 254: 12531-12534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sum total of this diversity has been termed the “sialome” (4Varki A. Angata T. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). 5The term sialome denotes the total complement of Sia types and linkages and their modes of presentation on a particular organelle, cell, tissue, organ, or organism as found at a particular time and under specific conditions (4Varki A. Angata T. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Sia residues are involved in many biological processes, often involving binding by intrinsic and extrinsic Sia-recognizing proteins. As an example of intrinsic Sia recognition, complement factor H uses Sia as a means to identify “self” and to prevent autoimmune attack by the alternate complement pathway; in contrast, foreign cells lacking Sia are not protected (5Pangburn M.K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that the CD33-related subset of Siarecognizing Ig-like lectins (Siglecs) may also serve to recognize host Sia residues as self (4Varki A. Angata T. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), thus dampening autoreactivity of cells of the innate immune response. Meanwhile, numerous vertebrate pathogens recognize and bind to glycan structures containing Sia residues (2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), using them as portals to gain entry. Elimination of vertebrate host Sia production to avoid such pathogens is not an option, as this results in embryonic lethality (6Schwarzkopf M. Knobeloch K.P. Rohde E. Hinderlich S. Wiechens N. Lucka L. Horak I. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5267-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Complicating matters, many successful microbes express surface Sia residues, mimicking the host and avoiding recognition by many arms of the immune system (7Vimr E.R. Kalivoda K.A. Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 132-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that Sia residues are involved in an ongoing biochemical “arms race” between hosts and pathogens, driven to diversify by “Red Queen” effects, 6The Red Queen effect in evolution refers to the observation to Alice by the Red Queen that “it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” Complex multicellular animals with long life cycles must evolve rapidly to survive the attacks of microbial pathogens that can replicate much faster (57Van Valen L. Nature. 1974; 252: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 58Hamilton W.D. Axelrod R. Tanese R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3566-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). even while conserving critical endogenous functions (4Varki A. Angata T. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 8Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Taking a “biochemical systems” approach to analyzing all extant data (see Fig. 1), we found that there are <60 known genetic loci directly involved in the biosynthesis, activation, transport, modification, transfer, recycling, degradation, and recognition of Sia residues within humans and other vertebrates (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). With the exception of the CD33-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs), all these loci are conserved between the human and mouse genomes, indicating their functional importance. Precursor molecules are first converted into Sia residues, which are then activated to CMP-Sia and transported to the Golgi apparatus, where members of a family of sialyltransferases transfer them onto the terminal ends of glycan chains in various types of structurally distinct linkages (see Fig. 1). Sia residues may also be modified from one form to another such as from Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc or by the addition of O-acetyl groups, and these alterations are differentially recognized by receptors on the same cell surface or on other cells. Sia residues attached to macromolecules are eventually cleaved from glycan chains in the lysosome, actively returned to the cytosol, and then recycled or degraded (see Fig. 1).TABLE 1Genes involved in sialic acid biology All human loci known or thought to be involved in aspects of Sia biology are listed.

These functionally related genes actually fall into diverse groups within the conventional Gene Ontology classification. They are also (with the exception of the CD33rSiglecs) randomly distributed throughout the genome. We suggest that all these genes should be evaluated together in a biochemical systems approach, considering the biosynthesis, activation, transport, modification, transfer, recycling, degradation, and recognition of Sia residues. Here, we undertake such an approach toward understanding the evolution of Sia biology in primates, rodents, and other mammals in combination with selected biochemical studies. We first investigate whether specific loci or functional classes of loci in this system have been subjected to adaptive selective pressures, whether any common principles emerge, and whether differences between chimpanzees and humans are more significant despite a shorter divergence time. We then take a biochemical approach to put the genomic data into context. Human Loci—We identified 55 loci in humans that are known to be (or to potentially be) involved in Sia biology (see Table 1). Human RefSeqs and the genome sequences of target loci were obtained from the NCBI LocusLink web site (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/). Some loci have several RefSeqs representing splice variants and/or show some sequence differences between the RefSeqs and the genome sequences. In the former case, the sequence with the most inclusive number of exons was used as a representative of the locus. In the latter case, the actual genome sequences were used for the analyses. Identification of Chimpanzee Orthologs—Human RefSeqs or human genome sequences from 43 human loci (excluding the CD33rSiglecs) were used to extract orthologous coding sequences from the chimpanzee genome assembly (NCBI Build 1 Version 1) as identified by reciprocal best BLASTZ alignments (12Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium Nature. 2005; 437: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Phred quality scores for each site in chimpanzee sequences were also provided by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium (12Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium Nature. 2005; 437: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). For eight of the human CD33rSiglecs (SIGLEC3, SIGLEC5-10, and SIGLEC12), high quality sequences were also obtained from our independent high resolution comparative analyses of human, chimpanzee, baboon, mouse, and rat (20Angata T. Margulies E.H. Green E.D. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One more Siglec locus (SIGLEC13) is found in the chimpanzee and baboon genomes, but its complete deletion in humans was reported previously (20Angata T. Margulies E.H. Green E.D. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SIGLEC13 was therefore used only for the domain-specific comparative analyses. Mouse and Rat Orthologs—RefSeqs of mouse and rat orthologs were obtained from the NCBI LocusLink web site. Reliable mouse sequences were obtained for all but four loci; reliable rat sequences were obtained for all but nine sequences. All rodent loci obtained have one sequence as the RefSeq, with the exception of the mouse St3gal2 locus. The representative sequence of the mouse St3gal2 locus was selected by following the procedure described for human loci. The high quality sequences of mouse and rat CD33rSiglec orthologs (Siglec3 and SiglecE-G) were obtained as described (20Angata T. Margulies E.H. Green E.D. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Evolutionary Analysis—Sequence alignments of coding regions were performed in ClustalW (26Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar) and manually checked to see whether chimpanzee sequences had insertions or deletions causing frameshifts in the aligned open reading frame. These were handled with reference to human and mouse sequences, which showed identical open reading frames for all loci studied, except for one locus (NAGK; see supplemental text). Chimpanzee-specific insertions were assumed to be errors and were deleted to maintain an open reading frame even if they had high quality scores. Frameshifts caused by deletions were left in the alignments as gaps, but the codons they were located in were removed from the analyses (see supplemental text). The sequences modified by these processes are referred to as “modified” sequences in supplemental Table 1. In the alignments, some sites that are substitutions or indels between the human and chimpanzee sequences show low quality Phred scores in chimpanzee. Because these low quality sites could be artifacts from the sequencing and base-calling process, a second round of analyses were done in which such low quality chimpanzee sites were changed to match the human sequences at the sites in question. The chimpanzee sequences in which substitutions were modified to match the human sequences are referred to as “humanized” sequences in supplemental Table 1. Several chimpanzee sequences also show regions of non-called bases (represented by “N” in supplemental Table 1). Gene sequence regions that had non-called bases in the chimpanzee sequence were excluded from analyses. The evolutionary parameters shown in Table 1 were calculated in multiple species comparisons using human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat. The numbers of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per site were estimated by the method of Nei and Gojobori (27Nei M. Gojobori T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1986; 3: 418-426PubMed Google Scholar) with the Jukes-Cantor correction (28Jukes T.H. Cantor C.R. Munro H.N. Mammalian Protein Metabolism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969: 21-132Crossref Google Scholar). Values for Ka and Ks were calculated using DnaSP Version 3.51 (29Rozas J. Rozas R. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar) or MEGA2 (30Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). Statistical tests were performed to assess the significance of evolutionary differences obtained in the analyses by using InStat Version 0.6 (GraphPad Software) or MEGA2. Protein Secondary Structure Prediction—For secondary structure prediction of the sialyltransferase loci, new joint method analysis was performed using web-based software at the Parallel Protein Information Analysis System (PAPIA) web site (available at www.cbrc.jp/papia-cgi/ssp_menu.pl) (61Akiyama Y. Onizuka K. Noguchi T. Ando M. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 1998; 9: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). Lectin Staining of Sialic Acids on Tissue Sections—Paraffin sections of lung, kidney, and spleen samples from seven humans, eight chimpanzees, six rats, and six mice were deparaffinized, blocked, and overlaid with predetermined concentrations of biotinylated Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) lectin or biotinylated Maackia amurensis hemagglutinin (MAH) lectin or with control reagent. Binding was detected by alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin using Vector blue substrate, nuclear fast red counterstaining, and aqueous mounting. Samples were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding. Digital photomicrographs were taken while viewing with an Olympus BH2 microscope with a MacroFire camera and Adobe Photoshop. Preparation of Erythrocyte Ghosts and Plasma—Blood from multiple taxa was collected directly into BD Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA, stored overnight at 4 °C, and then spun at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The plasma was removed and stored frozen until further work-up. The buffy coat was removed, and the erythrocyte pellet was washed twice with 10 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Lysis of erythrocytes was accomplished by adding 15 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The sample was transferred into glass Sorvall tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was carefully aspirated so as not to disturb the remaining “soft” pellet. The creamy particulate material that did not diffuse easily (representing contaminating white cells) was also removed. The tubes were filled with lysis buffer and centrifuged again. The process was repeated until ghosts were white. The last wash was made with ice-cold water containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene as a preservative. Glycopeptide Preparation from Erythrocyte Ghosts and Plasma—Plasma (0.5 ml) was lyophilized in a glass conical tube, and 250 μl of water was added. 0.5 ml of the ghosts was transferred into a glass conical tube, assuming ∼50% water. The lipids were extracted from each of the above samples with 20 volumes of 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol using a Brinkmann Instruments Polytron at a high setting for 30-60 s. The samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min after each extraction. All supernatants containing the lipids were pooled into a single glass vessel. Each sample was extracted again with 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol. The pellets w"

Ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor (GR) translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription in a DNA binding-dependent or independent manner. The predominant biological effect of glucocorticoids on peripheral T cells is immunosupression via transcriptional repression of genes induced during T cell activation. Glucocorticoids have been implicated in the inhibition of activation-induced T cell apoptosis by virtue of their down-regulation of Fas ligand (fasL) expression. It is believed that FasL, similar to other cytokines, is repressed by glucocorticoids via GR interaction with other transcription factors, interfering with their transactivation ability. Here, we show that human fasL is directly regulated by GR in a DNA binding-dependent manner. A negative GR element found at position -990 in the fasL promoter binds GR in vitro as well as in the chromatin context. This negative glucocorticoid response element overlaps with a known NFkappaB binding site. GR down-regulates fasL promoter by competing with NFkappaB for binding to the common response element. Thus, fasL is the first gene described whose repression by GR is mediated by sterical occlusion of NFkappaB DNA binding. This type of repression represents an additional mechanism for the GR-NFkappaB mutual antagonism."
https://openalex.org/W2101063971,"The regulation of cell polarity plays an important role in chemotaxis. GbpD, a putative nucleotide exchange factor for small G-proteins of the Ras family, has been implicated in adhesion, cell polarity, and chemotaxis in Dictyostelium. Cells overexpressing GbpD are flat, exhibit strongly increased cell-substrate attachment, and extend many bifurcated and lateral pseudopodia. These cells overexpressing GbpD are severely impaired in chemotaxis, most likely due to the induction of many protrusions rather than an enhanced adhesion. The GbpD-overexpression phenotype is similar to that of cells overexpressing Rap1. Here we demonstrate that GbpD activates Rap1 both in vivo and in vitro but not any of the five other characterized Ras proteins. In a screen for Rap1 effectors, we overexpressed GbpD in several mutants defective in adhesion or cell polarity and identified Phg2 as Rap1 effector necessary for adhesion, but not cell polarity. Phg2, a serine/threonine-specific kinase, directly interacts with Rap1 via its Ras association domain. The regulation of cell polarity plays an important role in chemotaxis.

Phg2, a serine/threonine-specific kinase, directly interacts with Rap1 via its Ras association domain. Rap proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Rap was first identified as an antagonist of Ras-induced transformation and is capable of inhibiting multiple Ras signaling pathways by binding to downstream targets of Ras (1Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 2Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar); however, Rap has since been shown to act in numerous Rap-mediated signaling pathways. In mammalian cells Rap is involved in processes like adhesion, exocytosis, differentiation, and cell proliferation (3Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 4Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Small GTPases act as molecular switches in numerous signaling pathways. They switch between an active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound state. Ras activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: GEF, nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; REM, Ras exchange motif; RA, Ras association; RBD, Ras binding domain; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibition; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mGDP, 2′-3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine diphosphate; GppNHp, guanosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate; mGppNHp, 2′-3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate. that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating the Ras protein. The inactivation is catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate the intrinsic slow GTP hydrolysis by many orders of magnitude (5Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. Mccormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). In the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum Ras proteins are involved in a wide variety of processes, including cell movement, polarity, cytokinesis, chemotaxis, macropinocytosis, and multicellular development (6Chubb J.R. Insall R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1525: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Weeks G. Gaudet P. Insall R.H. Loomis W.F. Kuspa A. Dictyostelium Genomics.

During the vegetative state, Dictyostelium are single-celled amoebae that feed on bacteria. Upon starvation, cells undergo a tightly regulated developmental process in which they secrete and chemotax toward cAMP, resulting in multicellular fruiting bodies. Recently the assembly of the Dictyostelium genome was completed (9Eichinger L. Pachebat J.A. Glockner G. Rajandream M.A. Sucgang R. Berriman M. Song J. Olsen R. Szafranski K. Xu Q. Tunggal B.

Fisher P.R. Glockner G. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Insall R.H. Genome Biology. 2005; 6: R68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 5 of which have been characterized to some extent. RasGEFA, formerly referred to as AleA, and Ras-GEFfM have a role in chemotaxis, and RasGEFB is involved in endocytosis (11Insall R.H. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Arigoni M. Bracco E. Lusche D.F. Kae H. Weeks G. Bozzaro S. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Wilkins A. Chubb J.R. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two proteins, GbpC and GbpD (also referred to as RasGEFT and RasGEFU, respectively), that were identified in a screen for cGMP binding domains also contain CDC25 homology domains (14Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6749-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GbpC belongs to the family of ROC GTPases and has a unique domain architecture: it contains a GTPase domain, a kinase domain, a CDC25-homology domain, a Ras exchange motif (REM) domain, a GRAM domain, and two cyclic nucleotide binding (cNB) domains (15Bosgraaf L. van Haastert P.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1643: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Mutant studies showed that GbpC is the high affinity cGMP-binding protein involved in regulation of myosin II (16Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GbpD is homologous to the C-terminal half of GbpC and also contains a CDC25 homology domain, GRAM, and two cyclic nucleotide binding domains. Contrary to gbpC-null mutants, which show a strongly reduced chemotaxis, gbpD-null mutants display improved chemotaxis and appear hyperpolar because cells make very few lateral pseudopodia while still retaining the ability to remodel the leading edge. Overexpression of GbpD results in severely reduced chemotaxis as these cells extend many bifurcated and lateral pseudopodia, resulting in the absence of a leading edge. Furthermore, GbpD-overexpressing cells (GbpDOE) are flat and adhesive due to an increased number of substrate-attached pseudopodia (17Bosgraaf L. Waijer A. Engel R. Visser A.J.W.G. Wesseis D. Soll D. van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mutant cells, which have no detectable cAMP and cGMP, overexpression of GbpD still induces strong adhesion and loss of cell polarity, suggesting that the activity of GbpD is not dependent on intracellular cGMP or cAMP. In support of these data, radioactive cyclic nucleotide binding assays revealed no detectable binding of cAMP or cGMP to GbpD (16Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The flattened morphology and increased adhesion of the GbpD-overexpressing cells is similar to that of cells overexpressing Rap1, suggesting that both proteins function in the same pathway (18Rebstein P.J. Cardelli J. Weeks G. Spiegelman G.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this paper we show by in vivo pulldown assays and in vitro nucleotide exchange measurements that GbpD is a Rap-specific GEF involved in substrate attachment and cell polarity. So far, the Rap signaling pathway has not been characterized in Dictyostelium. To identify downstream targets of GbpD/Rap in Dictyostelium, GbpD was overexpressed in null mutants of genes involved in adhesion or cell polarity. Using this assay, Phg2 was identified as a Rap1 effector, essential for regulation of substrate attachment but not for cell polarity. Phg2 is a serine/threonine-specific kinase, previously identified in a screen for mutants defective in phagocytosis, that plays a role in phagocytosis, cellular adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organization, and motility (19Gebbie L. Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Froquet R. Cherix N. Malbouyres M. Lefkir Y. Grangeasse C. Fache S. Dalous J. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beside the kinase domain, Phg2 contains proline-rich repeats and a Ras association (RA)/Ras binding domain (RBD) (19Gebbie L. Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Froquet R. Cherix N. Malbouyres M. Lefkir Y. Grangeasse C. Fache S. Dalous J. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibition (GDI) measurements, we demonstrated a direct binding of Rap1 to the RA domain of Phg2. These results suggest that GbpD and Rap1 are upstream activators of Phg2 in cell adhesion. Although phg2-null mutants overexpressing GbpD lacked the strong cell-substratum attachment, they still displayed defects in chemotaxis, indicating that the involvement of GbpD in cell polarity is important for chemotaxis of migrating Dictyostelium cells. Cell Culture—AX3 (wild-type), DH1 (a uracil auxotroph wild type, kindly provided by Dr. Cosson), and the indicated mutant cell lines were grown in HG5 medium (14.3 g/liter peptone, 7.15 g/liter glucose, 0.49 g/liter KH2PO4, and 1.36 g/liter Na2HPO4·H2O) to a density of no more than 2 × 106 cells/ml. Depending on the antibiotic resistance cassette present in the plasmids, the medium was supplemented with 10 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml Blasticidin S (ICN), and/or 10 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Rap1S17N cells were grown in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml tetracycline (Roche Applied Science). The phg2-, talinA-, and myosin VII-null cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Cosson (19Gebbie L. Benghezal M. Cornillon S. Froquet R. Cherix N. Malbouyres M. Lefkir Y. Grangeasse C. Fache S. Dalous J. Bruckert F. Letourneur F. Cosson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids—For expression of GbpD in Dictyostelium, the previously described MB74 GbpD vector was used (17Bosgraaf L. Waijer A. Engel R. Visser A.J.W.G. Wesseis D. Soll D. van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the regulated expression of Rap1S17N, the previously described tetracycline-controlled inducible expression system was used (20Blaauw M. Linskens M.H.K. van Haastert P.J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Rap1 mutant was amplified from cDNA using the primers RapS17NF (5′-GGATCCAAAAATGCCTCTTAGAGAATTCAAAATCGTCGTTTTAGGTTCAGGTGGTGTAGGTAAAAATGCTTTG-3′) and RapRmut (5′-GCATGCTTACAATAAAGCACATTTTG-3′). Subsequently, the BamHI-SphI fragment was cloned into the BglII-SphI of the response plasmid MB38 (20Blaauw M. Linskens M.H.K. van Haastert P.J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Five μg of plasmid DNA was transfected in tet7 cells, which already contain the transactivator plasmid MB35 (20Blaauw M. Linskens M.H.K. van Haastert P.J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For expression and purification of the GEF domain of GbpD (amino acids 1–587), Phg2RA (amino acids 583–680), full-length RasG and the C-terminal-truncated RasC (amino acids 1–170), and Rap1 (amino acids 1–169) proteins, the encoding DNA fragments were cloned in pGEX-4T3 (GE Healthcare) leading to the corresponding N-terminal GST fusion proteins. The GEF domain was amplified using the forward primer (5′-TGGATCCGAAAAAATGACAGATTACCCATTC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GTTATCTAGACTGCAGTGATGATGTCTCTTCTCTAATC-3′) with MB74 GbpD as the template. The DNA fragment was subcloned in pGEM-T-Easy (Promega) and sequenced. Subsequently, the GbpD fragment was released and cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX-4T3 (GE Healthcare). The RA domain of Phg2 was amplified from cDNA with the forward primer (5′-GGATCCATGGTTCAACCAAAAGATATTATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTATTGTTGTTTATGTGTGAC-3′). The RasG gene was amplified from cDNA using the forward primer (5′-GAGG ATCCATGACAGAATACAAATTAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CAGCGGCCG CTTATAAAAGAGTACAAGC-3′). The C-terminal-truncated RasC was amplified from cDNA using the primers 5′-GGATCCATGTCAAAATTATTAAAATTAG-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTATCTTTTAATTTCTCTAACG-3′. The C-terminal-trun-cated Rap1 was amplified using the forward primer (5′-GGATCCAAAATGCCTCTTAGAGAATTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTAACGGTTGATTTGACGGATTAAG-3′) with genomic DNA as the template. The fragments were digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned in pGEX4T-3. The expression vectors were checked by sequencing. Protein Preparation—The GST fusion constructs were expressed in BL21(DE3)codonplus-RIL cells (Stratagene). The cells were grown in Standard I medium (Merck) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, induced at an A600 of 0.8 with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 25 °C. After protein production, the cells were pelleted (15 min, 4000 × g, 4 °C), washed in 0.9% NaCl, and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). To inhibit protein degradation, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. Cells were lysed in a microfluidizer (Microfluidizer Inc.), and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I was added. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (45 min, 100,000 × g at 4 °C), and fusion proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose (GSH) affinity column (GE Healthcare). RasG and the C-trun-cated RasC and Rap1 proteins were eluted from the column as GST fusion proteins in lysis buffer containing 20 mm glutathione. For GbpDGEF, the GST tag was cleaved on the column using 200 units of thrombin (SERVA) followed by elution of the protein in lysis buffer. Isolated proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—For the in vitro measurement of GEF activity, the GTP-binding proteins were loaded with the fluorescent GDP analogue mGDP by incubation in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and a 20-fold excess of mGDP for 2 h at room temperature (21Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghoffer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mGDP-loaded GTPases were incubated at 25 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol) containing a 200-fold excess of unlabeled GDP, with the indicated amounts of GEF protein. The nucleotide exchange activity was measured in real time as decay in fluorescence using a Spex1 spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries), with excitation and emission wavelength of 366 and 450 nm, respectively. The obtained data were fitted to a single exponential decay using the program Grafit (Erithacus software). GDI Measurements (Assay)—For the GDI measurements, Rap1 was loaded with mGppNHp by incubating in ammonium sulfate buffer (200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol, 10 μm ZnCl2, pH 7.6) containing alkaline phosphatase (2 units/mg Rap1 protein) and a 1.5 m excess of the fluorescence GTP analogue mGppNHp (22John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The protein-nucleotide complex was separated from unbound nucleotides by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 16/20, GE Healthcare). The affinity between Phg2-RA and Rap1 was determined using the inhibition of the mGppNHp release from Rap1 as described (23Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Shortly, 200 nm mGppNHp-loaded Rap1 in the presence of varying concentrations of Phg2-RA and a 200-fold excess of unlabeled GppNHp was incubated in assay buffer at 25 °C. The decay in fluorescence was measured in a Spex1 spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 450 nm, respectively. The observed rate constants (kobs) were single exponential-fitted using the program Grafit (Erithacus software). The dependence of the observed rate constants on the effector concentration was fitted to yield the dissociation constant (Kd) as described (23Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). RBD Pulldown Assay—The assay was performed as described previously (24Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown by shaking in HL5 media supplemented with 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in KK2 (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.1), and lysed after mixing with an equal volume of 2× HK-LB (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, with two tablets of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science Complete) added per 50 ml of buffer). Lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Dictyostelium lysates (800 μg of protein) were incubated with 100μg of GST-RBD protein coupled to GSH beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed 3 times in 1× HK-LB. 40 μl of 1 × SDS gel loading buffer (0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 12.5% glycerol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue) was added to the pelleted beads, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked with nonfat milk, and probed with either RasC (25Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or RasG (26Khosla M. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4156-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) antibody. The amounts of bound RasC and RasG were determined by an ECL (Amersham Biosciences) reaction. Adhesion Assay—To quantify cell adhesion to the surface, we used a previously published protocol (27Fey P. Stephens S. Titus M.A. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, cells were grown in HG-5 medium on 6-well plates (Nunc) to a maximum of 70% confluence. The medium was replaced and incubated for 1 h. Then, plates were rotated on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm, and after 1 h a sample of 150 μl of the medium was taken. The remaining medium was removed and replenished with fresh HG-5, and the remaining adhering cells were detached by repeated pipetting. The number of cells in the two samples was determined in triplicate using a hemocytometer. The amount of loose cells in the first sample was divided by the total number of cells (first plus second sample) to yield the percentage of loose cells. Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis toward cAMP was tested using micropipettes filled with 10–4 m cAMP applied to a field of aggregation competent cells with an Eppendorf femtotip at a pressure of 25 hectopascals. Cells were starved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (PB) for 6–8 h, resuspended in PB, and monitored by phase contrast microscopy. The motile behavior of cells in spatial gradients of cAMP was analyzed using computer-assisted methods previously described (28Soll D.R. Comput. Med. Imaging Graph. 1999; 23: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, images were recorded every 10 s for a period of 15 min. The contour of the cells and position of the cell centroids were determined at 1-min intervals for DH1 and phg2– and at 3-min intervals for DH1/GbpDOE and phg2–/GbpDOE. GbpD Is a Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor for Rap1—GbpD contains a CDC25 homology domain and a REM and is, therefore, predicted to possess guanine nucleotide exchange activity on members of the Ras subfamily of GTPases (14Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6749-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fourteen Ras subfamily proteins have been identified in the Dictyostelium genome, an unusually large number (7Weeks G. Gaudet P. Insall R.H. Loomis W.F. Kuspa A. Dictyostelium Genomics. Horizon Bioscience, Norfolk, UK2005: 173-210Google Scholar). Thus far, six Ras subfamily members have been characterized, and they all appear to have important roles in cell physiology (6Chubb J.R.

RasC and RasG are the best characterized Dictyostelium Ras proteins, and both are activated in response to cAMP (24Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RasG regulates cell motility and the cytoskeleton during vegetative state (29Tuxworth R.I. Cheetham J.L. Machesky L.M. Spiegelmann G.B. Weeks G. Insall R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and both RasC and RasG are involved in regulation of the cAMP relay and cAMP-dependent chemotaxis (25Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 4P. Bolourani, unpublished observation. RasB is linked to the progression through the cell cycle (30Sutherland B.W. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and RasD is involved in both phototaxis and thermotaxis (31Wilkins A. Khosla M. Fraser D.J. Spiegelman G.B. Fisher P.R. Weeks G. Insall R.H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1407-1413PubMed Google Scholar), whereas RasS is involved in endocytosis and the regulation of cell motility (32Chubb J.R. Wilkins A. Wessels D.J. Soll D.R. Insall R.H. Comput. Med. Imaging Graph. 2002; 53: 150-162Google Scholar). The only thus far characterized Rap subfamily member, Rap1, is essential in Dictyostelium and involved in proliferation, growth, adhesion, and regulation of the cytoskeleton (18Rebstein P.J. Cardelli J. Weeks G. Spiegelman G.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Kang R.J. Kae H. Ip H. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3675-3682Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Seastone D.J. Zhang L.Y. Buczynski G. Rebstein P. Weeks G. Spiegelman G. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To characterize the specificity of GbpD, we determined GDP/GTP exchange activity on the six characterized Ras subfamily members using in vitro fluorescence exchange measurements. For these experiments, the catalytic GEF domain of GbpD was expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated as a 66-kDa protein (data not shown). The Ras proteins (RasB, -C, -D, -G, and -S) and Rap1 were isolated from E. coli as C-terminal-truncated proteins. C-terminal-truncated Ras proteins possess the same biochemical and structural properties as the full-length protein but are much more stable than the full-length proteins (22John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The Ras and Rap proteins were loaded with the fluorescent GDP analogue mGDP and incubated in the presence of excess GDP. Nucleotide exchange was measured in real time as a decay in fluorescence, caused by the release of mGDP, which shows a higher fluorescence intensity when bound in the hydrophobic environment of Rap than in the buffer solution. To control for the stability and folding of the purified Dictyostelium Ras and Rap proteins, the human Ras-specific GEF CDC25 and the highly active Rap-specific GEF C3G were used as controls. As expected, the GDP exchange activity of Dictyostelium Rap1 was enhanced by C3G, but not by CDC25, and exchange activity of RasC and RasG was enhanced by CDC25 but not by C3G (Fig. 1), indicating that the purified proteins are stable and functional. The slower decay of fluorescence of RasC compared with RasG may be due to the lower degree of homology to human Ras that RasC exhibits and, thus, is less sensitive to activation by human CDC25 (6Chubb J.R. Insall R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1525: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The addition of GbpDGEF to mGDP-loaded Rap1 resulted in a rapid decrease in fluorescence and, hence, acceleration of mGDP exchange (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1, B and C, show that the addition of GbpDGEF to mGDP-loaded RasG and RasC did not result in a decrease in fluorescence. GbpD was also unable to accelerate nucleotide exchange on RasB, RasD, or RasS, which were activated by human CDC25 (supplemental data). These results suggest that GbpD specifically activates Rap1 in vitro and not RasB, -C, -D, -G, and -S. It was previously shown that the RBD of human RalGDS can be effectively used to detect the amount of activated Dictyostelium Rap1 in vivo (33Kang R.J. Kae H. Ip H. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3675-3682Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Kae et al. (24Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) described a similar method in which they used the RBD of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Byr2 to detect the amount of GTP loaded RasC and RasG (24Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To further determine the activity and specificity of GbpD, the amount of activated Ras proteins in wild type AX3 cells, in gbpD-null cells, and in GbpDOE cells was determined. The amount of Rap1-GTP is significantly higher in GbpDOE mutant cells than in wild type and gbpD-null cells, whereas the total amount of Rap1 is similar in all three cell lines (Fig. 2). Seastone et al. (34Seastone D.J. Zhang L.Y. Buczynski G. Rebstein P. Weeks G. Spiegelman G. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have previously shown that modest overexpression of Rap1 results already in the described strong phenotype. These data support the in vitro data and suggest that GbpD acts as a RapGEF in vivo. The GST-Byr2 pulldowns, analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against RasC and RasG, showed similar amounts of activated RasG in all 3 cell lines, but reproducibly, an increased amount of GTP-RasC was detected in GbpDOE cells (Fig. 2). Because GbpD is not able to activate RasC in vitro, the increased activation of RasC seen in vivo may be due to an indirect effect. Rap1 Mediates GbpD-induced Adhesion and Pseudopodia Formation—The pulldown assays revealed that Rap1 and possibly RasC are potential targets of GbpD in vivo. To investigate the possible role of RasC in the GbpDOE phenotype, we overexpressed GbpD in rasC-null cells. The rasC–/GbpDOE mutant possessed the characteristic GbpDOE phenotype, a strong increased attachment to the substratum (Fig. 3C) and a very flat cell morphology (Fig. 3A), indicating that RasC is not essential for mediating the effect of GbpD. To investigate if Rap1 indeed mediates the GbpD-induced adhesion and pseudopodia format"
https://openalex.org/W2122510978,"The new glutathione S-transferase inhibitor 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX) is cytotoxic toward P-glycoprotein-overexpressing tumor cell lines, i.e. CEM-VBL10, CEM-VBL100, and U-2 OS/DX580. The mechanism of cell death triggered by NBDHEX has been deeply investigated in leukemia cell lines. Kinetic data indicate a similar NBDHEX membrane permeability between multidrug resistance cells and their sensitive counterpart revealing that NBDHEX is not a substrate of the P-glycoprotein export pump. Unexpectedly, this molecule promotes a caspase-dependent apoptosis that is unusual in the P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cells. The primary event of the apoptotic pathway is the dissociation of glutathione S-transferase P1-1 from the complex with c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Interestingly, leukemia MDR1-expressing cells show lower LC50 values and a higher degree of apoptosis and caspase-3 activity than their drug-sensitive counterparts. The increased susceptibility of the multidrug resistance cells toward the NBDHEX action may be related to a lower content of glutathione S-transferase P1-1. Given the low toxicity of NBDHEX in vivo, this compound may represent an attractive basis for the selective treatment of MDR1 P-glycoprotein-positive tumors.

Given the low toxicity of NBDHEX in vivo, this compound may represent an attractive basis for the selective treatment of MDR1 P-glycoprotein-positive tumors. The development of resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs is a common clinical problem that limits the therapeutic potential of anticancer drugs in clinical oncology. This complex phenomenon, known as multidrug resistance (MDR), 2The abbreviations used are: MDR, multidrug resistance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NBDHEX, 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; VBL, vinblastine; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is often associated with the overexpression of MDR1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the plasma membrane of tumor cells (1Ling V. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: S3-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). This 170-kDa glycoprotein utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport a wide range of compounds and drugs across membranes out of the cytosol thereby reducing their intracellular bioavailability and hence their toxicity (2Borst P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In humans, MDR1 gene overexpression causes cancer cells to become resistant to a variety of anticancer drugs, including vinblastine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and teniposide as well as many other cytotoxic agents (3Germann U.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 927-944Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This low specificity represents the major problem in the development of new drugs directed against tumor cells showing an intrinsic or acquired MDR phenotype. We have recently designed and synthesized new 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole derivatives characterized by strong cytotoxic activity toward several cancer cell lines (LC50 about 1 μm) and low toxicity in mice (up to 125 mg/kg) (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Among them, NBDHEX is characterized by the presence of a thioether bridge connecting the benzoxadiazole ring with an aliphatic chain (5Ricci G. De Maria F. Antonini G. Turella P. Bullo A. Stella L.

This compound is an efficient inhibitor of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a family of enzymes also involved in the cancer drug resistance phenomenon (6Townsend D.M. Tew K.D.

Specifically, the isoenzyme GSTP1-1 forms a heterocomplex with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that efficiently inhibits the stress-signaling cascade mediated by JNK (8Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 9Wang T. Arifoglu P.

Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M.

In this study we investigated the NBDHEX-mediated cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines overexpressing the MDR1 P-gp export pump. Our data show that NBDHEX is not a substrate of this ABC transporter, and both parental tumor cells (CCRF-CEM and U-2 OS) and their selected P-gp overexpressing variants (CEM-VBL10, CEM-VBL100, and U-2 OS/DX580) are efficiently committed to death by this molecule. These findings indicate that NBDHEX may be a novel and very effective compound in selectively killing tumor cells and their chemo-resistant variants showing an intrinsic or acquired MDR phenotype. Cells and Their MDR Phenotype—For this study we used the following human cell lines: human acute T-lymphoblastoid leukemia CCRF-CEM, human osteosarcoma U-2 OS and their P-gp overexpressing variants, CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100, which show different relative resistance levels to vinblastine (CEM-VBL10 <104 and CEM-VBL100 >106 P-gp molecules per cell) (10Cianfriglia M.

All cell lines were cultured using RPMI 1640 medium enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Adherent cells (U-2 OS and U-2 OS/DX580) were detached from a flask using trypsin. All components were purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Periodically, MDR-expressing cells were selected by routine administration of vinblastine sulfate (VBL) (Lilly) at the final concentration of 11 nm (10 ng/ml) and 110 nm (100 ng/ml) for CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100 cells, respectively, or with 1 μm doxorubicin (Sigma) for U-2 OS/DX580 cells. The cells were also typed (every 2-3 weeks) for P-gp expression. Briefly, living/intact CCRF-CEM and U-2 OS cell lines and their MDR variants were stained with the monoclonal antibody to MDR1 (MM4.17 directed to extracellular P-gp domain (13Cianfriglia M.

Cell Treatments—Treatments were performed on cells cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml. NBDHEX was synthesized as reported by Ricci et al. (5Ricci G. De Maria F. Antonini G. Turella P. Bullo A. Stella L.

Stock solutions of this compound were prepared in Me2SO and diluted to the appropriate concentration in RPMI 1640 cell medium just before use. The cytotoxic drug doxorubicin was used at 17 μm final concentration. Treatments with the cell-permeable JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) were performed at a final concentration of 20 μm, because lower concentrations did not show significant inhibition and higher concentrations were toxic. Treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Vinci-Biochem, Florence, Italy) was performed at a concentration of 40 μm. The P-gp inhibitor verapamil (Abbott) was used at concentration of 5 μm. All the inhibitors were added 1 h before the drug (NBDHEX or doxorubicin) treatment and maintained throughout the experiment. Analysis of Cell Viability and Apoptosis—The NBDHEX cytotoxicity was determined in all cell lines by the sulforhodamine B assay (Sigma) (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F.

The NBDHEX-induced apoptosis was measured after cell staining with the DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) and analysis of nuclear fragmentation with a fluorescence microscope. Intracellular Localization of NBDHEX—NBDHEX localization was evaluated by taking advantage of its intrinsic fluorescence (5Ricci G. De Maria F. Antonini G. Turella P. Bullo A. Stella L. Filomeni G. Federici G. Caccuri A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26397-26405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). U-2 OS/DX580 cells, grown on WillCo-dishes® (WillCo Wells B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for 24 h, were incubated with 25 μm NBDHEX, the lowest concentration that allowed intracellular drug detection. At different times of incubation, cells were observed under living conditions by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Both untreated and NBDHEX treated U-2 OS/DX580 cells were also specifically stained for vacuoles with acridine orange (Sigma) as reported previously (14Nilsson E. Ghassemifar R. Brunk U.T. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The observations were carried out with a Leica TCS SP2 spectral confocal microscope; NBDHEX was excited with a 488 nm argon laser line, and emission lines were collected after passage through a DD 488/543 filter in a spectral window ranging from 520 to 550 nm. The acridine orange was excited at 488 nm; the emitted green light (515-565 nm) and red light (>590 nm) were simultaneously registered in sequential double fluorescence mode after passage through the DD 488/543 filter. Inhibition of P-gp Function—CEM-VBL10, CEM-VBL100, U-2 OS/DX580, and their parental cell lines were treated with either 10 μm NBDHEX or 17 μm doxorubicin for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the P-gp inhibitor verapamil (5 μm). The cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in drug-free medium, in the presence or in the absence of verapamil. After 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and analyzed by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to evaluate either NBDHEX or doxorubicin intracellular retention. Kinetics of NBDHEX Uptake and Release in Leukemia Cell Lines—CCRF-CEM, CEM-VBL10, and CEM-VBL100 cells were incubated with either 2 or 10 μm NBDHEX at 37 °C. To measure the drug uptake at different incubation times, aliquots of cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. To determine the rate of release, cells were incubated with NBDHEX for 1 h at 37°C, washed, and resuspended in drug-free medium. At different time points aliquots of cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and analyzed for the drug content by flow cytometry. To determine the induction of apoptosis at different times of NBDHEX exposure, at the indicated times aliquots of either CEM-VBL100 or CCRF-CEM cells were washed and cultured in drug-free medium; the degree of apoptosis was determined after 9 and 24 h, respectively. Western Blot Analyses of Leukemia Cell Lines—CCRF-CEM, CEM-VBL10, and CEM-VBL100 cells were treated with 2 μm NBDHEX. At each time point analyzed, the cell pellets were lysed for Western blot analyses as described previously (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R.

Mitochondria- and cytosol-enriched fractions were obtained as described previously (15Filomeni G. Aquilano K. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. Antiox. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 10 and 20 μg of proteins from mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, were loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Polyclonal anti-Bax (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (1:2,000; Pharmingen) were used as primary antibodies. Mitochondrial Hsp60, used as loading and extraction control, was recognized by a monoclonal anti-Hsp60 (1:5,000; Stressgen, Victoria, Canada). The specific protein complex formed upon appropriate secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) treatment (1:10,000) was identified using Fluorchem Imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) after incubation with ChemiGlow chemiluminescence substrate (Alpha Innotech). Enzyme Activities in Leukemia Cell Lines—GST and caspase-3 activities were measured as described previously (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). NBDHEX Induces Cell Death in P-gp Overexpressing Cells—NBDHEX, a compound that induces cell death in several nonresistant tumor cell lines (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), is also cytotoxic toward the P-gp overexpressing cells. In particular, NBDHEX shows LC50 values in the micromolar or even nanomolar range for U-2 OS/DX580, CEM-VBL10, and CEM-VBL100 cell lines (see Table 1), independently of the acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. This suggests that NBDHEX is able to circumvent the drug resistance associated with the overexpression of the P-gp export pump. Actually, NBDHEX appears to commit the MDR cell lines to death even more efficiently than the corresponding sensitive cell lines as suggested by the slight but significant increased cytotoxicity observed with the CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100 cells compared with the parental cell line (Table 1).TABLE 1Cytotoxicity effect of NBDHEXCell linesCCRF-CEMCEM-VBL10CEM-VBL100U-2 OSU-2 OS/DX580LC50 (μM)0.33 ± 0.030.25 ± 0.01*0.19 ± 0.01**1.16 ± 0.181.65 ± 0.23 Open table in a new tab Intracellular Localization of NBDHEX—To clarify the NBDHEX mechanism, the intracellular localization of this drug was investigated in the adherent osteosarcoma U-2 OS/DX580 cell line overexpressing P-gp by the laser scanning confocal microscopy technique. After 5 min of treatment with 25 μm NBDHEX the inherent fluorescence of this compound was detected almost exclusively in the cytoplasm of the cells, whereas nuclei appeared completely negative (Fig. 1, panel A). This picture did not change after 45, 60, or 120 min of incubation in the presence of the drug, and only a weak signal was detectable in the nuclear matrix (Fig. 1, panel A). At 300 min of treatment some cells showed cytoplasmic vacuoles lacking in signal (Fig. 1, panel A arrowheads) and have faintly fluorescent nuclei (arrows). The observed vacuolation of the cytoplasm could be ascribed to morphological alterations associated with the apoptotic mechanism of damage (16Dai D.J. Lu C.D. Lai R.Y. Guo J.M. Meng H. Chen W.S. Gu J. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, the analysis of U-2 OS/DX580 cells treated with 25 μm NBDHEX for 300 min and stained with acridine orange demonstrated that the vacuolation was concomitant with the condensation and marginalization of the chromatin (data not shown). P-gp Does Not Affect the NBDHEX Efflux—P-gp molecules are undetectable on the parental drug-sensitive cells, although their number progressively increases in MDR variants (11Cenciarelli C. Currier S.J. Willingham M.C. Thiebaut F. Germann U.A. Rutherford A.V. Gottesman M.M. Barca S. Tombesi M. Morrone S. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the transmembrane regions of this protein are rich in highly conserved aromatic amino acids residues (17Pawagi A.B. Wang J. Silverman M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), NBDHEX could fall within the wide range of nonpolar compounds recognized as substrates by this ABC transporter. Moreover, P-gp binds its substrates via hydrogen bond formation (18Seelig A. Blatter X.L. Wohnsland F. Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 38: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Seelig A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and oxygen and nitrogen atoms present in the NBDHEX structure are potential hydrogen-bonding acceptors. To clarify if NBD-HEX efflux could be mediated by P-gp, we performed efflux experiments in the presence of verapamil. This drug is known to inhibit the P-gp export pump inducing intracellular accumulation of P-gp substrates such as doxorubicin (20Tsuruo T. Iida H. Tsukagoshi S. Sakurai Y. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2267-2272PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, verapamil inhibited doxorubicin efflux in both U-2 OS/DX580 and CEM-VBL100 cells (see Fig. 1, panel B, and Fig. 2, panel D, respectively), although it did not affect the intracellular concentration of doxorubicin in the sensitive variants (Fig. 2, panel B). Conversely, verapamil did not affect the intracellular concentration of NBDHEX in resistant and sensitive cell lines (see Fig. 1, panel B, and Fig. 2, panels A and C). These findings could be consistent with the fact that either NBDHEX is not a substrate for the P-gp export pump or a very fast inward diffusion kinetics of NBDHEX overcomes the P-gp-mediated efflux. Kinetics of NBDHEX Uptake and Efflux in Leukemia Cell Lines—To clarify this question, we determined the drug uptake and release kinetics in both sensitive and resistant leukemia cell lines. NBDHEX uptake data fit well to a first order equation that fulfills a half-time value of about 2.9 min with CCRF-CEM cells (see Fig. 3, panel A, with 2 and 10 μm NBDHEX concentrations). A comparable value (about 3.5 min) was found for the MDR variant CEM-VBL100 (Fig. 3, panel B, with 2 and 10 μm NBDHEX concentrations). It follows that the intracellular equilibrium concentration is reached after only 15-30 min of NBDHEX treatment in both sensitive and P-gp overexpressing cell lines. Moreover, the drug efflux is slow in all tested cell lines and follows a first order kinetics, with t½ values of about 50-60 min, with both 2 and 10 μm NBDHEX (Fig. 3, panels C and D, for CCRF-CEM and CEM-VBL100, respectively). Overall, these experiments show no differences in the NBDHEX drug uptake and efflux kinetics between P-gp overexpressing cell lines and their sensitive counterpart. As expected, the intracellular NBD-HEX concentration measured at equilibrium is very similar in both sensitive and MDR cell lines suggesting that NBDHEX is not transported by the pump but crosses the plasma membrane by passive diffusion. An important consequence of the discrepancy between the rates of drug uptake and release is that NBDHEX accumulates inside the cells up to a concentration at least 1 order of magnitude higher than that present in the medium. In other words, when NBDHEX is present at 0.3 μm concentration in the medium (corresponding to the LC50 value found for this drug in leukemia cells), the intracellular concentration should be about 3 μm. In addition, the kinetics of NBDHEX uptake has been correlated to the apoptotic event by evaluating the degree of apoptosis induced by different amounts of NBDHEX diffused in the cytoplasm. It is evident from Fig. 3 (panels A and B, insets) that NBDHEX uptake kinetics parallel the degree of apoptosis showing a direct and dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of NBDHEX even at low intracellular concentrations. NBDHEX Induces a Caspase-dependent Apoptosis—It is well known that P-gp overexpression confers resistance to a wide range of caspase-dependent apoptotic agents not only by removing drugs from the cell but also by inhibiting the activation of proteases involved in apoptotic signaling (21Johnstone R.W. Cretney E. Smyth M.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only a few drugs are reported to overcome the MDR phenotype induced by this ABC transporter, and most of them are molecules that induce cell death in a caspase-independent manner (22Ruefli A.A. Bernhard D. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Tainton K.M. Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 2378-2385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bielak-Zmijewska A. Koronkiewicz M. Skierski J. Piwocka K. Radziszewska E. Sikora E. Nutr. Cancer. 2000; 38: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We reported previously that NBDHEX induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was crucial to obtain evidence of the occurrence of a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway even in the P-gp overexpressing leukemia cells. After 3 h of NBDHEX treatment, caspase-3 activity was readily evident in the resistant cell lines, and its time course followed the increase of apoptotic cells number (Fig. 4, panel A). In addition, after 9 h of NBDHEX treatment, CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100 cell lines showed an apoptosis extent and caspase-3 activity 2- and 5-fold higher, respectively, than the parental CCRF-CEM cell line (Fig. 4, panel A). The caspase-dependent nature of the NBDHEX-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk which prevents cell death in both CCRF-CEM and in the P-gp overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 4, panel B). NBDHEX Induces Apoptosis via the Mitochondrial Pathway—Subsequently, we wanted to see if CCRF-CEM, and the drug-resistant variants CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100, activate the receptor-mediated (extrinsic) and/or the mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) apoptotic pathway upon NBDHEX treatment. Western blot analyses of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions after 4 h of NBDHEX treatment show that Bax accumulated into mitochondrial extract together with the release of cytochrome c within the cytosol. These phenomena were associated with the complete disappearance of the cytosolic Bax counterpart and with a drastic decrease of mitochondrial cytochrome c (Fig. 5, panel A). Although these events occurred in all the cell lines, the kinetics of translocation in/out the mitochondria seemed to be different as follows: slow in CCRF-CEM and very rapid in CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100. In fact, the mitochondrial amount of Bax almost disappeared in CEM-VBL100 after 8 h of treatment, at which time the extent of apoptotic cells was about 80-90% of the total population. The results obtained so far indicate the activation of the mitochondrial pathway as preferential route to trigger apoptosis upon NBDHEX treatment. To further confirm this issue, we determined by Western blot analyses the levels and the cleavage of both pro-caspase-8 and procaspase-9. Fig. 5 (panel B) shows that pro-caspase-8 was not affected by NBDHEX treatment because neither change in the expression level nor appearance of cleaved bands (data not shown) was observed. Concomitantly, a rapid and sustained activation of caspase-9 was observed, whereas the inactive pro-form of this enzyme completely disappeared in CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100. This trend was confirmed by Western blot analyses of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5, panel B); in fact, although present in all the cell lines examined, the intensity of the immunoreactive band of the caspase-3 active form was inversely related to vinblastine resistance supporting the evidence for high caspase activity measured in the NBDHEX-treated MDR cell lines (Fig. 4, panel A). NBDHEX Triggers JNK Activation—Recently we reported that NBDHEX triggers apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells by promoting the dissociation of GSTP1-1 from the GSTP1-1-JNK complex (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is located in the cytoplasm where NBDHEX was detected (see Fig. 1, panel A). To verify if this event occurred also in the MDR cells, we performed a comparative Western blot analysis of cells treated with 2 μm NBDHEX. Densitometric analysis shows a rapid and sustained increase of the phospho-active form of JNK up to 6 h of treatment in all cell lines tested and compared with the untreated control cells (Fig. 5, panel C). Actually, the JNK signal transduction pathway appears more efficiently activated in the MDR cell lines; we detected a 4-fold increase in the p-JNK levels after 3 h of incubation with NBDHEX in CCRF-CEM (p < 0.01; n = 4) and a 6-8-fold increase after 6 h of treatment in both CEM-VBL10 (p < 0.001; n = 3) and CEM-VBL100 (p < 0.001; n = 3) when compared with the untreated control cells. The crucial role played by JNK in the activation of the apoptotic signal is also confirmed by experiments carried out in the presence of the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 6). SP600125 protects both MDR cell lines and CCRF-CEM cells from apoptosis, in which activation of JNK is the early event of the apoptotic pathway triggered by NBDHEX (4Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). GST Activity Decreases in P-gp Overexpressing Leukemia Cells—Previous evidence shows an increase of JNK activation in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli in cells with a suppressed GSTP1-1 expression (8Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 26Ishisaki A. Hayashi H. Suzuki S. Ozawa K. Mizukoshi E. Miyakawa K. Suzuki M. Imamura T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked to see if the amount of GST in CCRF-CEM varied from that in the MDR cell lines. GST activity was 0.23 ± 0.05 units/mg in CCRF-CEM cells, 0.12 ± 0.03 in CEM-VBL10, and 0.14 ± 0.03 units/mg in CEM-VBL100. Thus, GST activity was found 2-fold decreased in the P-gp overexpressing cell lines compared with the parental cell line (n = 4, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 for CEM-VBL10 and CEM-VBL100, respectively). Overall, the present data support the idea that the decreased amount of GSTP1-1 measured in the P-gp overexpressing cells may account for the higher levels of the phospho-active form of JNK and for the greater susceptibility toward the NBDHEX action. Concluding Remarks—In this work we investigated the interaction of NBDHEX with tumor cell lines that developed a multidrug-resistant phenotype by overexpressing P-gp. This protein, besides its drug efflux activity, is known to protect tumor cells against a range of different stimuli that function by activating the caspase pathway. Notably, NBDHEX is able to overcome these drug-resistant mechanisms inducing cell death at submicromolar concentrations. NBDHEX kills MDR tumor cells following two independent strategies. First, NBDHEX is not recognized as a substrate by the P-gp export pump, and it accumulates inside the cells. Second, NBDHEX activates in the P-gp overexpressing cells a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway as observed in the parental cell line. These data are very peculiar because most of the few drugs that circumvent the P-gp system, such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, staurosporine, curcumin, and hexamethylene bisacetamide, induce a caspase-independent apoptosis (22Ruefli A.A.

Considering that the mitogen-activated protein kinases-mediated pathways are preferentially activated in transformed cells and that NBDHEX escapes recognition by the P-gp protein pump, this drug may represent an attractive basis for the selective treatment of tumors."

Two major PGHS isoforms, with distinct pathophysiological functions and catalytic regulation, have been characterized in mammals; a functionally homologous PGHS isoform pair has been cloned from an evolutionarily distant vertebrate, brook trout. The cyclooxygenase activities of recombinant brook trout PGHS-1 and -2 were characterized to test the generality of mammalian regulatory paradigms for substrate specificity, peroxide activation, and product shifting by aspirin. Both trout cyclooxygenases had much more restrictive substrate specificities than their mammalian counterparts, with pronounced discrimination toward arachidonate (20:4n-6) and against eicosapentaenoate (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoate (22:6n-3), the latter two prominent in trout tissue lipids. Aspirin treatment did not increase lipoxygenase-type catalysis by either trout enzyme. Both trout enzymes had higher requirements for peroxide activator than their mammalian counterparts, though the preferential peroxide activation of PGHS-2 over PGHS-1 seen in mammals was conserved in the fish enzymes. The divergence in cyclooxygenase characteristics between the trout and mammalian PGHS proteins may reflect accomodations to differences among vertebrates in tissue lipid composition and general redox state."

https://openalex.org/W2037756223,"Human keratinocytes grown in co-culture with fibroblast feeder cells have an extended in vitro lifespan and delayed accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4a when compared to the same cells grown on tissue culture plastic alone. Previous studies have indicated that human keratinocytes can be immortalized by telomerase activity alone when grown in co-culture with feeder cells, suggesting that loss of the p16INK4a/Rb pathway is not required for immortalization. Using two independent human keratinocyte cell strains, we found that exogenous telomerase expression and co-culture with feeder cells results in efficient extension of lifespan without an apparent crisis. However, when these cells were transferred from the co-culture environment to plastic alone they experienced only a brief period of slowed growth before continuing to proliferate indefinitely. Examination of immortal cell lines demonstrated p16INK4a promoter methylation had occurred in both the absence and presence of feeder cells. Reintroduction of p16INK4a into immortal cell lines resulted in rapid growth arrest. Our results suggest that p16INK4a/Rb-induced telomere-independent senescence, although delayed in the presence of feeders, still provides a proliferation barrier to human keratinocytes in this culture system and that extended culture of telomerase-transduced keratinocytes on feeders can lead to the methylation of p16INK4a."
https://openalex.org/W2092415563,"Anticancer drugs can induce tumor cell death by caspase-dependent apoptosis. The observation that procaspase-10 expression decreased in leukemic cells from acute myeloblastic leukemia patients at first relapse led us to explore the role of caspase-10 in cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. We show that caspase-10 is activated in etoposide-treated cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A caspase-10 peptide inhibitor, a caspase-10 dominant-negative mutant or a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of the enzyme negatively interfere with drug-induced cell death and caspase-2, -3, -8 and -9 activation. The extrinsic pathway to apoptosis is not involved in drug-induced caspase-10 activation that occurs downstream of Bax redistribution to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from this organelle. siRNA-mediated downregulation of Apaf-1 prevents etoposide-mediated activation of caspase-10. In a cell-free assay, cytochrome c and dATP treatment of cell extracts after immunodepletion of either caspase-3 or caspase-9 indicates that caspase-10 is activated downstream of caspase-9. Then, caspase-10 is involved in a feedback amplification loop that amplifies caspase-9 and -3 activities. Altogether, these data indicate an active role for caspase-10 in cytotoxic drug-induced tumor cell death, downstream of the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2065469276,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains the stability of chromosome ends and regulates replicative potential. Telomerase is upregulated in over 85% of human tumors, but not in adjacent normal tissues and represents a promising target for anticancer therapy. Most telomerase-based therapies rely on the inhibition of telomerase activity and require extensive telomere shortening before inducing any antiproliferative effect. Disturbances of telomere structure rather than length may be more effective in inducing cell death. Telomerase RNA subunits (hTRs) with mutations in the template region reconstitute active holoenzymes that incorporate mutated telomeric sequences. Here, we analysed the feasibility of an anticancer approach based on the combination of telomere destabilization and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. We show that a mutant template hTR dictates the synthesis of mutated telomeric repeats in telomerase-positive cancer cells, without significantly affecting their viability and proliferative ability. Nevertheless, the mutant hTR increased sensitivity to anticancer drugs in cells with different initial telomere lengths and mechanisms of telomere maintenance and without requiring overall telomere shortening. This report is the first to show that interfering with telomere structure maintenance in a telomerase-dependent manner may be used to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to anticancer drugs and may lead to the development of a general therapy for the treatment of human cancers."

The absence of the biotin biosynthesis pathway in humans suggests that it can be an attractive target for the development of novel drugs against a number of pathogens. 7-Keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA) synthase (EC 2.3.1.47), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in the biotin biosynthesis pathway, is believed to exhibit high substrate stereospecificity. A comparative kinetic characterization of the interaction of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> KAPA synthase with both l- and d-alanine was carried out to investigate the basis of the substrate stereospecificity exhibited by the enzyme. The formation of the external aldimine with d-alanine (<i>k</i> = 82.63 m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) is ∼5 times slower than that with l-alanine (<i>k</i> = 399.4 m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). In addition to formation of the external aldimine, formation of substrate quinonoid was also observed upon addition of pimeloyl-CoA to the preformed d-alanine external aldimine complex. However, the formation of this intermediate was extremely slow compared with the substrate quinonoid with l-alanine and pimeloyl-CoA (<i>k</i> = 16.9 × 10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Contrary to earlier reports, these results clearly show that d-alanine is not a competitive inhibitor but a substrate for the enzyme and thereby demonstrate the broad substrate stereospecificity of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> KAPA synthase. Further, d-KAPA, the product of the reaction utilizing d-alanine inhibits both KAPA synthase (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i> = 114.83 μm) as well as 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 43.9 μm), the next enzyme of the pathway."

ENK, a peptide neurotransmitter, displays precise cell-specific expression in the adult brain. AUF1 (also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D) has been known to regulate gene expression through altering the stability of AU-rich mRNAs. We show here that in the developing brain AUF1 proteins are expressed in a spatiotemporally defined manner, and p37 and p40/42 isoforms bind to an AT-rich double-stranded (ds) DNA element of the rat ENK (rENK) gene. This AT-rich dsDNA sequence acts as a cis-regulatory DNA element and is involved in regulating the cell-specific expression of the ENK gene in primary neuronal cultures. The AT-rich dsDNA elements are present at ∼2.5 kb 5′upstream of the rat, human, and mouse ENK genes. AUF1 proteins are shown here to provide direct interaction between these upstream AT-rich DNA sequences and the TATA region of the rENK gene. Double immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in the developing brain AUF1 proteins are expressed by proliferating neural progenitors and by differentiating neurons populating brain regions, which will not express the ENK gene in the adult, suggesting a repressor role for AUF1 proteins during enkephalinergic differentiation.

Double immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in the developing brain AUF1 proteins are expressed by proliferating neural progenitors and by differentiating neurons populating brain regions, which will not express the ENK gene in the adult, suggesting a repressor role for AUF1 proteins during enkephalinergic differentiation. Their subnuclear distribution and interactions with AT-rich DNA suggest that in the developing brain they can be involved in complex nuclear regulatory mechanisms controlling the development- and cell-specific expression of the ENK gene.

Many enkephalinergic neurons (i.e. express the ENK gene and use enkephalin peptides as neurotransmitters) are in the striatum (caudate putamen), and most of the other brain structures, such as cerebral cortex, are devoid of enkephalinergic neurons (1Paxinos G. Ashwell K.W. Törk I. Atlas of the Developing Rat Nervous System. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). This contrasting distribution is the result of the developmental process. ENK is a single copy gene encoding for preproenkephalin polypeptide, which is proteolytically cleaved, yielding four copies of Met-enkephalin and one copy of Leu-enkephalin peptides, which are endogenous ligands of opiate receptors (2Vaccarino A.L. Olson G.A. Olson R.D. Kastin A.J. Peptides. 1999; 20: 1527-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Enkephalins in the basal forebrain mediate social behavior, aggression, and reward and are implicated in mediating euphoric properties of drugs. The identity of neurons is established during neurodevelopment when multipotent progenitors differentiate into their various neurotransmitter phenotypes (3Agoston D.V. Dobi A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Enkephalinergic differentiation, the cell-specific expression of the ENK gene, i.e. in spiny projection neurons in the striatum, takes place between embryonic day 14 (E14) and postnatal day 2 (P2) in the rat (4Song D.D. Harlan R.E. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1994; 83: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is during this period when transcription factors that directly regulate the developmental expression of neurotransmitter genes, such as ENK, are specifically expressed. They bind to cis-regulatory DNA elements and regulate the expression of their target genes, such as ENK (5He X. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 183-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), by restricting its expression to specific subset of neurons. In mature ENK expressing/enkephalinergic neurons, ENK mRNA and ENK peptide levels can vary substantially in response to environmental/epigenetic signals (6Summers R.W. Wu X.R. Fitzgerald S.C. Brenneman D.E. von Agoston D. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 73: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 7Hyman S.E. Borsook D. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1996; 161: 59-71PubMed Google Scholar, 8Agoston D.V. Eiden L.E. Brenneman D.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Acting downstream from these signals there are ubiquitous transcription factors such as CRE, AP-2, NFκB, etc. that upon binding to their cis-regulatory DNA elements directly interact with the TATA complex (9Comb M.J. Kobierski L. Chu H.M. Tan Y. Borsook D. Herrup K. Hyman S.E. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1992; 126: 98-112PubMed Google Scholar). These cis-regulatory DNA elements are located within an ∼200-bp DNA stretch immediately upstream of TATA, which is also called the “proximal regulatory cassette” (PRC) (10Donovan D.M. Takemura M. O'Hara B.F. Brannock M.T. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The primary nucleic acid sequence of the PRC is extremely well conserved among man, rat, and mouse (9Comb M.J. Kobierski L. Chu H.M. Tan Y. Borsook D. Herrup K. Hyman S.E. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1992; 126: 98-112PubMed Google Scholar, 11Joshi J. Sabol S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Agoston D. Santha E. Shieh G. Lala R. Dobi A. DNA Seq. 1998; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although this region alone can control the rate of ENK gene transcription (7Hyman S.E. Borsook D. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1996; 161: 59-71PubMed Google Scholar, 10Donovan D.M. Takemura M. O'Hara B.F. Brannock M.T. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is insufficient to govern the precise developmental- and cell-specific expression of the ENK gene. However, an ∼2700-bp-long part of the rat ENK (rENK) gene, which includes the PRC, has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to govern correct cell-specific expression (3Agoston D.V. Dobi A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13Kaplitt M.G. Kwong A.D. Kleopoulos S.P. Mobbs C.V. Rabkin S.D. Pfaff D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brain Res. 1997; 52: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Regulation of the half-life of mRNAs has been emerging as an important control mechanism during development (15Brewer G. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Frequently, such regulation is mediated via AU-rich sequences, located at the 3′-untranslated region of mRNAs (16Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Proteins that bind these sequences include the AU-binding factor 1 (AUF1), also called hnRNP D (17Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). AUF1 has the characteristic domain structure that includes two RNA binding domains, oligomerization domain and a glycine-arginine-rich domain (19Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This domain structure is shared by many other hnRNP proteins (18Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has four isoforms, p37, p40, p42, and p45, that are the result of alternative splicing of exon 2 and exon 7 (20Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). AUF1 has also been described to participate in other regulatory mechanisms. For example, p40 has been shown to interact with the TATA-binding protein and can activate reporter gene expression in a cell culture model (23Tolnay M. Baranyi L. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AT-rich dsDNA elements, which constitute the core sequence of matrix- or scaffold attachment regions (MAR/SAR) (24Boulikas T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 279-388PubMed Google Scholar) and their binding proteins such as nucleolin (25Dickinson L.A. Kohwi S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and SATB1 (26Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), have been shown as key regulators of gene expression during cellular differentiation. Their molecular functions involve complex interactions with other nuclear regulatory proteins such as chromatin remodelers (27Liu J. Bramblett D. Zhu Q. Lozano M. Kobayashi R. Ross S.R. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5275-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Cai S. Han H.J. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Our systematic search for transcription factors that control rENK gene expression during neural differentiation (3Agoston D.V. Dobi A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Dobi A. Palkovits M. Ring M.A. Eitel A. Palkovits C.G. Lim F. Agoston D.V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has indicated that AUF1 is participating in this process. Here we show that AUF1 proteins are expressed by progenitors and differentiating neurons and regulate ENK gene expression in an AT-rich dsDNA-dependent manner. Isolation of Nuclear Proteins, DNA Probes—Microdissection of brain regions, isolation of nuclear proteins, and isolating and labeling DNA were carried out as published previously (29Dobi A. Palkovits M. Palkovits C.G. Ring M.A. Agoston D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the magnetic bead-based protein-DNA binding assay, the 5′ upstream region of the rENK gene from the pRESS1 vector (a kind gift of Dr. Steve Sabol) was either cleaved by restriction endonucleases or DNA fragments were generated by PCR using specific primers (Fig. 1). Fragments were radioactively labeled by [α-32P]dATP incorporation using Klenow polymerase and purified as described previously (29Dobi A. Palkovits M. Palkovits C.G. Ring M.A. Agoston D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The original ∼700-bp-long fragment h was subcloned, and the resulting fragments (h2-3) were radioactively labeled as above and tested for binding by EMSA (see below). Protein-mediated DNA-DNA Interaction (PMDDI) Assay— The assay is based on biomagnetic separation technology using streptavidin-coated superparamagnetic beads (Dynal Corp., Oslo, Norway). The procedure is illustrated by the flowchart in Fig. 2. The isolated (proximal) DNA fragment a, representing the TATA region of the rENK gene, was filled in at the EcoRI site with biotinylated dATP and dNTP. The biotinylated fragment was then conjugated to M-280 streptavidin-coupled paramagnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Corp.). Conjugated beads were washed three times with 200 μl of buffer containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol and stored at 4 °C. In our experience, conjugated beads can be stored up to 4 weeks at 4 °C. Distal DNA fragments representing the entire 5′ regulatory region of the rENK gene were generated and labeled as above. For the PMDDI assay, 0.1 pmol of the magnetic bead-conjugated fragment a was mixed with 2 μg of nuclear extracts isolated from various brain regions at various ages (14Dobi A. Palkovits M. Ring M.A. Eitel A. Palkovits C.G. Lim F. Agoston D.V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 5 fmol of radioactively labeled (distal) DNA fragments (a through k) in 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. To block nonspecific binding, the mixture contained 0.2 μg per μl of poly[d(I-C)] and 0.1% BSA. Protease activities were blocked by including 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg per μl of leupeptin, 10 μg per μl of aprotinin in the binding mixture. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min under constant gentle mixing. The binding was terminated by magnetic separation, and the beads were washed three times in 100 μl of 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin. The washed beads were resuspended in 10 μl of buffer and transferred to 3MM Whatman filter paper and dried, and radioactivity was quantified by using a PhosphorImager. EMSA—The 5′ upstream region of the rENK gene from the pRESS1 vector (a kind gift of Dr. Steve Sabol) was either cleaved by restriction endonucleases or DNA fragments were generated by PCR using specific primers as above. The fragments were radioactively labeled as described earlier (29Dobi A. Palkovits M. Palkovits C.G. Ring M.A. Agoston D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragment h (-2,067; -2,823BssHII-BamHI) was subcloned, and the resulting 500- and 300-nucleotide-long fragments (h2 and h3, respectively) were radioactively labeled as above and tested for binding by EMSA. In the competition assay, unlabeled DNA fragments were used as above in 100× excess prior to the addition of the nuclear extract (“head-to-head” competition). The AT-rich regions of mouse (mATENK, -3150 -30622; GenBank™ accession number U20894) and human ENK (hATENK, -3980 -3901 sequence information was provided by Dr. Hyman) genes were chemically synthesized, radioactively labeled, and annealed as described (29Dobi A. Palkovits M. Palkovits C.G. Ring M.A. Agoston D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift assay, 1 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-AUF1 antibodies (kind gifts of Drs. Brewer and Tolnay) or rabbit preimmune serum and a control antibody (rabbit anti-EGFR;, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Antibodies were mixed with 2 μg of nuclear extracts or with 1 ng of recombinant AUF1 protein, in the presence of 0.1 μg per μl of poly[d(I-C)] in the binding reaction buffer described for EMSA. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, and radioactively labeled double-stranded rATENK or rATENKmut probes were then added, and the mixture was further incubated for 10 min on ice and analyzed using an agarose thin layer gel system (30Dobi A. Debnam W. Dalgard C. Owusu A. von Agoston D. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). UV and Chemical Cross-linking—The rATENK DNA sequence was labeled by filling in radioactive nucleotides. For the binding reaction 10 fmol of radioactively labeled probe was mixed with 2 μg of nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of distamycin and 0.1 μg per μl of poly[d(I-C)] in 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol in a total volume of 10 μl, and the binding reaction was incubated at 0 °C for 10 min. Then the mixture was exposed to UV irradiation in a UV Stratalinker 1800 cross-linker, using the AutoCross Link program according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After UV irradiation, 2 units of DNase I (Worthington) was added to the reaction mixture, and the cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 22 °C. The proteins were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% MOPS SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with molecular weight markers according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The gel was transferred by vacuum onto 3MM filter paper and was subjected to autoradiography. DNase I Footprinting—Fragment h was cleaved by HindHIII digest, and the resulting fragment (h2) was further digested by AflII and StuI. The ∼300-bp-long subfragment (h3) was subcloned into pUC19 plasmid. The insert containing the rATENK sequence was asymmetrically labeled by filling in the AflII site with radioactive nucleotides. Footprinting was performed as described earlier (14Dobi A. Palkovits M. Ring M.A. Eitel A. Palkovits C.G. Lim F. Agoston D.V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the footprint reaction, 10,000 cpm/μl of radioactively labeled probe was mixed with 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] and 3 μg of nuclear extracts. The mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min, and then the reaction mixture was transferred to 22 °C for 2 min. After the incubation, 0.5 units of DNase I enzyme (Worthington) was added to the mixture in 1 μl, and the cleavage was allowed to proceed for 1 min at room temperature. In DNase I titration reactions 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 units of DNase I were added to the DNA without the addition of nuclear extracts (naked DNA). After the 1-min incubation 10 μg of counter-transcribed RNA was added to the reaction mixture in 1 μl immediately followed by the addition of 50 μl of DNase I stop solution (Stratagene). The reaction mixture was precipitated, washed by ethanol, dried, and dissolved in water to 3000 cpm per μl concentration. Nine thousand cpm of the DNase I-digested fragments were separated on each lane of a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. As marker, G-reaction ladder was generated by using a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (data not shown). DAPSTER Assay—The assay was performed as described previously with minor modification (31Kumar N.V. Bernstein L.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 299: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as published previously (29Dobi A. Palkovits M. Palkovits C.G. Ring M.A. Agoston D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty μg of nuclear extract was precleared with 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) washed in buffer Z (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Igepal, 0.1 m KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μm ZnCl2). After separation by centrifuging, 75 pmol of competitor ds- or ssDNA or an equal volume of 1× kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) was added in the presence of 0.1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)], 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and incubated under gentle rotation for 15 min at 4 °C. 5 pmol of biotinylated ds- or ssDNA, rATENK or rATENKmut, were added to the recovered nuclear extract and mixed by gentle rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. (See sequences in Table 1.) Thirty μl of washed streptavidin-agarose bead slurry was added, and the suspension was further incubated by gently rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged briefly, and the pelleted beads were washed three times in buffer Z, and beads were boiled in the presence of lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions. The bound proteins were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting (Invitrogen) followed by incubating the membranes with various primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). The membranes were stripped using the Restore Western blot stripping mixture (Pierce) and reprobed with anti-actin antibody (Sigma) as described above.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences used in PMDDI, UV cross-linking, EMSA, DAPSTER, or chromatin immunoprecipitation assaysNameSequence 5′–3′rATENK-FGAA CCA AAA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATA ATT AAC CATrATENK-RATG GTT AAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TAT TTT TGG TTCrATENKMut-FGAA CTG TTC TTA CTA TCG CCA TCA CCG TTA TTG CTC AAT TCG TAC TAG TTC ATG AAG TCT TTG GrATENKmut-RCCA AAG ACT TCA TGA ACT AGT ACG AAT TGA GCA ATA ACG GTG ATG GCG ATA GTA AGA ACA GTT CoATT-FTTT AGC TCA GTG GTA GAG CGCoATT-RGTT TCT GCC CTT TCC AAC TGCnATT-FCCC TGG GTT CGG TCC CC AGCnATT-RGTT CCC AGA CCT GTC CAG TTCoTATA-FCTG GCG TAG GGC CTG CGT CoTATA-RTGT GAG GTG GCC GCG TCGSnTATA-RCTG GGC TGC GGG GCT CTG ToSept-FTCC TGC TCC GGC AGT ATT GCoSept-RATG AAT CAC TTC GGT GGC ACnSept-FGGC AGT ATT GCT TTT GTG GTGnSept-RAGA CGG ACT TGG ATT TCG TGA G Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The assay was performed by optimizing existing protocols (32Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Liu C.L. Schreiber S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for embryonic and neonatal brain tissues. Briefly, frozen microdissected brain regions were placed into 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1% formaldehyde and incubated first on ice for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.75 ml of cold PBS, followed by 3 washes with 1 ml of cold PBS each. After the last wash, 0.9 ml of RT lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min with occasional mixing by gentle pipetting. The cells were disrupted by sonication on ice (four times for 10 s at level 4, separated by 30-s breaks). Debris was removed by centrifuging, and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and filtered through a 45-μm pore size filter. Aliquots (500 μl) were precleared with DNA- and BSA-blocked protein A/G-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and with preimmune serum and beads. The supernatant was recovered and was incubated with 1 μg of the following antibodies at 4 °C overnight: a pan-specific anti-AUF1 antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Tolnay), anti-hnRNPA2/B1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sixty μl of DNA- and BSA-blocked, protein A/G-coupled Sepharose beads were added to each sample, and they were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the samples were washed five times in ice-cold wash buffer 1 (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), once in RT wash buffer 2 (Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and twice in RT wash buffer 3 (Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). After the final wash, beads were resuspended in 100 μl of wash buffer 3 in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h and then 65 °C for 12 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and was ethanol-precipitated. After washing and drying, DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and was size separated on a 1.5% TBE agarose gel. DNA in the 300-500-bp size range was isolated from each sample and was extracted from the gel by using the agarose gel DNA extraction kit (Roche Applied Science). DNA was eluted in 50 μl of Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, and 3 μl was used as template in PCR using the qPCR™ core kit (Eurogentec, San Diego) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first PCR was carried out with 25 cycles, using primers specific to the rATENK, the proximal cassette, and control upstream region, respectively. The 100 times diluted product of the first reaction was used as template in the (semi-) nested reaction, performed with 25 or 30 cycles. The following PCR primers were used. The rATENK region was amplified with the primer pair of 5′oATT and 3′oATT (-2654; -2395) in the first reaction, whereas the nested primer pair was 5′nATT and 3′nATT (-2612; -2471). The ENK TATA region was first amplified with the sense primer 5′oTATA and the antisense 3′oTATA (-103; +73). In the semi-nested reaction, the sense primer was used in the pair with the antisense primer 3′snTATA (-103; +25). A distinct regulatory region containing the septamer site (74) located between -569 and -247 of the rENK gene was used as control and was amplified with primers 5′oSept and 3′oSept. The nested primers were 5′nSept and 3′nSept (-560; 287). (See sequences in Table 1.) The PCR products were separated on 2.5% agarose gel by agarose gel electrophoresis along with a 100-bp molecular weight ladder; the bands were visualized with ethidium bromide. Expression Cloning—Neonatal rat brain pEAK8 cDNA library (Edge BioSystems, Gaithersburg, MD) of 500,000 colony formation units was divided into 960 pools, representing ∼500 clones per pool complexity. Plasmids were isolated from the pools, and PEAKRapid embryonic epithelial cells were transfected with each plasmid pools using the calcium phosphate transfection protocol (Edge BioSystems, Gaithersburg, MD). After protein expression the cells were subjected to lysis, and each pool was tested by EMSA using radioactively labeled rATENK probe, and protein-DNA complexes were separated by agarose thin layer gel electrophoresis (30Dobi A. Debnam W. Dalgard C. Owusu A. von Agoston D. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A single pool that contained the rATENK binding activity was further divided into 96 sub-pools, and the screening procedure was repeated but this time only with the sub-pools. A single positive pool was identified, and a subsequent single clone sorted by PCR resulted in a single clone. The clone was sequenced and analyzed using the NCBI nucleotide data base. To obtain expression vectors of the various AUF1 isoforms, the expression library pools were screened and sorted by PCR using isoform-specific primers. The expressed proteins were analyzed by using the NuPAGE 4-12%, MOPS SDS-polyacrylamide gel system (Invitrogen), and the various cDNA fragments were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Cultures, DNA Molecular Decoy, and Reporter Assays— Animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Committee on Animal Research at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Following pentobarbital anesthesia, rat embryos were obtained from timed pregnancies; the brains were removed, and striatal and cortical primary embryonic neuronal cultures were prepared and maintained as published previously (29Dobi A. Palkovits M. Palkovits C.G. Ring M.A. Agoston D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For DNA molecular decoy assays, primary neuronal cultures were co-transfected with a DNA mixture containing the following: 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmid 2700/703ENK-Luc, 2 μg of competitor dsDNA corresponding to the rATENK region, or a control dsDNA (rATENKmut) as described for EMSA above and 0.1 μg of pCMV-Renilla luciferase.

To identify residues that play central roles in transport function, we have systematically substituted by site-directed mutagenesis all the charged residues located within predicted transmembrane domains of the Leishmania donovani nucleoside transporter 1.1, LdNT1.1, which transports adenosine and the pyrimidine nucleosides. Substitution of three of these ten residues by uncharged amino acids resulted in loss of >95% transport activity, and we hence designated them “key” residues. These amino acids were Glu94, Lys153, and Arg404 located in transmembrane domains 2, 4, and 9, respectively. In addition, previous studies on the related LdNT2 inosine/guanosine transporter identified the highly conserved Asp389 and Arg393 (equivalent to Asp374 and Arg378 in LdNT1.1) in transmembrane domain 8 as key residues. Among these residues, the mutants in Arg393 (LdNT2) and Arg404 were strongly impaired in trafficking to the plasma membrane, but the other mutants were expressed with high to moderate efficiency at the cell surface, indicating that their mutation impaired transport activity per se. A conservative K153R substitution exhibited a change in substrate specificity, acquiring the ability to transport inosine, a nucleoside that is not a substrate for the wild-type LdNT1.1 permease. These results imply that the Glu94, Lys153, and Asp374 residues may play central roles in the mechanism of substrate translocation in LdNT1.1.

Membrane transporters are responsible for the uptake of essential nutrients, modulation of concentrations of physiologically relevant compounds, and active release of substances such as signaling molecules. In particular, nucleoside transporters play a vital role in regulating the extracellular concentration of adenosine and in salvaging nucleosides (1Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, carrier-mediated transport of this nucleoside represents a key step in modulating many critical aspects of cell function. In addition, salvage of nucleosides and nucleobases is the first step of nucleotide synthesis in those cells that lack de novo purine biosynthetic pathways, including protozoan parasites (7Berens R.L Krug E.C.

All ENT family members appear to share a common predicted membrane architecture encompassing 11 transmembrane domains (TMDs), a large cytoplasmic loop between TMDs 6 and 7, and in many cases a large glycosylated loop between TMDs 1 and 2 (1Griffith D.A.

Therefore, a similar structural paradigm may exist for ENT family members in organisms ranging from phylogenetically ancient parasites to humans. Despite the importance of the ENTs in the pharmacology of cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular disease, and parasitic infection, relatively little is known about the mechanism of substrate permeation. Over the past few years, structure-function analyses of ENTs from both parasites and mammals have begun to uncover some important elements involved in substrate and inhibitor recognition and binding (22Yao S.Y.

However, the current knowledge is still limited, and the molecular mechanisms by which nucleosides bind to and are translocated by these permeases remain unexplained. Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a disease that is typically fatal if untreated. The parasite exhibits a digenetic life cycle in which the extracellular, flagellated, and motile promastigote resides within the phlebotomine sandfly vector and the intracellular, aflagellar, and nonmotile amastigote exists within the phagolysosome of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells of the mammalian host. L. donovani expresses two distinct nucleoside permeases with non-overlapping substrate specificities: LdNT1, which mediates the uptake of adenosine and pyrimidines, and LdNT2, which imports guanosine and inosine (16Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Carter N.S.

The LdNT1 genetic locus encompasses two closely related genes, LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2, which were cloned by functional complementation (16Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Predicted amino acid sequences of LdNT1.1, LdNT1.2, and LdNT2 revealed that these transporter proteins are members of the ENT family and exhibit significant sequence identity to the mammalian ENTs as well as the same predicted topology. Recent studies on LdNT1.1 and LdNT2 have exposed several functionally important elements of these ENTs, defining TMD5 as a component of the permeation pathway (33Vasudevan G. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6092-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Valdes R. Vasudevan G. Conklin D. Landfear S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6793-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and demonstrating a crucial role for two highly conserved charged amino acids within TMD8 (40Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Arastu-Kapur S. Arendt C.S. Purnat T. Carter N.S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2213-2219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present study extends these findings by identifying new amino acid residues that are likely to play a central role in the transport mechanism. Thus, we have systematically analyzed all ten charged amino acids within predicted TMDs of LdNT1.1. The rationale for this focus is that such charged residues often play central roles in the mechanism of permeation. Perhaps most notably, extensive mutagenesis of the Escherichia coli lactose permease (Lac Y) demonstrated that only six amino acids in this 417-residue protein are essential for transport function (42Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and all of these critical positions are charged amino acids located within TMDs. Each of these residues has been assigned a function in binding of lactose or protons (42Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 43Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R.

Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). By analogy, we anticipated that some charged TMD residues would be essential for the transport function of LdNT1.1. Indeed, results presented here show that Glu94, Lys153, and Asp374 are key residues for LdNT1.1 transport activity and that Lys153 is also a determinant of substrate specificity. These observations contribute to our emerging knowledge of the structure and function of the ENT family. Chemicals, Materials, and Reagents—Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc., Roche Pharmaceuticals, or Invitrogen. Radiolabeled [2,8-3H]adenosine (50 Ci/mmol), [5,6-3H]uridine (32.3 Ci/mmol), thymidine [methyl-3H] (5 Ci/mmol), [8-3H]guanosine (5.6 Ci/mmol), and [2,8-3H]inosine (39 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. All other chemicals, materials and reagents were of the highest commercial quality available. Parasite Cell Cultures—L. donovani strains were propagated at 26 °C in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 μg/ml hemin, and 100 μm xanthine as a purine source. Specifically, null mutant Δldnt1 (in which both alleles of the clustered LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 locus were deleted by targeted gene replacement (46Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell lines generated by transfection of Δldnt1/Δldnt2 with pX63NeoRI constructs were also selected and maintained in 100 μg/ml G418 as well as 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 50 μg/ml phleomycin. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Constructs—Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers were designed to incorporate both the desired mutation and a translationally silent change to introduce a restriction site to facilitate screening. Mutations were inserted within the LdNT1.1 open reading frame (ORF) template that had been ligated into the EcoRI site of pL2.5 expression vector (48Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The codons used to introduce the point mutations are listed: E94Q, E121Q, and E429Q (GAG→ CAG); E94D, E121D, and E429D (GAG→ GAC); K153A (AAG→ GCG); K153R (AAG→ AGG); D215N (GAC→ AAC); D215E (GAC→ GAG); R230A, and R404A (CGC→ GCC); R230K, and R404K (CGC→ AAG). For each mutant, two independent clones were isolated in parallel. Mutant clones were identified by restriction enzyme mapping, and the presence of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing at the Oregon Health & Science University Microbiology Research Core Facility using a model 377 Applied Biosystems automated fluorescence sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For expression in L. donovani, the wild type and mutant cDNAs in pL2.5 were excised with EcoRI and subcloned into the multicloning site of the episomal expression vector pX63NeoRI (39Valdes R. Vasudevan G. Conklin D. Landfear S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6793-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Clones were selected by PCR screening, and mutations were confirmed again by DNA sequencing before being transfected into the transport-defective Δldnt1 or Δldnt1/Δldnt2 L. donovani cell lines. To generate GFP fusions at the N terminus of LdNT1.1 (GFP-LdNT1.1), ORFs of the wild type and mutated LdNT1.1 genes were amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers containing BamHI restriction sites. After restriction digestion, the ORFs were subcloned into the BamHI site of the pXG-GFP+2′ vector (49Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and all constructs were transfected into the Δldnt1 parasites as described. Cell Transfection into Leishmania and Selection of Stable Transfectants—Wild-type and mutant LdNT1.1 pX63NeoRI constructs were transfected into transport defective Δldnt1 or Δldnt1/Δldnt2 L. donovani promastigotes using standard electroporation conditions (50Kapler G.M.

Transfectants were selected and expanded in liquid medium containing 100 μg/ml of neomycin analogue G418 (Invitrogen). Transport Assays—L. donovani promastigotes expressing the wild-type LdNT1.1 transporter, and the mutants were harvested between early and mid-log phases, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 138 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4.7H20, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and resuspended in PBS to a final density of 2–3 × 108 parasites/ml. Nucleoside transport measurements were performed in triplicate for 30 s using 100-μl aliquots by the previously described oil-stop method (16Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, substrate saturation curves were generated by incubating the parasites for 20 s with various concentrations of 3H-nucleosides (Moravek Biochemicals). For each substrate, initial rates of uptake at the higher and lower concentration were confirmed by linear regression analysis over the linear portion of a 60-s time course. These data were adjusted by subtracting the background level associated with formaldehyde-treated cells and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by least-squares analysis using the GRAFIT program (Erithacus Software). Protein Preparation and Immunoblotting—Log-phase Leishmania parasites were pelleted at 850 × g, washed once in PBS (pH 7.4), and resuspended at a density of 2 × 109 cells/ml in the appropriate volume of TENS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) in which a Complete™ Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) had been dissolved (1 tablet per 10 ml). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with additional vortexing, and particulate matter was removed from the lysates by spinning at 11,600 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. 15 μl of the corresponding supernatants were resuspended in 4× Laemmli sample buffer (53Sambrook J.F.E.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.40Google Scholar), heated at 65 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel using standard conditions. Immunoblotting was performed as described (54Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) and blots were probed with a mouse anti-GFP antibody (Living Colors A.V. monoclonal JL-8, BD Biosciences) at a 1:5,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat dry milk and then with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:10,000. Blots were also probed with a mouse antibody against α-tubulin (Oncogene monoclonal Ab-1) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk as a control to normalize for protein loading. Bands were visualized using the Western Lightning™ chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacture's instructions. Blots were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film. Fluorescence Microscopy—Parasites were pelleted, washed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended at a density of ∼107 cells/ml, attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 15 min, and rinsed with PBS. For GFP fluorescence imaging, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides in 40 μl of fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). For imaging of the microtubule cytoskeleton, coverslips were incubated in PBS containing 2% goat serum (PBS-GS) at room temperature for 15 min. Mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) was added at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three to four times in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antimouse antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:10000 in PBS-GS (100 μl per coverslip). Coverslips were washed again three to four times in PBS and mounted as described above. Subcellular localization of proteins was determined using a deconvolution fluorescence microscope (Applied Precision Instruments) with an inverted Nikon TE200 Eclipse microscope, a Kodak CH350 CCD camera, and the Deltavision operation system. Images were acquired using a 60 × 1.4 NA objective and a 1024 × 1024 format and were deconvolved with seven iterations using SoftWoRx software. For GFP excitation was at 488 nm and emission at 538 nm, and for Alexa Fluor 594 excitation was at 594 nm and emission at 617 nm. Functional Characterization of Mutants within TMDs of LdNT1.1—To identify residues likely to play central roles in transport activity, we systematically evaluated the function in substrate permeation of all charged residues of LdNT1.1 located within predicted transmembrane segments. Previously we used TMpred software (16Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to infer that LdNT1.1 encompasses 11 putative transmembrane helices, with cytoplasmic N-terminal and extracellular C terminus (Fig. 1). This predicted topology is supported by experimental data defining the topology of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter hENT1 (14Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Berry Z.A. Abidi F. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol.

The model predicts ten charged residues within TMDs of LdNT1.1 (Glu94 in TMD2, Glu121 in TMD3, Lys153 in TMD4, Lys194 in TMD5, Asp215 and Arg230 in TMD6, Asp374 and Arg378 in TMD8, Arg404 in TMD9 and Glu429 in TMD10) (Fig. 1). Lys194 was already assessed as a part of our previous cysteine scanning mutagenesis analysis of TMD5 of LdNT1.1. Because the K194C mutant retained substantial transport activity (39Valdes R. Vasudevan G. Conklin D. Landfear S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6793-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this residue was not required for ligand permeation. In another study, Asp389 and Arg393 within TMD8 of LdNT2 (corresponding to Asp374 and Arg378 within TMD8 of LdNT1.1) were also examined by site-directed mutagenesis. These residues, which constitute a conserved signature motif (DXXXR) within the vast majority of ENTs (15Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were found to be important determinants for transporter function and targeting respectively (40Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Given the conservation of this motif among ENTs, we did not mutagenize Asp374 or Arg378 in LdNT1.1. Hence, reference to the key nature of these residues in this manuscript is inferred from the demonstrated function of Asp389 and Arg393 in LdNT2. To assess the functional roles in ligand permeation of the seven remaining charged residues, we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute each residue with either an uncharged amino acid or a charged conserved replacement (Table 1). The mutant permeases were then expressed in the transport-defective Δldnt1 L. donovani-null mutant that is genetically deficient in the LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 genes and is consequently unable to take up adenosine or the pyrimidine nucleosides.3 A transfectant expressing the wild-type LdNT1.1 permease was also created and used as control.TABLE 1Phenotypes of mutants of charged intramembrane residuesResidueTMDMutationResultsaKey refers to a >95% loss of adenosine uptake activity compared"
https://openalex.org/W2134145987,"Mechanical unloading of the rat heart increases both protein synthesis and protein degradation. The transcriptional mechanism underlying increased protein synthesis during atrophic remodeling is not known. The aim of this study was to identify transcriptional regulators and the gene expression profile regulating protein synthesis in the unloaded rat heart and in the unloaded failing human heart. We measured DNA binding activity, transcript levels, and protein expression of transcriptional regulators of protein synthesis in a model of atrophic remodeling induced by heterotopic transplantation of the rat heart (duration 1 and 7 days). Using microarray analysis and quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction, we found an increase in c-myc-regulated gene expression including an induction of ribosomal subunit messenger RNA's (RPS 10, RPL 21) and rRNA (18S). Consistent with the gene expression profile, DNA binding activity of c-myc and the nuclear protein concentration of its coactivator, upstream binding factor (UBF), increased in the atrophied heart whereas protein levels of the c-myc inhibitor MAD1 decreased. We found the same increase of ribosomal subunit messenger RNA and rRNA in 21 paired samples of failing human hearts obtained before and after left ventricular assist device treatment (mean duration: 157+/-31 days). In summary, mechanical unloading increases c-myc activity and c-myc-regulated gene expression in the rat heart. Changes in transcript levels of genes regulating ribosomal biogenesis in the unloaded rat heart resemble those found in the unloaded failing human heart. We concluded c-myc and c-myc-regulated gene expression are transcriptional regulators of protein synthesis during atrophic remodeling of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2065608953,"The mSin3 corepressor complex has been linked to diverse cancer signaling pathways through its capacity to regulate target gene expression via chromatin modification. mSds3, a cell essential gene, is a key component of the mSin3 complex serving to maintain its inherent histone deacetylase activity. mSds3 also serves an essential role in the establishment of pericentric heterochromatin, and genetic ablation of mSds3 results in chromosome missegregation. In contrast, mSin3A nullizygous cells show normal chromosome dynamics and cytogenetic profiles. The integral role of mSds3 in controlling chromosome segregation and mSin3-regulated transcriptional networks prompted efforts to determine the neoplastic impact of loss of one copy of mSds3 or mSin3A. In particular, we assessed whether loss of one copy of mSds3, alone or in combination with p53 mutation, results in aneuploidy and promotes a cancer-prone condition in the mouse. We observe that, in a p53 null background, loss of one mSds3 allele results in accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor burden. Notably, these mSds3+/− p53−/− tumors exhibit a more complex cytogenetic profile characterized by marked aneuploidy and centromeric associations. The presence of even one copy of p53 is sufficient to suppress the accelerated tumorigenesis in mSds3+/− mice, consistent with a key role for p53 in monitoring mitotic fidelity. These observations with Sds3 mutant mice contrast with mSin3A+/− p53−/− mice, which do not show an accelerated or increased tumor incidence relative to mSin3A+/+p53−/− controls, correlating with the absence of aneuploidy detected upon mSin3A genetic inactivation. This genetic study establishes that the capacity of mSds3 to cooperate with p53 deficiency in cancer predisposition relates to its specific role in chromosome segregation, rather than its central role in maintaining a functional mSin3A complex."
https://openalex.org/W2075411706,"Tumors in the thymus can be of different cellular origin. Among the most common tumors are thymoma and lymphoma, which are derived from transformed thymic epithelial cells and transformed lymphocytes, respectively. Thymic lymphoma and their response to apoptotic stimuli are poorly characterized. Here, we analyse apoptosis events in the thymic lymphoma cell line Thy278, which expresses cell surface antigens characteristic of immature double positive thymocytes. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 stimulation, Thy278 cells die by apoptosis, similar as primary thymocytes during negative selection. Caspases are crucial for deletion of both Thy278 cells and normal thymocytes. Moreover, we show that deletion of primary thymocytes and Thy278 cells upon CD3 stimulation is considerably impaired by neutralizing CD95L antibody. Thus, our results not only demonstrate that TCR-induced apoptosis is still functional in transformed thymocytes, but also suggest that Thy278 cells are a helpful model for the molecular analysis of negative selection."
https://openalex.org/W2012072372,"In the core binding factor (CBF)β-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) oncoprotein, CBFβ lies N-terminal to the α-helical rod domain of SMMHC. Deletion of the SMMHC assembly competence domain (ACD), conserved among skeletal, smooth and nonmuscle myosins, prevents multimerization, inhibition of CBF and inhibition of cell proliferation. To define the amino acids critical for ACD function, three outer surface residues of ACD helices A–D, the subsequent helices E–H or the more N-terminal X or Z helices were now mutated. Variants were assessed for multimerization in low ionic strength in vitro and for nuclear localization as a measure of in vivo multimerization. Mutation of individual helices C–H reduced multimerization, with alteration of the outer surface of helices D or E having the greatest effect. The ability of these SMMHC variants to slow murine myeloid progenitor proliferation largely paralleled their effects on multimerization. Divergence at the boundaries of the ACD may reflect quantitative differences between in vitro and in vivo filament assembly. Each helix mutant retained the ability to bind the mSin3A corepressor. Agents interacting with the outer surface of the CBFβ-SMMHC ACD that prevent multimerization may be effective as novel therapeutics in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2020824226,"The receptor for avian sarcoma/leukosis virus subtype A (ASLV-A), Tva, is the simplest member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family containing a single ligand-binding repeat (LBR). Most LBRs contain a central Trp (Trp33 in Tva) that is important for ligand binding and, for the low density lipoprotein receptor, is associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. The Tva ligand-binding module contains a second Trp (Trp48) that is part of a DEW motif present in a subset of LBRs. Trp48 is important for ASLV-A infectivity. A soluble Tva (sTva) ligand-binding module is sufficient for ASLV-A infectivity. Tva interacts with the viral glycoprotein, and a soluble receptor-binding domain (SUA) binds sTva with picomolar affinity. We investigated whether Tva, a retroviral receptor, could behave as a classic LBR by assessing sTva interactions with the universal receptor-associated protein (RAP) and comparing these interactions with those between sTva and its viral ligand (SUA). To address the role of the two Trp residues in Tva function, we prepared sTva harboring mutations of Trp33, Trp48, or both and determined the binding kinetics with RAP and SUA. We found that sTva behaved as a “normal” receptor toward RAP, requiring both calcium and Trp33 for binding. However, sTva binding to SUA required neither calcium nor Trp33. Furthermore, sTva could bind both RAP and SUA simultaneously. These results show that the single LBR of Tva has two ligand-binding sites, raising the possibility that other LBRs may also.

Although the LBR sequences vary significantly except for a small number of highly conserved residues, they exhibit a remarkable conservation of tertiary structure. The overall structure, formed by three conserved disulfide bonds, consists of two loops linked by a bridge containing a one-turn helix, with variably oriented N- and C-terminal chains. An acidic cluster chelates a Ca2+ ion, and coordination of this Ca2+ ion is critical for module structure (22Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M.

A conserved Trp resides on the bridge and coordinates the calcium ion through its backbone carbonyl (22Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M.

Each LBR also has a hydrophobic bundle that helps to stabilize the N-terminal loop. Mutations of the Cys residues, acidic cluster, and/or bridge Trp of LDLR LBRs are found in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, suggesting the importance of these residues in receptor function (29Goldstein J.L.

Recent structural studies have revealed a role for the LBR bridge Trp and a conserved Lys in its respective ligand in receptor interaction. For example, in the crystal structure of the LDLR ectodomain at the pH of ligand release, a Lys from the β-propeller domain is in contact with the bridge Trp of LBR5 (33Rudenko G. Henry L.

An interaction between a Lys from apoE and a Trp from an LBR-mimetic antibody has been observed (35Raffai R. Weisgraber K.H. MacKenzie R. Rupp B. Rassart E. Hirama T. Innerarity T.L. Milne R. J.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1841-1850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP has three LBR-binding domains that bind two to three LBRs within a given receptor in a non-cooperative manner (48Andersen O.M. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15408-15417Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 49Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ability of RAP to bind the LBRs of all LDLR family members and to inhibit their natural ligand binding suggests that, despite the variations in specific sequence and surface charge among the various LBRs and the differential specificities of each receptor for its cognate ligand, individual LBRs fold similarly and interact with ligands by a common mechanism. Avian sarcoma/leukosis virus is the prototype oncovirus. Avian sarcoma/leukosis virus subtype A (ASLV-A) infects avian species that express its receptor, Tva (tumor virus A). Tva is an LDLR family member that contains a single LBR. The natural ligands and cell function of Tva remain unknown. For ASLV-A, binding to Tva at a target cell surface via its fusion glycoprotein, EnvA (the envelope glycoprotein of ASLV-A), unleashes a series of conformational changes in EnvA that embed the EnvA fusion peptide in the cell membrane, thereby initiating the infection process (50Matsuyama S.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 428-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The isolated LBR of Tva, soluble Tva (sTva; the 47-residue LBR of Tva), is sufficient for this activation (51Hernandez L.D. Peters R.R. Delos S.E. Young J.A.T. Agard D.A. White J.M. J.

A. 1998; 95: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EnvA consists of a trimer of heterodimers. Each dimer is composed of a receptor-binding domain, SUA (the receptor-binding subunit of EnvA), and a fusion-mediating domain. A soluble form of SUA binds sTva with picomolar affinity, and binding induces a conformational change in SUA (54Delos S.E. Godby J.A. White J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3488-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). sTva contains two Trp residues in its LBR, Trp33 (the bridge Trp) and Trp48 in the C-terminal loop. Mutations of the bridge Trp (Trp33) increase sTva misfolding, but do not abolish SUA binding (55Wang Q.Y. Manicassamy B. Yu X. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G. Rong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutagenesis of Trp48 revealed the requirement for an aromatic amino acid at this position for ASLV-A infectivity (56Zingler K. Young J.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent study showed that mutation of Trp48 to Ala renders Tva unable to induce the conformational changes in EnvA that lead to fusion (51Hernandez L.D. Peters R.R. Delos S.E. Young J.A.T. Agard D.A. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although hydrophobic interactions (54Delos S.E. Godby J.A. White J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3488-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and charge interactions (56Zingler K. Young J.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Rong L. Edinger A. Bates P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3458-3465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been proposed to be important for binding, there is no structural information on the SUA/sTva binding interface. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether sTva exhibits normal LBR function. To assess the ability of sTva to function as a normal LBR and to further characterize SUA/sTva binding, we compared the binding of RAP and SUA to the isolated Tva LBR, sTva. Because of the importance of Trp residues in both SUA function and familial hypercholesterolemia pathogenesis, we also prepared sTva mutants in which one or both Trp residues were mutated. We first characterized the properties of these mutants by CD and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) and then compared their binding to RAP and SUA. We found that the Trp mutations did not significantly alter overall sTva structure. Our data also revealed that RAP binding to sTva required both calcium and the bridge Trp (Trp33), mirroring conditions for RAP binding to other LBRs. In contrast, SUA binding was best in the absence of added calcium and did not require Trp33. We further found that RAP and SUA could not compete for sTva binding and also that they could bind sTva simultaneously. These results indicate that RAP and SUA use independent binding sites. Thus, a simple single LBR has two ligand-binding sites, raising the possibility that other LBRs may as well. Preparation of SUA, sTva, and RAP—SUA was prepared as described previously (54Delos S.E. Godby J.A. White J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3488-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, S2 cells stably expressing SUA were maintained in serum-free insect medium-1 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1× l-glutamine, 1× pyruvate, and 300 μg/ml hygromycin (all from Invitrogen). For expression of SUA proteins, cells were removed from the dishes; washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium (MediaTech, Inc.); and diluted in serum-free insect medium-1 supplemented with 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1× l-glutamine, 1× pyruvate, and 1% EX-CYTE (Serologicals Corp.) at 1-2 × 106 cells/ml. Two days later, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were fed with additional medium as needed to keep them from reaching stationary phase and harvested 5 days post-induction. SUA was purified from culture supernatants by consecutive TALON (Clontech) and then SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. Samples were concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. The preparation of sTva has been described previously (28Tonelli M. Peters R.J. James T.L. Agard D.A. FEBS Let. 2001; 509: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of pMAL-sTva were grown in LB/ampicillin medium, induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested 19 h later. Cells were lysed in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) using a French press; the soluble material was diluted 1:4 with water; and proteins were separated by Q-Sepharose chromatography. The pMAL-sTva-containing fractions were pooled, bound to amylose (New England Biolabs Inc.), and eluted with 10 mm maltose. pMAL-sTva fractions were pooled and refolded in oxidation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2) to which 3 mm oxidized and 0.3 mm reduced glutathione were added just prior to use. The refolded protein was then concentrated, cleaved with Factor Xa, and purified by reverse-phase chromatography. Lyophilized samples were stored at room temperature until needed. sTva as used here refers to the LBR of the quail homolog of Tva. cDNA for the expression of RAP as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and anti-RAP polyclonal antibody were the generous gifts of Dr. Dudley K. Strickland. GST-RAP was purified as described previously (58Lazic A. Dolmer K. Strickland D.K. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14913-14920Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21 cells were transformed with pGEX-RAP DNA. Cultures were grown in 2X YT/ampicillin medium; harvested; and lysed in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. GST-RAP was isolated by GSH-Sepharose chromatography and subsequent purification over Q-Sepharose. This GST-RAP fusion protein will be referred to as RAP throughout, except where relevant to the discussion that it is the full-length GST-RAP fusion protein we are using. Mutagenesis—The sTva mutations W33G, W33F, W48A, W48F, and 2W2F were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The existence of the correct mutation and the fidelity of the rest of the gene were confirmed by sequencing. Each mutant was prepared according to the protocol described above for sTva. Biotinylation of sTva—sTva and mutants thereof were conjugated to EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2. The reaction was allowed to proceed for a minimum of 20 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated sTva was separated from unconjugated sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate on a Superdex G-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) Treatment of SUA—Concentrated fractions of SUA were treated with Endo H (New England Biolabs Inc.) for 3 h at 37 °Cin buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 5% (v/v) glycerin, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.2). The extent of the reaction was followed by silver staining. Endo H-treated SUA was separated from Endo H by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex G-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the Calcium Ion Concentration of Buffer Solutions—The calcium concentration of various buffers prior to calcium addition was determined by ratiometric analysis of the excitation fluorescence characteristics of Fura-2 pentapotassium salt (catalog no. F-1200, Molecular Probes). For these measurements, a 2 μm stock solution of Fura-2 was prepared in 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, and 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and added to samples to a final concentration of 2 nm. The fluorescence was then measured at 510 nm while scanning excitation wavelengths from 250 to 450 nm in a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with an F-3004 Peltier sample cooler maintained at 20 °C. Both excitation and emission monochrometors were set to 2-nm band pass to optimize signal strength, and a Schott KV450 filter was used in the emission beam to eliminate second-order diffraction effects and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The KD for Fura-2 was empirically determined using the calcium calibration buffer kit 2 (catalog no. C-3009, Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using Equation 1,[Ca2+]=(KD·((R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)))·(F380(max)/F380(min))(Eq. 1) where Rmax is the F340/F380 ratio at 39 μm free calcium, Rmin is the F340/F380 ratio at 0 μm free calcium, R is the F340/F380 ratio of the sample, F380(max) is the fluorescence at 380 nm excitation of 0 μm free calcium, and F380(min) is the fluorescence at 380 nm excitation of 39 μm free calcium. A double log plot of log(KD·((R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R)))·(F380(max)/F380(min)) versus log[Ca2+] was constructed yielding a linear relationship where the x intercept represented the log(KD). Using this method, the KD for calcium binding to Fura-2 was determined to be 2.07 × 10−7 m. The free calcium content of the relevant buffer solutions was then determined from the ratio of their emission at 510 nm after excitation at 340 versus 380 nm using Equation 1 in conjunction with the empirically determined value for the KD. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance biosensor data were collected on a Biacore 3000 optical biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Biotin-labeled sTva was manually injected over one well of a streptavidin chip. A parallel well was activated and then deactivated but left unconjugated as a control. Samples were diluted two times either with running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% polysorbate 20) or with running buffer containing 3 mm CaCl2. Kinetic studies were performed on duplicate injections at 25 °C at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Samples were injected at 90 s and dissociated at 300 s. The chip was regenerated by injection of 30 μlof 50 mm NaOH and 1 m NaCl. The real-time data were fit using a 1:1 binding model after subtraction of buffer effects and any binding to the control chip. For GST-RAP binding, a control with GST alone was tested under each condition; no binding between GST and sTva was observed. Where S.D. values are given, the reported values represent the average of two to five independent experiments. The values for each kinetic parameter were averaged independently. Circular Dichroism—The CD spectra of SUA were measured on an AVIV 215 CD spectrophotometer scanning at 0.5-nm intervals with an averaging time of 0.5 s/data point. The temperature was maintained at 24 °C by a circulating water bath, and the cell was maintained under nitrogen purge. The values from three scans were averaged. The contributions of the buffer were subtracted from all spectra. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All fluorescence measurements were taken using a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a F-3004 Peltier sample cooler controlled by a Wavelength Electronics LFI-3751 temperature controller. The excitation slits were set to a 1-nm band pass, whereas the emission slits were set to 3 nm. All samples were prepared at 5 μm, and measurements were made using 4-mm path length quartz cuvettes. All spectra were measured at 22 °C. The samples were excited at 295 nm, and spectra were taken from 305 to 410 nm with three-scan averaging. The spectrum of each respective buffer under the respective condition was subtracted before plotting the data. For experiments in the presence of calcium, 1 m CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 3 mm in a 5 μm solution of protein in buffer A. The solution was stirred in the sample chamber for 4 min and then scanned as described above. Competition Assays—Competition assays were performed in both directions. Immediately prior to initiation of the experiment, the stock protein solutions were pelleted for 30 min at high speed in a tabletop centrifuge to remove any aggregates that might have formed during storage. (No visible pellets were observed in any of these samples.) sTva that had been biotinylated and separated from free biotin as described above was bound to avidin-agarose beads. As a control, sTva was omitted from one tube of each set. To assess the ability of RAP to compete for SUA binding, one set of the sTva-bound beads was preincubated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of RAP, and then constant amounts of SUA were added to each tube in the set. To assess the ability of SUA to compete for RAP binding, another set of beads was preincubated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of SUA, and then constant amounts of RAP were added to each tube. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4°C,andthe beads were washed four times, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies as described in the figure legends. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—SUA and RAP stock solutions were pelleted for 30 min at top speed at 4 °C immediately prior to beginning the experiment to remove any potential aggregated material. Anti-V5 antibody was bound to protein G-agarose beads and used to capture SUA. The beads were then washed to remove any unbound SUA. Solutions of increasing amounts of RAP in RAP buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) containing a constant amount of sTva were preincubated and then"
