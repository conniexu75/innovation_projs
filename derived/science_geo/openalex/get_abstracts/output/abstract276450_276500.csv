https://openalex.org/W2002755392,"Coral reefs of north Jamaica, normally sheltered, were severely damaged by Hurricane Allen, the strongest Caribbean hurricane of this century. Immediate studies were made at Discovery Bay, where reef populations were already known in some detail. Data are presented to show how damage varied with the position and orientation of the substraturn and with the shape, size, and mechanical properties of exposed organisms. Data collected over succeeding weeks showed striking differences in the ability of organisms to heal and survive."

Song dialect populations may represent a level of genetic population structure below that of the subspecies and may play an important role in songbird evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2013188744,Experimental evidence demonstrates that the parasitic phorid fly Apocephalus shifts the competitive balance between the ant species Pheidole dentata and Solenopsis texana by interfering with the defensive behavior of Pheidole dentata major workers (soldiers). This represents one of the first examples of a parasite affecting competitive interactions anmong terrestrial animals in natural communities. Similar complex interactions are probably common in many ant communities.
https://openalex.org/W2077072334,The x-ray diffraction patterns of the denticle material from several species show that the material consists of the mineral goethite. This is the first indication that goethite is precipitated by marine invertebrates. The mineralogy of the denticle caps has biologic and geologic implications.
https://openalex.org/W2072724287,"Adsorption at the water-sediment interface has been correlated with the organic carbon content of natural sediment samples and with water-octanol partitioning equilibria. In deriving a new model for sorption in sediment, it is assumed that adsorption is due to humin-kerogen polymers associated with the clay component in the sediment. The model includes solubility parameter theory applied to solute-gel-liquid interactions and a theory of the liquid-polymer interactions that control gel swelling. Partially swollen gels are expected to exhibit impeded diffusion. These concepts are able to explain observations of limited desorption of certain organic compounds from natural sediments and soil minerals. Experiments were performed in which extractive solvents flowed through a liquid chromatographic column packed with dried estuarine and pond sediment samples and the effluent was analyzed for a test lipophilic compound, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. The model predicts that the maximum desorption rate and the maximum extent of gel swelling should coincide and, conversely, that the desorption rate should be diffusion-limited if the polymer gel is only partially swollen. The conditions for maximum desorption and for diffusion-limited desorption were both observed experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2038930238,"Solvent etching of single crystals of hexahelicene grown from a racemic solution reveals an unusual layer-like pattern in which pure (+)- and pure (-)-layers alternate through the crystal; this arrangement results in a nearly racemic composition although the crystal is ostensibly chiral, space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). Etched crystals of enantiomerically pure hexahelicene display no such pattern. The two kinds of crystal are indistinguishable by x-ray diffraction."

https://openalex.org/W1965926927,"The decade-old Transamazon Highway provides a useful stage for examining some of the major issues related to frontier conquest and the impact of pioneer settlement on one of the world's richest biomes. The highway project is an ambitious colonization scheme and the lessons that can be drawn from it, ranging from the environmental effects of stripping back the tree cover to the spread of diseases, will be useful in guiding development policy in other tropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2029836404,"The ionium-thorium method for age determination in deep-sea sediments is critically reviewed, and its shortcomings are discussed. A method that allows an estimate of the rate of sedimentation in the superficial layer of the sediment is presented. A formula for calculating the error in age determination by the method is given for the case when the rate of sedimentation is changing and, with it, the rate of thorium-232 sedimentation."

https://openalex.org/W2092366569,"Remains of vertebrates and invertebrates found at several New England Woodland sites confirmed results and conclusions of earlier investigators, and further indicated that amphibians and reptiles were not used much as food, if so used at all. Vertebrate remains found at Late Archaic sites indicate the presence of a largely contemporary fauna. Failure of Late Archaic people at sites studied to use mollusks in quantity as food may have been determined by cultural barriers, and not by lack of availability."

https://openalex.org/W4256634664,"The Senate last week unanimously approved the nomination of Jerome B. Wiesner as director of the newly established Office of Science and Technology. Wiesner's nomination occasioned his first formal appearance before a Congressional committee since he joined the administration as Kennedy's special assistant for science and technology. He retains that post while serving as director of the new office and will also continue as chairman of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), an 18-member group of nongovernmental consultants drawn from science, industry, and education. He will also continue as chairman of the Federal Council on Science and Technology, which is the intragovernmental counterpart of the PSAC. In relations between science and government, Wiesner probably occupies the most influential position in the country. Following are excerpts from his testimony before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee. (A limited number of complete transcripts may be obtained without charge from the committee at Room 4230, New Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.)."
