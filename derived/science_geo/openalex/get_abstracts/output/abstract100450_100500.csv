https://openalex.org/W1996568613,"During ischemic brain injury, glutamate accumulation leads to overstimulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors with intracellular Ca2+ overload and neuronal cell death. Here we show that glutamate can induce either early necrosis or delayed apoptosis in cultures of cerebellar granule cells. During and shortly after exposure to glutamate, a subpopulation of neurons died by necrosis. In these cells, mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed, nuclei swelled, and intracellular debris were scattered in the incubation medium. Neurons surviving the early necrotic phase recovered mitochondrial potential and energy levels. Later, they underwent apoptosis, as shown by the formation of apoptotic nuclei and by chromatin degradation into high and low molecular weight fragments. These results suggest that mitochondrial function is a critical factor that determines the mode of neuronal death in excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1989053030,"Although dendritic growth and differentiation are critical for the proper development and function of neocortex, the molecular signals that regulate these processes are largely unknown. The potential role of neurotrophins was tested by treating slices of developing visual cortex with NGF, BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4 and by subsequently visualizing the dendrites of pyramidal neurons using particle-mediated gene transfer. Specific neurotrophins increased the length and complexity of dendrites of defined cell populations. Basal dendrites of neurons in each cortical layer responded most strongly to a single neurotrophin: neurons in layer 4 to BDNF and neurons in layers 5 and 6 to NT-4. In contrast, apical dendrites responded to a range of neurotrophins. On both apical and basal dendrites, the effects of the TrkB receptor ligands, BDNF and NT-4, were distinct. The spectrum of neurotrophic actions and the laminar specificity of these actions implicate endogenous neurotrophins as regulatory signals in the development of specific dendritic patterns in mammalian neocortex."

https://openalex.org/W2029346512,"To explore the role of primary visual cortex in contour integration, we measured the contextual sensitivity of human contrast thresholds and of superficial layer complex cells in monkey V1. An observer's contrast detection was 40% improved by a second suprathreshold bar; the effect was decreased as the two bars were separated along their axis of orientation, were displaced from colinearity, and had their relative orientation changed. Recordings from V1 showed that 42% of complex cells demonstrated facilitation for a second bar outside their classical receptive fields with a similar dependency on relative location and orientation. Both effects were eliminated by an orthogonal line between the two iso-oriented lines. Multiple randomly placed and oriented lines in the receptive field surround often caused a reduction in a cell's response to an optimally oriented stimulus, but this inhibition could be eliminated by changing the orientation of a few of these elements to colinearity with the centrally located target."
https://openalex.org/W2023583278,"The signaling mechanisms that control the survival of CNS neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that, in contrast to PNS neurons, the survival of purified postnatal rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vitro is not promoted by peptide trophic factors unless their intracellular cAMP is increased pharmacologically or they are depolarized by K+ or glutamate agonists. Long-term survival of most RGCs in culture can be promoted by a combination of trophic factors normally produced along the visual pathway, including BDNF, CNTF, IGF1, an oligodendrocyte-derived protein, and forskolin. These results suggest that neurotransmitter stimulation and electrical activity enhance the survival of developing RGCs and raise the question of whether the survival control mechanisms of PNS and CNS neurons are different."
https://openalex.org/W2063575722,"The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is the first site in the amygdala where the plasticity underlying fear conditioning could occur. We simultaneously recorded from multiple LA neurons in freely moving rats during fear conditioning trials in which tones were paired with foot shocks. Conditioning significantly increased the magnitude of tone-elicited responses (often within the first several trials), converted unresponsive cells into tone-responsive ones, and altered functional couplings between LA neurons. The effects of conditioning were greatest on the shortest latency (less than 15 ms) components of the tone-elicited responses, consistent with the hypothesis that direct projections from the auditory thalamus to LA are an important link in the circuitry through which rapid behavioral responses are controlled in the presence of conditioned fear stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2023382980,"In standard protocols, the frequency of synaptic stimulation determines whether CA1 hippocampal synapses undergo long-term potentiation or depression. Here we show that during cholinergically induced theta oscillation (theta) synaptic plasticity is greatly sensitized and can be induced by a single burst (4 pulses, 100 Hz). A burst given at the peak of theta induces homosynaptic LTP; the same burst at a trough induces homosynaptic LTD of previously potentiated synapses. Heterosynaptic LTD is produced at inactive synapses when others undergo LTP. The synaptic modifications during theta require NMDA receptors and muscarinic receptors. The enhancement is cooperative and occludes with standard LTP. These results suggest that the similar bursts observed during theta rhythm in vivo may be a natural stimulus for inducing LTP/LTD."
https://openalex.org/W1972850922,"Transgenic FVB/N mice overexpressing human (Hu) or mouse (Mo) Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP695) die early and develop a CNS disorder that includes neophobia and impaired spatial alternation, with diminished glucose utilization and astrogliosis mainly in the cerebrum. Age at onset of neophobia and age at death decrease with increasing levels of brain APP. HuAPP transgenes induce death much earlier than MoAPP transgenes expressed at similar levels. No extracellular amyloid was detected, indicating that some deleterious processes related to APP overexpression are dissociated from formation of amyloid. A similar clinical syndrome occurs spontaneously in approximately 20% of nontransgenic mice when they reach mid- to late-adult life, suggesting that APP overexpression may accelerate a naturally occurring age-related CNS disorder in FVB/N mice."

https://openalex.org/W2045309328,"Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings were made from the same neocortical layer V pyramidal neuron, and current injection via the dendritic recording pipette was used to simulate the voltage change that occurs during an EPSP. At the soma, these simulated EPSPs increased nonlinearly with the amplitude of the dendritic current injection and with depolarization of the membrane potential. Bath application of the sodium channel blocker TTX decreased large (> 5 mV) EPSPs and also blocked amplification of EPSPs at depolarized membrane potentials, whereas calcium channel blockers had little effect. Local application of TTX to the soma and axon blocked EPSP amplification, whereas dendritic application had little effect. Simultaneous somatic and axonal recordings demonstrated that EPSP amplification was largest in the axon. These results show that EPSPs are amplified by voltage-activated sodium channels located close to the soma and in the axon."

https://openalex.org/W2088885861,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes the survival of two populations of CNS neurons: motoneurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. To see whether GDNF promotes the survival of PNS neurons, we studied embryonic chicken autonomic and sensory neurons in culture. We show that GDNF promotes the survival of sympathetic, parasympathetic, proprioceptive, enteroceptive, and small and large cutaneous sensory neurons. Whereas sympathetic, parasympathetic, and proprioceptive neurons become less responsive to GDNF with age, enteroceptive and cutaneous sensory neurons become more responsive. GDNF mRNA is expressed in the tissues innervated by these neurons, and developmental changes in its expression in several tissues mirror the changing responses of the innervating neurons to GDNF. These results show that GDNF promotes the survival of multiple PNS and CNS neurons and suggest that GDNF may be important for regulating the survival of various populations of neurons at different stages of their development."

https://openalex.org/W2082585200,"Voltage-activated K+ currents and their inactivation properties are important for controlling frequency-dependent signaling in neurons and other excitable cells. Two distinct molecular mechanisms for K+ channel inactivation have been described: N-type, which involves rapid occlusion of the open channel by an intracellular tethered blocker, and C-type, which involves a slower change at the extracellular mouth of the pore. We find that frequency-dependent cumulative inactivation of Shaker channels is very sensitive to changes of extracellular [K+] in the physiological range, with much more inactivation at low [K+]out, and that it results from the interaction of N- and C-type inactivation. N-type inactivation enhances C-type inactivation by two mechanisms. First, it inhibits outward K+ flux, which normally fills an external ion site and thus prevents C-type inactivation. Second, it keeps the channel's activation gate open even after repolarization, allowing C-type inactivation to occur for a prolonged period."

https://openalex.org/W2058595266,"Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis was studied in single rat melanotrophs and bovine chromaffin cells by capacitance measurements. Sustained exocytosis required MgATP, but even in the absence of MgATP, Ca2+ could trigger exocytosis of 2700 granules in a typical melanotroph and of 840 granules in a chromaffin cell. Granules undergoing ATP-independent exocytosis were similar in number to those appearing docked to the plasmalemma in quickly frozen unfixed sections (3300 in a melanotroph and 830 in a chromaffin cell). Most exocytosis required tens of seconds, but a small pool of granules was released in tens of milliseconds. Evidently, only a small subset of docked granules is rapidly releasable. We suggest that, temporally, the last ATP-dependent step in exocytosis is closely associated with docking and that docked granules reach fusion competence only after subsequent steps."
https://openalex.org/W2068095120,"Activation of G protein-gated K+ channels by G protein-coupled receptors contributes to parasympathetic regulation of heart rate in the atrium and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the peripheral and central nervous system. Having found that G beta gamma activates the cloned GIRK1 channel, we now report evidence for direct binding of G beta gamma to both the N-terminal hydrophilic domain and amino acids 273-462 of the C-terminal domain of GIRK1. These direct interactions are physiologically important because synthetic peptides derived from either domain reduce the G beta gamma binding as well as the G beta gamma activation of the channel. Moreover, the N-terminal domain may also bind trimeric G alpha beta gamma, raising the possibility that physical association of G protein-coupled receptors, G proteins, and K+ channels partially accounts for their compartmentalization and hence rapid and specific channel activation by receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2002426597,"The contribution of intersynaptic transmitter diffusion to the AMPA receptor EPSC time course was studied in cultured CA1 hippocampal neurons. Reducing release probability 20-fold with cadmium did not affect the time course of the averaged AMPA receptor EPSC, even when receptor desensitization was blocked by cyclothiazide, suggesting that individual synapses contribute independently to the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC. Deconvolution of the averaged miniature EPSC from the evoked EPSC showed that release probability decays only slightly faster than the EPSC, suggesting that the AMPA receptor EPSC time course is determined primarily by the asynchrony of vesicle release. Further experiments demonstrated that cyclothiazide, previously thought to affect only AMPA receptor kinetics, also enhances synaptic release."

https://openalex.org/W1996629542,"Ca2+ channels display remarkable selectivity and permeability, traditionally attributed to multiple, discrete Ca2+ binding sites lining the pore. Each of the four pore-forming segments of Ca2+ channel alpha 1 subunits contains a glutamate residue that contributes to high-affinity Ca2+ interactions. Replacement of all four P-region glutamates with glutamine or alanine abolished micromolar Ca2+ block of monovalent current without revealing any additional independent high-affinity Ca2+ binding site. Pairwise replacements of the four glutamates excluded the hypothesis that they form two independent high-affinity sites. Systematic alterations of side-chain length, charge, and polarity by glutamate replacement with aspartate, glutamine, or alanine weakened the Ca2+ interaction, with considerable asymmetry from one repeat to another. The P-region glutamate in repeat I was unusual in its sensitivity to aspartate replacement but not glutamine substitution. While all four glutamates cooperate in supporting high-affinity interactions with single Ca2+ ions, they also influence the interaction between multiple divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W2043789426,We have extended our analysis of the role of the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq28) in sexual orientation by DNA linkage analyses of two newly ascertained series of families that contained either two gay brothers or two lesbian sisters as well as heterosexual siblings. Linkage between the Xq28 markers and sexual orientation was detected for the gay male families but not for the lesbian families or for families that failed to meet defined inclusion criteria for the study of sex-linked sexual orientation. Our results corroborate the previously reported linkage between Xq28 and male homosexuality in selected kinships and suggest that this region contains a locus that influences individual variations in sexual orientation in men but not in women.
https://openalex.org/W2036209063,"The architecture of the pore-region of a voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.3, was probed using four high affinity scorpion toxins as molecular calipers. We established the structural relatedness of these toxins by solving the structures of kaliotoxin and margatoxin and comparing them with the published structure of charybdotoxin; a homology model of noxiustoxin was then developed. Complementary mutagenesis of Kv1.3 and these toxins, combined with electrostatic compliance and thermodynamic mutant cycle analyses, allowed us to identify multiple toxin-channel interactions. Our analyses reveal the existence of a shallow vestibule at the external entrance to the pore. This vestibule is approximately 28-32 A wide at its outer margin, approximately 28-34 A wide at its base, and approximately 4-8 A deep. The pore is 9-14 A wide at its external entrance and tapers to a width of 4-5 A at a depth of approximately 5-7 A from the vestibule. This structural information should directly aid in developing topological models of the pores of related ion channels and facilitate therapeutic drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1981646620,"The modulation of Ca2+ channel activity by protein kinases contributes to the dynamic regulation of neuronal physiology. Using the transient expression of a family of neuronal Ca2+ channels, we have identified several factors that contribute to the PKC-dependent modulation of Ca2+ channels. First, the nature of the Ca2+ channel alpha 1 subunit protein is critical. Both alpha 1B and alpha 1E channels exhibit a 30%-40% increase in peak currents after exposure to phorbol esters, whereas neither alpha 1A nor alpha 1C channels are significantly affected. This up-regulation can be mimicked for alpha 1E channels by stimulation of a coexpressed metabotropic glutamate receptor (type 1 alpha) through a PKC-dependent pathway. Second, PKC-stimulated up-regulation is dependent upon coexpression with a Ca2+ channel beta subunit. Third, substitution of the cytoplasmic domain I-II linker from alpha 1B confers PKC sensitivity to alpha 1A channels. The results provide direct evidence for the modulation of a subset of neuronal Ca2+ channels by PKC and implicate alpha 1 and beta subunit interactions in regulating channel activity via second messenger pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2104801499,"Contradictory hypotheses regarding the nature of synaptic transmission in the CNS have arisen from indirect methods of quantal analysis. In this study, we directly count the quanta released following nerve stimulation to examine synaptic transmission at a fast glutamatergic synapse in the mammalian auditory brainstem. Our results demonstrate the relationship between spontaneous and nerve-evoked synaptic events, indicate that asynchronous transmitter release governs the time course of evoked transmission, and show that the stochastic quantal release process, as originally proposed at the neuromuscular junction, is highly conserved at this central synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2089764173,"Miniature postsynaptic currents (minis) in cultured retinal amacrine cells, as in other central neurons, show large variations in amplitude. To understand the origin of this variability, we have exploited a novel form of synapse in which pre- and postsynaptic receptors sample the same quantum of transmitter. At these synapses, mini amplitudes measured simultaneously in the 2 cells show a strong correlation, accounting for, on average, more than half of the variance in amplitude. Two pieces of evidence support the conclusion that variations in the amount of transmitter in different quanta underlie this correlation. First, diazepam, which enhances GABA binding, increases mini amplitude, implying therefore that transmitter concentration is not saturating. Second, we show that amplitude distributions from all cells, even those with a small number of release sites, have the same shape, implying that most or all variance is intrinsic to each release site."
https://openalex.org/W1989868645,"Heterotrimeric G proteins mediate a variety of signaling processes by coupling seven-transmembrane receptors to intracellular effector molecules. The Drosophila phototransduction cascade is a G protein-coupled signaling cascade that utilizes a phospholipase C (PLC beta) effector. PLC beta has been shown to be activated by Gq alpha in reconstituted systems. To determine whether a Gq-like protein couples rhodopsin to PLC, and to study its function, we isolated a mutant defective in a photoreceptor-specific Gq protein, DGq. We now demonstrate that Gq is essential for the activation of the phototransduction cascade in vivo. We also generated transgenic flies expressing DGq under an inducible promoter and show that it is possible to manipulate the sensitivity of a photoreceptor cell by controlled expression of DGq. Characterization of quantum bumps in mutants expressing less that 1% of the levels of DGq revealed that the rhodopsin-G protein interaction does not determine the gain of the single photon responses. Together, these results provide significant insight into the role of Gq in regulating the output of a photoreceptor cell."
https://openalex.org/W1999783230,"A trinucleotide repeat (CAG) expansion in the huntingtin gene causes Huntington's disease (HD). In brain tissue from HD heterozygotes with adult onset and more clinically severe juvenile onset, where the largest expansions occur, a mutant protein of equivalent intensity to wild-type huntingtin was detected in cortical synaptosomes, indicating that a mutant species is synthesized and transported with the normal protein to nerve endings. The increased size of mutant huntingtin relative to the wild type was highly correlated with CAG repeat expansion, thereby linking an altered electrophoretic mobility of the mutant protein to its abnormal function. Mutant huntingtin appeared in gray and white matter with no difference in expression in affected regions. The mutant protein was broader than the wild type and in 6 of 11 juvenile cases resolved as a complex of bands, consistent with evidence at the DNA level for somatic mosaicism. Thus, HD pathogenesis results from a gain of function by an aberrant protein that is widely expressed in brain and is harmful only to some neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2060119066,"We have generated mice deficient in HO-2, the major cerebral isoform of heme oxygenase, in order to assess the potential role of carbon monoxide as a retrograde messenger in hippocampal LTP. Cerebral HO catalytic activity was markedly reduced in the HO-2 mutant mice, yet no differences were found between wild types and mutants in gross neuroanatomical structure, in basal hippocampal synaptic transmission, or in the amount of potentiation produced by various LTP induction protocols. Furthermore, zinc protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of HO, had nearly identical inhibitory effects on LTP in wild-type and HO-2 mutant hippocampal slices. Our data indicate that carbon monoxide produced endogenously by HO is unlikely to be a neuromodulator required for LTP in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2083845304,"We report that the growth cones of Xenopus retinal ganglion cells express fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and that bFGF stimulates neurite extension from cultured retinal neurons. Furthermore, bFGF is abundant in the developing optic tract but is reduced in the optic tectum. To test whether FGF signaling plays a role in axonal guidance in vivo, bFGF was exogenously applied to the developing optic pathway in ""exposed brain"" preparations. FGF-treated retinal axons navigate normally through the optic tract, but the majority veer aberrantly at the tectal border and bypass the target. Our results implicate FGF signaling in target recognition and suggest that diminished levels of bFGF in the tectum cause arriving axons to slow their growth."
https://openalex.org/W1989103278,"To study the effect of cell type-restricted hamster PrP expression on susceptibility to the hamster scrapie agent, we generated transgenic mice using a 1 kb hamster cDNA clone containing the 0.76 kb HPrP open reading frame under control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. In these mice, expression of HPrP was detected only in brain tissue, with highest levels found in neurons of the cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. These transgenic mice were susceptible to infection by the 263K strain of hamster scrapie with an average incubation period of 93 days, compared to 72 days in normal hamsters. In contrast, nontransgenic mice were not susceptible to this agent. These results indicate that neuron-specific expression of the 1 kb HPrP minigene including the HPrP open-reading frame is sufficient to mediate susceptibility to hamster scrapie, and that HPrP expression in nonneuronal brain cells is not necessary to overcome the TSE species barrier."

https://openalex.org/W2065572905,"Immunocytochemical evidence for localized distribution of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein in nerve terminals of cultured hippocampal cells is presented together with results on the functional relevance of the exchanger in the control of [Ca2+]i and of synaptic vesicle recycling. The monoclonal antibody R3F1, directed against an epitope on the intracellular loop of the protein, revealed higher densities of expression in synaptic regions than in other parts of the neurons. Removal of extracellular Na+ produced enhanced and prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i in nerve terminals during and after electrical stimulation of the cells. Correspondingly, initial rates of exocytosis, measured by fluorescence changes of FM 1-43 during stimulation, were faster in LiCl-containing solution than in NaCl-containing solution. By contrast, endocytosis at 20 s was the same in both solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2002128406,"Inward rectifier potassium channels are found in the heart and CNS, where they are critical for the modulation and maintenance of cellular excitability. We present evidence that the inward rectifier potassium channel HIR is modulated by extracellular pH in the physiological range. We show that proton-induced changes in HIR single-channel conductance underlie the HIR pH sensitivity seen on the macroscopic level. We used chimeric and mutant channels to localize the molecular determinant of HIR pH sensitivity to a single residue, H117, in the M1-to-H5 linker region. This residue provides a molecular context that allows a titratable group to influence pore properties. We present evidence that this titratable group is one of two cysteines located in the M1-to-H5 and H5-to-M2 linkers."
https://openalex.org/W2035646776,"Chimeras of GIRK1 and IRK1, a G protein-insensitive inward rectifier, are activated by coexpression of G beta gamma if they contain either the N-terminal or part of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of GIRK1. The N-terminal domain of GIRK1 also facilitates the fast rates of activation and deactivation following m2 muscarinic receptor stimulation. The hydrophobic core of GIRK1 (M1-H5-M2) is important for determining the brief single-channel open times typical of GIRK1 but not important for determining G beta gamma sensitivity. Coexpression with CIR revealed that the gating properties associated with different GIRK1 domains could not have arisen from altered ability to form heteromultimers. These results implicate specific regions of GIRK1 in G protein activation and suggest that GIRK1 may be closely linked to the m2 muscarinic receptor-G protein complex."

https://openalex.org/W2074454109,"Extracellular Mg2+, which blocks NMDA channels in a voltage-dependent manner and increases the receptor's affinity for glycine, is shown here to potentiate NMDA responses at saturating glycine concentrations. This potentiation, induced by millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, is not mimicked by Ca2+ and Ba2+ and is voltage independent. The potentiation is variable in native receptors of cultured mouse central neurons; in recombinant receptors, it is ""permitted"" by the NR2B subunit and prevented by the NR1 splice variant containing an N-terminal insert. Mg2+ also induces a shift of the pH sensitivity of NMDA receptors. The similarity and nonadditivity of the effects of Mg2+ and spermine suggest that Mg2+ may be the physiological agonist acting at the subunit-specific spermine site."

https://openalex.org/W1965570982,"Adenosine is a CNS depressant with both pre- and postsynaptic actions. Presynaptically, adenosine decreases neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus but only at excitatory terminals. In the thalamus, however, we show that, in addition to its actions at excitatory synapses, adenosine strongly suppresses monosynaptic inhibitory currents both in relay cells of the thalamic ventrobasal complex (VB) and in inhibitory neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt). A concomitant increase in transmission failures and results coefficient of variation analysis are both consistent with a presynaptic mechanism. Pharmacological manipulations support an A1 receptor-mediated process. Slow thalamic oscillations induced in vitro by extracellular stimulation and recorded with extracellular multiunit electrodes in VB and nRt are dampened by adenosine without affecting their periodicity. We conclude that adenosine can presynaptically down-regulate inhibitory postsynaptic responses in thalamus and exert robust antioscillatory effects, likely by synergistic depression of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1987867902,"We have cloned a receptor, named LSCPR, for vasopressin-related Lys-conopressin in Lymnaea stagnalis. Lys-conopressin evokes Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- currents in Xenopus oocytes injected with LSCPR cRNA. Expression of LSCPR mRNA was detected in central neurons and peripheral muscles associated with reproduction. Upon application of Lys-conopressin, both neurons and muscle cells depolarize owing to an enhancement of voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents and start firing action potentials. Some neurons coexpress LSCPR and Lys-conopressin, suggesting an autotransmitter-like function for this peptide. Lys-conopressin also induces a depolarizing response in LSCPR-expressing neuroendocrine cells that control carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, in addition to oxytocin-like reproductive functions, LSCPR mediates vasopressin-like metabolic functions of Lys-conopressin as well."

https://openalex.org/W2048421851,"huckebein encodes a putative zinc finger protein expressed in a subset of Drosophila CNS precursors, including the NB 4-2/GMC 4-2a/RP2 cell lineage. In huckebein mutant embryos, GMC 4-2a does not express the cell fate marker EVEN-SKIPPED; conversely, huckebein overexpression produces a duplicate EVEN-SKIPPED-positive GMC 4-2a. We use Dil to trace the entire NB 4-2 lineage in wild-type and huckebein mutant embryos. Loss of huckebein does not affect the number, position, or type of neurons in the NB 4-2 lineage; however, all motoneurons show axon pathfinding defects and never terminate at the correct muscle. Thus, huckebein regulates aspects of GMC and neuronal identity required for proper motoneuron axon pathfinding in the NB 4-2 lineage."

We have previously shown in culture that activin A induces somatostatin immunoreactivity in both neuron populations. We now show in vivo that both targets contain activin A; however, choroid expressed higher levels of activin A mRNA. In contrast, follistatin, an activin A inhibitor, was higher in iris/ciliary body. Iris cell-conditioned medium also contained an activity that inhibited activin A and could be depleted with anti-follistatin antibodies. These results suggest that development of somatostatin is limited to choroid neurons by differential expression of activin A and follistatin in ciliary ganglion targets."
https://openalex.org/W2042860685,"The linotte (lio) gene was identified in a screen for mutations that disrupted 3 hr memory after olfactory associative learning, without affecting the perception of odors or electroshock. The mutagenesis yielded a transposon-tagged gene disruption, which allowed rapid cloning of genomic DNA. The lio transcription unit was identified via rescue of the lio1 learning/memory defect by induced expression of a lio+ transgene in adults. The perception of odors or electroshock remained normal when the lio+ transgene was expressed in these lio1 flies. Learning/memory remained normal when the lio+ transgene was expressed in wild-type (lio+) flies. The lio gene produces only one transcript, the level of expression of which varies throughout development. Sequence analysis indicates that lio encodes a novel protein."
