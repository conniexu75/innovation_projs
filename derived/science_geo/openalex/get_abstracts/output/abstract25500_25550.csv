https://openalex.org/W2005542290,"Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation."

https://openalex.org/W2076849893,"The crystal structure of a complex containing the engrailed homeodomain and a duplex DNA site has been determined at 2.8 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 24.4%. In this complex, two separate regions of the 61 amino acid polypeptide contact a TAAT subsite. An N-terminal arm fits into the minor groove, and the side chains of Arg-3 and Arg-5 make contacts near the 5' end of this ""core consensus"" binding site. An alpha helix fits into the major groove, and the side chains of IIe-47 and Asn-51 contact base pairs near the 3' end of the TAAT site. This ""recognition helix"" is part of a structurally conserved helix-turn-helix unit, but these helices are longer than the corresponding helices in the lambda repressor, and the relationship between the helix-turn-helix unit and the DNA is significantly different."
https://openalex.org/W1983750916,"Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing both Syrian hamster (Ha) and mouse (Mo) prion protein (PrP) genes were used to probe the mechanism of scrapie prion replication. Four Tg lines expressing HaPrP exhibited distinct incubation times ranging from 48 to 277 days, which correlated inversely with HaPrP mRNA and HaPrPC. Bioassays of Tg brain extracts showed that the prion inoculum dictates which prions are synthesized de novo. Tg mice inoculated with Ha prions had approximately 10(9) ID50 units of Ha prions per gram of brain and less than 10 units of Mo prions. Conversely, Tg mice inoculated with Mo prions synthesized Mo prions but not Ha prions. Similarly, Tg mice inoculated with Ha prions exhibited neuropathologic changes characteristic of hamsters with scrapie, while Mo prions produced changes similar to those in non-Tg mice. Our results argue that species specificity of scrapie prions resides in the PrP sequence and prion synthesis is initiated by a species-specific interaction between PrPSc in the inoculum and homologous PrPC."
https://openalex.org/W2022200746,"A complementary DNA clone (designated GAT-1) encoding a transporter for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been isolated from rat brain, and its functional properties have been examined in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes injected with GAT-1 synthetic messenger RNA accumulated [3H]GABA to levels above control values. The transporter encoded by GAT-1 has a high affinity for GABA, is sodium-and chloride-dependent, and is pharmacologically similar to neuronal GABA transporters. The GAT-1 protein shares antigenic determinants with a native rat brain GABA transporter. The nucleotide sequence of GAT-1 predicts a protein of 599 amino acids with a molecular weight of 67 kilodaltons. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced protein suggests multiple transmembrane regions, a feature shared by several cloned transporters; however, database searches indicate that GAT-1 is not homologous to any previously identified proteins. Therefore, GAT-1 appears to be a member of a previously uncharacterized family of transport molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2038471077,"We have isolated cDNAs encoding a glutamate receptor subunit, designated GluR5, displaying 40%â€“41% amino acid identity with the kainate/AMPA receptor subunits GluR1, GIuR2, GIuR3, and GIuR4. This level of sequence similarity is significantly below the approximately 70% intersubunit identity characteristic of kainate/AMPA receptors. The GIuR5 protein forms homomeric ion channels in Xenopus oocytes that are weakly responsive to L-glutamate. The GIuR5 gene is expressed in subsets of neurons throughout the developing and adult central and peripheral nervous systems. During embryogenesis, GluR5 transcripts are detected in areas of neuronal differentiation and synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2077944067,"Glutamate has been found to play an unexpectedly important role in neuroendocrine regulation in the hypothalamus, as revealed in converging experiments with ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, optical physiology with a calcium-sensitive dye, and intracellular electrical recording. There were large amounts of glutamate in boutons making synaptic contact with neuroendocrine neurons in the arcuate, paraventricular, and supraoptic nuclei. Almost all medial hypothalamic neurons responded to glutamate and to the glutamate agonists quisqualate and kainate with a consistent increase in intracellular calcium. In all magnocellular and parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei tested, the non-NMDA (non-N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate antagonist CNQX (cyano-2,3-dihydroxy-7-nitroquinoxaline) reduced electrically stimulated and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials, suggesting that the endogenous neurotransmitter is an excitatory amino acid acting primarily on non-NMDA receptors. These results indicate that glutamate plays a major, widespread role in the control of neuroendocrine neurons."

Exogenous and endogenous ligands on the cell surface, homologous to the groEL heat shock family, induced reactivities that resembled superantigen responses in this major subset of human peripheral blood gamma delta T cells. Stimulation of human V gamma 9/V delta 2 T cells is not restricted by human leukocyte antigens (HLA), including nonpolymorphic beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M)-associated class Ib molecules. These data may be important for understanding the role of gamma delta T cells in autoimmunity and in responses to microorganisms and tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2042278236,"Anterior-specific neural induction can be assayed by means of an antibody that recognizes the Xenopus homeobox-containing protein En-2. The En-2 antigen is an excellent early marker, since it is present as a discrete band in the anterior neural plate of neurula embryos. Regional induction was assayed by combining dorsal mesoderm with competent ectoderm. Anterior notochord from the early neurula induced En-2 frequently, while posterior notochord induced En-2 less frequently. Presumptive somitic mesoderm and presumptive head mesoderm, though they induced neural tissue, were not strong inducers of En-2. Thus, anterior notochord may be the primary mesodermal tissue responsible for the patterning of the anterior neural plate."

https://openalex.org/W2058106424,"Behavioral changes following injury, neural degeneration, and aging partly reflect the synaptic plasticity of the nervous system. Such long-term plastic changes are likely to depend on alterations in the production of proteins involved in synaptic structures and neurotransmission. We have studied the regulation of the mRNA encoding one such protein, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the rate limiting enzyme of GABA synthesis, after a unilateral lesion in the hippocampus that leads to increased seizure susceptibility. Quantitative in situ hybridization reveals a long-term increase in GAD mRNA in several bilateral structures, as well as in specific neurons in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. Our data do not support the often stated hypothesis that seizure susceptibility depends on the malfunction of GABA neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1556364310,"The spectral and catalytic properties of the copper cofactor in highly purified bovine aortic lysyl oxidase have been examined. As isolated, various preparations of purified lysyl oxidase are associated with 5-9 loosely bound copper atoms per molecule of enzyme which are removed by dialysis against EDTA. The enzyme also contains 0.99 +/- 0.10 g atom of tightly bound copper per 32-kDa monomer which is not removed by this treatment. The copper-free apoenzyme, prepared by dialysis of lysyl oxidase against alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl in 6 M urea, catalyzed neither the oxidative turnover of amine substrates nor the anaerobic production of aldehyde at levels stoichiometric with enzyme active site content, thus contrasting with the ping pong metalloenzyme. Moreover, the spectrum of the apoenzyme was not measurably perturbed upon anaerobic incubation with n-butylamine, while difference absorption bands were generated at 250 and 308 nm in the spectrum of the metalloenzyme incubated under the same conditions. A difference absorption band also developed at 300-310 nm upon anaerobic incubation of pyrroloquinoline quinone, the putative carbonyl cofactor of lysyl oxidase, with n-butylamine. Full restoration of catalytic activity occurred upon the reconstitution of the apoenzyme with 1 g atom of copper/32-kDa monomer, whereas identical treatment of the apoenzyme with divalent salts of zinc, cobalt, iron, mercury, magnesium, or cadmium failed to restore catalytic activity. The EPR spectrum of copper in lysyl oxidase is typical of the tetragonally distorted, octahedrally coordinated Cu(II) sites observed in other amine oxidases and indicates coordination by at least three nitrogen ligands. The single copper atom in the lysyl oxidase monomer is thus essential at least for the catalytic and possibly for the structural integrity of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510599459,"We have isolated protransglutaminase E, the zymogen form of epidermal transglutaminase E, from the skin of the adult guinea pig. This zymogen is the source of the large majority of soluble transglutaminase activity of skin. A molecular weight value for protransglutaminase E of 77,800 +/- 700, estimated by sedimentation equilibrium, is in close agreement with the apparent values determined by exclusion chromatography and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment of the proenzyme with dispase, proteinase K, trypsin, or thrombin produces active enzyme. The enzyme, transglutaminase E, formed by the action of dispase, was observed to exist in the native state as a molecule indistinguishable in size from the zymogen. Under denaturing conditions, however, the enzyme dissociates into two fragments with molecular weights of 50,000 and 27,000. The observation that reducing agents are not needed for this dissociation suggests a noncovalent association of the two peptide chains in the native enzyme. Evidence that the catalytically essential -SH group of the enzyme residues in the Mr 50,000 fragment and that only the Mr 27,000 fragment possesses an unmasked amino terminus provides the basis for a proposed model of zymogen activation. Whether the noncatalytic fragment plays a role in catalysis is not known because separation of the fragments of native enzyme was not achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2048341638,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) serves as a membrane anchor for a large number of eukaryotic proteins. A genetic approach was used to investigate the biosynthesis of GPI anchor precursors in mammalian cells. T cell hybridoma mutants that cannot synthesize dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) also do not express on their surface GPI-anchored proteins such as Thy-1 and Ly-6A. These mutants cannot form mannose-containing GPI precursors. Transfection with the yeast Dol-P-Man synthase gene rescues the synthesis of both Dol-P-Man and mannose-containing GPI precursors, as well as the surface expression of Thy-1 and Ly-6A, suggesting that Dol-P-Man is the donor of at least one mannose residue in the GPI core."
https://openalex.org/W2048482657,"Molecules that determine the specific features of individual muscles in vertebrates are unknown. Antibody labeling studies described here revealed a molecular difference among muscles in the zebrafish head, in that two functionally related jaw muscles (the levator arcus palatini and the dilator operculi), and not other head muscles, expressed engrailed-homeodomain proteins. Expression began in mesoderm-derived muscle-precursor cells in the paraxial mesenchyme and continued during muscle morphogenesis and differentiation. Growth cones of trigeminal motoneurons that innervate these muscles associated with the precursors within a few hours of the time they began to express engrailed. It is proposed that the engrailed proteins in these cells establish muscle identity and neuromuscular target recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1554771869,"The antagonist carazolol has been used as a fluorescent probe for the binding site of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR). The fluorescence properties of carazolol are dominated by the emission of the carbazole group, with the fine structure of the spectrum, but not the quantum yield, sensitive to the environment of the probe. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the bound probe is consistent with an extremely hydrophobic environment in the binding site of the receptor. Binding of carazolol to the purified beta AR increases the polarization of the fluorophore. Exposure to collisional quenchers has demonstrated the bound carazolol to be completely inaccessible to the solvent. Furthermore, the fluorescence of bound carazolol is not quenched by exposure to sodium nitrite, a Forster energy acceptor which has an R0 value of 11.7 A with carazolol. Thus, physical analysis of the binding site of the beta AR by carazolol fluorescence indicates that the antagonist binds to the beta AR in a rigid hydrophobic environment which is buried deep within the core of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1613230957,"Osmoregulated transcription from the proU promoter of Escherichia coli has been successfully reconstituted from purified components in a simple in vitro system consisting of plasmid DNA template, RNA polymerase, and nucleotides in the absence of any other protein factor. proU transcription is stimulated by addition of high concentrations of potassium glutamate, the ionic compound accumulated in vivo during hyperosmotic stress. Transcription from the nonosmoregulated promoters beta la, lac, and pepN is inhibited under the same conditions, demonstrating the specificity of potassium glutamate as an inducer of proU transcription. proU transcription requires a circular DNA template, but stable alterations in the degree of supercoiling are unnecessary for this potassium glutamate-dependent signaling. These results agree well with previous data obtained in an S-30 coupled transcription/translation system and suggest that physiological changes in the ionic composition of the intracellular millieu can regulate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1520699352,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the bovine and rat gastric H,K-ATPase beta subunit. A bovine abomasum lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened with a monoclonal antibody raised against the rabbit H,K-ATPase beta subunit. A single positive phage clone containing an approximately 900-base pair cDNA insert was identified as reactive with the antibody. The identity of the cDNA was established by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence with sequences of cyanogen bromide fragments of the porcine H,K-ATPase beta subunit. Polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to generate a cDNA fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal portion of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase beta subunit. A rat stomach cDNA library was screened with the polymerase chain reaction product, and several full-length beta subunit cDNA clones were identified. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 294 amino acids with a molecular weight of 33,689. The rat H,K-ATPase beta subunit shows 41% amino acid sequence identity to the rat Na,K-ATPase beta 2 subunit and shares a number of structural similarities with Na,K-ATPase beta subunit isoforms. By analyzing the segregation of restriction fragment length polymorphisms among recombinant inbred strains of mice, we localized the H,K-ATPase beta subunit gene to murine chromosome 8. Northern and Western blot analysis reveals that this gene is expressed exclusively in stomach. Our results suggest that the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase beta subunits evolved from a common ancestral gene and may play similar functional roles in enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1556133282,"We show for the first time that [3H]progesterone ([3H]PRG) can directly photoaffinity label membrane proteins prepared from a multidrug-resistant human leukemic lymphoblastic cell line CEM/VLB5K. A 170-kDa protein in CEM/VLB5K cell membranes was specifically labeled by [3H]PRG, which we identified as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody C219. The anticancer drug vinblastine and multidrug resistance reversing agent verapamil as well as several steroidal hormones were examined for their ability to interfere with [3H]PRG binding to Pgp. We found that 200-fold molar excess of vinblastine strongly inhibited (93%) the binding of [3H]PRG to Pgp compared with verapamil (80%), progesterone (78%), testosterone (46%), dexamethasone (25%), and aldosterone (56%). The results of this study provide direct evidence that progesterone can bind to Pgp and support the hypothesis that under physiological conditions Pgp may play a role in the excretion of progesterone from certain cells. Importantly, our results show that under our conditions vinblastine and verapamil are better able to compete with [3H]PRG for binding to Pgp than are other steroids, including testosterone, corticosteroids, and mineralocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2007283243,"Serotonin (5-HT) produces presynaptic facilitation and FMRFamide produces presynaptic inhibition in Aplysia sensory neurons. These effects may involve the modulation of Ca2+ influx into sensory neuron terminals during action potentials. Here, we have used the Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2 to monitor directly the effects of 5-HT and FMRFamide on internal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). 5-HT caused a 50% increase in the transient rise in [Ca2+]i in response to action potentials, whereas FMRFamide decreased the [Ca2+]i transient by 40%. Neither transmitter altered the resting [Ca2+]i, the time course of recovery of the [Ca2+]i transient, or the [Ca2+]i transients produced by intracellular injection of CaCl2 or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. We conclude that the effects of the transmitters on the action potential-induced [Ca2+]i transient are due to changes in Ca2+ influx and not in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1480389906,"Identification of cis-regulatory sequences is a first step in analyzing the regulation of the human multidrug-resistant 1 (MDR1) gene which encodes the 170-kilodalton membrane P-glycoprotein in normal tissues and tumor cells. We have studied several overlapping genomic clones containing the 5'-flanking region of the gene. These clones span about 30 kilobases (kb) of contiguous DNA containing 10 kb of the gene and 20 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the first exon and the 2 kb preceding the exon were determined. DNA sequences containing the 5'-flanking regions were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. For transient CAT assay, we have employed six cell lines, including human cancer KB, vincristine-resistant VJ-300 derived from KB, mouse adrenal tumor Y-1, African green monkey kidney CV-1, mouse fibroblast NIH3T3, and human adrenal carcinoma SW-13 cells. Promoter activity was very weak regardless of the length of the promoter region in mouse adrenal tumor Y-1 and monkey kidney CV-1 cells, in which endogenous P-glycoprotein was expressed. Introduction of a 700-base genomic DNA fragment from a site located at 10 kb far upstream of the initiation site increased the transcription of the CAT gene in Y-1, CV-1, and SW-13 cells. However, no significant increase in the CAT activity could be observed in NIH3T3, KB, and VJ-300 cells. This fragment markedly augmented the expression of the CAT gene regardless of orientation or position, and it acted in a cell type-specific manner even with heterogenous promoters. Our present study suggests that the 700-base pair fragment may carry a tissue-specific transcriptional enhancer that is active in at least some adrenal and kidney-derived cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1487880751,"A novel membrane-bound serine esterase, named tryptase TL2, which is immunologically reactive with the antibody inhibiting induction of syncytia by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (Hattori, T., Koito, A., Takatsuki, K., Kido, H., and Kutunuma, N. (1989) FEBS Lett., 248, 48-52), has been purified from a human T4+ lymphocyte clone. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 198 +/- 15 kDa, as judged by gel-permeation liquid chromatography, and is composed of two subunits of 32 kDa and four subunits of 28 kDa, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Studies with model peptide substrates showed that the enzyme preferentially recognized L-arginine and cleaved Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide and Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide with high efficiency at a pH optimum of 8.5. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by the envelope glycoprotein gp 120 of HIV-1, by synthetic peptides with the sequence GPGR in their center, which corresponds to the principal neutralizing epitope of the gp 120s of various HIV-1 strains, by Kunitz-type inhibitors with the sequence GPCR in their active site, such as trypstatin, HI30, and [Arg15, Glu52]aprotinin and by the microbial inhibitors leupeptin and antipain. Studies on the subcellular distribution of tryptase TL2, immunohistochemical analysis, and cell surface radioiodination indicated that the enzyme is mainly localized in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1591988268,"We have isolated and characterized three genomic clones and a genomic fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction that contain the rat guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A)/atrial natriuretic peptide receptor gene. The gene spans about 17.5 kilobases and includes 22 exons and 21 introns. All of the exon-intron junction sequences coincide with the GT/AG consensus. GC-A consists of at least the following four distinguishable domains: extracellular ligand binding, transmembrane, kinase-like, and cyclase catalytic. Exon 7 encodes the putative transmembrane domain. The kinase-like and catalytic domains are encoded by exons 8-15 and 16-22, respectively. The 5' end of the transcript, estimated by primer extension and S1 mapping, is 370 nucleotides upstream of the methionine initiation codon. The initiator sequence (-3 to +5) of CACACTCC has two mismatches when compared with a consensus initiator sequence of CTCANTCT. The 5'-flanking region contains three potential Sp1-binding sites and an inverted CCAAT box, but no apparent TATA box. Three different and short interspersed, repetitive sequences are found within intervening sequences and within the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of the gene (five rat identifier, two rat type 2 Alu equivalent, and seven Alu-like sequences). They fall between the four major domains suggestive that these may be sites for frequent recombination events. This first reported structure of a gene for a member of this new enzyme/receptor family should facilitate the search for new family members, as well as allow studies to progress on the mechanisms by which the gene is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1768888541,"Abstract A cDNA coding for an allelic variant of rat IID1, designated IID1v, was isolated that produced a P-450 having a 10-fold lower catalytic activity toward the substrate bufuralol when expressed in COS-1 cells (Matsunaga, E., Zanger, U. M., Hardwick, J. P., Gelboin, H. V., Meyer, U. A., and Gonzalez, F. J. (1989) Biochemistry, 28, 7349-7355). IID1 and IID1v cDNA-deduced proteins differed in sequence by 4 amino acid residues. IID1 has Val, Phe, Arg, and Leu while IID1v has Ile, Leu, Gln, and Phe at amino acid positions 123, 124, 173, and 380, respectively. Chimeric cDNAs between IID1 and IID1v were constructed and expressed in hepatoma cells using vaccinia virus. A chimera having the Phe (IID1v) at amino acid 380, with the remaining 3 variant amino acid residues of IID1, was found to have a 17-fold decrease in Vmax and a 2 to 3-fold decrease in Km for (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation when compared to a converse chimera having Ile (IID1) in a background of IID1v sequence. Although this enzyme lacked significant bufuralol metabolism, it was able to carry out debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. In contrast, the chimera having Ile (IID1) at position 380 was lacking in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. Type I difference spectra analysis revealed that both forms could bind debrisoquine with similar spectral dissociation constants. These data demonstrate that the single amino acid substitution Ile380----Phe differentially decreases the catalytic activity of IID1 toward bufuralol but not debrisoquine."
https://openalex.org/W1601650782,"Culture conditions allowing for cytochrome P-450IA1 induction by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) in normal human keratinocytes (HK) were investigated. HK grown in serum-free low extracellular Ca2+ (0.1 mM) medium did not accumulate P-450IA1 mRNA in response to TCDF. If, however, the cultures were pretreated for more than 24 h with either serum or elevated extracellular Ca2+ (2.0 mM), induction of P-450IA1 was obtained by TCDF. Serum and elevated Ca2+ concentrations were found to be additive in this respect. When analyzing HK derived from five individuals, no apparent difference was found in the relative induction of P-450IA1 by increasing concentrations of TCDF, giving an EC50 of approximately 2 nM. The permissive effect of serum and elevated Ca2+ could be conferred to a reporter gene by the -1140 to +2435 part of the human CYPIA1 gene. Culture conditions allowing for P-450IA1 induction correlated with conditions that induced mRNA corresponding to the differentiation specific enzyme epidermal transglutaminase. This finding, together with the known differentiation promoting effects of serum and elevated Ca2+, suggest that terminal differentiation is necessary for P-450IA1 induction in HK by Ah receptor ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2138212257,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase appears to play a role in cAMP-induced gene expression in mammalian cells. There exist two major types of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, type I and type II, which are distinguished by their regulatory subunits, RI and RII, respectively. We investigated the role of type I and type II protein kinase in the cAMP-induced gene expression by either stable or co-transfection of RI alpha, RII alpha, or RII beta gene in an expression vector together with somatostatin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (SS-CAT) fusion gene using a cAMP-unresponsive mutant pheochromocytoma cell line (A126-1B2). Introduction of the RII beta gene restored the capability of these cells to induce the SS-CAT gene expression in response to forskolin stimulus and induced a changed morphology which resembled that of wild type. The RII alpha gene also induced SS-CAT gene expression but to a lesser degree than that achieved by the RII beta gene, whereas the RI alpha gene had no effect. The induction of SS-CAT gene expression by the RII beta gene was specifically blocked by the 21-mer RII beta antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. These results show for the first time that type II but not type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is essential for a cAMP-induced gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1546129341,"Time course digestion of intact human erythrocytes and right side-out vesicles with carboxypeptidase Y altered the Rh polypeptides and removed the 125I label that is normally incorporated by cell-surface radioiodination, but did not affect the RhD, Rhc, or RhE antigens. Under the same conditions, however, the LW antigens were rapidly destroyed. Digestion of inside-out and right side-out vesicles with aminopeptidase M was without any detectable effect on the Rh and LW antigens or polypeptides, although glycophorin A was degraded from right side-out but not from inside-out vesicles. These findings demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of the Rh and LW polypeptides is exposed at the external surface of human erythrocytes and indicate, in addition, that the LW antigens and tyrosine residue(s) of the LW and Rh proteins, respectively, are located close to the C termini of these polypeptides. Further studies using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies showed that LW antigen expression is inhibited by treatment of red cells with EDTA and is selectively restored by Mg2+, but not by Mn2+ or Ca2+, whereas the Rh antigens were not affected under these conditions. In addition, O- and N-glycanase digestion of the LW glycoprotein removed its sugar chains, but did not alter significantly the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal anti-LW antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1561276659,"Three glucuronate-rich dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DS-PG) subclasses were isolated and previously characterized from bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures (Kinsella, M. G., and Wight, T. N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19222-19231). In the present study, pulse-chase experiments indicate that the DS-PG of highest apparent Mr (approximately 1 x 10(6)), denoted previously as HMW-DS, is a relatively stable component of the endothelial extracellular matrix and is formed at the expense of lower Mr DS-PG species. The formation of HMW-DS is reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of dansylcadaverine, an inhibitor of transglutaminase-catalyzed protein cross-linking, but not when the activity of other cross-linking enzymes such as lysyl oxidase is inhibited. The putative DS-PG precursor to HMW-DS accumulates during inhibition of cross-linking only when lysosomal degradation is also inhibited by ammonium chloride, suggesting that the precursor is degraded rapidly in the absence of cross-linking. HMW-DS is precipitable from endothelial cell monolayer extracts with antibodies against fibronectin, a known transglutaminase substrate. Thus, we conclude that the stability of HMW-DS in the subendothelial matrix in culture depends upon the cross-linking of a low Mr DS-PG precursor to matrical protein(s), including fibronectin, resulting in the formation of a DS-PG subclass of high apparent molecular mass."
https://openalex.org/W1522885958,"Dexamethasone increases glutamine synthetase activity and mRNA abundance in L6 muscle cells in culture, apparently by a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated process. The data in this report reveal that increased glutamine synthetase mRNA abundance is attributable at least in part to an enhanced rate of transcription of the glutamine synthetase gene. Nuclear runoff assays of glutamine synthetase gene expression were performed with purified myonuclei from dexamethasone-treated or untreated L6 skeletal muscle cells. These assays showed glutamine synthetase transcription to be increased approximately 2-fold as early as 1 h after incubation of cells with dexamethasone (10(-7) M); there was no increase in the rate of transcription of the beta-tubulin gene, which served as a control. The increase in glutamine synthetase gene transcription correlates with increased glutamine synthetase enzymatic activity after dexamethasone treatment. Studies with actinomycin D indicated that the half-life of glutamine synthetase mRNA (7-8 h) is not altered by dexamethasone. Therefore, the degradation of glutamine synthetase mRNA is not affected by dexamethasone, and the increased glutamine synthetase mRNA level is attributable to increased transcription. The dexamethasone-mediated increase in glutamine synthetase mRNA abundance is glucocorticoid receptor-mediated; RU38486 (a glucocorticoid receptor blocker) completely blocked the effect of dexamethasone. The dexamethasone-mediated increase in glutamine synthetase gene transcription and steady-state mRNA level was not blocked by cycloheximide, indicating a direct effect."
https://openalex.org/W1579943994,"We have synthesized two photoreactive derivatives of somatostatin, namely [125I-Tyr11,azidonitrobenzoyl (ANB)-Lys4]somatostatin and [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys9]somatostatin, and used them to characterize somatostatin receptors biochemically in several cell types. Saturation binding experiments carried out in the dark demonstrated that [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin bound with high affinity (KD = 126 +/- 39 pM) to a single class of binding sites in GH4C1 pituitary cell membranes. The affinity of this analog was similar to that of the unsubstituted peptide [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin (207 +/- 3 pM). In contrast, specific binding was not observed with [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys9]somatostatin. The binding of both [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin and [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin was potently inhibited by somatostatin (EC50 = 300 pM) whereas at 100 nM unrelated peptides had no effect. Furthermore, both pertussis toxin treatment and guanyl-5'yl imidophosphate (Gpp(NH)p) markedly reduced [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin binding. Thus, [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin binds to G-protein coupled somatostatin receptors with high affinity. To characterize these receptors biochemically, GH4C1 cell membranes were irradiated with ultraviolet light following the binding incubation, and the labeled proteins were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A major band of 85 kDa was specifically labeled with [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin but not with [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys9]somatostatin or [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin. The binding affinity of the 85-kDa protein for [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin was very high (Kd = 34 pM). Labeling of this protein was inhibited competitively by somatostatin (EC50 = 140 +/- 80 pM) but not by unrelated peptides. Furthermore, this band was not labeled in pertussis toxin-treated membranes or in untreated membranes incubated with Gpp(NH)p. Finally, [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin specifically labeled bands of 82, 75, and 72 kDa in membranes prepared from mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, rat pancreatic acinar AR4-2J cells, and HIT hamster islet cells, respectively. Thus, [125I-Tyr11,ANB-Lys4]somatostatin represents the first photolabile somatostatin analog able to bind to receptors with high affinity. Our studies demonstrate that this novel peptide covalently labels specific somatostatin receptors in a variety of target cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2061574424,"Modulation of evoked quantal transmitter release by protein kinase C (PKC) was investigated at an identified cholinergic neuro-neuronal synapse of the Aplysia buccal ganglion. Evoked acetylcholine release was increased by a diacylglycerol analog that activates PKC and was decreased by H-7, a blocker of PKC. FLRFamide facilitated evoked quantal release by increasing presynaptic Ca2+ influx. The inhibition of PKC by H-7 prevented both the increase of presynaptic Ca2+ influx and the facilitation of evoked acetylcholine release induced by the activation of presynaptic FLRFamide receptors. These results provide evidence that the activation of PKC could be a step in the intracellular pathway by which FLRFamide receptors increase evoked quantal acetylcholine release."
https://openalex.org/W1515434407,"Glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli was inactivated by chemical modification with arginine-specific reagents (Colanduoni, J. A., and Villafranca, J. J. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 126, 412-418). E. coli glutamine synthetase was also a substrate for an erythrocyte NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase. Transfer of one ADP-ribosyl group/subunit of glutamine synthetase caused loss of both biosynthetic and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. The ADP-ribose moiety was enzymatically removed by an erythrocyte ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase, resulting in return of function. The site of ADP-ribosylation was arginine 172, determined by isolation of the ADP-ribosylated tryptic peptide. Arginine 172 lies in a central loop that extends into the core formed by the 12 subunits of the native enzyme. The central loop is important in anchoring subunits together to yield the spatial orientation required for catalytic activity. ADP-ribosylation may thus inactivate glutamine synthetase by disrupting the normal subunit alignment. Enzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation may provide a simple, specific technique to probe the role of arginine residues in the structure and function of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W67215996,"In order to obtain further information on the structure of D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3), limited proteolysis experiments have been carried out on its apo-, holo-, and holoenzyme-benzoate forms. The enzyme is unsensitive to 10% (w/w) chymotrypsin, while incubation with 10% (w/w) trypsin, under nondenaturating conditions, produces inactivation and proteolysis patterns which are different for the three forms of enzyme analyzed. These results confirm the previously reported conformational changes which occur upon binding of coenzyme to the apoprotein, and of benzoate to holoenzyme. The stable 37.0-kDa polypeptide, obtained from the apo- and holoenzyme-benzoate complex upon cleavage of a C-terminal 2.0-kDa fragment, retains full catalytic activity with unaltered kinetic parameters, and the coenzyme binding properties of the native enzyme. These results are in agreement with the tentative localization of the FAD-binding domain in the N-terminal region of the enzyme, and with the hypothesis that the function of the C-terminal region of D-amino acid oxidase could be related to the import of the enzyme into the peroxisomes, as suggested by Gould et al. (Gould, S. J., Keller, G. A., and Subramani, S. (1988) J. Cell. Biol. 107, 897-905)."

https://openalex.org/W1990999962,"""Fast chemical stimulation"" was shown to induce potentiation of glutamate-activated currents in neurons isolated from rat hippocampus. A fast application system allowed solution changes up to a rate of 20 Hz. In Mg2(+)-free solution, the response to glutamate application immediately after repetitive stimulation with glutamate plus glycine was increased by 25%-88%, returning to control levels over 10-15 min. Enhancement of glutamate-induced currents was also seen after stimulation with solutions containing aspartate or NMDA plus glycine. Aspartate-induced currents were not potentiated. These and other observations demonstrate that in a purely ""postsynaptic"" system, short-term potentiation can be induced and is mediated via NMDA receptors whereas the potentiated current is carried via non-NMDA glutamate receptor channels."
https://openalex.org/W1536348433,"Abstract Treatment of pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase from Escherichia coli, a lysine-type, Schiff-base mechanism enzyme, with the substrate analog bromopyruvate results in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzymatic activity. Whereas the substrates pyruvate and 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate provide greater than 90% protection against inactivation by bromopyruvate, no protective effect is seen with glycolaldehyde, an analog of glyoxylate. Inactivation studies with [14C] bromopyruvate show the incorporation of 1.1 mol of 14C-labeled compound/enzyme subunit; isolation of a radioactive peptide and determination of its amino acid sequence indicate that the radioactivity is associated with glutamate 45. Incubation of the enzyme with excess [14C]bromopyruvate followed by denaturation with guanidine.HCl allow for the incorporation of carbon-14 at cysteines 159 and 180 as well. Whereas the presence of pyruvate protects Glu-45 from being esterified, it does not prevent the alkylation of these 2 cysteine residues. The results indicate that Glu-45 of E. coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase is essential for catalytic activity, most likely acting as the amphoteric proton donor/acceptor that is required as a participant in the overall mechanism of the reaction catalyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1512545654,"We have previously demonstrated that the two heads of chicken gizzard heavy meromyosin (HMM) in a rigor complex with rabbit skeletal F-actin could be cross-linked by the water-soluble carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. Here, we report the location of the cross-linked sites in the amino acid sequence of the HMM heavy chain. One of the cross-linked residues was identified as Glu-168 by sequencing the CN1.CN6 cross-linked peptide containing residues 1-77 (CN1) and 164-203 (CN6). This site is located close to the ATP-binding site of HMM. Since the other site was further into the amino acid sequence of CN1, another cross-linked peptide corresponding to residues 53-66 and 145-182 was isolated from the 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide-treated acto-tryptic gizzard HMM digested further by other proteolytic enzymes. The amino acid sequence of this peptide and its cyanogen bromide fragment indicated that the cross-linking occurred between Glu-168 and Lys-65. Our results suggests that these two amino acid side chains are in contact with each other in the acto-gizzard HMM rigor complex and participate in the electrostatic interaction between the two HMM heads bound to F-actin. Based on the head-to-head contact, we propose a three-dimensional model for the attachment of gizzard HMM heads to F-actin."

https://openalex.org/W1629157581,"The corset of microtubules which encloses the cell body of Crithidia fasiculata displays cross-links joining tubules to each other and to plasma membrane. Two proteins, designated COP-33 and COP-61 on the basis of their subunit Mr values, have been considered putative components of this apparatus because of their abundance in isolated cytoskeleton and their ability to cross-link brain microtubules in vitro. The oligomeric structures of the native proteins have now been characterized, and they have been shown to be basic, rather symmetrical, and to require detergent for solubilization. Using monospecific antibodies, enzyme-linked immunoassays of subcellular fractions have shown that each is 5-fold enriched in the microtubule plasma membrane fraction and absent from flagellar and some internal membranes. The binding of each to soluble tubulin and to microtubules has been systematically studied and compared with that of two noncytoskeletal protein ligands (glycolytic enzymes). The observed positive cooperatively was unexpected for binding of these large ligands to microtubules. In each case the maximum number of mol of ligand bound per mol of tubulin (0.5-1.0) was identical whether the latter was dissociated or assembled and so were the dissociation constants (1.3-6.0 x 10(-7) M) for three of the ligand proteins."
