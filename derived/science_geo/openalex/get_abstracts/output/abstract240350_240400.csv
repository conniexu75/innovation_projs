In this report, we found that sclerostin could antagonize canonical Wnt signaling in human embryonic kidney A293T cells and mouse osteoblastic MC3T3 cells. This sclerostin-mediated antagonism could be reversed by overexpression of Wnt co-receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5. In addition, we found that sclerostin bound to LRP5 as well as LRP6 and identified the first two YWTD-EGF repeat domains of LRP5 as being responsible for the binding. Although these two repeat domains are required for transduction of canonical Wnt signals, canonical Wnt did not appear to compete with sclerostin for binding to LRP5. Examination of the expression of sclerostin and Wnt7b, an autocrine canonical Wnt, during primary calvarial osteoblast differentiation revealed that sclerostin is expressed at late stages of osteoblast differentiation coinciding with the expression of osteogenic marker osteocalcin and trailing after the expression of Wnt7b. Given the plethora of evidence indicating that canonical Wnt signaling stimulates osteogenesis, we believe that the high bone mass phenotype associated with the loss of sclerostin may be attributed, at least in part, to an increase in canonical Wnt signaling resulting from the reduction in sclerostin-mediated Wnt antagonism.

The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins is one of the major families of developmentally important signaling molecules and plays important roles in embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate (1Moon R.T.

Wnt signaling is also regulated by a number of naturally occurring antagonists that include Dickkopf (Dkk) molecules. The first Dkk (Xenopus Dkk1) was initially discovered as a Wnt antagonist that plays an important role in head formation (9Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). To date, four Dkk molecules have been identified in mammals (10Monaghan A.P. Kioschis P. Wu W. Zuniga A. Bock D. Poustka A.

However, only the first two molecules (Dkk1 and Dkk2) have been well documented to function as antagonists of canonical Wnt signaling. Both DKK1 and DKK2 antagonize canonical Wnt signaling by simultaneously binding to LRP5/6 and a single transmembrane protein called Kremen (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A.

Work from our laboratory and others further demonstrated that the second Cys-rich domain (but not the first Cys-rich domain) of Dkk1 and Dkk2 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling (16Li L. Mao J. Sun L.

In addition, mice in which the LRP5 gene was inactivated by gene targeting showed phenotypes similar to those of osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome patients (22Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R.

Commun. 2003; 301: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) stimulated the canonical Wnt signaling activity and induced production of an osteoblast marker, alkaline phosphatase (AP), in osteoblast-like cells. The finding that inactivation of the Wnt antagonist sFRP1 enhances trabecular bone accrual further supports the idea that canonical Wnt signaling enhances bone formation (25Bodine P.V. Zhao W.

Recently, we reported that Dkk1 is expressed in differentiated osteoblast cells and osteocytes and that the G171V mutation in LRP5 may cause the HBM phenotype by attenuating the antagonistic effect of Dkk1 on canonical Wnt signaling (20Boyden L.M.

Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4295-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) described a new Wnt antagonist called WISE. WISE appears to be a context-dependent regulator of Wnt signaling; it may inhibit or stimulate Wnt signaling in different assays in Xenopus. WISE was also shown to bind to LRP6 and compete with Wnt8 for binding to LRP6 (27Itasaki N. Jones C.M. Mercurio S. Rowe A. Domingos P.M. Smith J.C. Krumlauf R.

Loss of function mutations of SOST are responsible for an autosomal recessive sclerosing skeletal disorder (28Brunkow M.E. Gardner J.C. Van Ness J. Paeper B.W. Kovacevich B.R. Proll S. Skonier J.E.

Med. 2004; 199: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), but another study suggested that sclerostin might not be a functional BMP antagonist and speculated that it might modulate Wnt signaling (32Van Bezooijen R.L. Roelen B.A. Visser A. Van Der Wee-Pals L. De Wilt E. Karperien M. Hamersma H. Papapoulos S.E. Ten Dijke P. Lowik C.W. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In this report, we now clearly demonstrate that sclerostin can bind to both LRP5 and LRP6 and act as a Wnt antagonist. Because sclerostin expression occurs after peak Wnt7b expression during osteogenic differentiation, we believe that the reduction in sclerostin-mediated antagonism of Wnt signaling contributes to the increases in bone mass associated with SOST.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Transfection, Preparation of CM, and Luciferase Assay—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line A293T and mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3 were maintained and transfected as previously described (26Zhang Y.

For luciferase assays, cells in 24-well plates were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.5 μg DNA/well using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), as suggested by the manufacturer. The LacZ plasmid was usually used to make DNA concentrations equal for each transfection. Cell extracts were collected 24 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were performed as previously described (33Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 34Yuan H. Mao J. Li L. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Luminescence intensity was normalized against fluorescence intensity of green fluorescent protein. For preparation of DKK1-AP- and sclerostin-AP-containing CM, HEK cells were seeded in 6 well-plates at 4 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 1 μg DNA/well. Conditioned media were collected 48 h after transfection.Construction of Expression Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The wild-type and mutant forms of human LRP5, LRP6, mouse Wnt1, DKK1, sclerostin, and DKK2 were generated by PCR using the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu Ultra (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Hemagglutinin or FLAG epitope tags were introduced to the C termini of the full-length and mutant molecules. The expression of these molecules was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. The LEF-1 reporter gene constructs were kindly provided by Dr. R. Grosschedl (35Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).DKK1-AP and Sclerostin-AP Binding Assay—HEK cells in 24-well plates were transfected with LRP5 and its mutants. One day later, cells were washed with cold washing buffer (Hank's buffered salt solution containing bovine serum albumin and NaN3) and incubated with mouse DKK1-AP or sclerostin-AP CM on ice for 2 h. Then, cells were washed three times with the washing buffer and lysed. The lysates were heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and AP activity was determined using a Tropix luminescence AP assay kit. The immunoprecipitation assays were carried out essentially as previously described (36Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).Primary Calvarial Osteoblast Culture—Mouse calvarial osteoblast cultures from 5-day-old mice were generated as described previously (37Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation in the presence of 8 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Media were changed every 2 days.Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative PCR analysis, RNA was reverse-transcribed by the SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was carried out using the QuantiTect™ SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on a DNA Engine OPTICON™ instrument (MJ Research Inc.). B-actin was used as an internal reference for each sample. Using a formula described previously (38Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24913) Google Scholar), the relative change in mRNA levels was normalized against the B-actin mRNA levels.In Situ Hybridization—The full-length coding region of Wnt7b was used to synthesize antisense and sense probes. The probes were labeled with digoxigenin using an RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science). Sections of the tibia from a 3-week-old mouse were dewaxed, rehydrated, and fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde. Then, the sections were treated with 2% glycine and proteinase K and acetylated using an acetic anhydride/Tris-EDTA acetate solution, followed by hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled probe. The sections were washed twice with 50% formamide, 5× SSC, and 5% SDS for 30 min at 70 °C and once with 50% formamide, 2× SSC for 30 min at 65 °C, and then they were incubated with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase antibody followed by nitro blue tetrazolium/4-bromo-5-chloro indolyl phosphate, which yields a purple-blue color. The sections were also counterstained with methyl green (nuclei) and orange G (cytoplasma).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBecause of the homology shared between WISE and sclerostin, we examined whether sclerostin would exert an effect on canonical Wnt signaling. The effect of CM containing mouse sclerostin on Wnt3a-induced activation of canonical Wnt signaling was determined using the LEF-1-based reporter gene assay in HEK cells. Sclerostin-containing CM showed marked inhibition of Wnt3a activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Because control CM started to show significant inhibition at 50 μl, we did not test higher doses. To further confirm this effect of sclerostin, sclerostin and another canonical Wnt, Wnt1, were coexpressed in HEK cells, and sclerostin showed up to 60% inhibition of the activity of coexpressed Wnt-1 (Fig. 1B, bars 2 and 4). Interestingly, coexpression of LRP5 abolished the antagonistic effect of sclerostin on Wnt signaling, and a slight stimulation of Wnt1 signaling by sclerostin was even observed in the presence of coexpressed LRP5 (Fig. 1B, bars 6 and 8). We also examined the effect of sclerostin on Wnt signaling in an osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3. Expression of sclerostin also showed up to 70% inhibition of Wnt-1 activated reporter gene activity in MC3T3 cells (Fig. 1C, bars 2 and 4). Once again, expression of LRP5 reversed the inhibition (Fig. 1C, bars 6 and 8). However, in MC3T3 cells, we did not observe any increase in Wnt1 activity when sclerostin and LRP5 were expressed with Wnt (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, all these results clearly demonstrated that sclerostin antagonizes canonical Wnt activity activated by canonical Wnts when LRP5 is expressed at endogenous levels.To understand how sclerostin antagonizes canonical signaling, we examined whether sclerostin binds to LRP5/6 directly. The binding of sclerostin-AP fusion protein to cells expressing exogenous LRP5 or LRP6 were measured as we and others have previously done with Dkk1-AP (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, sclerostin-AP showed a LRP6 binding curve similar to that of Dkk1-AP, suggesting that sclerostin-AP has an affinity for LRP6 comparable with that of Dkk1-AP, which was previously determined to be sub-nanomolar (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The binding of sclerostin-AP and Dkk1-AP to LRP5-expressing cells revealed that sclerostin-AP and Dkk1-AP also have similar affinities for LRP5 (Fig. 2B). To delineate which regions of LRP5 are responsible for the binding of sclerostin-AP, we measured the binding of sclerostin-AP to two LRP5 mutants that lack either the first or last two YWTD-EGF repeat domains. These mutants are designated as LRP5R12 or LRP5R34, respectively (Fig. 2E). Whereas Dkk1-AP was capable of binding to both LRP5 mutants (Fig. 2D), sclerostin-AP could only bind to LRP5R12, but not LRP5R34 (Fig. 2C). Additionally, a LRP5 mutant containing Ala substitution for Asp111 and Asp418 showed a more marked reduction in binding to sclerostin-AP than a LRP5 mutant containing Ala substitution for either of these two residues (Fig. 2G). Residues Asp111 and Asp418 are located at the centers of the wider openings of the barrel-like structures formed by the first and second YWTD-EGF repeat domains, respectively, and correspond to the Glu721 residue of the third YWTD-EGF repeat domain that is required for Dkk binding (26Zhang Y.

This piece of data suggests that both of the first two YWTD-EGF repeat domains can bind to sclerostin.Fig. 2Binding of sclerostin-AP to LRP5 and its mutants.

Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that this LRP5 mutant may still retain the Wnt-binding sequences. To determine whether sclerostin and Wnt compete with each other for binding to LRP5R12, we measured the binding of sclerostin-AP to cells expressing LRP5R12 in the presence or absence of Wnt3A CM. The presence of Wnt3a did not affect the binding of sclerostin-AP to LRP5R12 at all (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the presence of Dkk1 completely blocked the binding of sclerostin-AP to LRP5R12 (Fig. 3B). In an attempt to further delineate sclerostin-binding sequences on LRP5, we have constructed two additional LRP5 mutants, which lack the second to fourth YWTD-EGF repeat domains and the first, third, and fourth YWTD-EGF repeat domains, respectively. However, these two LRP5 mutants did not bind to either sclerostin-AP or Dkk1-AP, nor did they transduce Wnt signaling (data not shown). These results suggest two possibilities: either both the first and second YWTD-EGF repeat domains are required for the binding of sclerostin to LRP5 or these LRP5 mutants were incorrectly folded.Fig. 3Effects of Wnt3a, Dkk1, and LRP5 mutation on sclerostin binding. A, HEK cells were transfected with LRP5. Binding of sclerostin-AP (5 μl) was determined in the presence of control CM (CCM) or Wnt3a CM (WCM; 100 μl). B, HEK cells were transfected with LRP5R12. Binding of sclerostin-AP (50 μl) was determined in the presence of buffer or recombinant Dkk1 (10 nm). C, HEK cells were transfected with LRP5 (▪) or LRP5G171V (□). Binding of Dkk1-AP (Dkk) or sclerostin-AP (Scl) was determined. In all these binding assays, binding to cells transfected with control plasmid LacZ was subtracted as non-specific binding.

We have previously characterized one of the mutations, G171V, and found that this mutation interfered with the interaction of LRP5 with its chaperon Mesd, resulting in poor transportation of LRP5 to cell surfaces (26Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because this LRP5 mutant was still able to transduce signals intracellularly for autocrine Wnts (26Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we had proposed a hypothesis to suggest that the mutation may increase Wnt signaling by retaining the LRP5 receptor inside the cells from extracellular antagonists such as Dkk1 because Dkk1 is highly expressed in osteocytes (26Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The finding of sclerostin as a new Wnt antagonist, which is known to be expressed in the bone and osteocytes, may provide alternative explanations for the effects of the G171V mutation, which is located in the first YWTD-EGF repeat domain and within the sclerostin-binding region. One such explanation may be that the G171V mutation directly interferes with the binding of LRP5 to sclerostin. To test this possibility, we measured and compared the binding of sclerostin-AP to LRP5G171V with that of Dkk1-AP. As we hav"

https://openalex.org/W2139089901,"Although signaling mechanisms inducing cardiac hypertrophy have been extensively studied, little is known about the mechanisms that reverse cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we describe the existence of a similar Akt/forkhead signaling axis in cardiac myocytes in vitro and in vivo, which is regulated by insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), stretch, pressure overload, and angiotensin II stimulation. FOXO3a gene transfer prevented both IGF and stretch-induced hypertrophy in rat neonatal cardiac myocyte cultures in vitro. Transduction with FOXO3a also caused a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte size in mouse hearts in vivo. Akt/FOXO signaling regulated the expression of multiple atrophy-related genes atrogenes, including the ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1 (MAFbx). In cardiac myocyte cultures, transduction with constitutively active Akt or treatment with IGF suppressed atrogin-1 mRNA expression, whereas transduction with FOXO3a stimulated its expression. FOXO3a transduction activated the atrogin-1 promoter in both cultured myocytes and mouse heart. Thus, in cardiomyocytes, as in skeletal muscle, FOXO3a activates an atrogene transcriptional program, which retards or prevents hypertrophy and is down-regulated by multiple physiological and pathological stimuli of myocyte growth."
https://openalex.org/W2072372077,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a paradigmatic single gene disorder caused by homozygosity with respect to a unique mutation at the beta-globin locus. SCA is phenotypically complex, with different clinical courses ranging from early childhood mortality to a virtually unrecognized condition. Overt stroke is a severe complication affecting 6-8% of individuals with SCA. Modifier genes might interact to determine the susceptibility to stroke, but such genes have not yet been identified. Using Bayesian networks, we analyzed 108 SNPs in 39 candidate genes in 1,398 individuals with SCA. We found that 31 SNPs in 12 genes interact with fetal hemoglobin to modulate the risk of stroke. This network of interactions includes three genes in the TGF-beta pathway and SELP, which is associated with stroke in the general population. We validated this model in a different population by predicting the occurrence of stroke in 114 individuals with 98.2% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2127056741,"Signaling by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18 and FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) have been shown to regulate proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production of articular and growth plate chondrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Notably, the congenital absence of either FGF18 or FGFR3 resulted in similar expansion of the growth plates of fetal mice and the addition of FGF18 to human articular chondrocytes in culture enhanced proliferation and matrix production. Based on these and other experiments it has been proposed that FGF18 signals through FGFR3 to promote cartilage production by chondrocytes. Its role in chondrogenesis remains to be defined. In the current work we used the limb buds of FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– embryonic mice as a source of mesenchymal cells to determine how FGF18 signaling affects chondrogenesis. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy demonstrated impaired cartilage nodule formation in the FGFR3–/– cultures. Potential contributing factors to the phenotype were identified as impaired mitogenic response to FGF18, decreased production of type II collagen and proteoglycan in response to FGF18 stimulation, impaired interactions with the extracellular matrix resulting from altered integrin receptor expression, and altered expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2. The data identified FGF18 as a selective ligand for FGFR3 in limb bud mesenchymal cells, which suppressed proliferation and promoted their differentiation and production of cartilage matrix.

This work, thus, identifies FGF18 and FGFR3 as potential molecular targets for intervention in tissue engineering aimed at cartilage repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage. Articular cartilage has a very limited capacity for regeneration and repair. Irreparable structural damage can, therefore, occur during the progression of degenerative disorders like osteoarthritis, in which the metabolic activity of articular chondrocytes is altered to favor catabolic over anabolic function (1Hunziker E.B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 10: 432-463Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 2Solchaga L.A. Goldberg V.M. Caplan A.I. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2001; S391: 161-170Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When the articular surface is denuded, the underlying bone and marrow is exposed, and spontaneous repair mechanisms result in the formation of tissue that resembles fibro-cartilage. This tissue has neither the structural nor functional properties that are required to withstand the excessive biomechanical forces that it is subjected to and rapidly deteriorates. The focus of tissue engineering for cartilage repair is, therefore, aimed at developing strategies that are modeled after spontaneous repair mechanisms but which result in the generation of durable hyaline cartilage. This will be critically dependent on identification and manipulation of the signaling pathways that will selectively promote chondrogenesis and cartilage production by the multifunctional and pleiotropic growth factors present in the repair microenvironment. Growth factors that have been implicated in articular cartilage repair include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. plateletderived growth factor, bone morphogenetic proteins, and transforming growth factor β (3O'Connor W.J.

Commun. 1988; 156: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). More recently, FGF18 was shown to act as a trophic factor for articular chondrocytes (8Ellsworth J.L. Berry J. Bukowski T. Claus J. Feldhaus A. Holderman S. Holdren M.S. Lum K.D. Moore E.E. Raymond F. Ren H.P. Shea P. Sprecher C. Storey H. Thompson D.L. Waggie K. Yao L. Fernandest R.J. Eyre D.R. Hughes S.D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 308-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). FGFs mediate their effects on chondrocytes by binding to three related trans-membrane receptors that are linked to multiple signal transduction pathways and which network with other cell surface-binding proteins for growth factors and for matrix molecules (9Ornitz D.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In the context of tissue engineering for cartilage repair it is, therefore, critical to determine the ligand-receptor interactions that are primarily responsible for proliferation and those that are primarily responsible for differentiation and cartilage production. In the current work we have used a three-dimensional cell culture model to define the role of FGF signaling through FGFR3 in the commitment of pre-chondrogenic mesenchymal cells to chondrogenesis and to cartilage production. This mouse limb bud micro-mass system has been used for more than two decades as a biologically relevant assay to examine the roles of growth factors, cytoskeletal proteins, teratogens such as thalidomide and retinoids, and gene mutations on cartilage development (10Kaplowitz P.B.

Wide-field and confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy were used in conjunction with recognized molecular probes to capture the differentiation status of chondrogenic cells and the architecture of the cartilage nodules that they produced. Comparisons were made between cultures of cells derived from genetically modified embryonic mice lacking expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and their wild type littermates. Whereas both FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– cells were responsive to FGF2, only the FGFR3+/+ cells responded to FGF18 stimulation. We conclude that FGF18 promotes differentiation and cartilage production by an FGFR3-mediated pathway in cells with chondrogenic potential. This knowledge can be exploited for the differential manipulation of FGF signaling pathways to optimize tissue engineering for cartilage repair and regeneration. Mice—All mouse procedures were performed in accordance with McGill University guidelines, which are set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. E11.5 embryos were removed from timed pregnant FGFR3+/– mice that had been mated with FGFR3+/– male mice. The FGFR3 colony was maintained on a C3H background as described (18Valverde-Franco G. Liu H.

Embryos were genotyped with the same PCR protocol but using yolk sac and liver as a source of DNA. After decapitation the fore and hind limb buds were removed from embryonic mice under sterile conditions and digested with 1 mg/ml dispase (Sigma) to release mesenchymal, prechondrogenic cells for micro-mass culture. Preparation of Micro-mass Cultures and in Situ Analyses—Cells released from E11.5 limb buds were plated in 20-μl spots containing 1 × 107 cells/ml on 60-mm dishes and left for 1 h at 37 °C before adding 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F-12 (1:1; Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Wisent, St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada) and incubating overnight. Cultures were then rinsed once with serum-free medium before adding medium supplemented with 2% FBS or 2% FBS with 10–9 m FGF18 (Peprotech, Ottawa, Ontario) and incubating for 2, 4, or 8 days with medium changes every second day. At the indicated times dishes were rinsed 3 times with PBS (pH 7.4) before fixing for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cultures were rinsed 3 times for 5 min with PBS and stored in PBS at 4 °C according to the protocol of Weston et al. (19Weston A.D. Chandraratna R.A.S. Torchia J. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In situ staining for proteoglycan and alkaline phosphatase was performed as described previously (20Henderson J.E. Naski M.C. Aarts M. Wang D. Cheng L. Goltzman D. Ornitz D.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Type II collagen was localized immunohistochemically with the avidin-biotin-peroxide method as described (21Amizuka N. Davidson D. Liu H. Valverde-Franco G. Chai S. Sasaki T. Ozawa H. Hammond V.

Bone (NY). 2003; 34: 13-25Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and by immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (see next paragraph) using a monoclonal antibody from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Ohio State University). Localization of type X collagen mRNA by in situ hybridization was performed as described by Miao et al. (22Miao D. Liu H. Plut P. Niu M. Huo R. Goltzman D. Henderson J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 294: 210-222Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using a digoxigenin-labeled probe, a kind gift from Benoit St. Jacques, Shriner's Hospital for Children, Montréal, Québec. Stained dishes were overlaid with 1 ml of 75% glycerol and imaged using a 2.5× magnification Zeiss Plan-Neofluar objective on a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope fitted with an AxioCam MR digital camera. Adobe Photoshop image analysis software was used to quantify the integrated optical density of representative dishes from at least three independent experiments for each treatment group. Immunofluorescent Staining of Limb Bud Cultures—At the indicated times cultures were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.3) for 1 h. After washing with PBS to remove residual paraformaldehyde, cultures were incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with PBS containing 400 milliunits/ml chondroitinase and 800 milliunits/ml and keratanase (Sigma), rinsed with PBS, permeabilized by treating with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, and then placed on ice and treated with 5 mg/ml NaBH4 (2 × 30 min) to reduce background fluorescence. Cultures were blocked for 2 h with 20% normal goat serum before applying anti-type II collagen antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) or anti-α1 integrin antiserum (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA) diluted 1:200 with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. Incubations were carried out overnight at 4 °C before washing in several changes of PBS and incubating overnight at 4 °C in goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:500. Cultures were then washed thoroughly and counter-stained for 2 h at room temperature with a mixture of 2 μg/ml TRITC-phalloidin and 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 to identify actin filaments and DNA, respectively. Permeabilization and actin staining were not performed on cultures in which cell-surface α1 integrin was localized. The images are representative of at least three sets of specimens from independent cultures. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Fluorescence imaging was performed using a LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The system consisted of a laser scanning module that was mounted on an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss), an argon laser (458, 488, and 514 nm), two helium-neon lasers (543 and 633 nm), and a pulsed titanium sapphire laser for multiphoton excitation (VerdiV10/Mira 900 from Coherent). Imaging of stained limb bud cultures was performed using Achroplan 20×/0.5 and Achroplan 63×/0.9 water immersion objectives. The Meta function was used to select filter and dichroic mirror (beam splitter) configurations that minimized any overlap from different fluorochromes. Images were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a BP 510/520 infrared band pass filter for Alexa 488, at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm and a BP 565–615 infrared pass filter for TRITC, and a 2-photon excitation wavelength of 780 nm and a BP 390–465 infrared band pass filter for Hoechst 33258. The pinhole size was adjusted to obtain the optimal spatial resolution of the confocal laser scanning microscope system using the diameter of the inner diffraction ring of the light spot calculated by the software. Stack images were recorded with a z-step of 0.94 μm and x/y resolution of 0.4 μm with Zeiss LSM 510 META software (Version 3.0). High magnification images were recorded with a z-step of 0.45 μm and x/y resolution of 0.08 μm. For each set of samples the laser intensity and detector sensitivity were set for the most intensely stained specimen, and all other samples were imaged at the same intensity. The images are representative of at least three sets of specimens from independent cultures. Mitogenic Assay—Primary limb-bud cells prepared as described were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well on 24-well cluster plates (Corning, NY) and grown for 24 h in medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were washed once with serum-free medium and cultured in medium containing 2% FBS, 2% FBS with 10–9 m FGF2, or 2% FBS with 10–9 M FGF18. Four replicate wells for each treatment were trypsinized at 2, 4, and 8 days post-inoculation and counted using a hemacytometer, and statistical comparisons were made using the Student's t test. The results are representative of two independent experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles— RNA was harvested at 2 and 8 days using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 ml of Trizol reagent was added to each 60-mm plate, and the suspension was aspirated 10–15 times through an 18-gauge needle. The RNA pellet was re-suspended in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and 1 μl was run on a 1% agarose gel to evaluate the quality and quantity of extracted RNA. Reverse transcription and PCR were performed as described, and the conditions were optimized for control levels of expression in wild type mice by generating linear curves from products removed at 26–40 cycles (18Valverde-Franco G.

The plateau effect was determined for each set of primers using different annealing temperatures, and test reactions were run with the primers and conditions shown in Table I. PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels with a GAPDH control, and the results for each gene of interest were normalized to the GAPDH product. Gels were imaged using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc system, and the amplification products were quantified using Adobe Photoshop image analysis software. Results are representative of three independent experiments for each time point and treatment condition.Table IPrimer sequence and reference informationGeneSequence 5′ to 3′SizeAnneal temperatureCyclesReference°CFGFR1Ftgg agt tca tgt gca agg tg856583518Valverde-Franco G.

Chandraratna R.A.S. Torchia J. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In brief, the plasmids were pCDNA3 vector or pCDNA3-carrying cDNAs encoding wild type FGFR3iiic or FGFR3iiic with the achondroplasia (FGFR3G380R) or thanatophoric dysplasia mutation (FGFR3K650E). The plasmids, which were kind gifts from David M. Ornitz, were mixed 2:1 with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and transfected according to the manufacturer's directions into limb bud cells isolated from E11.5 embryos of FGFR3+/– matings. 20-μl spots were plated in 60-mm dishes and cultured for 8 days as described before harvesting RNA for reverse transcription-PCR analysis from cells identified as FGFR3–/–. The results are representative of at least two independent experiments. Expression of Molecular Markers of Chondrocyte Differentiation in Mesenchymal Cell Cultures—Condensations of mesenchymal cells released from the limb buds of wild type E11.5 mice plated at high density first appeared at day 2 and increased in size and density up to day 8. Clearly circumscribed nodules stained intensely for proteoglycan and for type II collagen on days 4 and 8 and for alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen on day 8 of culture (Supplemental Fig. S1). Images of nodules stained with TRITC-phalloidin (orange) for actin, with Hoechst nuclear stain (blue), and with a monoclonal antibody for type II collagen (green) were captured in three planes using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The small, shallow condensations seen on day 2 differentiated into nodules of rounded chondrocytes surrounded by flattened un-differentiated cells by day 4 and stained intensely for type II collagen by day 8 (Supplemental Fig. S2). The pattern of expression of these molecular markers recapitulated the in vivo differentiation program of cells of the chondrogenic lineage and validated the model system for examination of the roles of FGF2, FGF18, and FGFR3 in cartilage production in vitro. Defective Cartilage Nodule Formation in FGFR3–/– Limb Bud Cell Cultures—To determine how the absence of signaling through FGFR3 influenced this differentiation program, we established cultures from the limb buds of the E11.5 progeny of mating FGFR3+/– mice (Fig. 1). FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– cultures were identified by genotyping the yolk sac and liver DNA of the embryos (data not shown). Cultures were maintained to day 8 under basal conditions (2% serum) and immuno-stained for type II collagen (Fig. 1, A–D) or hybridized with a probe for type X collagen mRNA (Fig. 1, E–F). In both cases the signals obtained for wild type cells were far more intense, and the nodules were much deeper and well formed than those for FGFR3–/– cells. This data suggested that signaling through FGFR3 promoted chondrogenic cell differentiation and cartilage matrix production. Quantification of Cell Proliferation and Nodule Formation in Response to FGF Ligands—The reduction in type II and type X collagen positive reactivity seen in Fig. 1 could have resulted from a reduction in the number of cells that survived under basal conditions to differentiate into matrix-producing chondrocytes or from defective differentiation. Mesenchymal cells from the limb buds of FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– embryonic mice were plated at low density and grown in the presence of 2% serum (basal), 2% serum with 10–9 m FGF2, or 2% serum with 10–9 m FGF18 (Fig. 2A). FGFR3+/+ cells continued to proliferate under basal conditions, whereas FGFR3–/– cells did not. The addition of FGF2 stimulated the proliferation of both FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– cells, whereas FGF18 inhibited the mitogenic response to 2% serum of FGFR3+/+ cells and had no effect in the FGFR3–/– cultures. A similar lack of response to FGF18 was seen in FGFR3–/– cells plated at high density and stained at day 8 with Alcian blue to identify proteoglycan (Fig. 2B). This was in contrast to the increased staining intensity, quantified as integrated optical density, seen in the FGFR3+/+ cultures. This set of experiments revealed a differential response of FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– limb bud mesenchymal cells to FGF18 and indicated that FGF18 was a more selective ligand than FGF2 for FGFR3. Reduction in Type II Collagen and α1 Integrin in Response to FGF18 in FGFR3–/– Cultures—In previous work we showed that expression of FGFR3 carrying the activating G380R achondroplasia mutation (FGFR3Ach) in CFK2 chondrogenic cells stimulated expression of α1 integrin, which effectively favored binding of the cells to type II collagen rather than fibronectin (20Henderson J.E. Naski M.C. Aarts M. Wang D. Cheng L. Goltzman D. Ornitz D.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– limb bud mesenchymal cells were grown to day 8 in basal medium or medium supplemented with10–9 m FGF18 and immuno-stained for type II collagen or α1 integrin (Fig. 3). Both basal and FGF18-stimulated levels of type II collagen (Fig. 3, A–D) and α1 integrin (Fig. 3, E–H) were significantly reduced in FGFR3–/– cultures. These experiments confirmed the hypothesis that FGF18 signals through FGFR3 to promote cartilage matrix production and corroborated previous work demonstrating a relationship between FGF signaling and integrin expression in chondrogenic cells. Gene Expression in FGF18-treated Cells and Those Expressing Constitutively Active FGFR3—The differentiation of mesenchymal cells to cartilage-producing chondrocytes is accompanied by concomitant changes in the expression of FGF receptors, integrin receptors, and components of the extracellular matrix. To determine how altered FGFR3 signaling influenced these expression patterns, RNA was harvested from FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– limb bud cells after 2 or 8 days in basal medium (2% serum) or basal medium supplemented with 10–9 m FGF18 (Fig. 4). Treatment of FGFR3+/+ cells with FGF18 increased expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 to similar levels as seen in the FGFR3–/– cells by day 8. α1 integrin, type II collagen, and type X collagen expression were also increased in FGFR3+/+ cells in response to FGF18, although there was no response to this ligand in FGFR3–/– cells (Fig. 4A). Densitometric analysis of expression levels at day 8, normalized to GAPDH (Fig. 4B), showed that in the FGFR3–/– cells α1 integrin and type X collagen were un-detectable and that type II collagen was poorly expressed using the PCR conditions outlined in Table I. Expression patterns for the same panel of marker genes was also determined after transfecting FGFR3+/+ and FGFR3–/– cells with plasmids encoding wild type or mutant FGFR3 (Fig. 5). Expression of the constitutively active FGFR3G380R in FGFR3+/+ cells elicited a similar pattern of increased gene expression as seen in wild type cells stimulated with FGF18 (Fig. 4). Similar results were seen in FGRF3–/– cells expressing FGFR3iiic stimulated with FGF18 and in FGFR3–/– cells expressing FGFR3K650E receptors.Fig. 5Gene expression profiles in FGFR3–/– cells transfected with FGFR3 constructs. Total RNA was harvested from FGFR3+/+ cells expressing pcDNA vector as control (V), cDNA encoding wild type FGFR3iiic (R3iiic), or FGFR3iiic with the G380R achondroplasia mutation (FGFR3G380R). In an independent experiment, FGFR3–/– cells were transfected with vector, cDNA encoding wild type receptor or the receptor with the K650E thanatophoric dysplasia mutation (FGFR3K650E). All cultures were maintained for 8 days in the presence of 2% serum, except one set of dishes containing FGFR3–/– cells with the wild type FGFRiiic receptor, which were stimulated with 10–9 m FGF18. Semiquantitative data were obtained by normalizing the signal for the genes of interest (A) to that for GAPDH in the same sample and expressing the result as a ratio (B).

This is due in part to its restricted pattern of expression, to the time- and tissue-specific expression of FGF receptor isoforms, and also to the presence of specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans (9Ornitz D.M.

In mouse models of human chondrodysplasia, FGF2 and FGF18 have been identified as potential ligands for FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes, for FGFR3 in resting and proliferating chondrocytes, and for FGFR2 in the perichondrium and periosteum of developing long bones (25Ornitz D.M.

We addressed here whether Runx2 activity is functionally linked to cell cycle-related mechanisms that control normal osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. We found that the levels of Runx2 gene transcription, mRNA and protein, are each up-regulated with cessation of cell growth (i.e. G0/G1 transition) in preconfluent MC3T3 osteoblastic cells that do not yet express mature bone phenotypic gene expression. Cell growth regulation of Runx2 is also observed in primary calvarial osteoblasts and other osteoblastic cells with relatively normal cell growth characteristics, but not in osteosarcoma cells (e.g. SAOS-2 and ROS17/2.8). Runx2 levels are cell cycle-regulated in MC3T3 cells with respect to the G1/S and M/G1 transitions: oscillates from maximal expression levels during early G1 to minimal levels during early S phase and mitosis. However, in normal or immortalized (e.g. ATDC5) chondrocytic cells, Runx2 expression is suppressed during quiescence, and Runx2 levels are not regulated during G1 and S phase in ATDC5 cells. Antisense or small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of the low physiological levels of Runx2 in proliferating MC3T3 cells does not accelerate cell cycle progression. However, forced expression of Runx2 suppresses proliferation of MC3T3 preosteoblasts or C2C12 mesenchymal cells which have osteogenic potential. Forced elevation of Runx2 in synchronized MC3T3 cells causes a delay in G1. We propose that Runx2 levels and function are biologically linked to a cell growth-related G1 transition in osteoblastic cells.

Stringent control of proliferation in mesenchymal stem cells, osteoprogenitors, and preosteoblasts is essential for the normal growth and development of bone.

However, recent evidence suggests that Runx2 performs another principal function, which is related to control of osteoblast proliferation (31Pratap J. Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M.

The biological activity of Runx2 must be understood within the biochemical and cellular concepts that Runx2 is a critical nuclear gene regulatory effector that supports transduction of osteogenic signals from the extracellular milieu into the nucleus. The ultimate effect of these signaling cascades is that Runx2, together with a number of coregulatory partner proteins, interacts at specific subnuclear sites to activate or repress Runx2-dependent target genes, many of which represent bone phenotype-related genes (32Javed A.

The essential nature of Runx2 in regulating major biological events is attributable in part to its molecular role in facilitating chromatin remodeling of its cognate genes (36Sierra J. Villagra A.

Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M. Robinson J.A. Choi J.-Y. Komori T. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5357-5362PubMed Google Scholar, 47Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.-Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Runx2-deficient calvarial cells exhibit accelerated proliferative potential and that reintroduction of Runx2 restores stringent control of proliferation (31Pratap J. Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M. Robinson J.A. Choi J.-Y. Komori T. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5357-5362PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, enhanced expression of Runx2 upon induction of the postproliferative state in osteoblasts may be functionally coupled to its intrinsic cell growth inhibitory properties and distinct from its role in promoting expression of mature bone phenotypic genes. However, to understand the growth regulatory role of Runx2, it is necessary to define more precisely how the timing of Runx2 expression is related to the onset of quiescence, progression through the cell cycle, and/or arrest at specific cell cycle stages in osteoblasts. The main findings of this study are that Runx2 deficiency modulates expression of cell cycle regulators and that Runx2 expression is controlled with respect to the G0/G1, G1/S, and M/G1 transitions in osteoblastic MC3T3 cells and primary calvarial osteoblasts. In contrast, Runx2 levels do not respond to serum deprivation in osteosarcoma cells, whereas Runx2 protein expression is suppressed in quiescent chondrocytic cells. Elevation of Runx2 levels by forced expression significantly decreases the rate of cell proliferation by lengthening G1 in MC3T3 cells. Thus, Runx2 performs an antiproliferative function by suppression of cell cycle progression through G1 and supporting the transition from active cell growth to quiescence (G0/G1) in osteoblasts. The cell cycle-controlled down-regulation of Runx2 expression may control entry into S phase during the proliferative period of osteoblast differentiation. Cell Culture and Synchronization—Experiments were performed with osteoblastic cells, which include rat calvarial osteoblasts, temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen-transformed human osteoblasts (48Bodine P.V.N. Vernon S.K. Komm B.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4592-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), mouse MC3T3 cells (49Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Koyama H. Kasai S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), osteosarcoma cells (rat ROS17/2.8 and human SAOS-2 cells), chondrocytic cells (mouse ATDC5 clonal teratocarcinoma cells) (50Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), as well as primary human articular chondrocytes and mesenchymal progenitor cells (mouse C2C12 cells) (51Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was used for the majority of our experiments. MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were seeded in either 6-well or 100-mm plates at 0.08 × 106 cells/well or 0.4 × 106 cells/plate, respectively, and grown in a subconfluent state for 72 h until the onset of exponential growth. For serum reduction experiments, cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and refed with α MEM plus 10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1% or 0% FBS. For heparin treatment experiments, cells were refed with αMEM plus 10% FBS and treated with 250–1,000 μg/ml heparin. Cells were maintained in culture for 2 days before harvesting. Cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 was achieved by serum deprivation. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free αMEM for 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. Cell cultures were arrested in G1/S by mimosine treatment or in early S by aphidicolin or hydroxyurea treatment or in mitosis by nocodazole treatment. Cells grown in αMEM plus 10% FBS were treated with 400 μm mimosine or with 2.5 μg/ml aphidicolin or with 2 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h or with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h. Cells arrested in G0/G1 were released from quiescence by serum stimulation. Briefly, cells exponentially growing in αMEM plus 10% FBS were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h. Then, the cells were stimulated to progress through the cell cycle by the removal of medium and the addition of αMEM plus 10% FBS. Cells arrested in mitosis (nocodazole) or at the G1/S boundary (mimosine) were stimulated to progress, respectively, in G1 or S phase by the addition of αMEM plus 10% FBS without drugs. After serum stimulation, cells were harvested at selected time points for Western blot analysis, Northern blot analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. To inhibit cell cyclespecific degradation of proteins, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) was added to the cells. MG132 was prepared as a stock solution of 25 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide and administered to the cells after a 1:1,000 dilution into the cell culture medium (25 μm final concentration). Flow Cytometric Analysis—The distribution of cells at specific cell cycle stages was evaluated by flow cytometry. Cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol at –20 °C overnight. Subsequently, cells were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to FACS analysis based on DNA content (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The samples (1 × 106 cells) were analyzed by cell cycle distribution using the FACStar cell sorter and Consort 30 software (Becton Dickinson). In several experiments, we performed flow cytometric analysis of MC3T3 cells stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V antibody and propidium iodide (Calbiochem) to monitor the fraction of necrotic (propidium iodide-positive and annexin V-negative cells) or apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive). Western Blot Analysis—Runx2 and cell cycle markers of MC3T3 cell were analyzed by Western blot analysis as described previously (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 53Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of total cellular protein or nuclear extracts were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.). Blots were incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of each primary antibody for 1 h. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (p27, Cdk2, Cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin E, Bcl-2, and Bax), mouse monoclonal antibodies (cyclin D1 and HA probe), and goat polyclonal antibodies (actin) were acquired commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for lamin B1 (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco) and Runx2 (22Zhang Y.W. Yasui N. Ito K. Huang G. Fujii M. Hanai J. Nogami H. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10549-10554Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) were also used in these studies. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and signal intensities were quantitated by densitometry. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from MC3T3 cells by using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto Hybond Plus membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to probes specific for Runx2, histone H4, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Hybridization was performed as described previously (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 53Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) in the presence of buffer containing 50% formamide at 42 °C, and the blots were washed extensively in buffer containing 1 × SSC (standard saline citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Data were analyzed after overnight exposure using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Ethidium bromide (EtBr) staining of the gels was used to assess equal loading of samples. Nuclear Run-off Transcription Assays—Nuclear run-off transcription assays were performed as described previously (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar), with some modifications. Nuclei were isolated from 1 × 107 cells that were cultured in the presence (i.e. proliferating cells) or absence (i.e. quiescent cells) of serum. Nuclei were resuspended in 150 μl of glycerol storage buffer, and run-off transcription was carried out in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]UTP 3000 Ci/mmol, ICN) according to a standard protocol. After nuclei isolation and run-off transcription reactions, RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent and used for hybridization with 4-μg cDNA probes slot-blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes at 65 °C for 24 h. Antisense and siRNA Oligonucleotide Treatment—MC3T3 cells were incubated for 4 h with each oligonucleotide (Oligo Etc., Inc.) at 400 nm with Lipofectin (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. We used an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-ACG CCA TAG TCC CTC CTT TT-3′), which is complementary to the translation-initiation region (nucleotide 343–362) of the P1 promoter-derived mRNA, which encodes the Runx2 MASNS/p57/Type II isoform. Scrambled oligonucleotide (5′-TCG TAC CTT ATC CAG TCT CC-3′) was used as a control. After the 4-h incubation with oligonucleotides and Lipofectin, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 10% FBS and incubated for 30–42 h. Knock-down experiments were performed with siRNA duplexes specific for Runx2 (Runx2-siRNA1 = r(CUC UGC ACC AAG UCC UUU U)d(TT); Runx2-siRNA2 = r(AAA AGG ACU UGG UGC AGA G)d(TT)) or green fluorescent protein (GFP-22, rhodamine, Qiagen) (r(GCA AGC UGA CCC UGA AGU UCA U)). Transfection of siRNAs was performed with oligofectamin using conditions as recommended by the supplier (Invitrogen). Plasmid Transfection and Adenoviral Infection—MC3T3 cells were plated in 100-mm plates at a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/plate and were transiently transfected with 5 μg of pHA-Runx2 expression plasmid (33Zaidi S.K. Javed A. Choi J.-Y. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3093-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μl of Plus reagent and 15 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Adenovirus infection of calvarial osteoblasts was performed with a vector expressing Xpress-tagged mouse RUNX2 under control of the cytomegalovirus CMV)5 promoter (pAd/CMV5/Xpress-Runx2/IRES/GFP) or the corresponding empty vector. Virus was administered at 200 particles/cell in αMEM with 1% FBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were exposed to virus by rotating dishes three times at 15-min intervals, and the virus-containing medium was removed after 1 h. Cells were washed two times with serum-free medium and then cultured in αMEM containing 10% FBS. The cell number was monitored at daily intervals to determine effects on cell growth. Parallel Regulation of Runx2 mRNA and Protein Levels during the Cessation of Cell Growth—We have previously observed increased proliferation of Runx2-deficient calvarial cells (31Pratap J. Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M. Robinson J.A. Choi J.-Y. Komori T. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J.

Pratap J. Javed A. Zaidi S.K. Xing L. Balint E. Dalamangas S. Boyce B. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Jones S.N. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8650-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Consistent with the deregulation of cell growth in Runx2-deficient osteoblast progenitor cells (i.e. cells from Runx2–/– knock-out and Runx2ΔC/ΔC knock-in mice) (31Pratap J. Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M. Robinson J.A. Choi J.-Y. Komori T. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5357-5362PubMed Google Scholar), we find there are selective changes in the expression of activators and inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) based on gene expression profiling experiments with RNA from wild type and Runx2ΔC/ΔC mutant calvaria (data not shown). Apart from Runx2 genotype-dependent changes in cell proliferation (31Pratap J. Galindo M. Zaidi S.K. Vradii D. Bhat B.M. Robinson J.A. Choi J.-Y. Komori T. Stein J.L. Lian J.B.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5357-5362PubMed Google Scholar) and the expression of several cell cycle regulators (data not shown), Runx2 itself is regulated with respect to cell growth (Fig. 1). Cessation of osteoblast growth by serum reduction or deprivation for at least 48 h correlates with increased Runx2 protein levels in MC3T3 cells (Fig. 1A). We assessed the gene regulatory levels at which Runx2 expression is controlled during cell growth inhibition. First, we analyzed the correlation between Runx2 protein and mRNA expression up"
https://openalex.org/W2149317862,"The human hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 is a critical regulator of cellular and systemic responses to low oxygen levels. When oxygen levels are high, the HIF-1α subunit is hydroxylated and is targeted for degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL). This regulatory pathway is evolutionarily conserved, and the Caenorhabditis elegans hif-1 and vhl-1 genes encode homologs of the HIF-1α subunit and VHL. To understand and describe more fully the molecular basis for hypoxia response in this important genetic model system, we compared hypoxia-induced changes in mRNA expression in wild-type, hif-1-deficient, and vhl-1-deficient C. elegans using whole genome microarrays. These studies identified 110 hypoxia-regulated gene expression changes, 63 of which require hif-1 function. Mutation of vhl-1 abrogates most hif-1-dependent changes in mRNA expression.

During development, homeostasis, or disease states, cellular oxygen levels are often insufficient to meet physiological demands, and this condition is termed hypoxia. Mammalian cells respond to hypoxia by implementing changes in gene expression to increase anaerobic energy production, protect cells from stress, regulate cell survival, and increase local angiogenesis. The requisite changes in gene expression are largely controlled by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; eEF-2, elongation factor 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HRE, hypoxia response element; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; RNAi, RNA interference; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau. 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; eEF-2, elongation factor 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HRE, hypoxia response element; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; RNAi, RNA interference; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau. transcription factor (1Semenza G.L.

HIF-1 is a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex, and both subunits are members of the family of transcription factors containing basic-helix-loop-helix and Per-ARNT-Sim domains. The HIF-1β subunit is also termed ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator). Although ARNT can dimerize with other transcription factors, HIF-1α is apparently dedicated to a hypoxia response (3Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J.

Proline hydroxylation in the conserved LXXLAP motif in HIF-1α increases its affinity for the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), which is part of an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets proteins for proteasomal degradation. Thus, when VHL is disabled by mutation, HIF-1 is expressed at constitutively high levels (8Kim W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells utilize multiple strategies to regulate HIF-1α activity. HIF-1α is modified post-translationally by hydroxylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation (7Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L.

The availability of interacting proteins, such as transcriptional coactivators, also influences HIF-1 function. Important questions remain. What other oxygen-sensing molecules control cellular hypoxia response? What are the most important VHL-independent mechanisms for regulating HIF-1 activity? What fraction of the transcriptional response to hypoxia is controlled by HIF-1? Caenorhabditis elegans has recently proven to be an important model system for studying hypoxia response. The C. elegans homolog of the HIF-1α subunit is hif-1, and the HIF-1/EGL-9/VHL pathway is evolutionarily conserved (6Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R.

C. elegans carrying deletions in the hif-1 gene are apparently healthy in standard culture conditions, but they exhibit high levels of lethality in 0.5 or 1% oxygen (15Jiang H. Guo R.

To identify genes regulated by HIF-1 during response to hypoxia and to determine what fraction of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes is dependent upon hif-1, we conducted genomewide studies of hypoxia-induced changes in mRNA expression in wild-type, hif-1-deficient, and vhl-1-deficient C. elegans. These studies demonstrate that C. elegans hif-1 regulates the majority of early transcriptional responses to hypoxia and provide clear evidence for HIF-1-independent pathways for adaptation to oxygen deprivation. C. elegans Culture, Microarray Experiments, and Data Analysis—C. elegans were cultured using standard procedures on NGM plates with an Escherichia coli food source (17Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For hypoxia treatments, plates containing synchronized third stage larvae were placed either in room air (normoxia control) or a sealed plexiglass chamber with constant gas flow. Compressed air and pure nitrogen were mixed to achieve the appropriate oxygen concentration, as assayed by an oxygen sensor (15Jiang H. Guo R. Powell-Coffman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7916-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We were most interested in the earliest hif-1-dependent and hif-1-independent responses to hypoxia. Therefore, we assayed mRNA expression at the earliest time point at which the F22B5.4 transcript was consistently induced (4 h at 21 °C in 0.1% oxygen). At the time that this study was conducted, F22B5.4 was the only C. elegans transcript shown to be induced by hypoxia. The F22B5.4 putative 5′-regulatory sequences contain multiple elements similar to the mammalian hypoxia response element (HRE), the DNA binding site for the HIF-1 transcriptional complex, and F22B5.4 is expressed at high levels in egl-9 mutants (6Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). These data suggested that F22B5.4 might be a direct target for C. elegans HIF-1. For the microarray experiments, three strains were assayed: wild-type N2, hif-1 (ia04), and vhl-1 (ok161). Worms were incubated for 4 h in 21% oxygen or 0.1% oxygen at 21 °C. Animals were quickly harvested in ice-cold M9 buffer, and poly(A) RNA was isolated using established procedures. No more than 3 min elapsed between the removal of plates from the hypoxic chamber and the addition of TRIzol. The microarray hybridizations were performed by Min Jiang in the laboratory of Stuart K. Kim at Stanford University (18Jiang M. Ryu J. Kiraly M. Duke K. Reinke V. Kim S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). cDNA from animals incubated in 21% O2 (normoxia) was labeled with Cy5, and cDNA from hypoxia-treated worms was labeled with Cy3. There were 18 mRNA samples: (two oxygen concentrations × three genotypes × three independent experiments). Each hybridization compared expression in normoxia versus hypoxia for one genotype, and nine experiments were performed. The raw data and the normalized data are available at the Stanford Microarray Data base. The following criteria were used to filter the data: FLAG = 0; failed = 0; red and green fluorescence intensity at least 2-fold above background. We averaged the log2 values (hypoxia net intensity/normalized normoxia net intensity) from each experiment. Student's t test p values were determined with the averages for each strain. To identify putative regulatory elements in hif-1-dependent genes, we used the motif-finding program at bioprospector.stanford.edu (BioProspector). We searched for DNA sequences that were overrepresented in the 18 genes most strongly induced by hypoxia in Table I relative to the 47 hif-1-independent genes. Sequences 200–2,000 bp upstream from each putative translational start were used for this analysis. Gene cluster analyses were performed using tools available at PlantGDB (19Dong Q. Schlueter S.D.

Open table in a new tab Viability Assays—To create DNA constructs for bacteria-mediated RNAi, cDNAs provided by Yuji Kohara were subcloned into the L4440 double-T7 vector (20Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). When cDNAs were not available, coding sequences were PCR amplified using primers designed by Valerie Reinke (21Reinke V. Smith H.E. Nance J. Wang J. Van Doren C. Begley R. Jones S.J. Davis E.B. Scherer S. Ward S. Kim S.K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs were transformed into E. coli strain HT115 (DE3) (20Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). RNAi analyses were performed as described previously (22Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome Biology. 2001; (http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/1/research/0002)PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, embryonic and larval viability was assayed in the following mutant strains: hif-1 (ia04), cam-1 (gm122), egl-9 (sa307), fmo-12 (ok299), fmo-14 (ok294), inx-2 (ok376), phy-2 (ok177), and vab-1 (e2). Assays for viability at 21 or 0.5% O2 at 21 °C were performed as described previously (16Padilla P.A. Nystul T.G. Zager R.A. Johnson A.C. Roth M.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were conducted for each condition, and Student's t test was used to judge whether averaged values differed significantly. RNA Blots—Total RNAs were isolated from synchronized L3 stage wild-type (Bristol strain N2) worms, hif-1 (ia04) mutants, vhl-1 (ok161) mutants, and hif-1 (ia04) vhl-1 (ok161) double mutants that had been incubated for 4 h in normoxia or hypoxia (0.5% O2). The RNA samples were fractionated via agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. DNA probes for RNA blot analyses were amplified using published primers (21Reinke V. Smith H.E. Nance J. Wang J. Van Doren C. Begley R. Jones S.J. Davis E.B. Scherer S. Ward S. Kim S.K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes, and signals were detected and quantified using a phosphorimager. GFP Reporter Analysis—To generate the phy-2:GFP construct pSH01, DNA was PCR amplified using the primers Phy2PF2 (PstI) 5′-ggcgctgcagAGACTATAGTCTATAGCTGAAAACG and Phy2PR2 (BamHI) 5′-gcgggatccACTGCTCTCATTCTGAAAGACAAATC. The PCR product includes the phy-2 sequence from –1715 bp to +11 bp relative to the translational start site (23Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These regulatory sequences were cloned into GFP vector pPD95.75 (provided by A. Fire, Carnegie Institution of Washington). To create transgenic animals, the DNA was coinjected with the pRF-4 rol-6 marker (24Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Five independent transgenic lines were examined. The primary goals of these studies were to identify hypoxia-induced gene expression changes in C. elegans and to determine which of these responses to hypoxia were regulated by hif-1. Toward these aims, we analyzed mRNA expression patterns in synchronized populations of wild-type worms that were cultured in standard laboratory conditions (normoxia) or in hypoxia. We also assayed mRNA from two mutant strains: (a) animals carrying the strong loss-of-function mutation in hif-1 and (b) C. elegans that carry a deletion in vhl-1 and express the HIF-1 protein at constitutively high levels. RNA was isolated from three independent experiments for each experimental condition (three genotypes; normoxia versus hypoxia). mRNAs were hybridized to whole genome microarrays that contained probes for 17,817 predicted genes (94% of the genome). To identify hypoxia-induced gene expression changes in wild-type worms, we used two criteria. First, we identified genes that exhibited a significant difference in mRNA levels in hypoxia versus normoxia as judged by Student's t test, p value <0.05. Second, we focused on genes that showed an average hypoxia-induced difference in mRNA expression greater than or equal to 2-fold. 110 genes met both of these criteria. To determine which of these gene expression changes were dependent upon hif-1 function, we examined the data from hif-1 (ia04) mutants. 63 of the 110 hypoxia-responsive genes were not significantly regulated by hypoxia in hif-1 (ia04) mutants (p value > 0.05), and they are listed in Table I. In this article, we will refer to this class of genes as “hif-1-dependent.” The 47 genes listed in Table II were expressed at significantly higher or lower levels in hypoxia in hif-1-deficient animals (p value < 0.05; Table II), and we will refer to them as “hif-1-independent” genes. In most cases, hypoxia caused increased gene expression, but 6 of the hif-1-dependent genes and 3 of the hif-1-independent genes were down-regulated by hypoxia. A total of 654 genes met less stringent criteria for hypoxia-responsive genes (1.5-fold average difference between hypoxia and normoxia treatments; p < 0.05), and they are listed in the supplemental data.Table II47 genes regulated by hypoxia independently of hif-1 functionGeneDescriptionWild type H/N ratioaH/N = mRNA expression in a hypoxic condition relative to mRNA levels in a normoxic condition.

Open table in a new tab To validate further the microarray data and to compare directly the expression of certain genes in the presence or absence of hif-1 and vhl-1 function, we analyzed the expression of a subset of the hypoxia-induced genes on RNA blots. C. elegans hypoxia has been defined as oxygen concentrations between 0.1 and 2% (25Van Voorhies W.A. Ward S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 2467-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nystul T.G. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9133-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To confirm that the gene expression changes detected by our microarray analyses were induced by another oxygen concentration in this range, we repeated the experiments using 0.5% oxygen. We tested eight of the hif-1-dependent genes. One of these genes, F57B9.1, was not expressed at levels detectable by RNA blot analysis. The other seven genes were (a) induced by hypoxia in wild-type animals; (b) expressed at lower levels in hif-1-defective mutants; (c) expressed at higher levels in animals lacking vhl-1 function; and (d) expressed at low levels in double mutants, consistent with VHL-1 acting as a regulator of HIF-1 (Fig. 1A). Genes were chosen for RNA blot analysis based on signal intensity, level of differential expression, and, in some cases, predicted function.

https://openalex.org/W2117062067,"TRPM7/ChaK1 is a unique channel/kinase that contains a TRPM channel domain with 6 transmembrane segments fused to a novel serine-threonine kinase domain at its C terminus. The goal of this study was to investigate a possible role of kinase activity and autophosphorylation in regulation of channel activity of TRPM7/ChaK1. Residues essential for kinase activity were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Two major sites of autophosphorylation were identified in vitro by mass spectrometry at Ser1511 and Ser1567, and these sites were found to be phosphorylated in intact cells. TRPM7/ChaK1 is a cation-selective channel that exhibits strong outward rectification and inhibition by millimolar levels of internal [Mg2+]. Mutation of the two autophosphorylation sites or of a key catalytic site that abolished kinase activity did not alter channel activity measured by whole-cell recording or Ca2+ influx. Inhibition by internal Mg2+ was also unaffected in the autophosphorylation site or “kinase-dead” mutants. Moreover, kinase activity was enhanced by Mg2+, was decreased by Zn2+, and was unaffected by Ca2+. In contrast, channel activity was inhibited by all three of these divalent cations. However, deletion of much of C-terminal kinase domain resulted in expression of an apparently inactive channel. We conclude that neither current activity nor regulation by internal Mg2+ is affected by kinase activity or autophosphorylation but that the kinase domain may play a structural role in channel assembly or subcellular localization.

TRPM7/ChaK1 is a cation-selective channel that exhibits strong outward rectification and inhibition by millimolar levels of internal [Mg2+]. Mutation of the two autophosphorylation sites or of a key catalytic site that abolished kinase activity did not alter channel activity measured by whole-cell recording or Ca2+ influx. Inhibition by internal Mg2+ was also unaffected in the autophosphorylation site or “kinase-dead” mutants. Moreover, kinase activity was enhanced by Mg2+, was decreased by Zn2+, and was unaffected by Ca2+. In contrast, channel activity was inhibited by all three of these divalent cations. However, deletion of much of C-terminal kinase domain resulted in expression of an apparently inactive channel. We conclude that neither current activity nor regulation by internal Mg2+ is affected by kinase activity or autophosphorylation but that the kinase domain may play a structural role in channel assembly or subcellular localization. Recent studies have characterized several unique protein kinases that display no amino acid sequence similarity to the superfamily of protein kinase A-related enzymes, including eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (EF2K) 1The abbreviations used are: EF2K, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase; MHCK, myosin heavy chain kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. and Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinases A, B, and C (MHCK A-C). Several additional catalytic domains related to EF2K and MHCK have been identified through data base searches in mammals as well as in nematode worm, although the function of these potential protein kinases is not known (1Ryazanov A.G.

Using this approach, we and others identified an 1863-amino acid polypeptide (termed ChaK for channel kinase) that contained a TRP-related channel domain fused to the atypical kinase domain at its C terminus (3Drennan D. Ryazanov A.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 85: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol.

The same gene product was also identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using a portion of phospholipase C β1 as bait (and termed TRP-PLIK) (5Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) and in a screen for TRP-related channels (and termed LTRPC7) (6Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Based on revised nomenclature for TRP channels, the kinase-containing TRP has been termed TRPM7/ChaK1 based on its similarity to long TRP family members, melastatin, MTR1 (TRPM5), and LTRPC2 (TRPM2) (7Clapham D.E. Montell C. Schultz G. Julius D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A closely related gene, TRPM6/ChaK2 has also been identified as being mutated in familial hypomagnesemia (8Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann N.L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Members of the TRP family of channels contain six predicted transmembrane segments and are related to the superfamily of ion channels that include voltage-gated K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (12Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 13Montell C. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; RE1: 1-17Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase domain at the C terminus of TRPM7, other regions of potential functional importance are a putative coiled-coil domain and a domain enriched in Ser/Pro and Thr/Pro motifs (the STP domain) (Fig. 1A). We have recently determined the crystal structure of the kinase domain of TRPM7 (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The TRPM7 kinase domain (residues 1551-1577) forms a domain-swapped bilobate dimer. Despite a lack of amino acid sequence similarity to the classical eukaryotic protein kinases, the TRPM7 kinase domain exhibits within its N-terminal lobe secondary and tertiary structural similarity to the protein kinase A superfamily as well as to metabolic enzymes with ATP grasp domains. However, in contrast to the classical kinase superfamily, the C-terminal lobe of the TRPM7 kinase domain contains a zinc finger homology domain, and zinc appears to play a structural role in TRPM7 and related EF2K/MHCK family members (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Previous studies in heterologous expression systems have indicated that TRPM7 exhibits a steep outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation and permeability to monovalent and divalent cations (5Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 6Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R.

Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) demonstrated that millimolar concentrations of internal Mg2+, MgATP, MgGTP, or other Mg2+-nucleotides inhibit TRPM7. In RBL and Jurkat T cells, the native correlate of TRPM7 was described and termed MagNuM (magnesium nucleotide-dependent metal cation) (14Hermosura M.C. Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 445-458Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), or MIC (Mg2+-inhibited cation) (15Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen.

Similar currents have also been described in cardiac fibroblasts (17Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (18Zakharov S.I. Smani T. Leno E. Macianskiene R. Mubagwa K. Bolotina V.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and brain microglia (19Jiang X. Newell E.W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42867-42876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The role of the kinase domain and phosphorylation in the ion channel function is controversial (for a recent review, see Ref. 20Fleig A. Penner R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 633-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Runnels et al. (5Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) reported that mutations of kinase domain residues (probably involved in ATP and zinc binding (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)) apparently abolished channel activity measured in whole-cell recording. Subsequently, Schmitz et al. (10Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) showed that whereas TRPM7 mutants with impaired kinase activity formed functional channels, these channels exhibited reduced sensitivity to Mg2+. Moreover, a kinase deletion mutant exhibited increased Mg2+ sensitivity. From these studies, Schmitz et al. (10Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) concluded that the TRPM7 kinase domain was somehow coupled negatively to the mechanism(s) that mediated Mg2+-dependent inhibition. In this study, we have characterized the biochemical and functional properties of the TRPM7 kinase activity. Guided by the crystal structure, we have confirmed the identity of amino acids critical for kinase activity. We have identified two major sites of TRPM7 autophosphorylation by mass spectrometry and demonstrated that these sites are phosphorylated in intact cells. Using whole-cell patch clamp recording, we have measured the magnitude of the constitutive current conducted by wild-type TRPM7 and its kinase-dead and autophosphorylation site variants and compared the extent of inhibition by internal Mg2+ among them. We have also measured the corresponding Ca2+ influx in intact mammalian cells overexpressing the wild-type channel and the variants. We show that autophosphorylation site or kinase-dead TRPM7 mutant channels do not differ from wild-type channels in their ability to form functional ion channels and in their sensitivity to internal Mg2+. Thus, TRPM7 channel function and regulation by Mg2+ are clearly dissociated from autophosphorylation or kinase activity. Interestingly, results obtained following deletion of the much of the kinase domain suggest that this C-terminal region may play a structural role in channel assembly or subcellular localization. cDNA Cloning—Data base analysis, which used tBlastN, identified the expressed sequence tag, AA138771 (GenBank™). Mouse embryo rapid screen cDNA library panels (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) were screened by PCR using the primers based on the expressed sequence tag sequence (sense, 5′-AGCAGTCAAAGTGCTGTGTAC-3′; antisense, 5′-CATCTTCTCCTAGATTGGCAG-3′). A mouse embryo library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was then screened using a fragment from the PCR analysis. Multiple rounds of screening subsequently yielded 50 independent overlapping cDNA clones, which were sequenced and aligned. For expression in mammalian cells, full-length TRPM7, TRPM7-ΔKD, and TRPM7 mutants were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Expression of Wild-type and Mutant TRPM7 Kinase Domain in Sf9 Cells—A recombinant 316-residue kinase domain fragment (TRPM7 residues 1548-1863) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells with a hexahistidine tag by using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) essentially as described (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The expressed protein was purified using Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method was employed to generate point mutants, R1622L, K1646R, K1727A, N1731V, D1765N, D1765A, Q1767N, Q1767A, T1774S, T1774A, D1775A, and N1795A. The wild type pFastBac construct was used as a template, and PCR was carried out for each mutant with a set of sense and antisense mutagenic primers (essentially as described in the Stratagene QuikChange™ kit). The PCR products were treated with DpnI restriction enzyme and purified through agarose gel electrophoresis. Purified DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli (DH5a), and transformants harboring mutant constructs were identified. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant pFastBac constructs were used to generate mutant recombinant viruses, and protein was expressed and purified as in the case of wild type. Expression of GST-TRPM7 Kinase Domain in E. coli—For bacterial expression, DNA fragments were subcloned in frame with GST using the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins including either residues 1180-1863 or 1580-1863 of TRPM7 were expressed in E. coli (DE3) and purified using standard methods. Phosphorylation Assays—Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate (unless otherwise indicated), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm [32P]ATP (specific activity, 2-5 × 102 cpm/pmol), and GST-TRPM7-KD (10 μg/ml) or Sf9 cell TRPM7-KD or mutant proteins (∼1 μg/ml), with or without myelin basic protein (MBP; 50 μg/ml). For analysis of the effect of Mg2+ and other divalents cations on kinase activity, GST-TRPM7 was incubated with MBP in a reaction mixture containing different concentrations of Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+. All reactions were initiated by the addition of [32P]ATP and carried out at 30 °C for 10-30 min. In the studies shown in Figs. 3D and 4B, GST-TRPM7-(1180-1863) (wild-type sequence), GST-TRPM7-(1180-1863) (S1511A and S1567A; see details below), and GST-TRPM7-(1180-1863) (TAP sequence; see details below) (100 ng/ml) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C (in Fig. 3D, [32P]ATP was also included). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried and subjected to autoradiography or analysis using a phosphor imager (Fuji). Phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional peptide mapping were performed as described (21Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 4Phosphorylation of TRPM7 in intact cells.

Wild-type TRPM7 was expressed for 24-48 h, and cells were labeled with 32Pi, for 2 h. Cells were incubated without or with ionomycin (5 μm) for 5 min, cell lysates were prepared, and TRPM7 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In other studies, HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type TRPM7 or TRPM7-TAP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell lysates were prepared, and TRPM7 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using phospho-specific or FLAG antibodies. Mass Spectrometry—After SDS-PAGE, bands containing autophosphorylated TRPM7 were excised from the gel, destained, and digested with trypsin (Roche Applied Science). The tryptic peptides were eluted from the gel and collected on POROS R2 beads (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After washing, the peptides were eluted from the beads and spotted onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target using 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid (Sigma) as matrix. MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was carried out on a Voyager-DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). MALDI-ion trap analysis was performed on a modified LCQ (Thermo Finnegan, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer (22Krutchinsky A.N. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5066-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On-line HPLC-MS/MS was performed using a 0.2 × 50-mm MAGIC MS C18 column (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) connected directly to an LCQ-DECA electrospray-ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnegan). Immunofluorescence and Immunoblotting—Antibodies to TRPM7 were made against GST fusion proteins that contained the coiled-coil domain (residues 1145-1321) (in rabbit) or the kinase domain (residues 1580-1863) (in guinea pig) of TRPM7. A phosphorylation state-specific antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser1567 of TRPM7 was generated in rabbit using as antigen a phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 1562-1571 of mouse TRPM7. Antibodies were affinity-purified by absorption to immobilized recombinant proteins or phosphopeptide. For indirect immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy, HEK293 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS). After blocking (5% milk powder) for 30 min, cells were incubated with anti-TRPM7 antibody (guinea pig) for 2 h, washed three times in washing buffer, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-guinea pig antibody for 30 min. Immunoblotting was carried out using standard procedures, and proteins were identified by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Ca2+ Imaging of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells (RIKEN, Tsukuba, Japan) were transfected with wild-type TRPM7 and various mutants using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiencies, estimated by immunofluorescence staining, were typically >80%. Transfected cells were washed in HEPES-buffered saline (120 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.4)) and loaded with 5 μm FURA-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in HEPES-buffered saline for 20 min at 37 °C to allow cleavage of the acetoxymethyl ester. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded at room temperature and analyzed with a video image analysis system (AquaCosmos; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), with excitation alternatively at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Data from 30-50 individual cells were collected per experiment, and ensemble averages were calculated from multiple experiments. Data acquisition was typically for 5-s intervals and lasted for 15 min. Electrophysiology—CHO-K1 cells were grown in F-12K medium with l-glutamine (ATCC, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). Cells were grown in 6-well polystyrene dishes, and 1 day after plating they were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The TRPM7 plasmid (pcDNA3.1) DNA was supplemented with enhanced GFP plasmid (eGFPN3; Clontech) at a 5:1 ratio in order to visualize the transfected cells by their enhanced GFP fluorescence (23Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar). Transfection continued for ∼12 h. For mock transfection, the same procedure was employed, except DNA was omitted. Cells were subsequently trypsinized and plated on acid-washed glass coverslips for recording. For whole-cell patch clamp recording, coverslips with CHO cells were placed on a stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM-35) and superfused with the external solution used for recording. GFP-positive cells were visualized using mercury arc lamp illumination at 290-nm wavelength. Recombinant TRPM7 channel currents were recorded in the whole-cell patch clamp using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Command voltage ramps from -110 to +85 mV (211-ms duration) were applied at 0.5-Hz frequency, and the resulting currents were digitized at 200 μs. Cell and electrode capacitance was compensated with the EPC-9 circuitry. Series resistance was compensated by 85% to avoid potential errors due to large current amplitudes. Resistances of the fire-polished pipettes measured with the internal solutions were 1.5-4 megaohms. The silver-silver chloride ground electrode was connected to the bath solution via an agar bridge. All recordings were made at room temperature. The current amplitude was measured at +80 mV and plotted against time after whole cell recording mode was established. In the majority of cells, the current had reached its maximum less than 6 min after break-in. All CHO cells tested exhibited an endogenous MIC current thought to represent native TRPM7 channels. The endogenous MIC current amplitude at +80 mV averaged 30.6 pA/picofarad (S.E. = 5.6, n = 12). Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and Microcal Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) were used to analyze the data. The following internal solutions were used to record from CHO cells overexpressing wild-type TRPM7 and mutants. The 0 Mg2+ solution contained 130 mm Cs+ glutamate, 12 mm EGTA, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The 4 and 6.5 mm Mg2+ solutions had 130 mm Cs+ glutamate, 12 mm EGTA, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 4 mm/6.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The free Mg2+ concentrations in these solutions were 2.3 and 4 mm, respectively, as calculated by Maxchelator software. The external solution contained 4.5 mm K, 162 mm Na+ aspartate, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glucose, pH 7.3. For testing Ca2+ and Zn2+ inhibition of TRPM7 current, EGTA in the internal solution was replaced with 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm CaCl2 or ZnCl2 added as indicated. Salts were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem. Characterization of the Kinase Activity and Autophosphorylation of TRPM7—To examine the kinase activity of TRPM7, several GST fusion proteins containing the kinase domain and additional N-terminal extensions were expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1 and data not shown). A high level of autophosphorylation of TRPM7-(1180-1863) was observed, predominantly on serine with low phosphorylation of threonine (Fig. 1, B and D). In contrast, much lower autophosphorylation was found for a fragment that contained just the kinase domain (TRPM7-(1580-1863)) (Fig. 1B). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping revealed multiple phosphopeptides (Fig. 1E). TRPM7 also phosphorylated the exogenous substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP), largely on serine residues with low phosphorylation on threonine residues (Fig. 1, C and D). We recently determined the crystal structure of the kinase domain of TRPM7 (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Whereas the likely function of several key amino acids in the kinase domain of TRPM7 was implied by analogy with residues in the classical kinase superfamily, it was important to directly analyze the properties of these residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Moreover, the availability of mutant (kinase-dead) TRPM7 was necessary for the studies described below. Mutation of residues (Arg1622 to leucine; Lys1727 to alanine; Asn1731 to valine; Thr1774 to serine or alanine) likely to be involved directly in binding of phosphate groups of ATP or residues (Gln1767 to asparagine or alanine; Asp1775 to alanine) likely to be involved in metal binding all resulted in very low activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, mutation of residues implicated in catalysis (Lys1646 to arginine; equivalent to the conserved lysine residue of classical kinases that is often mutated to produce a kinase-dead protein; Asp1765 to asparagine or alanine) resulted in very low activity. Mutation of a residue in the glycine motif (Asn1795 to alanine) that may be involved in peptide substrate binding or orientation of the substrate-binding loop resulted in low but measurable activity. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Phosphorylation Sites in TRPM7—TRPM7-(1180-1863) phosphorylated in vitro as described above was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The TRPM7 band was digested in the gel with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A). Since the addition of HPO3 causes an increase in mass of 80 Da, potential phosphopeptides within the tryptic map were identified by searching the observed signals for shifts of 80 Da relative to expected tryptic peptides. Three peptides showing an 80-Da shift were observed, corresponding to residues 1564-1576 (predicted phosphorylated mass 1516.7 Da, observed mass 1516.4 Da), 1501-1521 (predicted mass 2380.5, observed mass 2380.3), and 1564-1584 (predicted mass 2418.7, observed mass 2418.4). These peptides were subjected to fragmentation in a MALDI-ion trap mass spectrometer (22Krutchinsky A.N. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Anal.

Other fragment ions confirmed the identity of each tryptic peptide. The MS2 spectrum of the 1501-1521 peptide contained fragment ions showing that the major site of phosphorylation in this peptide was Ser1511 (data not shown). The MALDI-ion trap fragmentation data from the other two peptides did not allow us to determine whether Ser1565 or Ser1567 was the site of phosphorylation, so the 1564-1584 peptide was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS (Fig. 3, B and C). The fragmentation pattern of the triply charged ion indicated that Ser1567 was phosphorylated in the 1564-1584 peptide. Mutation of both Ser1511 and Ser1567"

Here we applied an in vitro whole cell panning approach using antibody phage display technology to identify cell-surface epitopes specifically expressed on human blood BDCA3+ DCs. A single-chain antibody fragment (anti-1F12 scFv) was isolated that recognizes a conserved surface antigen expressed on both human BDCA3+ DCs and mouse CD8α+ DCs. We demonstrate that anti-1F12 scFv binds Nectin-like protein 2 (Necl2, Tslc1, SynCaM, SgIGSF, or Igsf4), an adhesion molecule involved in tumor suppression, synapse formation, and spermatogenesis. Thus, Necl2 defines a specialized subset of DCs in both mouse and human. We further show that Necl2 binds Class-I-restricted T-cell-associated molecule (CRTAM), a receptor primarily expressed on activated cytotoxic lymphocytes. When present on antigen presenting cells, Necl2 regulates IL-22 expression by activated CD8+ T-cells. We propose that Necl2/CRTAM molecular pair could regulate a large panel of cell/cell interactions both within and outside of the immune system.

Defining Dendritic Cells across Species Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 23PreviewDendritic cells are often called the sentinels of the immune system because they can infiltrate peripheral tissues and engulf, process, and present antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex molecules. These sentinels are not a homogenous population of cells but rather a phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous population of leukocytes that can be divided into distinct subsets, each with specialized immune functions. The subsets are differentiated by their surface epitope expression.

Indeed, DCs can transmigrate through the endothelium, intercalate between mucosal epithelial cells (3Rescigno M. Urbano M. Valzasina B. Francolini M. Rotta G. Bonasio R. Granucci F. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P.

Autoimmun. 2005; 8: 124-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that DCs are not a homogeneous population of cells. Rather, DCs can be divided into distinct subsets each serving a restricted set of specialized functions. For example, mouse splenic DCs can be subdivided into at least three different subsets based on the surface expression of CD8α, CD11b, and CD11c. CD11cbrightCD11b+CD8α– DCs are localized in the marginal zone, require interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) for development (6Suzuki S. Honma K. Matsuyama T. Suzuki K. Toriyama K. Akitoyo I.

In contrast, CD11cbrightCD11b–CD8α+ DCs are found in and around the T-cell area, require IRF8 for development (8Aliberti J. Schulz O. Pennington D.J. Tsujimura H. Reis e Sousa C. Ozato K. Sher A.

Finally, CD11clowCD11b–CD8α+/– DCs, also known as plasmacytoid DC (PDC) precursors, require IRF8 for development (9Schiavoni G. Mattei F. Sestili P. Borghi P. Venditti M. Morse 3rd, H.C.

Immunol. 2002; 63: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Study of human blood DCs has also revealed the existence of at least three major subsets: CD1c+ DCs, BDCA3+ DCs, and Neuropilin-1(BDCA4)+ BDCA2+ PDC (14Dzionek A. Fuchs A. Schmidt P. Cremer S. Zysk M. Miltenyi S. Buck D.W. Schmitz J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6037-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). In rats, beside PDCs (15Hubert F.X. Voisine C. Louvet C. Heslan M. Josien R. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), two DC subsets have been identified in the lymph: CD4+SIRPα+ DCs and CD4+SIRPα– DCs (16Yrlid U. Macpherson G. APMIS. 2003; 111: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). With the exception of PDCs, how mouse, rat, and human DC subsets relate to each other has remained elusive. Consequently, it has been difficult to compare functional DC subset data obtained from different animal models. Our understanding of DC biology in mammals would greatly benefit from a common cross-species phenotypic definition. Currently, DC subset definition relies heavily upon isolation of antibodies obtained from rodents immunized with allogeneic DCs. We reasoned that, if highly conserved DC subset markers do exist, they would probably not be easily targetable through in vivo immunization. Indeed, since DCs play a critical role in the initiation and the maintenance of immune responses, B-cells, which target conserved epitopes present on host DCs, might be put at a disadvantage and not perceive signals necessary for their survival or differentiation into antibody producing cells. Whole cell panning with filamentous phage offers an attractive alternative to immunization because it can be conducted in vitro in a competitive setting, thus allowing selection and counter-selection with a tightly controlled stringency and without the limitations linked to interspecies compatibility or to targeting molecules essential to the host immune response. Whole cell panning approaches using phage antibody libraries have been successfully used to isolate antibodies specific to DCs (17Lekkerkerker A. Logtenberg T. J. Immunol.

Molecular targets of phage antibodies can be identified using cell sorting and biochemical/cloning techniques (18Ridgway J.B. Ng E. Kern J.A. Lee J. Brush J. Goddard A. Carter P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2718-2723PubMed Google Scholar, 22van der Vuurst de Vries A.R. Logtenberg T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3898-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we applied a whole cell panning phage display approach to select a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) that recognizes an epitope expressed on both human BDCA3+ DCs and mouse CD8α+ DCs. We show that this scFv binds Nectin-like protein 2 (Necl2), a type-I cell surface protein previously shown to be involved in tumor suppression, synapse formation, and spermatogenesis. We further show that Class-I-restricted T-cell-associated molecule (CRTAM), a surface receptor primarily expressed on activated cytotoxic lymphocytes, constitutes a counter-structure for Necl2. Thus, Necl2 defines a specialized subset of DCs across species and participates in the cross-talk between antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Antibodies—Unless specified otherwise all antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-FcγRII (IV-3) antibody producing cell line was obtained from ATCC (www.atcc.com, catalog number HB-217). BDCA-3 and BDCA-4 antibodies were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec Inc. Biotin-conjugated anti-CD162 (PL1) was obtained from Ancell Co. (Bayport, MN). PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2b antibody was purchased from Southern Biotech. Anti-hNecl1 (M170) antibody was produced at Immunex Co. Constructs—The extracellular domain of hNecl2 (amino acids 1–374) and hNecl1 (amino acids 1–363) were PCR-amplified and fused to human IgG1 Fc. After subcloning into pDC409 expression vector (27Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), recombinant protein was produced in transiently transfected CV1/EBNA (hNecl1-Fc) cells or CKE5 cells (hNecl2-Fc) (28Ettehadieh E. Wong-Madden S. Aldrich T. Lane K. Morris A.E. Cytotechnology. 2002; 38: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For the mouse and human CRTAM constructs, the natural leader sequences were substituted with that of a VH5a leader sequence modified with a 3′-end PciI site (MGSTAILALLLAVLQGVSAHMA). CRTAM extracellular domains (amino acids 17–285) were then fused to the mouse IgG1 Fc tail, subcloned into pDC409, and produced in CV1/EBNA cells. Mice—Female C57BL/6 (B6) (8–12 weeks of age) and OT-I TCR-Tg mice specific for chicken ovalbumin (OVA) peptide 357–364 (OT-Ip) in the context of H-2Kb (29Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Heath W.R. Howard J.L. Bevan M.J. Carbone F.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar) were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and bred at Amgen (Seattle, WA). All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and according to federal guidelines. Patients—Healthy volunteers received either 10 or 25 mg/kg/day of Flt3-ligand (FL; Immunex Co.) for 10 consecutive days in conformity with two institutional review board approved protocols (Baylor Institute, Investigational New Drug number 7805; Duke University, Investigational New Drug number 8209). The volunteers had normal blood counts and chemistries and were >18 years of age. Prior to entering the study, each volunteer signed an informed written consent that fulfills Institutional Review Board guidelines. FL-treated volunteers underwent apheresis at base line and after 10 days of FL injection. Mononuclear cells were then selected by either standard Ficoll/Hypaque gradient method or by using continuous-flow cell processor COBE® 2991™ (Gambro® BCT™). Purified PBMCs were resuspended at 107 to 108 cells/ml in medium containing 44% RPMI 1640, 44% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 12% dimethyl sulfoxide and then cryo-preserved. Phage Library—Three scFv libraries (Cambridge Antibody Technologies) with total diversity of 1010 (30Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) were used to select specific binders to human Dendritic Cells. An aliquot containing 4.1012 cfu phage in the hyperphage format (31Rondot S. Koch J. Breitling F. Dubel S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was first blocked in 500 μl of 3% nonfat milk in PBS and dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C. The blocked phage were incubated with 108 PBMC from FL-treated healthy volunteers for 2 h at room temperature with gentle mixing. Cells were then pelleted, washed three times, and then labeled with anti-BDCA3 antibody. Approximately 105 CD162brightBDCA3+ cells were purified by magnetic-activated and subsequently fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Sorted cells were washed once with PBS, and cell-bound phage were eluted with 200 μl of 100 nm HCl for 10 min at room temperature and then neutralized with half-volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). A log phase culture of Escherichia coli strain of TG1 was infected with eluted phage and plated on 2×YT agar plates that contain 2% glucose and 50 μg/ml of carbencillin. The resulting colonies were propagated and used to prepare phage for the next round of panning. 1011 cfu phage were used to repeat the panning process. After the second round of panning, eluted phage were used to infect TG1 cells and plated on 2×YT plates with 2% glucose and 50 μg/ml carbencillin. After 24 h, 400 individual colonies were picked into 96-well plates and grown overnight to make glycerol stocks. FACS Analysis of PBMC Using Phage—Polyclonal or individual phage were prepared from the glycerol stock from different stages of panning and used to compare their binding specificity to different subsets of human PBMC. Briefly, 1011 cfu phage were blocked in PBS + 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then used to bind PBMCs for 1 h at room temperature. PBMCs were obtained by standard Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation of blood obtained from normal healthy volunteers. Phage revelation was performed by HRP-conjugated anti-M13 major coat protein antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) followed by FITC-conjugated anti-HRP antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Production of scFv-Fc Fusion Proteins—The DNA fragment encoding scFv region of 1F12 was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pDC409huIgG1 to produce scFv-Fc fusion protein as described previously (32Fredericks Z.L. Forte C. Capuano I.V. Zhou H. Vanden Bos T. Carter P. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The 1F12 scFv-Fc construct was used to transfect COS1-PKB cells, and the fusion protein was purified using protein-A affinity chromatography. Histology—Human thymi, spleens, lymph nodes, and tonsils were obtained from an in-house tissue bank. Murine tissues were collected from adult BALB/c mice. For paraffin tissues, samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed routinely overnight in a Shandon automated tissue processor and then embedded. Frozen tissue samples were snap-frozen in OCT compound by immersion in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Sections were cut at 5 μm and stained with the predetermined optimal concentrations of biotinylated anti-1F12 scFv-Fc. An unrelated scFv-Fc protein served as a negative control. At the same time, sections were stained with commercially available anti-mouse CD8α antibody or anti-BDCA3 antibody. For confocal usage, biotinylated reagents were subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated Streptavidin fluorochrome (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Non-biotinylated primary antibodies were incubated with Molecular Probes anti-IgG Alexa Fluor®555 fluorochrome (Molecular Probes). All fluorescent slides were examined and photographed on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation/Western Blotting—108 Bone marrow-derived DC (33Brasel K. De Smedt T. Smith J.L. Maliszewski C.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 3029-3039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-CD3ϵ-activated C57BL6 mouse splenic CD8+ T-cells were surface-biotinylated (EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-biotinylation kit) and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (PBS + 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce) with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Cell debris were spun out (3000 rpm, 15 min) and supernatants were precleared with 100 μl of packed protein-A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 4 °C before addition of anti-1F12 scFv-Fc, Necl2-Fc, or corresponding controls (unrelated scFv-Fc and Necl1-Fc) at 5 μg/330 μl. After 3-h incubation on ice, 15 μl of packed protein-A beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice in ice-cold lysis buffer and once in ice-cold PBS before SDS-PAGE analysis on 4–20% Novex® Tris-glycine gel. Reduction, Alkylation, and Digestion—Following SDS-PAGE, protein was stained using Colloidal Blue (Invitrogen). Gel bands were manually excised, and the gel pieces were processed using an automated protein digestion station (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) that performed the tasks of reduction and alkylation of cysteines, tryptic digestion (Promega, Madison, WI), and extraction of the peptides. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides was performed on a Micromass QTOF 1 instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Peptides were sequenced by on-line microcapillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) operated in a data-dependent mode. The capillary column was made from a piece of 50 μm inner diameter fused silica line with an internal frit (New Objective, Cambridge, MA) that was packed with YMC ODS-AQ resin (Waters, Milford, MA). The liquid chromatography gradient (0–75% solvent B in 60 min, solvent A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.001% heptafluorobutyric acid, and 5% acetonitrile; solvent B = 80% acetonitrile) was developed using an Eldex Micropro syringe pump (Eldex, Napa, CA) operating at 8 μl/min. A preinjector splitter cut the flow to ∼250 nl/min. The effluent of the column was directed into an Upchurch (Oak Harbor, WA) micro-tee containing a platinum electrode and a New Objective uncoated fused silica tip (360 μm outer diameter, 20 μm inner diameter, pulled to a 10-μm opening). Identification of Protein—Peptides were identified using the Mascot program (34Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the de novo sequencing program Lutefisk (35Taylor J.A. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) as well as an additional data base search program written in-house. Search parameters used were peptide mass tolerance of 0.45 Da, fragment ion tolerance of 0.25 Da, oxidized methionine was the only variable modification allowed, and the nr protein sequence data base from the NCBI was searched. A reversed nr data base was also searched to determine appropriate scoring thresholds to reduce false positive rates (<0.25%) for individual peptides. Lentiviral Vectors and Transduction—Both fl-hNecl1 and fl-hNecl2 were subcloned into the lentiviral vector pLV410G using Gateway® Technology (Invitrogen). pLV410G was derived from pRRL-cPPT-CMV-X-PRE-SIN (36Barry S.C. Harder B. Brzezinski M. Flint L.Y. Seppen J. Osborne W.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to contain the human eF1a promoter as well as the attR1/attR2 Gateway® cassette. Production of vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein pseudotyped packaged lentiviral constructs was performed by transient transfection of 293ME cells (cell line stably expressing the macrophage scavenging receptor and the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA). Each semiconfluent 15-cm plate of 293ME cells was cotransfected with 4.7 μg of pCMVDR8.2 (37Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), 2.3 μg of lentiviral transfer vector, 2.0 μg of pMD.G (expresses vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein) (37Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), and 90 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 9.0-ml volume of Opti-MEM according to the manufacturer's protocols (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). The next day, transfection medium was replaced with 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% FBS, and the viral supernatants were harvested at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. The packaged viral vectors were concentrated from 0.22-μm filtered viral supernatant by ultracentrifugation in Beckman SW28 at 25,000 rpm for 2 h, then resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS and stored at –80 °C. Serial dilution of concentrated virus supernatants were used to transduce 105 EL4 cells (ATCC, catalog number TIB-41) in 250 μl of culture medium containing 10 μg/ml DEAE overnight. Cells were then expanded in 5 ml of culture medium. hNecl1 and hNecl2 transduction efficiency was assessed by flow cytometry using biotinylated mouse anti-hNecl1 antibody and anti-1F12 scFv, respectively. Optimal transduction yielded 10% positive cells that were then enriched by MACS® using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). Cell Aggregation Assay—EL4 thymoma cells and Necl1+EL4 and Necl2+EL4 cells were labeled with 10 μm CFDA-SE (Molecular Probes, catalog number V-12883) according to the manufacturer's specifications, mixed with equal numbers of unlabeled EL4, Necl1+EL4, or Necl2+EL4, and cultured at 5.105 cells/ml in 8-well MultiDishes (Nunc, Rochester, NY). hCRTAM-Fc (1 μg/ml) was added either at the culture initiation or after formation of cell clusters (4 h) without disrupting cell aggregates. EL4/OT1 Coculture—EL4 cells or EL4-Necl2 stable transfectants were incubated for 2 h with 100 μm H2-K(b)-restricted OVA-derived peptide (SIINFEKL, Anaspec Inc., San Jose, CA), washed extensively, and cocultured with CD8+ T purified from the spleen and lymph nodes of two female OT1 mice using a Miltenyi Biotech CD8+ T-cell-negative enrichment kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. For mRNA collection experiments, 106 EL4 cells/ml were irradiated (3000 rad) and then cocultured for 3 days with 2.105 OT1 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 10% heat inactivated FBS. CD8+ T-cells were then harvested and separated from EL4 cells by MACS®-positive selection using PE-conjugated anti-mouse Vα2 TCR + anti-PE Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). CD8+ T purity (>95%) was assessed by flow cytometry before mRNA extraction using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). For cytotoxic assay, 104 EL4 cells/ml were stained with a combination of PKH-26 and carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and then cocultured with increasing numbers of OT1 cells in round bottom 96-well microtitration plates in triplicates. EL4 cytolysis was then determined at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h by flow cytometry as described previously (38Sheehy M.E. McDermott A.B. Furlan S.N. Klenerman P. Nixon D.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 249: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR Analysis—mRNA was reverse-transcribed using Roche Applied Science/Applied Biosystems TaqMan reverse transcriptase reagents (catalog number N8080234) after random hexamer priming (catalog number N8080127). Cytokine primers/probe sets were obtained from Applied Biosystems' Assay-on-Demand™. Murine hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (muHPRT) primer/probe set was used in parallel reactions as a sample control and for determination of relative cytokine expression. Identification of a Unique Blood Dendritic Cell Subpopulation—Peripheral blood was collected from healthy volunteers injected daily with FL. Mononuclear cells were then isolated and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. A rare (0.12 ± 0.04% of PBMC, n = 7) population of cells was identified by their uniquely bright expression of surface CD162 (Fig. 1). Those cells appeared myeloid in origin as they expressed CD11c, CD13, and CD33. In contrast, CD162bright cells did not show any detectable surface expression of CD2, CD11b, CD14, CD15s(slewX), or FcγRII-A (Fig. 1). CD162bright cells with identical phenotypic characteristics were also found in the blood of normal healthy volunteers although in lower abundance (0.05 ± 0.02, n = 8). Since FL is a known DC growth factor, we hypothesized that CD162bright cells might represent a previously uncharacterized population of peripheral blood DCs. To test this hypothesis, CD162bright cells were purified by flow cytometry and cultured in the presence of allogeneic T-lymphocytes. Unlike CD14+ monocytes, CD162bright cells were capable of inducing proliferation of allogeneic T-lymphocytes, as assessed by tritiated thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1). Thus CD162bright cells are allo-competent DCs. In the course of this study, Dzionek et al. described a monoclonal antibody against a dendritic cell surface antigen (BDCA3) (14Dzionek A. Fuchs A. Schmidt P. Cremer S. Zysk M. Miltenyi S. Buck D.W. Schmitz J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6037-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Anti-BDCA3 antibody specifically labels a rare population of human blood CD11c+CD11b– DCs (14Dzionek A. Fuchs A. Schmidt P. Cremer S. Zysk M. Miltenyi S. Buck D.W. Schmitz J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6037-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). We tested whether anti-BDCA3 antibody would label CD162bright DCs in the blood of normal and FL-treated healthy volunteers. CD162bright DCs were the only blood mononuclear cells labeled with anti-BDCA3 antibodies. Thus, we have identified a rare population of human blood DCs that specifically expresses BDCA3 and is expanded by in vivo administration of FL. 1F12, a CD162brightBDCA3+ DC Cell Surface Marker—We reasoned that a whole cell panning phage display approach could be applied in vitro to target BDCA3+ DCs in the context of whole PBMCs. Scfv-filamentous phage from a highly diverse library (>1010 clones) were incubated with PBMCs from FL-treated healthy volunteers. After extensive washes, CD162brightBDCA3+ cells were purified by magnetic activated and fluorescence cell sorting. Phage bound to the surface of BDCA3+ DC were then eluted by acid treatment and amplified in E. coli (see “Materials and Methods”). Two successive rounds of sel"

Vif targets APOBEC3G for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by forming an SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Cullin5, Elongin B, and Elongin C (Vif-BC-Cul5) through a novel SOCS-box motif. In this paper, we have established an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay with purified Vif-BC-Cul5 complex and reported that the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex could function as an E3 ligase for APOBEC3G in vitro. A Vif-BC-Cul5 complex promotes the in vitro ubiquitination of the wild type, APOBEC3G but not that of D128K mutant, which does not interact with Vif. We have also investigated several loss-of-function Vif mutants. One mutant, SLQ144/146AAA, lost its activity on APOBEC3G because it could not form a complex due to mutations in SOCS-box motif. Other mutants, C114S and C133S, also lost their activity because of loss of the E3 ligase activity of a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex, although these mutants retained the ability to bind to APOBEC3G as well as Cul5 complex. These findings suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is essential for Vif function against APOBEC3G.

Vif has conserved SLQ residues that share similarity with the SOCS-box motif of SOCS6 (10Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and several recent studies have revealed that Vif interacts with cellular proteins, Cullin5 (Cul5), Elongin B (EloB), Elongin C (EloC), and Rbx1 through this novel SOCS-box motif to form a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex, which is a ubiquitin ligase (E3)-like complex (11Yu X.

The ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation system has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction (14Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a multistep process of a three-enzyme cascade involving the ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes (15Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The E3 binds both the protein target and a cognate E2 to mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate protein and plays a pivotal role in substrate recognition and conferring specificity to the ubiquitination pathway. Since a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is an E3-like complex, it has suggested that Vif functions as a substrate recognition subunit of the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex and targets APOBEC3G for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, resulting in inhibition of the incorporation of APOBEC3G into HIV-1 virions and protection of the viral DNA from mutation (10Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 16Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol.

Moreover, there still remain some controversies between the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex formation and/or substrate recognition by Vif and its activity to antagonize APOBEC3G. Here, we have first shown that a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex could indeed work as an E3 ligase complex by an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay using purified Vif-BC-Cul5 complex. By using the assay, we have shown that a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex induces the ubiquitination of the wild type (WT) APOBEC3G, but not that of D128K APOBEC3G, which does not interact with HIV-1 Vif (18Bogerd H.P.

Moreover, we have also shown the clear relationship between the ability of Vif to overcome APOBEC3G and the ubiquitination of APOBEG3G by the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex using several Vif mutants. Expression Vectors and Molecular Clones—The wild type (WT) Vif and mutants (C114S, C133S, and SLQ144/146AAA) were expressed by pgVif, M18, M19, and M29 vectors, respectively (kind gifts from Dr. M.

Cell Lines—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS and penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (PSG) (Invitrogen). M8166 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) containing 10% FCS and PSG. Preparation of HIV-1 Virus and Infectivity Assay—Luciferase reporter viruses with or without Vif were prepared in HEK293T cells by cotransfection of pNL43-Luc (WT) or pNL43/Δvif-Luc (ΔVif) together with a mock vector or expression vectors for APOBEC3G WT or D128K and Vif WT or its mutants by calcium phosphate method as described previously (8Shindo K.

Viruses in the supernatants were collected after 48 h of transfection, and virus titers were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for the p24 antigen (RETRO-TEK, Zepto-Metrix Corp., Buffalo, NY). An adjusted amount of viruses was challenged to target cells, M8166. Twenty-two hours postinfection, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and the luciferase activity was measured with a Luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Values were presented as percent infectivity relative to the value of wild type virus without expression of APOBEC3G. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—To see protein-protein interaction in vivo, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay as described previously (8Shindo K. Takaori-Kondo A. Kobayashi M. Abudu A.

Expression vectors for HA-APOBEC3G WT or D128K were cotransfected with expression vectors for Vif WT or its mutants into HEK293T cells by calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate).

HA-APOBEC3G and Vif were visualized by ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant baculoviruses for Vif WT or its mutants were co-infected Hi Five cells with Cul5, EloB, EloC, and Rbx1 expressing recombinant viruses. Sixty-four hours after infection, cells were harvested and lysed in lysing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan)).

The beads were washed with lysing buffer three times and analyzed on immunoblot with anti-c-myc mAb (9E10) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) for detection of c-myc-Cul5 or rabbit anti-Vif serum. Expression of Recombinant Proteins in HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3/HA-WT or D128K APOBEC3G by calcium phosphate method.

The beads were washed with lysing buffer three times and washing buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm DTT) twice. Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Insect Cells—N-terminal-(His)6-tagged WT and mutants Vif were cloned into pVL1393 vectors (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was generated by using Bac-PAK6 baculovirus expression system (Clontech). N-terminal c-myc-tagged Cul5, C-terminal-HPC4-tagged EloB, C-terminal herpes simplex virus-tagged EloC, and N-terminal T7-tagged human Rbx1 were described previously (14Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T.

Hi Five cells were cultured in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS at 27 °C and co-infected with Vif WT or mutants, Cul5, EloB, EloC, and Rbx1 recombinant viruses. Sixty-four hours after infection, cells were harvested and lysed in insect cell lysing buffer (2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). Vif proteins were purified by TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). Recombinant His-HA-APOBEC3G protein was also obtained by the same method. In Vitro Ubiquitin Conjugation Assay—N-terminal (His)6-tagged NEDD8, Ubc12 (E2 for NEDD8) and APP-BP/Uba3 (E1 for NEDD8) were described previously (25Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K.

The plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ubiquitin was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School), and GST-ubiquitin was expressed and purified in our laboratory. Vif WT or mutant complexes were incubated with 4 μl of packed and washed antibody-conjugated beads containing HA-WT or D128K APOBEC3G in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 ng of E1, 75 mm E2, 1 μg of NEDD8, 160 ng of Ubc12, 50 ng of APP-BP1/Uba3, 2.5 μg of GST-ubiquitin) in the presence of ATP and ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm creatine phosphate, 5 μg of creatine phosphokinase) at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by adding 4× SDS sample buffer. After being boiled for 10 min, samples were subjected to Western blot to detect GST-ubiquitin conjugated HA-APOBEC3G. We also performed this assay using recombinant His-HA-APOBEC3G protein purified from insect cells. APOBEC3G D128K Mutant Is Resistant to HIV-1 Vif—Several groups (18Bogerd H.P. Doehle B.P.

A. 2004; 101: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have reported that the substitution of Asp-128 in human APOBEC3G for Lys (D128K) resulted in the resistance to HIV-1 Vif. Although it is suggested to be attributed to the inability of Vif to bind to APOBEC3G D128K mutant, some groups demonstrate the results against the current notion (26Xu H. Svarovskaia E.S. Barr R. Zhang Y. Khan M.A. Strebel K. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings, we first tested the antiviral activity of WT and D128K APOBEC3G as well as their functional interaction with HIV-1 Vif. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of APOBEC3G D128K suppressed the infectivity of wild type as well as ΔVif virions to the same extent, while the antiviral activity of WT APOBEC3G was inhibited by Vif. The amount of WT APOBEC3G protein incorporated into virions as well as in producer cells in the presence of HIV-1 Vif was much lower than that of D128K APOBEC3G (Fig. 1B), indicating that HIV-1 Vif prevented virion incorporation of WT APOBEC3G by effectively reducing its intracellular level of the protein in producer cells but not that of D128K. These results confirmed the previous reports that APOBEC3G D128K is resistant to HIV-1 Vif. Moreover, HIV-1 Vif was co-immunoprecipitated with APOBEC3G WT, but not D128K (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Vif could not down-regulate the expression of D128K because Vif cannot bind to the mutant. Vif C114S, C133S, and SLQ144/146AAA Mutants Could Bind to APOBEC3G but Failed to Exclude APOBEC3G from Virions—Simon et al. (20Simon J.H. Sheehy A.M. Carpenter E.A. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2675-2681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that introduction of several Vif mutants such as C114S, C133S, and SLQ144/146AAA into ΔVif virions could not restore the infectivity of the virions produced from non-permissive cells. We then tested the function of these mutants in the context of inhibition of the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G. Vif WT could overcome the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G on ΔVif virions, but Vif mutants not (Fig. 2A). Inability of the Vif mutants to prevent virion incorporation of APOBEC3G was attributed to their defect to down-regulate its expression in producer cells because WT Vif could reduce the amount of APOBEC3G in both virion and producer cells (Fig. 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that APOBEC3G could interact with all these mutants as well as WT Vif (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that interaction between APOBEC3G and Vif could not explain Vif function to antagonize APOBEC3G. We then examined whether these Vif mutants could form a complex with EloB, EloC, and Cul5 in baculovirus-infected insect cells (Fig. 2D). Lysates from Hi Five insect cells infected with Vif WT or mutants encoding baculoviruses together with EloB, EloC, and Cul5 encoding baculoviruses were immunoprecipitated with anti-Vif antibody, and the amount of Cul5 co-immunoprecipitaed with Vif was probed. An SLQ144/146AAA mutant, in which highly conserved SLQ residues required for the interaction with EloC were substituted for AAA (27Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C.

In contrast, C114S and C133S Vif mutants could bind to Cul5 possibly through EloB and EloC, indicating that the reason why both C114S and C133S mutants could not antagonize APOBEC3G was still unclear because these mutants could interact with APOBEC3G (Fig. 2C) as well as form a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex (Fig. 2D). A Vif-BC-Cul5 Complex Had an E3 Ligase Activity for APOBEC3G—Yu et al. (11Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that HIV-1 Vif interacted with cellular proteins Cul5, EloB, EloC, and Rbx1 to form a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex and then induced the ubiquitination and degradation of APOBEC3G. However, the direct evidence whether the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is the E3 ligase for APOBEC3G is still missing. To confirm this hypothesis, we tried to establish an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay using the purified Vif-BC-Cul5 complex. The Vif-BC-Cul5 complex was purified with NTA beads from lysates of Hi Five insect cells co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing His-tagged Vif (His-Vif), Cul5, EloB, EloC, and Rbx1. As shown in Fig. 3A, Vif protein with molecular weight of 24kDa was purified successfully, which was confirmed by immunoblot. We also detected Vif-associated proteins of approximate molecular masses of 85, 18, 15, and 12 kDa. Western blot revealed that these proteins corresponded to Cul5, EloB, EloC, and Rbx1, respectively. These findings clearly showed that Vif could form a complex with Cul5, EloB, EloC, and Rbx1 in insect cells. With the purified Vif-BC-Cul5 complex in hand, we examined the E3 ligase activity of Vif-BC-Cul5 for APOBEC3G by an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay. HA-tagged-APOBEC3G immunopurified with anti-HA beads from 293T lysates transfected with the HA-APOBEC3G expression vector was used as a substrate. Since NEDD8, an ubiquitin-like modifier protein, enhances the E3 activity of cullin-based ligases, we also added purified APP-BP1/Uba3 complex (E1 for NEDD8), Ubc12 (E2 for NEDD8), and NEDD8 to the reaction mixture. As shown in Fig. 3B, APOBEC3G was ubiquitinated efficiently and specifically in the presence of the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex (lane 6), since APOBEC3G was not ubiquitinated when either GST-ubiquitin, E1, E2, or Vif-BC-Cul5 was omitted (lanes 2–5). To exclude the possibility that the recognition of APOBEC3G by the complex requires substrate modification and/or a factor copurified, we performed the assay using recombinant APOBEC3G purified from insect cells as a substrate and again obtained the exact same result (Fig. 3C). These indicated that the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is the E3 ligase for APOBEC3G and that the complex is sufficient for the ubiquitination of APOBEC3G in vitro. Furthermore, a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex could not promote the ubiquitination of APOBEC3G D128K (Fig. 3D). Since Vif could not recognize APOBEC3G D128K (Fig. 1C), this result indicated that recognition of APOBEC3G by Vif is crucial for its ubiquitination by the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex. Finally, the reason why Vif C114S and C133S mutants cannot antagonize APOBEC3G was still unclear because both mutants could interact with APOBEC3G (Fig. 2C) as well as form a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex (Fig. 2D). We, therefore, tested the E3 ligase activity of the Vif C114S- or C133S-BC-Cul5 complex using this assay (Fig. 3E). The WT Vif-BC-Cul5 complex could ubiquitinate APOBEC3G effectively (lane 3), whereas the Vif C114S- or C133S-BC-Cul5 complex almost lost the E3 ligase activity toward APOBEC3G (lanes 4 and 5, respectively), although each complex contained similar level of each protein (Fig. 3F). We thus concluded that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Vif mutants through the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is strongly correlated with their ability to inhibit APOBEC3G. HIV Vif is known to antagonize the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by excluding the protein from HIV virion. Although it has been suggested that Vif forms a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex, and the complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of APOBEC3G, it has not been proven whether a Vif-BC-Cul5 ligase directly ubiquitinates APOBEC3G. In the present study, we have established an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay for APOBEC3G using the purified Vif-BC-Cul5 complex and demonstrated that this complex indeed ubiquitinates APOBEC3G and Vif could function as a target recognizing subunit of the E3 ligase. We believe that this is the first direct evidence of ubiquitination of APOBEC3G by a Vif-BC-Cul5 ligase complex. The result that the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex did not induce the ubiquitination of APOBEC3G D128K, which could not be recognized by Vif, supports that this complex is the E3 ligase for APOBEC3G. Some viruses utilize ubiqutin-mediated proteolysis in their viral life cycle to enhance viral replication, in which viral proteins function as an adaptor or a substrate recognition subunit of E3 ligase. In the former case, the human papillomavirus E6 protein acts as an adaptor to bring the substrate protein p53 to a cellular ligase, termed E6AP (28Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar), and HIV-1 Vpu protein brings CD4 to an Skp1-Cullin-βTrCP complex by binding to βTrCP (29Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In the latter case, adenovirus proteins E4orf6 and E1B55K form an E3 complex with BC-Cul5 to ubiquitinate p53 (30Blanchette P. Cheng C.Y. Yan Q. Ketner G. Ornelles D.A. Dobner T. Conaway R.C.

Conaway J.W. Branton P.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3104-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Vif acts as a substrate recognition subunit of an E3 ligase complex like adenovirus protein but most importantly to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of the antiviral host protein directly. We have then investigated the ability of several loss-of-function Vif mutants to ubiquitinate APOBEC3G using the in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay. Vif SLQ144/146AAA mutant lost its activity against APOBEC3G because it could not form a Vif-BC-Cul5 ligase complex due to mutations in SOCS-box motif, which is critical for binding to EloC. Our findings confirm the notion revealed recently that a novel SOCS-box motif in Vif is responsible for and regulates assembly of a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex. More importantly, we have demonstrated that both Vif C114S and C133S mutants can form a complex with BC-Cul5 (Figs. 2D and 3E) but cannot ubiquitinate APOBEC3G. Two recent reports have shown different results from ours. Mehle et al. (12Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) has shown that C114/133S double mutant have a weak interaction with Cul5, whereas Yu et al. (13Yu Y. Xiao Z. Ehrlich E.S. Yu X. Yu X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) has shown that C114S and C133S mutants could bind to EloB-EloC complex but not to Cul5. These two reports suggest that these cysteine residues are important for assembly of a Vif-BC-Cul5 complex. However, our data clearly showed that both Vif C114S and C133S could form the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex in insect cells, and the complex could be purified. This discrepancy between the previous observations and ours cannot be fully explained at this moment, but we suspect that it is because the amount of components of Vif-BC-Cul5 is larger in baculovirus-infected insect cells than 293T cells, in which the binding experiments of the previous reports were employed. Alternatively, post-translational modification(s) to strengthen the binding between Vif-BC and Cul5 might be occurred in insect cells. Moreover, our in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay clearly showed that purified Vif C114S- and C133S-BC-Cul5 complexes could not ubiquitinate APOBEC3G. These Vif mutants retained the ability to bind to BC-Cul5 complex as well as APOBEC3G, namely, these Vif mutants can recognize APOBEC3G as a substrate recognition subunit of a Vif-BC-Cul5 ligase. If so, why do these complexes containing Vif C114S or C133S fail to ubiquitinate APOBEC3G? The crystal structure of the SCFSkp2 ligase, a family of cullin-based ligases, has shown that the ligase has a rigid structure and the positioning between E2 and the substrate is crucial for the ligase activity (32Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). When N-terminal domain, critical for substrate binding, and C-terminal half (E2-binding site) of cullin-1 (Cul1) were linked with a flexible linker, the ligase could not ubiquitinate the substrate, although the mutated Cul1 could bind both E2 and the substrate (32Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). This suggested that Cul1 ensures the fine positioning between E2 and the substrate because it is a rigid protein. Thus, in the case of Vif-BC-Cul5, the mutation of C114 or C133 may affect the conformation of Vif and perturb the position of APOBEC3G in the ligase complex, resulting in the loss of the E3 activity of the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex. However, it might be possible that stability of these complexes containing C114S or C133S is too weak to ubiquitinate APOBEC3G. The mechanism for loss of the E3 activity of C114S- and C133S-containing complexes should be fully elucidated in the future. Finally, our results clearly suggested that loss of ubiquitin ligase activity of the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is tightly linked to the loss of Vif function against APOBEC3G. In other words, ubiquitination of APOBEC3G by the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex is essential for Vif function. Our in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay is a powerful tool to analyze the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination of APOBEC3G by the Vif-BC-Cul5 complex, which will provide us with new insights into Vif function and identification of new targets for therapeutic strategy.

Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, the reaction with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid demonstrated an FeIV=O + porphyrin π-cation radical (Cpd I) (Egawa, T., Shimada, H., and Ishimura, Y. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 201, 1464–1469). By contrast, with peracetic acid, FeIV=O plus a tyrosyl radical were observed by freeze-quench Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy (Schünemann, V., Jung, C., Trautwein, A. X., Mandon, D., and Weiss, R. (2000) FEBS Lett. 479, 149–154). Our detailed kinetic studies have resolved these contradictory results. At pH >7, a significant fraction of Cpd I is formed transiently, whereas at low pH only a species with a Soret band at 406 nm, presumably FeIV=O + tyrosyl radical, is observed. Evidence for formation of an acylperoxo complex en route to Cpd I was obtained. Because of rapid heme destruction, steps subsequent to formation of the highly oxidized forms could not be fully characterized. Heme destruction was avoided by including peroxidase substrates (e.g. guaiacol), which were oxidized to characteristic peroxidase products as the FeIII–P450 was regenerated. Addition of ascorbate to either of the high valent species also reforms the FeIII state with only a small loss of heme absorbance. These results indicate that typical peroxidase chemistry occurs with P450cam and offer an explanation for the contrasting results reported earlier.

Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic cycle of P450 consists of multiple intermediates, including several with activated forms of oxygen, each capable in theory of initiating substrate oxidation. The oxenoid intermediate, FeIV=O, coupled with a porphyrin π-cation radical, is referred to as Compound I (Cpd I) and has been widely postulated as the principal oxygenating species in the catalytic cycle (1Ortiz de Montellano P. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar, 2Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cpd I, which is two oxidation equivalents above the native ferric state of the heme, has been well characterized in catalytic cycles of peroxidases, a related class of enzymes containing a heme prosthetic group (7Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar). Peroxidases readily react with H2O2 or peracids to form Cpd I.Important to the understanding of P450 mechanisms of oxygenation was the finding that either peracids or H2O2 can be used to provide both oxygen and reducing equivalents to P450 for oxygenation of substrates (1Ortiz de Montellano P. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar, 8Sligar S.G. Shastry B.S. Gunsalus I.C. Ullrich V. Hildebrandt A. Roots I.

Portland Press, London1999: 71-84Google Scholar). This “shunt” pathway avoids the use of O2, NAD(P)H, and a reductase system. (The reductase systems consist of a flavoprotein and a nonheme iron protein such as putidaredoxin, or else a single protein that contains both FAD and FMN (91).) The shunt pathway most likely involves Cpd I of P450, thought to be the oxygenating species for hydrocarbon hydroxylation (10Groves J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3569-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because Cpd I is thought to be highly reactive, it has been postulated that it cannot be isolated and characterized (11Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Cpd I has been known for more than 50 years for peroxidases, and it is readily formed by the reactions of peroxides or peracids with the ferric forms of peroxidases (7Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar). Cpd I can usually be easily recognized because the diminished aromaticity of the π-cation radical of the porphyrin yields a Soret band with a significantly smaller extinction coefficient than that of Soret bands of other heme species. It has been established that the predominant form of Cpd I in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and in many other peroxidases, is a ferryl iron (FeIV=O) paired with a porphyrin π-cation radical (1Ortiz de Montellano P.

The Soret band of Cpd ES does not have diminished intensity like that of Cpd I, because the porphyrin macrocycle maintains its aromaticity. Other heme proteins and enzymes have also been shown to have tyrosyl or tryptophanyl radicals in a Cpd ES-like form of the two-electron oxidized state. These include myoglobin (20Gunther M.R.

It was elegantly demonstrated for catalase peroxidase from Synechocystis PCC6803 that three different radical states are in equilibrium (27Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). They were identified as a porphyrin radical exchange-coupled to the ferryl moiety (classical Cpd I), and two protein-based radical forms (tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals) paired with the FeIV=O.Although H2O2 readily forms Cpd I with peroxidases, it is not always useful for forming Cpd I with other heme proteins. For example, peracids are often more effective reagents than H2O2 with cytochromes P450 in “shunt” pathways. Because the acid is an excellent leaving group, heterolytic cleavage of the O–O bond of the peracid to form Cpd I with various hemes and hemoproteins is often considerably more facile (30Bruice T.C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1983; 1: 14-15Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Groves J.T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8443-8452Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar) than the analogous reaction with H2O2 in which OH– (or H2O after protonation) is the leaving group. Intriguing is the fact that Cpd I species for P450 and peroxidases generally promote different reactions, with cytochromes P450 usually oxygenating substrates (oxygen atom transfer) and peroxidases oxidizing substrates (electron transfer).One problem with using peracids with P450 enzymes is that after formation of Cpd I-like species, extensive heme destruction reactions mask subsequent events and even compromise the resolution of spectra of Cpd I. These bleaching processes are caused by the reaction of the peracids with P450 in higher oxidation states and occur when the peracids are significantly in excess over P450. Similar but less severe effects have been shown for HRP (33Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Hernández-Ruiz J. Garcia-Cánovas F. Thorneley R.N.F. Acosta M. Arnao M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5469-5476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar to Cpd I of peroxidases, the Soret band of P450 Cpd I has considerably lower extinction, is shifted to shorter wavelengths than that of the starting ferric form, and there is a weak band at about 690 nm (2Egawa T.

In contrast to the optical data (2Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The protein radical had properties more like the tyrosyl radical of cytochrome c oxidase (38Lang G. Spartalian K. Yonetani T. Biochim. Biophys.

It was concluded that the EPR signal of P450cam was attributed to a tyrosyl radical (35Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R.

Similar intramolecular electron migration has also been discussed for the HRP variant F172Y, bovine liver catalase, and CcP (21Ivancich A. Jouve H.M. Sartor B. Gaillard J.

The aim was to better resolve the apparent discrepancies between the observations by UV-visible spectroscopy of a Cpd I-like species in reactions of P450cam with mCPBA (2Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Wagner G.C. Palcic M.M. Dunford H.B. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and those by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy of a Cpd ES-like form of P450cam in reactions with PAA. The work presented here shows that both intermediates can be seen, with the classical Cpd I forming first; in addition, pH, temperature, and choice of peracid are shown to affect the relative quantities of each intermediate that accumulate in these reactions. Double-mixing experiments with different peroxidase substrates showed that both Cpd I and the Cpd ES-like form can be reduced to the ferric state by a typical peroxidase mechanism, and that such reagents can eliminate most heme destruction.MATERIALS AND METHODSP450cam was prepared as previously described (41Egawa T. Ogura T. Makino R. Ishimura Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10246-10248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to an absorbance ratio A391 nm/A280 nm of >1.45 and stored in 0.15 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 1 mm d-camphor. The high spin ferric form of P450cam was freed of d-camphor by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration in the presence of 0.05 m MOPS, pH 7.0, and then equilibrated with 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by passing it through a second G-25 column. All reagents were obtained from commercial sources. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC instrument. The peracids were standardized spectrophotometrically using the triiodide assay (ϵ353 nm = 25.5 mm–1 cm–1) (42Cotton M.L. Dunford H.B. Raycheba J.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1973; 51: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All kinetic experiments were performed at 4 or 25 °C and at pH 6.2, 7.4, and 8.0 in 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm KCl. All stopped-flow kinetic and diode array studies were carried out using freshly prepared enzyme and peroxidase substrates.Kinetic data were acquired using a Hi-Tech Scientific, Ltd Model SF-61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon lamp. Dead times were determined to be 1.5 ms. Diode array assays used a Hi-Tech SF-61 DX-2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a 1.5-ms integration time. Concentrations given in figure legends are those after mixing the reactants. Data collection and analysis were performed using program A based on the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (43Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 235-242Google Scholar) and developed in our laboratory by R. Chang, C-J. Chiu, J. Dinverno, and Dr. D. P. Ballou, and by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and global analysis routines in the Specfit program (Spectrum Software Associates). Because peracid was always greatly in excess of P450 in these experiments, fitting to models described below treated the first step as pseudo-first order reactions.RESULTSReactions with mCPBA at pH 7.4 and at Both 25 and 3.4 °C—The reaction of ferric P450cam with peracids using conditions (300 μm mCPBA, pH 7.4, 25 °C) similar to those described in Ref. 2Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar confirmed the rapid formation of a Cpd I-like species. However, more detailed analysis showed that Cpd I was already partially converted to another intermediate form with an absorbance peak at ∼406 nm. This latter species is possibly the Cpd ES-like FeIV=O-tyrosyl radical that has been described by Schünemann et al. (35Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Schünemann V. Jung C. Terner J. Trautwein A.X. Weiss R. J. Inorg.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10919-10930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as it is the main species seen (data shown in Supplementary Materials) following reaction of ferric P450cam with PAA at pH 7 (the conditions used by Schünemann et al.). Fig. 1A shows spectra of both native P450cam recorded during the reaction with excess mCPBA and the ferric low spin form before mixing. The first rapid phases (to ∼0.04 s) are followed by heme bleaching, which makes detailed analysis over the entire reaction course impractical. In the first phase, the Soret peak at 417 nm decreases, and a significantly less intense peak emerges at ∼367 nm (spectrum at 0.007 s). This has converted by 0.038 s to a species with a peak at ∼406 nm; however, because of the rapid bleaching that ensues under these conditions, even this species cannot be well characterized. Use of SVD and global analysis for the model A → B → C → D → E with k1 = 170 s–1, k2 = 51 s–1, k3 = 27 s–1, and k4 = 4 s–1 yielded the spectra shown in Fig. 1B. Species E and k4 were used to represent the bleaching process and aid in the fitting procedures, but the spectrum of E is not plotted because it is not well defined. The spectrum of B closely resembles that of CPO Cpd I (34Palcic M.M. Rutter R. Araiso T. Hager L.P. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (a broad Soret peak at 367 nm and a weak band at ∼695 nm) and is similar to that shown earlier (2Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 44Harris D. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); it is consistent with a species containing an exchange-coupled S = 1FeIV=O and a spin S = ½ porphyrin (34Palcic M.M. Rutter R. Araiso T. Hager L.P. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows absorbance versus time traces at 406, 417, and 367 nm that demonstrate the kinetics of the reaction. The model allows the prediction of the formation and decay of species for the reaction as shown in Fig. 1D. The observed rate of formation of the putative Cpd I approaches a maximal value at higher concentrations of mCPBA, and this implies that a species (presumably a binding complex) forms en route from the ferric state to Cpd I. The formation of Cpd I can be seen as a rapid increase in absorbance at 367 nm and a rapid decrease at 406 nm (Fig. 1C).The second phase includes conversion of Cpd I into another intermediate that is characterized by the loss of the absorbance at 367 nm and the formation of a peak at ∼406 nm (maximum at ∼40 ms). This presumably involves intramolecular electron transfer to reduce the porphyrin radical while concomitantly forming a tyrosyl radical. Subsequent spectral changes are complicated because of the extensive heme bleaching that occurs, particularly at higher peracid concentrations.At 3.4 °C, a smaller fraction of classical Cpd I is formed. However, a new species that precedes Cpd I can be partially resolved, and this is likely to be the acylperoxo complex. SVD and global analysis of diode array data were fit to the model (A → B → C → D → E with k1 = 170 s–1, k2 = 38 s–1, k3 = 9.1 s–1, and k4 = 3.5 s–1) to yield the spectra shown in Fig. 2. B is representative of the acylperoxo complex, C is Cpd I, and D, which absorbs maximally at ∼406 nm, is the likely Cpd ES-like FeIV=O-tyrosyl radical species that was also shown in Fig. 1 (reaction at 25 °C). E is not a real species, but represents part of the bleaching pathway and was used to improve the fitting process. The buildup of an acylperoxo-ferric complex en route to the formation of Cpd I is also consistent with the recent report that the rate of forming Cpd I reaches a limiting value at high concentrations of mCPBA (45Prasad S. Mitra S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Qualitatively, the data at the two temperatures are the same, but because of differential temperature effects on the various rate constants, the putative acylperoxo-ferric complex and the 406-nm species were better resolved at 3.4 °C, whereas Cpd I was better resolved at 25 °C. Note that spectra derived from the analyses carried out above are not completely quantitative. This is largely because the events involving the bleaching reactions are not well characterized, and therefore the simple model used is insufficient to fully account for the observations. Although the spectra are not accurate representations of the species, they do show salient features that permit us to assign tentative chemical structures. The studies described below were carried out at higher and lower pH values and with both mCPBA and PAA to try and optimize the formation of the intermediates that were only partially resolved at pH 7.4.Fig. 2SVD analysis of the rapid scan data from 0 to 0.3 s for the reaction of P450cam with mCPBA at 3.4 °C. mCPBA, 600 μm at pH 7.4.

J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 360-363Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 47Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), as well as by facilitating protonation of the leaving acid, and therefore would lead to a greater yield of Cpd I. Surprisingly, at low pH, virtually no Cpd I was detected using either mCPBA or PAA; however, a large fraction of the P450cam was found as a species with a blue-shifted Soret maximum at ∼406 nm (Figs. 3, 4, 5). In addition, SVD and global analysis of the diode array data recorded at 3.4 °C and pH 6.2, using kinetic constants derived from single wavelength traces, resolved a spectrum of an intermediate that preceded the 406-nm species (Fig. 3B, species B). This first intermediate is likely to be an acylperoxo complex with the heme, like that described for the data at pH 7.4 (above).

https://openalex.org/W2076237242,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is proteolytically processed by β- and γ-secretases to release amyloid β, the main component in senile plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved within the amyloid β domain by α-secretase releasing the non-amyloidogenic product sAPPα, which has been shown to have neuroprotective properties. Several G protein-coupled receptors are known to activate α-secretase-dependent processing of APP; however, the role of G protein-coupled nucleotide receptors in APP processing has not been investigated. Here it is demonstrated that activation of the G protein-coupled P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) subtype expressed in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells enhanced the release of sAPPα in a time- and dose-dependent manner. P2Y2 R-mediated sAPPα release was dependent on extracellular calcium but was not affected by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,-trimethylammonium salt, an intracellular calcium chelator, indicating that P2Y2 R-stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization was not involved. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with GF109203 or by PKC down-regulation with phorbol ester pre-treatment had no effect on UTP-stimulated sAPPα release, indicating a PKC-independent mechanism. U0126, an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, partially inhibited sAPPα release by UTP, whereas inhibitors of Src-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation by P2Y2 Rs had no effect. The metalloprotease inhibitors phenanthroline and TAPI-2 and the furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone also diminished UTP-induced sAPPα release. Furthermore, small interfering RNA silencing of an endogenous adamalysin, ADAM10 or ADAM17/TACE, partially suppressed P2Y2R-activated sAPPα release, whereas treatment of cells with both ADAM10 and ADAM17/TACE small interfering RNAs completely abolished UTP-activated sAPPα release. These results may contribute to an understanding of the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP."

These functional domains derive from enzymatic modification in the Golgi apparatus of the primary polymerization product of HS/heparin biosynthesis, composed of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine units ((GlcUA-GlcNAc)n). The nascent polymer is first subject to partial N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of the GlcNAc residues. The modification occurs in a regioselective fashion, giving rise to (i) consecutively N-sulfated regions, (ii) regions of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units, and (iii) domains that escape modification and remain N-acetylated (5Salmivirta M.

Sometimes, the N-deacetylation/N-sulfation reaction remains partial, with N-unsubstituted GlcN units as a result (9Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R.

The further modification reactions, C5 epimerization of GlcUA residues into iduronic acid (IdoUA) residues and O-sulfation, all occur in the vicinity of previously incorporated N-sulfate groups. O-Sulfation is frequently found at C2 of IdoUA units and at C6 of GlcN units. Rarely, O-sulfation occurs also at C2 of GlcUA units and at C3 of GlcNSO3 residues, the latter sulfate substitution providing a hallmark for the antithrombin binding HS/heparin sequence. In tissues, spatially and temporally coordinated expression of protein binding HS domains might entail mechanisms to control the protein activity above the level of protein expression. Remarkable specificity has indeed been demonstrated with regard to the ability of HS to form complexes with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors in mouse embryo tissues (11Allen B.L. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), presumably because of structural distinctions between the HS species found in the distinct tissue loci. Moreover, immunohistochemical studies of tissues with antibodies against different HS epitopes suggest structural differences in HS in distinct cellular environments, such as the tubular and glomerular epithelia and basement membranes of the kidney (12van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M. A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J. H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Antibodies have become important tools to assess the occurrence and localization of HS in tissues. Potentially, antibodies can also provide structural information of tissue HS, but proper assessment of such data obviously requires sufficient knowledge of the antibody epitope structure. So far, relatively few anti-HS antibodies have been studied with regard to their cognate epitopes. We have previously characterized the epitope to antibody JM403 (12van den Born J. Gunnarsson K.

The phage display antibodies recognized a number of different epitopes that were all characterized by the presence of N- and O-sulfate substituents both in HS and heparin preparations (13Dennissen M.A. Jenniskens G.J.

We have studied two previously uncharacterized epitopes to monoclonal antibodies against HS, JM13 (16van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P. Bakker M.A. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J. Berden J.H. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar) and HepSS1 (17Kure S. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3900-3908PubMed Google Scholar), and attempted to define further the epitopes recognized by JM403 and 10E4. Two of the antibodies (10E4 and HepSS1) are commercially available and have been widely used as research reagents. Moreover, we have examined the immunoreactivity of these antibodies in rat and human tissue. Our results suggest that HepSS1 and JM13 bind to rare saccharide epitopes that occur predominantly in basement membrane HS. HepSS1 reacts specifically with an epitope of several consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units with little or no O-sulfation, whereas JM13 binds to an O-sulfated epitope containing GlcUA. 10E4 and JM403 both recognize more common but distinct epitopes. Our results suggest a mixed N-sulfated and N-acetylated epitope for 10E4 and support the earlier data (12van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M. A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M.

Chemical modifications to HS-II (cleavage with HNO2 at pH 1.5 or 3.9, N-deacetylation, N-acetylation, or N-sulfation) were made as described previously (12van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M. A.H.

HS preparations from bovine aorta, lung, intestine, and kidney and the murine Englebreth-Holm-Schwarz tumor (EHS-HS) were isolated and characterized as described before (19Maccarana M. Sakura Y.

Tawada (Seikagaku Corp.). The Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide (K5PS) with the same (GlcUA-GlcNAc)n structure as the HS/heparin precursor polysaccharide, O-sulfated K5PS, N-desulfated heparin, and N-desulfated, N-acetylated heparin were supplied by Dr. G. van Dedem (AKZO-Nobel, Oss, The Netherlands). N-Sulfated K5PS was a gift from Dr. B. Casu (Instituto di Chimica e Biochimica G. Ronzoni, Milan, Italy). Porcine intestinal heparin was from Leo Pharmaceutical Products (Weesp, The Netherlands). HS-II, EHS-HS, and bovine kidney HS were biotinylated by derivatization of the carboxyl groups using biotin LC hydrazide (Pierce Chemical Company) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. HS-II was also biotinylated via its N-unsubstituted GlcN units using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). The four murine monoclonal antibodies against HS were all of the IgM isotype. JM403 was generated by immunization with rat glomerular HS proteoglycans (21van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P. Bakker M.A. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J. Berden J.H. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), JM13 was obtained from immunization with human glomerular HS proteoglycans (16van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.

Embryonic Rat Tissues—Methanol-fixed 10-μm cryostat sections of embryonic rat heads were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the sections in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 30 min followed by a 40-min incubation with the primary antibodies (diluted 1:10,000). The sections were washed with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (three times for 10 min/wash) and incubated for 40 min with the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, 1:600 dilution; Sigma). The slides were again washed with PBS and Tween as above and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). All incubations were performed at room temperature. The slides were examined using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Human Uterine Cervix—Slide-mounted, paraffin-embedded 6-μm sections of human uterine cervix (generously provided by Dr. Frej Stenbäck, University of Oulu) were pretreated for antigen retrieval 2Tissue sections were pretreated with trypsin or incubated in a microwave oven or pressure cooker prior to the immunohistochemical staining, and the results were compared with similarly stained sections without pretreatment.

The immunoreactivity was amplified using biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1:250; Vectastain, Vector Laboratories) and detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) as substrate. Sections were counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin (Sigma) and examined using an Olympus BX60 microscope. Images were taken with Olympus U-CMAD-2 CCD camera. Some tissue sections were treated with heparitinase (25 milliunits/ml; EC 4.2.2.8; Seikagaku Corp.) for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 5 mm calcium acetate to assess the specificity of the staining. Immunocytochemistry—The cells used for immunostaining included human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, either mock-transfected or transfected with HS 2-O-sulfotransferase (2-OST), 6-O-sulfotransferase-3 (6-OST3) (kindly provided by Marion Kusche-Gullberg, Uppsala), or N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-2 (NDST-2) (a gift from Lena Kjellén, Uppsala) and parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-K1), the HS-deficient strain (CHO677) and the 2-OST-deficient strain (CHO-F17). The cells were maintained as described previously (23Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 463-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. The primary antibodies were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI nuclear stain (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence images were analyzed with Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. For FACS analysis, HEK293 cells were incubated with the anti-HS antibodies for 20 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM. The cells were washed twice and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. All incubations and washes were performed in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 nm sodium azide. The immunoreactivity of the cells was analyzed using a FACS Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences). ELISA—The binding of the antibodies to various polysaccharides was assessed by inhibition ELISA. Two different protocols were used. In Protocol 1, antibodies were immobilized to polystyrene flat bottom microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorp) precoated with goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies (Sigma). Biotinylated HS-II was added together with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor glycosaminoglycans. Biotinylated HS-II remaining on the plates after washes was detected by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) and developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (SFRI Laboratories, Berganton, France) as peroxidase substrate. The color reaction was stopped with sulfuric acid, and absorption was measured at 450 nm. In Protocol 2, biotinylated HS from the EHS tumor was immobilized to streptavidin-coated plates followed by the addition of antibodies and the competitor saccharides. Bound antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgM antibodies using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as peroxidase substrate. In both protocols, competition was calculated as (1 – (A450 with competitor/A450 without competitor)) × 100%. The results from experiments according to Protocol 1 were normalized relative to the inhibition accomplished by HS-II, which was set to 1.00. Developing Rat Tooth—The four antibodies studied demonstrated a different pattern of HS staining in the developing rat molar tooth. The HepSS1 and JM13 epitopes were largely confined to the basement membrane, whereas JM403 and 10E4 staining was seen both in the basement membrane and the dental epithelium and/or mesenchyme (Fig. 1 and Table I). JM403 staining was restricted to the epithelium during early development (embryonic day 15), but at embryonic day 16 a distinct staining was seen also in the mesenchymal tissue (Fig. 1). The appearance of the mesenchymal JM403 reactivity thus coincided with the mesenchymal condensation, which reflects the commencement of active morphogenesis in the mesenchyme. By contrast, 10E4 staining was confined to the mesenchyme, whereas the dental epithelium remained negative throughout the development (Fig. 1; embryonic days 17 and 18, data not shown). The surrounding oral epithelium stained positively for JM403 but did not contain the 10E4 epitope (Fig. 1). Tissue sections pretreated with heparitinase were not stained by any of the antibodies (data not shown).Table IImmunolocalization of anti-HS antibody epitopes in embryonic rat tooth and adult human cervix tissuesAntibodyDental BMaBM, basement membrane.Oral BMDental epitheliumOral epitheliumDental mesenchymeUterine cervix epitheliumUterine cervix BMHepSS1++++++-+--JM13-+++----+++JM403++++++++++++-+++10E4++++--+++++-a BM, basement membrane. Open table in a new tab All four HS epitopes were found in the basement membrane HS but with marked differences in their occurrence in the oral versus dental basement membranes. HepSS1 epitope was thus expressed weakly in the oral basement membrane but strongly in the dental basement membrane that separates the morphogenetically active epithelial and mesenchymal tissues (Fig. 1). Immunostaining of adjacent tissue sections with JM13 revealed a largely opposite expression pattern, such that intense expression was seen in the oral basement membrane but faint expression in the dental basement membrane. The JM403 and 10E4 epitopes were found in both basement membranes, the former epitope being expressed preferentially in the oral and the latter in dental basement membrane (Fig. 1). The different antibodies thus showed distinct reactivities in the dental versus oral basement membrane and mesenchyme versus epithelium. Human Uterine Cervix—We proceeded to immunostain sections of human uterine cervix to elucidate whether the same HS epitopes are found in adult human tissue (Fig. 2). Both JM13 and JM403 showed distinct staining of the basement membrane but little or no staining in the ectocervical epithelium or in the underlying stroma. By contrast, 10E4 showed intense cell surface staining at the suprabasal layers of the stratified squamous epithelium, but no staining in the basement membrane. The human cervix tissue was not immunoreactive to HepSS1 with any of the antigen retrieval procedures employed in our study. These data suggest different structures of basement membrane and epithelial cell HSs in adult human tissue. To characterize the saccharide epitopes recognized by the antibodies, we assessed the ability of different saccharides to inhibit the binding of biotinylated HS to immobilized anti-HS antibodies in ELISAs. All four anti-HS monoclonal antibodies (JM13, HepSS1, 10E4, and JM403) bound efficiently to biotinylated HS-II, a low sulfated HS species from human aorta, which was used in the first series of ELISA studies made according to Protocol 1 (see “Materials and Methods”). To compare the binding properties of the antibodies, the results were normalized by setting the inhibition obtained by unbiotinylated HS-II to 1.00. The inhibitor saccharides included various bovine HS species, heparin, and K5PS from E. coli, as well as various derivatives of these saccharides obtained by chemical modification (Table II). Further assessment (Table III) of the 10E4 epitope specificity was made in a second series of experiments (Protocol 2; see “Materials and Methods”) involving immobilized EHS-HS, particularly to evaluate the role of GlcN N-substitution in 10E4 binding (see below).Table IIInhibition of the binding of biotinylated HS to immobilized anti-HS antibodies in ELISA (Protocol 1) by various heparin-like polysaccharidesInhibitorJM13HepSS110E4JM403Derivatives of K5PSNative K5<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01N-Deacetylated K5<0.01<0.01<0.017.50N-Deacetylated, N-sulfated K50.502.80<0.01<0.01O-Sulfated K52.20<0.01<0.01<0.01N-Deacetylated, O-sulfated K5>100.00<0.01<0.010.03N-Deacetylated, N-sulfated, O-sulfated K5>100.00<0.01<0.01<0.01Derivatives of human aorta HS-IINative HS-II1.001.001.001.00HS-II, HNO2, pH 1.5<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01HS-II, HNO2, pH 3.9<0.011.000.10<0.01N-Acetylated HS-II1.001.001.00<0.01N-Deacetylated HS-II10.00<0.01<0.014.40N-Deacetylated, N-sulfated HS-II10.005.21<0.01<0.01Heparan sulfate preparations from bovine organsAorta<0.010.362.560.94Lung<0.010.06<0.010.77Intestine<0.010.076.880.91Kidney (1.1 m)<0.010.04<0.010.27Kidney (1.25 m)<0.01<0.01<0.010.16Heparin derivativesNative heparin<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01N-Deacetylated heparin<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01N-Desulfated heparin<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01N-Desulfated, N-acetylated heparin<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01N- and O-desulfated, N-deacetylated heparin<0.01<0.01<0.010.05N- and O-desulfated, N-reacetylated heparin<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01N-Resulfated, O-desulfated heparin<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01 Open table in a new tab Table IIIInhibition of the binding of two anti-HS antibodies to immobilized EHS-HS in ELISA by various HS-related polysaccharides in the fluid phaseInhibitorGlcN substitution6-O-SulfateIC50N-AcetylN-Sulfate−NH3+10E4JM403%%%%μg / mlμg / mlDerivatives of E. coli K5PSNative K5100000>100>100PDeAcaPDeAc, partially N-deacetylated.

Open table in a new tab JM13—None of the bovine HS preparations competed for the binding of JM13 to biotinylated HS-II, suggesting that the epitope occurs rarely in HS (Table II). Treatment of HS-II with HNO2 at pH 1.5 abolished binding, pointing to the presence of N-sulfate in the JM13 epitope. The finding that treatment of HS-II with HNO2 at pH 3.9, which cleaves the polysaccharide at N-unsubstituted GlcN residues, also abolished antibody reactivity, would reflect the presence of free amino groups in the JM13 epitope. However, because N-acetylated HS-II bound JM13 as effectively as native HS-II, it is more likely that GlcNH3+ residues in HS-II are present vicinal to the JM13 epitope but not a part of the antibody binding site. Removal of N-acetyl groups from HS-II as well as their replacement with N-sulfate groups increased JM13 binding, suggesting an inhibitory role for the N-acetyl groups in the interaction (Table II). Alternatively, the finding may also reflect generation of new epitopes containing either GlcNH3+ or GlcNSO3− residues. Experiments with various K5PS derivatives proved useful in assessing the role of O-sulfates in JM13 binding. Although the native or N-deacetylated K5PSs did not bind JM13, some reactivity was obtained with N- or O-sulfated K5PS and very strong reactivity with O-sulfated K5PS containing either N-sulfate groups or N-unsubstituted GlcN units (Table II). These data indicate that O-sulfation is essential for the binding and confirm the idea that N-acetyl groups inhibit the binding. The finding that N-deacetylated, O-sulfated K5PS bound JM13 much better than N-deacetylated or N-desulfated heparin suggests that IdoUA units interfere with JM13 binding because K5PS lacks IdoUA, which is abundant (>75% of all hexuronic acid residues) in heparin. In conclusion, JM13 appears to recognize a rare HS epitope, characterized by the presence of O-sulfate substituents in a GlcUA-rich sequence (Table IV).Table IVEpitope characteristics of four anti-HS antibodiesAntibodyOccurrence in HSRequired GlcN N-substitutionRequirement forEpitope characteristicsO-SulfateIdoUAJM13RareN-Sulfate or -NH3+YesNo2-O-Sulfated GlcUA-rich sequenceHepSS1RareN-sulfateNoNoN-Sulfated GlcUA-rich sequence10E4CommonN-sulfate and N-acetylNoNoMixed N-acetylated/N-sulfated sequenceJM403Common-NH3+NoNoGlcUA-rich sequences with N-unsubstituted GlcN units Open table in a new tab HepSS1—The HepSS1 epitope was present in bovine aorta HS but not in other bovine HS preparations (Table II). Treatment of HS-II with HNO2 at pH 1.5 abolished HepSS1 binding, whereas treatment with HNO2 at pH 3.9 or N-acetylation had no effect. N-Deacetylation of HS-II abolished the binding, but increased binding was seen upon subsequent N-sulfation of the N-deacetylated polysaccharide. All of these findings suggest a role for the N-sulfate substituents in the binding. Notably, a functional HepSS1 epitope could be generated solely by extensive (>95%) N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of K5PS (Table II). These findings suggest a role for consecutive GlcUA-GlcNSO3 disaccharide units in the interaction. O-Sulfate groups or IdoUA did not seem to be involved in HepSS1 binding, as indicated by experiments with O-sulfated K5PS species or chemically modified heparin preparations (Table II). To define the HepSS1 epitope further, we assessed the ability of EHS-HS and partially N-sulfated K5PSs to bind HepSS1. Partially (∼60%) N-sulfated K5PS did not react with HepSS1 (Fig. 3), whereas a completely (>95%) N-sulfated preparation was reactive (Table II). Furthermore, HepSS1 displayed strong reactivity toward EHS-HS that was shown to contain, by compositional disaccharide analysis, an unusually high proportion (∼60%) of non-O-sulfated HexA-GlcNSO3− disaccharide uni"
https://openalex.org/W2045489268,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling is critical in a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGF-β signaling is mediated by a group of proteins including TGF-β receptors and Smads. It is known that different cells can exhibit different sensitivities to TGF-β. Several molecular mechanisms, such as the differential expression of the receptor levels, have been suggested as contributing to these differences. Here, we report evidence for a novel mechanism of regulating TGF-β sensitivity that depends on the role of CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) in regulating the basal level of Smad3 via the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. First, using a luciferase assay we found that overexpression of CHIP inhibited TGF-β signaling, whereas silencing CHIP expression by small interfering RNAs led to increased TGF-β signaling sensitivity. Second, based on the results of cell proliferation assays and JunB expression, we found that TGF-β signaling could be abolished by stably overexpressing CHIP. Third, in those cell lines with stably expressed CHIP, we observed that the Smad3 protein level was dramatically decreased. Finally, we demonstrated that CHIP served as a U-box dependent E3 ligase that can directly mediate ubiquitination and degradation of Smad3 and that this action of CHIP was independent of TGF-β signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest that CHIP can modulate the sensitivity of the TGF-β signaling by controlling the basal level of Smad3 through ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

It has been reported that degradation of Smad proteins through ubiquitination is an important mechanism for regulating cellular responsiveness to TGF-β family ligands (11Wang T. Front.

The effects of most of the known ubiquitination ligases, however, are mainly for terminating the TGF-β signaling. For example, several E3 ligases, such as SCF/Roc1 (28Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and Smurf1/2 (24Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), are thought to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of the activated form of Smad proteins. Roc1 is a Cullin-binding protein with RING finger domain and has been reported to associate with Smad3 in a Smad3-SCF/Roc1 complex in the nucleus, which is then transported into the cytoplasm for degradation (28Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Smurf1 and Smurf2 are HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) domain-containing E3 ligases (24Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Smurf1 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated Smads specifically in the BMP (bone morphogenitic protein) pathway to trigger Smad1 ubiquitination and degradation (32Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Smurf1 has also been reported to interact with TGF-β type I receptor through Smad7 to regulate receptor degradation (30Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that TGF-β-induced Smad2-Smurf2 association with the transcriptional co-repressor SnoN leads to Smurf2 targeting SnoN for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by proteasome (29Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These findings provided a mechanism for the down-regulation of TGF-β signaling via degradation of activated R-Smads (15Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate whether some of the E3 ligases may also mediate the degradation of Smads in the absence of TGF-β signaling and, thus, could regulate the basal state of Smads. At present, whether Smurf2 could target unstimulated Smads is still unclear (25Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Recently, based on a yeast two-hybrid study, we found that CHIP interacted with Smad1/4 and regulated the bone morphogenetic protein signal pathway (23Li L. Xin H. Xu X. Huang M. Zhang X. Chen Y. Zhang S. Fu X.Y. Chang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CHIP was originally identified as a novel tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein and was confirmed to interact with heat shock proteins (33Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This protein has been reported to inhibit Hsp40-stimulated ATPase activity of Hsc70. It may also block the Hsc70-substrate-binding cycle to reduce chaperon efficiency (33Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) or enhance Hsp70-dependent folding activity (34Kampinga H.H. Kanon B. Salomons F.A. Kabakov A.E. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4948-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that CHIP interacts directly with a tetratricopeptide repeat domain in Hsp90 to induce ubiquitination and degradation of the glucocorticoid receptor through the proteasome (35Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Also, CHIP was identified as mediating the degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (36Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), Parkin-associated endothelin-receptor-like receptor (Pael-R) (37Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T.

Here, we present evidence that CHIP can be an important regulator in controlling the sensitivity of the TGF-β signaling by reducing the basal level of Smad3 through ubiquitination. Plasmids and Constructs—The Myc-tagged CHIP expression vector pRK1M/Myc-CHIP was constructed by PCR based on pACT2-CHIP (23Li L. Xin H. Xu X. Huang M. Zhang X. Chen Y. Zhang S. Fu X.Y. Chang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the mammalian expression vector pRK1M (a gift from Dr. Ying Zhang). HA-tagged CHIP constructs (pcDNA6/V5/HA-CHIP and pEFNeo/HA-CHIP) were generated using the same method by subcloning into the pcDNA6/V5 (Invitrogen) and pEFNeo (from Dr. Xin-yuan Fu) vectors, respectively. The Myc-tagged CHIP mutant H260Q (histidine to glutamine at position 260) was generated using the primers 5′-attgaggagcagctgcagcgtg-3′ and 5′-gtccttgcggtcataggtgat-3′ based on Myc-CHIP with the site-directed mutagenesis MutanBEST Kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). The His-tagged Smad3 (pcDNA6/V5/His-Smad3) construct was generated by a PCR-based approach from pRK5/F-Smad3 into the vector pcDNA6/V5. FLAG-tagged Smads (pRK5-Smad2, pRK5-Smad3, or pRK5-Smad4), HA-tagged Smad3(3S-A), TGF-βRI(T204D), and (CAGA)12-MLP-Lux constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Xiaofan Wang (Duke University). The HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmid was a gift from Dr. Ying Zhang (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The STAT3 construct (pRC/CMV/STAT3) and its response reporter (pGL2-M67/sie) were provided by Dr. Xinyuan Fu (Yale University). The pBS/U6/CHIPi1 and 2 were constructed according to a previously published protocol (23Li L. Xin H. Xu X. Huang M. Zhang X. Chen Y. Zhang S. Fu X.Y. Chang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). pEGFP-N1 was purchased from Clontech, and the pBS/U6 vector and pBS/U6/EGFPi were kindly provided by Dr. Yang Shi (Harvard University) (52Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cell Lines and Transfections—Mv1Lu (mink lung epithelial cells), HEK293T,COS-7, HepG2, and SkOV3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. BaF3 cells from a bone marrow-derived murine interleukin-3 dependent pro-B cell line were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% conditioned medium from the WEHI3 cells as a source of inteleukin-3. The U937 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the CalPhos mammalian transfection system (Clontech) were used for transient transfection for Mv1Lu, COS-7, and 293T cells. For establishment of the HA-CHIP-expressing stable Mv1Lu cells, pEFneo/HA-CHIP was transfected into Mv1Lu cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. As for BaF3/HA-CHIP cells, the pEFneo/HA-CHIP plasmid was transfected into the BaF3 cells using an electroporation procedure. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were mixed with 15 μg of plasmid in ice-cold PBS, placed in a chamber, and subjected to 240 V (t ≈ 35–40 ms) with a BTX ECM 399 electroporation system (BTX division of Genetronics Inc.). Selection was initiated 24 h after transfection using 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and the resultant clones were characterized by Western blot and maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Metabolic labeling immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (23Li L. Xin H. Xu X. Huang M. Zhang X. Chen Y. Zhang S. Fu X.Y. Chang Z.

In some cases, transfected cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) or 7.5 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Inc.) as indicated. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs from 5 × 106 cells were extracted with 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) plus 200 μl of chloroform. The supernatant was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. The RNA pellet was re-suspended in sterile water. 1 μg of total RNA was used as template for one-step RT-PCR analysis (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd) according to the protocol. The primers designed to amplify the fragment in the C-terminal (U-box domain) of human and mouse CHIP were 5′-tataggatccaagaagaagcgctggaacagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-tatactcgagtcagtagtcctccacccagccatt-3′ (reverse). The reaction mixture was first incubated at 50 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription and then denatured at 94 °C for 2 min before PCR cycles. 26 cycles of PCR were conducted under the conditions of 94 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The reaction products were extended at 72 °C for 10 min before storing at 4 °C. The RT-PCR for β-actin was performed with the same aliquoted samples as an internal control. Pulse-Chase Assay—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells growing in the 12-well plate were pre-incubated in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium for 1 h and then pulsed for metabolic labeling for 10 min with 200 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chased at different time points. The cells were lysed and subjected to anti-FLAG (M2) immunoprecipitation and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and 35S-labeled F-Smad3 was visualized with a PhosphorImager. Ubiquitination Assay in Vivo—293T cells were transfected with the related constructs to express HA-ubiquitin, His-tagged Smad3, and Myc-tagged CHIP proteins as indicated in the presence of 50 μm MG132 for 5 h. 7.5 ng/ml TGF-β1 was used as a final concentration for treatment of the cells. The cells were lysed, precipitated, and immunoblotted as described previously (23Li L. Xin H. Xu X. Huang M. Zhang X. Chen Y. Zhang S. Fu X.Y. Chang Z. Mol. Cell.

Luciferase Assays—Luciferase assays were carried out in Mv1Lu cells by co-transfecting (CAGA)12-MLP-Lux and different constructs as indicated. The vectors were used to balance the transfection. 6 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 (7.5 ng/ml) for 24 h. Luciferase activities were measured by the Dual luciferase assay system (Promega) in Top Count (Packard). The Renilla luciferase internal control vector (pRL-TK) (Promega) was always used for calibration of the even transfection efficiency. 20 ng/ml leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) (R&D Systems, Inc.) was used in the experiment for the STAT3 luciferase activity assay. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—5 × 103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. The cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium and treated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 for 72 or 96 h in triplicate. [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added at 1 μCi/well 4 h before termination of incubation. The incorporated [3H]thymidine was counted with Top Count (Packard). CHIP Can Significantly Reduce the Sensitivity of TGF-β Signaling As Demonstrated by Smad3-dependent Transcriptional Activities—To test the role of CHIP on TGF-β signal transduction, we determined whether CHIP had any effect on Smad3-dependent transcriptional activities that could be measured by the luciferase reporter (CAGA)12-MLP-Lux. We performed the experiments in TGF-β response cells (Mv1Lu) and found that 7.5 ng/ml TGF-β stimulated the luciferase activity 5.6-fold over control (Fig. 1A, left columns). The same dose of TGF-β, on the other hand, did not stimulate the reporter activity in cells overexpressing CHIP (Fig. 1A, right columns). This result suggests that overexpression of CHIP can desensitize cells in response to TGF-β signaling. To determine whether such an effect of overexpressed CHIP is specific, we conducted a similar experiment using the STAT-responsive reporter pGL2-M67/sie, which responses to several cytokines (e.g. LIF) in the presence of STAT3 (43Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the STAT3 reporter and STAT3 in the presence or absence of the overexpressed CHIP protein. When these cells were treated with LIF, we observed that the overexpressed"

To address the potential role of SEPT9 in tumorigenesis, we assessed the expression of SEPT9 in 7287 fresh frozen human tissue samples and 292 human cell lines by microarray analysis. In addition, we used a sensitive RT-PCR strategy to define the expression of SEPT9 isoforms in archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded normal human tissues. The mRNA data were further confirmed by immunohistological analyses of SEPT9 protein expression in normal human tissues using antisera that detect SEPT9 isoforms. Using these complementary approaches, we demonstrate that SEPT9 mRNA and protein are expressed ubiquitously, with the isoforms showing tissue-specific expression. The microarray analysis indicates that there is consistent overexpression of SEPT9 in diverse human tumours including breast, CNS, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, lymphoid, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, skin, soft tissue and thyroid. Since tumours are commonly associated with enhanced cell proliferation, we examined the possible correlation of Ki67 and SEPT9 expression in normal tissues and tumours. Our data indicate that the overexpression of SEPT9 in neoplasia is not simply a proliferation-associated phenomenon, despite its role in cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041417130,"The mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis by inhibiting the onset of anaphase until all kinetochores are attached to the mitotic spindle and tension across the kinetochores is generated. Here, we report that the stable partial downregulation of the spindle checkpoint gene MAD1, which is observed in human cancer, leads to a functional inactivation of the spindle checkpoint resulting in gross aneuploidy. Interestingly, although Mad1 is thought to act as a kinetochore based activator of Mad2 during checkpoint activation, we show that normal levels of Mad2, but not of Mad1, are required for preventing premature sister chromatid separation and for maintaining the timing of an undisturbed mitosis, suggesting a Mad1 independent function of Mad2 that operates independent of its checkpoint function. Most significantly, a partial repression of either MAD1 or MAD2 confers resistance to nocodazole, a drug that inhibits microtubule attachment. In contrast, sensitivity to clinically relevant drugs like taxol or monastrol that inhibit the generation of tension across kinetochores is not modulated by partial downregulation of MAD1, suggesting a functional bifurcation of spindle checkpoint dependent apoptotic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2025448306,"The incorporation of ammonia into glutamine, catalyzed by glutamine synthetase, is thought to be important in the detoxification of ammonia in animals. During early fish development, ammonia is continuously formed as yolk proteins and amino acids are catabolized. We followed the changes in ammonia and urea-nitrogen content, ammonia and urea-nitrogen excretion, glutamine synthetase activity, and mRNA expression of four genes coding for glutamine synthetase (Onmy-GS01–GS04) over 3–80 days post fertilization and in adult liver and skeletal muscle of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Both ammonia and urea-nitrogen accumulate before hatching, although the rate of ammonia excretion is considerably higher relative to urea-nitrogen excretion. All four genes were expressed during early development, but only Onmy-GS01 and -GS02 were expressed at appreciable levels in adult liver, and expression was very low in muscle tissue. The high level of expression of Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 prior to hatching corresponded to a linear increase in glutamine synthetase activity. We propose that the induction of glutamine synthetase genes early in development and the subsequent formation of the active protein are preparatory for the increased capacity of the embryo to convert the toxic nitrogen end product, ammonia, into glutamine, which may then be utilized in the ornithine-urea cycle or other pathways.

Glutamine synthetase (l-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP forming), EC 6.3.1.2) catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamate and ammonium to glutamine. Glutamine formation plays a key role in nitrogen metabolism, including nucleotide, amino acid, and urea biosynthesis. Glutamine synthetase is critical in the detoxification process of the highly mobile and toxic ammonia (for reviews, see Refs. 1Korsgaard B. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. Walsh P.J. Wright P.A.

During early fish development, endogenously feeding embryos rely on the catabolism of yolk protein and amino acids for fuel, resulting in a high rate of ammonia production (for review see Ref. 4Wright P.A. Fyhn H.J. Wright P.A. Anderson P.M. Fish Physiology, Vol. 20: Nitrogen Excretion. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 149-186Google Scholar).

Biochem. 1997; 16: 311-321Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), ammonia levels steadily rise during embryogenesis and peak after hatch. Although the egg capsule or chorion is permeable to ammonia (7Smith S. Brown M.E. Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1957: 323-359Google Scholar, 8Rahaman-Noronha E. O'Donnell M.J. Pilley C.M.

Thus, glutamine synthetase may play a central role in maintaining low tissue levels of ammonia throughout the critical time of organ development during embryogenesis. Glutamine may be further utilized to synthesize urea in the rainbow trout embryo. In fish, glutamine is the nitrogen-donating substrate for the first step in the ornithine urea cycle (OUC) 1The abbreviations used are: OUC, ornithine urea cycle; dpf, days post fertilization; CYA, complete yolk absorption; ANOVA, analysis of variance.

Fishes. 1991; 32: 199-218Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggested that urea synthesis may be important during protracted teleost embryogenesis, as ammonia excretion is restricted and the rate of protein catabolism is high.

Physiol. 1979; 63A: 51-56Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated significant urea production in rainbow trout embryos from the incorporation of NaH14CO3, the carbon substrate for the urea cycle. As well, exposure to elevated water ammonia levels results in a significant increase in tissue urea-nitrogen concentrations in trout embryos (14Steele S.L. Chadwick T.D. Wright P.A. J. Exp.

Glutamine synthetase is induced along with the key OUC enzyme, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase III, and other OUC enzymes during early life stages in rainbow trout (5Wright P.A. Felskie A.

Indeed, the levels of glutamine synthetase and OUC enzyme activities are high in early stages of trout development relative to adult liver levels (5Wright P.A. Felskie A. Anderson P.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Korte J.J. Salo W.L. Cabrera V.M. Wright P.A. Felskie A.K. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6270-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The functional glutamine synthetase enzyme consists of eight identical subunits, with some microheterogeneity between subunits (21Smirnov A.V. Tumani H. Henne S. Barchfeld S. Olgemoller U. Wiltfang J. Lange P. Mader M. Nau R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 292: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Developmental expression of glutamine synthetase has been studied in several species. In rat brain, a single glutamine synthetase gene is expressed in 14-day embryos, well before enzyme activity can be detected (22Mearow K.M. Mill J.F. Vitkovic L. Mol. Brain Res. 1989; 6: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A study of the ontogeny of one glutamine synthetase gene in sea urchin embryos revealed mRNA expression in the unfertilized egg (i.e. of maternal origin), as well as in several embryonic stages (23Fucci L. Piscopo A. Aniello F. Branno M. Di Gregorio A. Calogero R. Geraci G. Gene. 1995; 152: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There are two glutamine synthetase isoforms in Drosophila with some quantitative variation in the developmental pattern of expression (24Caggese C. Barsanti P. Viggiano L. Bozzetti M.P. Caizzi R. Genetica. 1994; 94: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome in rainbow trout occurs at about 3 dpf (25Nagler J.J. Fish Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 22: 61-66Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Glutamine synthetase activity was detected in “eyed up” embryos when the yolk sac was dissected away from the embryonic body (14Steele S.L. Chadwick T.D. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, transcription of glutamine synthetase should occur sometime after 3 dpf but well before hatching in rainbow trout. Gene sequences for glutamine synthetase have been reported in several fish species (26Walsh P.J. Handel-Fernandez M.E. Vincek V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 124B: 251-259Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Walsh P.J. Meyer G.D. Medina M. Bernstein M.L. Barimo J.F. Mommsen T.P. J. Exp.

Recently, four glutamine synthetase isoforms were isolated from adult trout tissues, Onmy-GS01–GS04 (29Murray B.W. Busby E.R. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, Onmy-GS01, -GS02, and -GS04 were assigned to three different linkage groups of the rainbow trout map (31Sakamoto T. Danzmann R.G. Gharbi K. Howard P. Ozaki A. Sokkean K. Woram R.A. Okamoto N. Ferguson M.M. Holm L.-E. Guyomard R. Hoyheim B. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1331-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on polymorphic sites in the 3′-untranslated region. 2K. Gharbi, R. Danzmann, and M. Ferguson, unpublished observations. Overall, these findings, along with sequence analysis (29Murray B.W. Busby E.R. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that Onmy-GS01, -GS02, -GS03, and -GS04 are separate loci. Preliminary evidence suggests that mRNA expression of Onmy-GS01–GS04 varies between different adult tissues (29Murray B.W. Busby E.R. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of the four isoforms is not understood. Due to the importance of ammonia detoxification during early development, we decided to first investigate whether one or more of the glutamine synthetase genes are critical in trout embryogenesis. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the developmental expression of glutamine synthetase and relate these changes to major developmental landmarks (e.g. hatching) and nitrogen excretion. We measured developmental changes in the level of mRNA expression of Onmy-GS01, -GS02, -GS03, and -GS04 from 14 to 80 dpf, as well as in adult liver and skeletal muscle tissue. Glutamine synthetase activities, ammonia and urea-nitrogen excretion rates, and ammonia and urea-nitrogen content were also measured between 3 and 80 dpf. Rainbow trout (O. mykiss Walbaum) embryos were purchased on the day of fertilization from Rainbow Springs Trout Farm (Thamesford, Ontario, Canada) and held in continuous-flow, mesh-bottom incubation trays supplied with local well water (10 °C, pH 8; water hardness 411 mg/liter as CaCO3; Ca2+, 5.24 mEq/liter; Cl–, 1.47 mEq/liter; Mg2+, 2.98 mEq/liter; K+, 0.06 mEq/liter; Na+, 1.05 mEq/liter) at the Hagen Aqualab, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Embryos in the incubation trays were shielded from light. The pigmented eye was clearly visible (eyed-up stage) at 14 dpf. After 100% hatching (25–30 days), yolk sac larvae were transferred to mesh-sided, well aerated, floating baskets within a 2-meter circular tank of continuous flow water. Five days after 100% hatching, feeding was administered (1.3–5.0% body weight, Martin Mills Inc., Elmira, Ontario, Canada) via a conveyer belt system. CYA occurred at 50 dpf (juveniles). Adult rainbow trout (donated by the Alma Aquaculture Research Station, Alma, Ontario, Canada) were kept in circular tanks in recirculating, freshwater (10 °C, pH 8) in the Hagen Aqualab, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Fish were fed trout pellets (Martin Mills Inc.) daily ad libitum. Nitrogen excretion rates were measured as previously described (5Wright P.A. Felskie A. Anderson P.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of total RNA, enzyme activities, and concentrations of ammonia and urea-nitrogen, fish were collected at appropriate stages, quickly blotted dry, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until later analysis (1–3 months). For measurements in adult tissues, fish were killed by a sharp cranial blow, and tissues were immediately removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by storage at –80 °C until later analysis (1–3 months). Ammonia and Urea-nitrogen Concentration—Water samples were analyzed for ammonia concentration using the indophenol blue method (32Verdouw N.E. van Echted C.J.A. Dekkers E.M.J. Water Res. 1978; 12: 399-402Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Urea-nitrogen content was measured using a colorimetric assay as described by Rahmatullah and Boyde (33Rahmatullah M. Boyde T.R.C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1980; 107: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Ammonia and urea-nitrogen excretion rates were expressed per gram of whole wet embryo (micromoles/g/h). Urea-nitrogen was calculated by accounting for the two nitrogens per urea molecule. Percent urea-nitrogen excretion was calculated as urea-nitrogen excretion rate/(urea-nitrogen excretion rate + ammonia excretion rate) × 100. Whole embryo, tissue, and yolk ammonia and urea-nitrogen concentrations were measured as described by Wright et al. (5Wright P.A. Felskie A. Anderson P.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final supernatant was analyzed for ammonia concentration using a Sigma diagnostic kit (171 UV, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Urea-nitrogen concentration was measured using the method described by Rahmatullah and Boyde (32Verdouw N.E. van Echted C.J.A. Dekkers E.M.J. Water Res. 1978; 12: 399-402Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Ammonia and urea-nitrogen content were expressed as micromoles/g. The turnover time is the amount of time required for an organism to clear the total content of a substance from its system, where turnover time (h) = ammonia or urea-nitrogen tissue content (micromoles/g)/ammonia or urea-nitrogen excretion rate (micromoles/g/h). RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from 14- and 21-dpf embryos, 31-dpf yolk sac larvae, 60- and 80-dpf juveniles, and adult liver and muscle samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). An extra phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) step was added to samples that contained large amounts of yolk (14, 21, and 31 dpf). RNA was stored at –80 °C for up to 6 months. To eliminate possible genomic DNA, total RNA (3 μg) was treated with deoxyribonuclease I, amplification grade (Invitrogen). The DNase-treated total RNA samples were reverse transcribed using the enzyme SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and primer, Poly-T. Non-reverse transcribed controls were synthesized using the same reaction but substituting diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water for the SuperScript enzyme. Real-time PCR—mRNA expression of Onmy-GS01–GS04 was quantified from the above cDNA products using the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and dual-labeled probes (Table I) were designed for each gene using PrimerExpress software (version 2.0.0, Applied Biosystems). All probes were dual-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein fluorescent reporter at the 3′-end and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine quencher at the 5′-end. Each PCR reaction contained a 5-μl template, 12.5 μl of Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (no AmpErase UNG, Applied Biosystems), and 2.5 μl of forward and reverse primers (9 μm) and probe (2.5 μm). The following conditions were used; 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. To correct for variability in amplification efficiency between different cDNAs, a standard curve was performed (34Giulietti A. Overbergh L. Valckx D. Decallonne B. Bouillon R. Mathieu C. Methods. 2001; 25: 386-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) for each glutamine synthetase gene using serial dilutions of cDNA samples from trout brain tissue, known to have high glutamine synthetase activity. The relative dilution of a given sample was extrapolated by linear regression using the threshold cycle of each unknown. To account for differences in cDNA loading and RNA reverse transcriptase efficiency, each sample was normalized to the expression level of the control gene β-actin. Two control genes were tested for consistency of expression between developmental stages; β-actin and 18 S rRNA. The expression of both genes varied over developmental time. When expressed as a ratio with glutamine synthetase mRNA, the ontogenic changes were very similar between glutamine synthetase mRNA:β-actin and glutamine synthetase mRNA:18 S rRNA. Thus, β-actin was used as the control gene. To account for differences in β-actin expression between early stages and adult liver and muscle, the level of expression of β-actin within each group of samples was normalized to a randomly selected “control” group (60 dpf) according to Billiau et al. (35Biliau A.D. Sefrioui H. Overbergh L. Rutgeerts O. Goebels J. Mathieu C. Waer M.

Open table in a new tab Samples were assayed in triplicate with only one target gene assayed per well. One PCR reaction from each primer set was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced to ensure that each primer set was only amplifying the target sequence. Non-reverse transcribed RNA and water-only controls were run to ensure that no genomic DNA was being amplified and that reagents were not contaminated. Glutamine Synthetase Activity—Enzyme activity was measured in early stages (3, 10, 21, 31, 60, and 80 dpf) and adult tissue homogenates, prepared as previously described (5Wright P.A. Felskie A. Anderson P.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine synthetase activities were calculated from the amount of product (γ-glutamyl hydroxamate) formed via the γ-glutamyl transferase reaction (36Shankar R.A. Anderson P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) from 0 to 30 min at 26 °C. Activity was expressed as the number of micromoles of product formed per gram of wet weight tissue per minute (μmol/g/min). Statistical Analyses—Changes in variables during development were analyzed using least squares linear regression. If inspection suggested a non-linear approach would be more appropriate, this was tested with an F-test. GraphPad Prism (version 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used to calculate linear and non-linear fits and to compare fits. Levels in the yolk were compared with those in the embryo using a paired t test. The t tests were used to test if low values were significantly different from zero. If there was no obvious linear or non-linear relation of a variable with dpf, then ANOVA and the Tukey's test were used to test for differences during development. Statistical analysis for glutamine synthetase mRNA expression was performed using SigmaStat software version 3.00 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Expression of Onmy-GS01–GS04 was compared using one-way ANOVA and a Dunn's post-hoc test. All values are presented as means ± S.E., and significant differences were detected at p < 0.05. Nitrogen Excretion and Ammonia and Urea-nitrogen Content—The rate of ammonia excretion increased in a linear manner during early life stages (r2 = 0.94; Fig. 1A). Urea-nitrogen excretion was not detectable at 3 dpf (t test, t = 1.89, p = 0.12); then it increased in a sigmoidal manner (a sigmoidal fit significantly better than a linear fit, F2,32 = 6.748, p = 0.0036; Fig. 1B). The percentage of nitrogen excreted as urea was much less than ammonia but increased over time (ANOVA, F4,28 = 26.53, p = 0.000; Fig. 1C). About 8% of nitrogen was excreted as urea up to day 31 and about 22% at 60 and 80 dpf (Tukey, p < 0.001); it was not different between days 10 and 31 (Tukey, p > 0.3) or between days 60 and 80 (Tukey, p > 0.8). Ammonia concentration in the whole embryo was increased in a linear fashion during early development (Fig. 2A). Ammonia concentration in the yolk was more than twice that of the larvae at 31 dpf (paired t test, t = 8.15, p = 0.000; Fig. 2A). Urea-nitrogen concentration was low before hatching, increased during hatching, and then decreased after hatching (non-linear fit better than linear fit, F1,33 = 158.6, p < 0.001; Fig. 2B). Urea-nitrogen concentration was ∼10% greater in the larvae than in the yolk at 31 dpf (paired t test, t = 2.97, p = 0.031; Fig. 2B). The ammonia turnover time (time required to clear the embryo of its ammonia content) was initially very long at 3 dpf, but then rapidly decreased by 10 dpf (non-linear sigmoidal fit better than a linear fit, F2,32 = 149.2, p < 0.001; Fig. 2C). At 10 dpf ammonia turnover was ∼1 day, at 21 dpf it was about one-half day, and at 60 and 80 dpf total ammonia content was turning over every 3 h. Urea-nitrogen turnover was high before hatching and decreased after hatching; it could not be calculated at 3 dpf, because urea-nitrogen excretion was not detectable (Fig. 2C). Urea-nitrogen turnover times at 10 and 21 dpf were ∼1 week and significantly greater than those at 31–80 dpf (ANOVA, Tukey, p < 0.004). Urea-nitrogen turnover times at 10 and 21 dpf were not different (Tukey, p > 0.4) and also did not differ between 31, 60, and 80 dpf (Tukey, p > 0.2). Similar to ammonia turnover times, urea-nitrogen was turning over about every 3 h at 60 and 80 dpf. Glutamine Synthetase mRNA Expression and Enzyme Activity—All four glutamine synthetase genes were expressed during early development (Fig. 3). At 14 dpf, the level of expression of Onmy-GS01–GS04 was relatively low, but -GS01 and -GS03 were clearly the first genes expressed. By 21 dpf, Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 mRNA levels were significantly higher than at 14 dpf (11- and 18-fold, respectively) and the level of Onmy-GS02 and -GS04 mRNA remained low (ANOVA, Dunn's, p < 0.05; Table II, Fig. 3). By 31 dpf, just after hatch, all four glutamine synthetase genes were expressed, with Onmy-GS03 significantly higher than Onmy-GS01, -GS02, and -GS04. At several developmental stages, glutamine synthetase mRNA levels were higher relative to expression in adult liver and muscle tissue (Table II). For example, Onmy-GS01 mRNA levels were ∼10-fold higher at 21 and 80 dpf relative to adult muscle tissue. Onmy-GS03 expression was 71- and 107-fold higher at 21 dpf relative to levels in muscle and liver, respectively. Onmy-GS02 and -GS04 expression were relatively low throughout early development.Table IIStatistical comparisons in relative mRNA expression of glutamine synthetase genes (Onmy GS01–GS04) between early developmental and adult tissues of rainbow troutdpf14 GS04EmbryoLiverSkeletal muscle21316080GS01GS02GS03GS04GS02GS03GS04GS02GS04GS01GS02GS04GS03GS04GS01GS02GS03GS0414GS01—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS02—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS03—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS04—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).21GS01—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS03—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).31GS01—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS02—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS03—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).60GS01—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS04—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).80GS01—aSignificantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS02—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).GS04—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).—bSignificantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).a Significantly different from a different gene at the same developmental stage (p < 0.05).b Significantly different from the same gene at a different developmental stage (p < 0.05).

Two distinct evolutionary lineages, Onmy-GS01/03 and Onmy-GS02/04, were identified (29Murray B.W. Busby E.R. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicating at least two rounds of gene duplications. The gene pairs in each lineage most likely represent the results of the ancestral salmonid tetraploidization event estimated to have occurred 25–100 million years ago (37Allendorf F.W. Thorgaard G.H. Turner B.J. Evolutionary Genetics of Fishes. Plenum Press, New York1984: 1-46Crossref Google Scholar). The coding sequences of these isoforms are very similar, whereas the 3′-untranslated regions are more diverged. The nucleotide sequences of the 3′-untranslated region for Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 were 81% homologous, whereas Onmy-GS02 and -GS04 were 79% homologous. The low level of variation in the coding sequence of the isoforms made probe and primer design for mRNA analysis rather tricky. The approach we selected was real-time PCR using a gene-specific probe and set of primers that matched unique 3′-untranslated region sequences in each isoform. In preliminary trials, a subsample of each reaction was sequenced, and we confirmed that only one glutamine synthetase isoform was amplified for each set of primers. The results of this study support our previous evidence (29Murray B.W. Busby E.R. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the four isoforms of glutamine synthetase in trout (Onmy-GS01–GS04) are derived from separate genes. First, all four glutamine synthetase isoforms were expressed during early development and second, the relative mRNA levels varied between isoforms depending on the developmental age or tissue type. The pattern of mRNA expression observed suggests that Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 play a more important role during very early embryonic stages (14–31 dpf) compared with Onmy-GS02 and -GS04. In other words, we presume that the functional octomeric enzyme would have a proportionally higher ratio of Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 subunits relative to Onmy-GS02 and -GS04 at these early stages. Interestingly, these gene pairings correspond to the two distinct evolutionary lineages identified above. It may be that the duplicated genes (e.g. Onmy-GS01 and -GS03) have developed specialized regulatory subfunctions within the embryo. For example, at the time when we observed a large induction of Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 (14–21 dpf), the cerebral hemispheres thicken and become prominent (38Ballard W.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1973; 184: 7-26Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to determine if Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 mRNA in embryos levels are higher in brain tissue relative to other tissues and if these isoforms play a role in neural development. The timing of the induction of glutamine synthetase during early life stages may have particular significance for ammonia detoxification. As stated in the Introduction, the encapsulated salmonid embryo catabolizes endogenous yolk proteins and amino acids resulting in ammonia generation at a time when ammonia elimination is not efficient. Indeed, ammonia concentrations rose by about 2-fold between 3 and 31 dpf, despite a steep linear increase in the rate of ammonia excretion. It should be noted that the higher yolk ammonia content relative to the embryonic body at 31 dpf probably is related to pH differences between these compartments (8Rahaman-Noronha E. O'Donnell M.J. Pilley C.M. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2713-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elevation of ammonia in the embryo, however, may have been contained by the induction of glutamine synthetase. In fact, glutamine synthetase activity in young trout (e.g. 21 dpf) was comparable to activities in adult liver and other tissues. This is surprising given that the glutamine synthetase assay was performed on whole embryos (i.e. yolk plus embryonic body: 3, 10, and 21 dpf) where the presence of the relatively large yolk mass would dilute the embryonic tissue enzyme activity. Glutamine synthetase activities in the current study are consistent with those reported for adult trout (16Korte J.J. Salo W.L. Cabrera V.M. Wright P.A. Felskie A.K. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6270-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Todgham A. Anderson P.M. Wright P.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Our embryo data suggest that the early induction of Onmy-GS01 and -GS03 is preparatory for the increased capacity of the embryo to synthesize glutamine from excess ammonia before and just after hatching. Glutamine produced via the glutamine synthetase reaction during embryogenesis may be stored or shuttled to other pathways, such as the OUC (5Wright P.A. Felskie A. Anderson P.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dépêche J. Gilles R. Daufresne S. Chiapello H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 63A: 51-56Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Steele S.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6270-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, urea was clearly synthesized before hatch. There was an increase in urea-nitrogen concentration when the rate of urea-nitrogen excretion remained very low. The key OUC enzyme, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase III, along with other OUC enzymes is induced before hatching in rainbow trout (5Wright P.A. Felskie A. Anderson P.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Steele S.L. Chadwick T.D. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Korte J.J. Salo W.L. Cabrera V.M. Wright P.A. Felskie A.K. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6270-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase III mRNA was detected as early as 3 dpf but peaked at 10–14 dpf in trout embryos raised under similar conditions to the present study (16Korte J.J. Salo W.L. Cabrera V.M. Wright P.A. Felskie A.K. Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6270-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, part of the glutamine synthesized in the embryo is undoubtedly converted to urea via the OUC. Urea excretion in young trout constitutes a relatively small component of total nitrogen excretion (8–22%), similar to adult trout (reviewed in Ref. 40Wood C.M. Evans D.H. The Physiology of Fishes. CRC Press, Boca Raton1993: 379-425Google Scholar). The rate of urea elimination was initially slow and urea accumulated in the embryo prior to hatching, resulting in relatively long turnover times (∼1 week) compared with ammonia (0.5–1 day). The observed differences in turnover time may relate to the lower permeability of urea relative to ammonia (adult rainbow trout gill: urea 2.6 × 10–6 cm/s (41Pärt P. Wright P.A. Wood C.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119A: 117-123Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) versus NH3, 1.5 × 10–4 cm/s – 2.3 × 10–3 cm/s (42Kelly S. Wood C. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Urea excretion is dependent, in part, on a phloretin-sensitive, saturable (Km = 2 mm) urea transporter in rainbow trout embryos (43Pilley C.M. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 3199-3207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as has been documented in other teleost tissues (44Walsh P.J. Heitz M. Campbell C.E. Cooper G.J. Medina M. Wang Y.S. Goss G.G. Vincek V. Wood C.M. Smith C.P. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Walsh P.J. Grosell M. Goss G.G. Bergman H.L. Bergman A.N. Wilson P. Laurent P. Alper S.L. Smith C.P.

Physiol. 2001; 281: R1594-R1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the full expression of this transporter does not occur until after the gills are completely functional (at hatch gills account for only ∼4% of the potential respiratory surface area (9Rombough P.J. Moroz B.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 154: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar)), then this might explain the longer urea turnover times. The developmental timing of the rainbow trout urea transporter is unknown, but warrants further study. We compared Onmy-GS01–GS04 mRNA levels in young trout with two adult tissues, liver and skeletal muscle. Overall, expression of the four glutamine synthetase isoforms in these two adult tissues was very low, with only trace levels of Onmy-GS04. The lack of Onmy-GS04 expression in liver and muscle tissue agrees with Northern analysis of trout tissues (29Murray B.W. Busby E.R. Mommsen T.P. Wright P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taken together, one might suspect that Onmy-GS01, -GS02, -GS03, and -GS04 are not co-expressed in adult tissues, but this is not the case. In a separate study, we have detected significant levels of mRNA for all four glutamine synthetase isoforms in three regions of the rainbow trout brain. 3P. Wright, S. Steele, A. Huitema, and N. Bernier, unpublished observations. The glutamine synthetase activity in the brain is three orders of magnitude higher compared with other adult tissues. Brain glutamine synthetase has an important role in regulating neurotransmitter metabolism, as well as detoxifying ammonia (47Cooper A.J.L. Plum F. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 440-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Hence, there is differential expression of Onmy-GS01–GS04 in adult trout tissues, and the pattern of expression in adult tissue does not follow the Onmy-GS01/03 and -GS02/04 pairings observed during early life stages.

https://openalex.org/W2072872180,"By using microarray and an invasion/metastasis lung cell line model, we identified the DnaJ-like heat shock protein 40, HLJ1, and found that the expression of HLJ1 correlates negatively with cancer cell invasion ability. Overexpression of HLJ1 can suppress cancer cell invasion in vitro. We further characterize the putative promoter region and investigate the transcriptional regulations of human HLJ1. A serial deletion of the 1.2 kb at the 5'-flanking region of the human HLJ1 gene was subcloned into a vector containing reporter gene and transfected into human lung adenocarcinoma cell line CL1-0, followed by luciferase activity assay. The results indicated that the region from -232 to +176 could drive the basal transcriptional activity of the HLJ1 gene. Sequence analysis of the HLJ1 gene promoter region showed absence of a TATA box, but identified an inverted CCAAT box and four YY1 transcriptional factor-binding sites, which may be important in the regulation of HLJ1 expression. Co-transfection of the YY1 and HLJ1 basal promoter regions, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that YY1 could upregulate HLJ1 basal promoter activity. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that overexpression of YY1 in CL1-0 cells can increase HLJ1 expression and reduce cell invasive capability. The reduction of cancer cell invasive ability is, at least in part, through upregulation of E-cadherin expression. The increase in HLJ1 and E-cadherin expression, as well as the suppression of invasion ability, can be reversed specifically by HLJ1 siRNA."

The mPTS are distinct from the targeting signals of matrix proteins and exhibit a motif with a cluster of basic and possibly hydrophobic amino acids (8Biermanns M. von Laar J. Brosius U. Gärtner J.

Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our recent characterization of PEX19-binding sites (BS) in several PMPs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that these sites have in common a motif of about 15 amino acids and constitute an integral part of the mPTS of yeast PMPs (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Also human PEX19 was shown to bind to targeting-competent regions of several human PMPs (6Brosius U. Dehmel T. Gärtner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 774-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); however, whether human PEX19 actually binds the targeting motif, the TMD, or yet another region within the mPTS remained elusive. Furthermore, the two human PEX19-BS that have been characterized in some detail, namely those of PEX13 and PMP34, failed to reveal any obvious similarity (7Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here we predicted PEX19-BS in human PMPs with an algorithm developed for yeast PMPs. The identified PEX19-BS of ALDP was characterized and demonstrated to coincide with its targeting motif. Both the binding of PEX19 and the targeting of the mPTS of ALDP functioned in yeast. In addition, most of the predicted sites were proven to represent true PEX19-BS indicating that human PMPs harbor common PEX19-BS. We conclude that PMP targeting is conserved from yeast to man because of the recognition of the PEX19-BS by the orthologous PEX19 proteins. Strains and Media—Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for all plasmid amplifications and isolations. E. coli strains BL21(DE3) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and C41(DE3) (J. Walker, Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK) were used for heterologous expression of the recombinant GST-HsPEX19 and GST-ScPex19p fusion proteins, respectively. Two-hybrid assays were performed with yeast strain PJ69-4A (P. James, Madison, WI). Localization of GFP fusion proteins was analyzed in wild-type strain UTL-7A harboring a genomically integrated copy of a peroxisome-targeting signal type 2 (PTS2)-DsRed construct (yHPR251). Standard media for the cultivation of yeast and bacterial strains were prepared as described previously (24Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Panni S. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Castagnoli L. Schneider-Mergener J. Volkmer-Engert R. Cesareni G. PLoS Biol. 2004; : 2/E14Google Scholar). GST-HsPEX19 and GST-ScPex19p were coupled to CM5 sensor chips with densities of ∼2,000 resonance units. In both cases, GST alone was used as a control. Interaction studies were started by injecting the peptides, dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 5% Me2SO, and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4, in a concentration range of 12.5–200 μm (GST-ScPex19p) and 3–50 μm (GST-HsPEX19), respectively. Data were acquired with BIAcoreX equipment, and KD values were determined by applying the steady-state model using BIA-Evaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Morphological Analysis—Live yeast cells were analyzed for GFP and DsRed fluorescence as described previously (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Prior to inspection, cells were grown for 2 days on agar plates with ethanol as sole carbon source. The human skin fibroblast (GM5756T) cell line was transfected with the pEGFP-C1-derived plasmids by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin at 8% CO2. After 2 days, cells were fixed on cover glasses with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal rabbit anti-HsPEX14 antibodies (27Will G.K.

All micrographs were recorded with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope in combination with AxioVision 4.2 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) without changing the information present in the original images. Miscellaneous—The prediction of PEX19-BS, the PEX19 in vitro binding assays with peptide arrays on membrane blots, including the purification of the GST-PEX19 fusion proteins from E. coli, and the yeast two-hybrid assays were carried out essentially as described previously (15Rottensteiner H.

Castagnoli L. Schneider-Mergener J. Volkmer-Engert R. Cesareni G. PLoS Biol. 2004; : 2/E14Google Scholar). Prediction of PEX19-BS in Human PMPs—We recently characterized PEX19-BS in PMPs from S. cerevisiae (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The outcome of this analysis was the development of a prediction matrix, which contains scores for each of the central nine amino acids of a 15-mer peptide. The total score of one peptide is the exponential of the sum of the individual amino acid scores and is a measure for the probability to represent a PEX19-BS. This matrix can be used to scan proteins for PEX19-BS with a 15-amino acid window, as shown for S. cerevisiae PMPs (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To see whether our algorithm would also be useful for the prediction of such sites in higher eukaryotes, all known human PMPs were analyzed (Table III). For PEX11β, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16, PMP22, PMP34, ALDP, ALDP-related protein, and PMP70 the search results of our prediction were contained within fragments that had been reported in the literature to interact with PEX19 (6Brosius U.

Although most of these published fragments are rather large, two binding sites have been mapped in more detail; the core of one PEX19-binding sequence in PEX13 comprises amino acids 175–196 (7Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), containing the predicted amino acids 177–191 (Table III), and one site in PMP34 is delimited by amino acids 274–301 (16Jones J.M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which comprises most of the predicted amino acids (271–285, Table III), thereby indicating the conciseness of the applied algorithm.Table IIIPrediction of PEX19-binding sites in human PMPsPMPPosition of central 15-merSequenceScoreaArbitrary units.PEX2147-161KLGGLINFLIFLQRG7714PEX2199-213lwhGFAEFLIFLLPLINV7014PEX252-66FEPEVKACLWVFLWRftiy3522PEX10238-252syRLLGVISLLHLVLSMglg6736PEX10157-171qRRALLRAVFVLRQGL4882PEX11α173-187eETEWLQSFLLLLFRS13,473PEX11β236-250GLCGLVSSILSILTLiypwlrl9095PEX11β186-200pqLALKLRLQVLLLARVlrgh6931PEX11γ126-140rwWTLSTTLWALSLLLG3714PEX11γ141-155VARSLWMLLKLRQRL3024PEX1258-72WFDEIFTLLDLLLQQhy10,723PEX13177-191lkihftKVFSAFALVRTIRYLyrrlqrmlglrrgs2437PEX1424-38PREPLIATAVKFLQNs6559PEX16119-133vwgevgrwlvialiqlAKAVLRMLLLLWFK6749PEX26276-290aspsSLHFLYKLAQLFRWIrkaafs8507PEX26253-267fslpsKKSLLAALILCLLVVrfdpa8439PMP22103-117PLAGLRRLLLDRLVFa6974PMP2218-32PRRALAQYLLFLRLYp4105PMP24127-141iNMYLLSRVLFALSRL6399PMP24155-169PFPLLTAVVWGLVLWlfeyh4384PMP246-20appQLRALLVVVNALLRK3550PMP34271-285lEAKLLQTVLTAALMFlvye7875PMP69581-595SLEKFHSLVLKLCGG8221PMP69316-330vsknafVCIYLISCFTQLIDLstt6342PMP6939-53ssqNALMFLTLLCLTLLEqf4828PMP6920-34rprldlqFLQRFLQILKVLFPSwss3624PMP7082-96fckETGYLVLIAVMLVSR10,110PMP7059-73VDKVFFSRLIQILKImvpr7314ALDP68-82NRVFLQRLLWLLRLLfprvlc37,393ALDRP80-94VNADFFKQLLELRKI19,872a Arbitrary units. Open table in a new tab Identification and Characterization of the ALDP PEX19-BS—The sequence that represents a PEX19-BS with highest probability was present in the ALDP (Table I). The site was predicted to reside at position 68–82 and apparently represents the only PEX19-BS of the protein (Fig. 1A). We synthesized synthetic 15-mer peptides designed to represent the first 200 amino acids of ALDP in an overlapping arrangement on a membrane and analyzed their ability to bind human PEX19. Although a control incubation of the peptide-containing cellulose membrane with purified GST did not result in significant binding to any of the peptides (not shown), one array of spots that is typical for true binding sites in peptide scan experiments emerged upon incubating the membrane with a purified GST-HsPEX19 fusion protein (Fig. 1B). The serial spots covered amino acids 67–87 of ALDP with the individual peptides sharing the nine-amino acid 73QRLLWLLRL81 region. Systematic truncations of the ALDP-(67–84) peptide, aimed to determine a core binding site, were synthesized and again tested for PEX19 binding. The smallest fragment that retained more than 50% of the ALDP-(67–84) binding activity was the 10-mer peptide RLLWLLRLLF (peptide 44), delimited by amino acids 74 and 83 and containing the shared amino acid residues described above (Fig. 1C). To obtain independent evidence for the interaction of the ALDP fragment with PEX19, a yeast two-hybrid assay was carried out. The 15-amino acid ALDP-(69–83) fragment was fused to the Gal4p DNA-binding domain (GAL4 BD) and coexpressed with a Gal4p activation domain (GAL4 AD) fusion of HsPEX19. This led to growth of the transformed strain on histidine adenine double dropout plates, whereas expression of HsPEX19 or ALDP-(69–83) alone did not (Fig. 2A), thereby indicating that also in vivo the ALDP peptide was recognized by human PEX19. The combined data show that ALDP-(1–200) possesses a single PEX19-BS that matches with our yeast-based prediction matrix.Fig. 2Recognition of PEX19-binding sites is conserved between yeast and man. A, interaction of the ALDP-(69–83) fragment with PEX19 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. The Gal4p-binding domain fusion of ALDP-(69–83) was tested in combination with the Gal4p activation domain fusions of HsPEX19 or ScPex19p in yeast strain PJ69-4A as indicated. As controls, the bare Gal4p domains were coexpressed. Two independent transformants were tested for growth on adenine histidine double dropout medium. B, effect of mutating the ALDP PEX19-binding site on PEX19 binding. Peptides possessing single proline substitutions at each position within ALDP-(67–84) (P) were tested for interaction with HsPEX19 or ScPex19p. Wt boxes represent the unaltered ALDP-(67–84) peptide. Differences in intensity for the identical wild-type peptides are within the usual standard deviation of this method. C, A yeast PEX19-binding site is recognized by human PEX19. A yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted to study the interaction of an ScPex13p-(173–258) fragment with human and yeast PEX19. The same fragment but with a Leu to Pro mutation at position 207 was also tested. This mutation within the targeting motif of ScPex13p abolished binding of both yeast and human PEX19. BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Yeast Pex19p Binds a Human PEX19-BS—Because the applied matrix was based solely on binding data acquired with ScPex19p, we reasoned that the identified BSs in human PMPs should also be recognized by the yeast protein. When ScPex19p was tested for in vivo interaction with the 15-mer PEX19-BS of ALDP, this yielded a clear positive result in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A). To compare the binding of human and yeast PEX19 with the ALDP site more accurately, ALDP-(67–84) peptides with single proline substitutions at each position were synthesized and subjected to PEX19 interaction assays. As a control, wild-type ALDP-(67–84) peptides were synthesized. For HsPEX19, leucine residues 75, 76, 78, and 79 were sensitive to the proline exchange; all other substitutions retained HsPEX19 binding at least to some extent (Fig. 2B). Incubation of an identical blot with the yeast protein revealed that ScPex19p also bound the peptide of human origin (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, from the proline substitutions a similar yet slightly larger core sequence (74RLLWLLRLL82) emerged. Thus, the PEX19 proteins from both organisms are likely to contact ALDP-(67–84) in a similar manner. Human PEX19 Binds a Yeast PEX19-BS—We then asked whether a PEX19-BS from a yeast PMP would likewise be recognized by human PEX19. For that matter, two previously identified ScPex19p-binding fragments were analyzed for interaction with HsPEX19 by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Indeed, a ScPex13p-(173–258) fragment and a ScPex11p-(1–50) peptide (not shown) tested positive in combination with HsPEX19 and, as control, with ScPex19p (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the L207P point mutation, which specifically abolishes the ScPex13p-(173–258) interaction with ScPex19p (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), also caused a loss of HsPEX19 binding (Fig. 2C). To estimate the strength of the interaction of PEX19 with its BS, the 15-mer peptide ScPex13p-(199–213) (GIFAIMKFLKKILYR) representing a yeast PEX19-BS (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was synthesized in chemical amounts, and its affinity for both PEX19 proteins was determined by means of surface plasmon resonance. Both proteins bound the 15-mer peptide with KD values in the micromolar range (ScPex19p, KD = 12 × 10–6 m; HsPEX19, KD = 3,2 × 10–6 m), whereas neither protein showed significant affinity to the unrelated peptide sequence KPTPPPKPSHLKP (Ynl020cp-(608–620)). This result indicated that the interactions of PEX19 proteins with their BS are of intermediate strength. PEX19-dependent Targeting Is Conserved from Yeast to Man—Remarkably, the ALDP fragment (68–82) that we found here to bind PEX19 largely overlaps with a recently identified motif (71–84) that is required for targeting of ALDP (11Landgraf P. Mayerhofer P.U. Polanetz R. Roscher A.A. Holzinger A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We corroborated that in the homologous human system this motif (i.e. the PEX19-BS), when appended to two TMDs (ALDP-(66–164), is indeed sufficient for peroxisomal targeting (Fig. 3, A and B) (11Landgraf P. Mayerhofer P.U. Polanetz R. Roscher A.A. Holzinger A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, our unbiased approach for finding PEX19-BS provides strong affirmation for the role of PEX19-BSs as human PMP targeting motifs. Because ScPex19p did bind to the PEX19-BS of ALDP, we reasoned that in yeast the mPTS of ALDP should be correctly targeted to peroxisomes in a PEX19-BS-dependent manner also. To investigate whether this is really the case, a GFP fusion of an ALDP-(66–164) fragment was coexpressed with the synthetic peroxisomal marker protein PTS2-DsRed in S. cerevisiae, and cells were subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Both fluorescent proteins gave rise to one or a few rather large spots per cell that were clearly colocalized as judged from the merged image (Fig. 3C). As expected for a PMP targeting motif, upon removal of the PEX19-BS from the mPTS, targeting was compromised (ALDP-(87–164)). Expression of the isolated PEX19-BS (ALDP-(66–87)) did not lead to peroxisomal targeting of GFP, likely because this fragment could not be inserted into the peroxisomal membrane. Consistent with this interpretation, appending the ALDP PEX19-BS to a yeast Pex13p-(221–310) fragment that contains a TMD but is not able to target to peroxisomes by itself (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) restored the peroxisomal localization of the protein (Fig. 3C). These data clearly demonstrate that a human mPTS is also functional in yeast because the human PEX19-BS was recognized by yeast Pex19p. Validation of the PEX19-BS Prediction—To check whether our predictions for human PMPs more generally reflect true PEX19-BS, peptides designed to represent most of the sites listed in Table III were synthesized. Each site was covered by an array of nine overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the putative binding region with the peak scoring sequence at the central position. 20 of the 22 analyzed predicted sites did bind HsPEX19, albeit to varying extents (Fig. 4). Thus, whether all of the weakly interacting peptides (e.g. PEX11β-(185–199)) are also recognized by HsPEX19 in vivo remains to be shown. For some sites, a shift of the peak interacting peptide from the central position was noted (e.g. PEX11α-(173–187)), whereas other sites appeared to possess two distinct peaks (e.g. PEX13-(177–191)), suggestive of multiple, neighboring PEX19-BS. In summary, the PEX19-BS of human PMPs possess a common motif that is predictable by our algorithm, which in turn indicates that the basic principle of PEX19-based signal recognition is conserved from yeast to man. In this study, we identified PEX19-BS in human PMPs by applying an in silico search developed for yeast PEX19-BS (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in combination with an in vitro peptide binding assay. This approach not only allowed us to provide a comprehensive picture of PEX19-BS in known human PMPs with relative ease, but it also revealed a remarkable conservation of these sites between yeast and man. Strikingly, the PEX19-BS of ALDP turned out to be identical to its targeting motif (11Landgraf P. Mayerhofer P.U. Polanetz R. Roscher A.A. Holzinger A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Also the published targeting motifs found in the ALDP homologues ALDR and PMP70 as well as those in the unrelated HsPMP22 and HsPEX2 (6Brosius U. Dehmel T. Gärtner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 774-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Biermanns M. von Laar J. Brosius U. Gärtner J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were predicted by our algorithm to coincide with PEX19-BS, which was also proven experimentally by the PEX19 in vitro binding assays (Fig. 4). As a consequence, we propose that previously described targeting motifs of human PMPs can be embedded in the more global PEX19-BS motif. This conclusion significantly extends the postulate of PEX19-BS being present within mPTS (15Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), as the rather large mPTS additionally possesses the information for insertion into the peroxisomal membrane. Formation of the peroxisomal compartment is a remarkably conserved process. Most genes affected in human peroxisome biogenesis disorders have been isolated based on their similarity to the orthologous yeast genes. Furthermore, the two known targeting signals of peroxisomal matrix proteins function in basically all eukaryotic cells (29Keller G.A. Krisans S. Gould S.J. Sommer J.M. Wang C.C. Schliebs W. Kunau W. Brody S. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we provide strong evidence that the targeting signals of PMPs are also conserved among species. A few previous reports had shown the correct insertion of PMPs into heterologous peroxisomal membranes, such as ScPex13p in human fibroblasts (30Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J. Crane D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 31Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M. Metzig B. America T. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our demonstration of the capability of HsPEX19 to recognize the PEX19-BS in ScPex13p (Fig. 2C) now provides the molecular basis for the observed targeting of this PMP to mammalian cells. We estimated the affinities of both yeast and human PEX19 for the PEX19-BS of ScPex13p by means of surface plasmon resonance. Binding of the two proteins was comparable and of intermediate strength with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. The slightly higher affinity of human PEX19 for the yeast-derived peptide is probably not significant in terms of function of the PMP receptor as both determined KD values are in the range expected for an import factor that only transiently interacts with PMPs en route to peroxisomes. The obtained values are also in agreement with a previous report in which the HsPEX19-HsPEX14 interaction was roughly quantified based on competition experiments (20Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, we demonstrate the ability of the mPTS of human ALDP to target the otherwise cytosolic GFP to yeast peroxisomal membranes. Also in this context, the PEX19-BS of ALDP was critical for correct targeting. Furthermore, the ALDP PEX19-BS was able to substitute a yeast PEX19-BS in the mPTS of ScPex13p and was bound by the yeast PEX19 protein in vitro and in vivo. Thus, human PMPs can be substrates for the yeast PMP targeting machinery. This is notable insofar as S. cerevisiae lacks PEX16, a component shown in higher eukaryotes to be required for PMP topogenesis (32South S.T. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Honsho M. Hiroshige T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44513-44524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In summary, our data are clear in that the molecular mechanisms of PMP targeting and especially the binding of PEX19 to PMP targeting signal motifs are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man.

https://openalex.org/W2122587704,"We have used a homology model of the extracellular domain of the 5-HT3 receptor to dock granisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, into the binding site using AUTODOCK. This yielded 13 alternative energetically favorable models. The models fell into 3 groups. In model type A the aromatic rings of granisetron were between Trp-90 and Phe-226 and its azabicyclic ring was between Trp-183 and Tyr-234, in model type B this orientation was reversed, and in model type C the aromatic rings were between Asp-229 and Ser-200 and the azabicyclic ring was between Phe-226 and Asn-128. Residues located no more than 5 Å from the docked granisetron were identified for each model; of 26 residues identified, 8 were found to be common to all models, with 18 others being represented in only a subset of the models. To identify which of the docking models best represents the ligand-receptor complex, we substituted each of these 26 residues with alanine and a residue with similar chemical properties. The mutant receptors were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells and the affinity of granisetron determined using radioligand binding. Mutation of 2 residues (Trp-183 and Glu-129) ablated binding, whereas mutation of 14 other residues caused changes in the [3H]granisetron binding affinity in one or both mutant receptors. The data showed that residues both in and close to the binding pocket can affect antagonist binding and overall were found to best support model B.

The data showed that residues both in and close to the binding pocket can affect antagonist binding and overall were found to best support model B. The 5-HT3 receptor is the only member of the 5-HT (serotonin) receptor family that is a ligand-gated ion channel. It is a member of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel family, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), 1The abbreviations used are: nACh, nicotinic acetylcholine; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A. 1The abbreviations used are: nACh, nicotinic acetylcholine; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A. glycine and GABAA receptors. The receptors function as a pentameric arrangement of subunits. Each subunit has a large extracellular N-terminal region and four transmembrane domains (M1–M4). Five 5-HT3 receptor subunits (A–E) have been identified although to date only homomeric (A only) or heteromeric (A and B) subunit complexes have been functionally characterized (1Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 2Niesler B. Frank B. Kapeller J. Rappold G.A. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 310: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 5-HT3 receptors may be evolutionarily the oldest members of the Cys-loop family (3Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and this, combined with the ability of the A subunit to yield functional homomeric proteins, has meant that 5-HT3 receptors provide a useful model system for understanding critical features of all Cys loop receptors (4Reeves D.C. Lummis S.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Most work on this family of proteins has been performed using nACh receptors, but despite many years of study structural details of the receptor-ligand interactions at the atomic level remain unknown. The determination of the structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), which is homologous to the extracellular domain of the nACh receptor, and indeed all Cys loop receptors, has significantly improved our knowledge of the ligand binding domain (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). However, some differences have emerged between the AChBP structure and cryoelectron microscopy data from the nACh receptor. For example, the extracellular domains of the nACh receptor α subunits in the closed state differ by rotations of their inner pore-facing regions when compared with the AChBP crystal structure (6Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, recent high resolution studies showing nACh receptor agonists bound to AChBP suggest that some details of the published homology models may need revision (7Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, homology models based on AChBP have proved useful for examining the binding region and predicting the orientation of ligands within the binding pockets for a range of Cys loop receptors including nACh, GABAA, and 5-HT3 receptors (8Le Novere N. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3210-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem.

However, it is important to combine information from such models with data from experimental studies. We have recently constructed a homology-based model of the 5-HT3 receptor extracellular domain where docking 5-HT into the binding pocket yielded seven alternative possible orientations of the ligand, only two of which were supported by experimental evidence (11Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the current study we have used this model to dock the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron. During the course of this work a similar study using a range of antagonists was published (10Maksay G. Bikadi Z. Simonyi M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This study supported our previous work by indicating that some of the residues that we had identified as critical for 5-HT binding and/or function in the binding pocket are also critical for antagonist binding. However, whereas these authors used previously reported experimental data to support their models, there are still many residues predicted to interact with antagonists that have not yet been examined. To provide experimental data to support our model, we have combined our modeling data with radioligand binding studies on receptors with changes in potentially critical ligand-binding amino acids to define the location of an antagonist in this site. Materials—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK), except fetal calf serum, which was from Labtech International (Ringmer, UK). [3H]Granisetron (81 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of the highest obtainable grade. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were maintained on 90-mm tissue culture plates at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mix F12 (1:1) with GlutaMAX™ I containing 10% fetal calf serum and passaged when confluent. Cells in 90-mm dishes were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (13Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) at 80–90% confluency. Following transfection cells were incubated for 3–4 days before assay. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis reactions were performed using the method described by Kunkel (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). The 5-HT3A(b) subunit DNA (accession number AY605711) has been described previously (16Hargreaves A.C. Lummis S.C. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the recommendations of Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and some suggestions of the Primer Generator (18Turchin A. Lawler Jr., J.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A silent restriction site was incorporated into each primer to assist rapid identification. Radioligand Binding—This was undertaken as described previously (19Lummis S.C. Sepulveda M.I. Kilpatrick G.J. Baker J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 243: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HEK293 cells that had been transfected with wild type or mutant DNA were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. They were then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing the following proteinase inhibitors (PI): 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Harvested cells were washed in HEPES/PI and frozen at –20 °C. After thawing, they were washed twice with HEPES buffer, resuspended, and 50 μg of cell membranes were incubated in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing [3H]granisetron. Initially, single point radioligand binding assays were performed using 1 nm and sometimes 20 nm [3H]granisetron to test for specific binding. If specific binding was present, saturation binding (8 point) assays were performed on at least three separate plates of transfected cells for each mutant. Nonspecific binding was routinely 5–10% of total binding and was determined by the addition of 1 μm d-tubocurarine or 1 μm quipazine (both potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (19Lummis S.C. Sepulveda M.I. Kilpatrick G.J. Baker J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 243: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Gill C.H. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), which gave equivalent results. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters presoaked for 3 h in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (21Huang X. Liu T. Gu J. Luo X. Ji R. Cao Y. Xue H. Wong J.T. Wong B.L. Pei G. Jiang H. Chen K. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) followed by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000sc). Maximum specific binding was up to 70,000 dpm and routinely in the range 500–2000 fmol/mg of protein. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting (GraphPad, PRISM, San Diego, CA) according to the equation B = (Bmax·[L])/(K + [L]), where B is bound radioligand, Bmax is maximum binding at equilibrium, K is the equilibrium dissociation constant, and [L] is the free concentration of radioligand. Modeling—This was performed as described previously (11Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, the three-dimensional model of the extracellular region of the 5-HT3 receptor was built using MODELLER 6v2 (22Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of AChBP determined to a resolution of 2.7 Å. The pentamer was generated by superimposing the model on to each protomer of AChBP, with care taken not to alter the coordinate axes of reference. The generated pentameric model was energy minimized in Sybyl 6.8 using the Amber force field (23Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4847) Google Scholar) by moving side chains alone, to relieve short contacts at the interprotomer interfaces. Electrostatic terms were included in these minimization cycles. Ligand Docking—Granisetron was docked using AUTODOCK 3.05 (24Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Proteins. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 25Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8853) Google Scholar). The binding pocket is geometrically well defined. 10 genetic algorithm runs were carried out to dock each of the four stereoisomers of granisetron. For the genetic algorithm, a population size of 50 was used, and the maximum number of generations was set to 27,000. A total of 13 unique docked poses were generated. These structures were used as input for software created by one of us (see Ref. 11Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that identified all amino acids that had at least one atom within 5 Å of the ligand. Potential hydrogen bonding interactions were identified using Swiss PDB Viewer (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Docking of Granisetron—AUTODOCK revealed 13 energetically favorable granisetron binding models, and 26 residues were identified as being no more than 5 Å from the docked granisetron (Fig. 1). Of these, 8 residues were found to be common to all models, with 18 others being represented in only a subset of the models (Table I). When 5-HT was docked into the binding site in our previous studies (11Reeves D.C. Sayed M.F. Chau P.L. Price K.L. Lummis S.C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2338-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it was found to be completely contained within the binding cleft, but an antagonist such as granisetron need not necessarily occupy the same location. Indeed, an antagonist might act solely by blocking the entrance to the binding pocket or by allosteric interactions at a site distant from the binding region. However, given the high affinity of granisetron binding (Kd < 1 nm), it is likely to have a well defined binding site. Combined with the competitive nature of the interactions with granisetron and 5-HT, it is likely that granisetron will bind at least partly in the binding pocket. Thus, it was not surprising that a high proportion of the residues that we had previously identified as within 5 Å of 5-HT in the binding pocket were also within5Åof granisetron in most of the models that the docking procedure revealed as energetically favorable.Table IResidues of the 5-HT3 receptor binding site within 5 Å of granisetron Open table in a new tab The models fall broadly into three groups, which we have designated A, B, and C (Table I). In group A the azabicyclic ring of granisetron is located between Trp-183 and Tyr-234, and the aromatic rings lie between Trp-90 and Phe-226. In group B the orientation of granisetron is reversed, and consequently the aromatic rings are located between Trp-183 and Tyr-234, whereas the azabicyclic ring is between Trp-90 and Phe-226. Group C is quite distinct as the azabicyclic ring lies between Phe-226 and Asn-128, and the aromatic rings between Asp-129 and Ser-206. Representatives from each of these groups are shown in Fig. 2. Effect of Mutations—Each of the residues that were found to be within 5 Å of granisetron in the models was changed to alanine and to a residue with properties similar to those of the wild type amino acid.

Open table in a new tab Changing 10 residues resulted in no change in affinity for either mutation, suggesting these residues do not play a role in ligand binding. The results also revealed that there was no specific binding for both mutations at Trp-183, which has previously been shown to be critical for ligand binding (27Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10262-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and at Glu-129. In both instances mutant receptors were expressed at the cell membrane (Fig. 3). There was also no binding to receptors with mutations of Trp-90 and Tyr-234 to alanine, which again expressed at the cell membrane (Fig. 3), indicating that the characteristics of these residues are critical for binding and/or the structural integrity of the receptor. For the remaining residues there were differences in binding affinities compared with wild type for one or both of the substitutions, suggesting that these residues have some role in granisetron binding. These residues include Tyr-153 and Trp-195, which may form part of the aromatic box that appears to be critical for all ligand gated ion channels (29Mu T.W. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6850-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The other residues are Arg-92, Thr-179, Thr-181, Ser-182, Leu-184, Ser-203, Ser-206, Ile-228, Asp-229, and Ile-230. The structure of AChBP is a useful model for the extracellular domain of the 5-HT3 receptor, which contains the binding site for agonists and competitive antagonists. Here we have used our model of the 5-HT3 receptor to dock granisetron into the binding site using AUTODOCK. This yielded 13 energetically favorable models. Within these models, 26 residues were identified as being within 5 Å of granisetron, and radioligand binding data from receptors mutated at each of these 26 positions showed that as many as 16 of these residues may be involved in the binding of granisetron. These are discussed in more detail below. The data also showed that only 8 of these 26 residues were common to all 13 models (see Table I). This is in contrast to our previous studies with 5-HT docking where more than 90% of residues within 5 Å of the ligand were common to all of the binding orientations identified. Nevertheless, all 8 common residues overlap with those that were identified as being located within 5 Å of 5-HT, providing support for the hypothesis that the selective antagonist granisetron binds in the same binding pocket as 5-HT. Examination of the average number of residues that altered binding affinity when mutated was 12 for model A and 12 for model B but only 10 for model C. This suggests that model C is less likely to be correct. Many of the other data would fit both models A and B, but the potential for weak interactions between granisetron and the protein is greatest in model B. In particular our data support a hydrogen bond between granisetron and Tyr-153 (shown in Fig. 4) and also aromatic interactions with Tyr-234 and Trp-183. Additionally, in this model granisetron is in the same orientation as predicted by Maksay et al. (10Maksay G. Bikadi Z. Simonyi M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), who show that it best fits the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist pharmacophore model in this orientation. Consequently, we propose that granisetron is located in the binding pocket with its aromatic rings positioned between Trp-183 and Tyr-234, and its azabicyclic ring is close to Trp-90 and Phe-226. However, it should be remembered that the model is based on the structure of AChBP, which is probably more similar to the desensitized and/or open states of the nACh receptor than its closed state (6Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Granisetron, as a competitive antagonist, would be expected to bind preferentially to the closed state, and consequently a number of the residues examined in this study may be in a different location, albeit probably only a few angstroms displaced from the AChBP-like model. Therefore, we must be cautious in using distances between atoms obtained from this model to confirm the presence of atomic interactions such as hydrogen bonds, which depend critically on the distance between atoms. The Role of Residues That Ablate Binding (Glu-129 and Trp-183)—The mutation of Glu-129 and Trp-183 to either alanines or chemically similar residues were found to eliminate [3H]granisetron binding. This was to be expected for Trp-183, which has been previously identified as critical for ligand binding (27Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10262-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Beene et al. (28Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10262-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) have shown that Trp-183 forms a cation-π interaction with the 1° amine of 5-HT, as has previously been demonstrated in the nACh receptor between acetylcholine and the homologous residue, Trp-149 (31Zhong W.G. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y.O. Li L.T. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Aromatic residues are found in homologous positions in GABAA and glycine receptors where they have also been shown to play a role in ligand binding (32Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Science. 1993; 262: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Vandenberg R.J. Handford C.A. Schofield P.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is not unexpected that Trp-183 forms an essential part of the antagonist binding site and we suggest that it forms a π -π interaction with granisetron. The role of Glu-129 is not yet clear, although our data show it has an essential role in either ligand binding or in the structure of the receptor and/or binding pocket. Given that radioligand binding was completely ablated when Glu-129 was replaced with the chemically similar aspartate, yet the receptors reached the membrane, we propose that this residue is critical for the local structure of the binding pocket. Our data are somewhat surprising given previous experiments that reported both radioligand binding (of a different antagonist GR65630) and function of an E129D mutant 5-HT3 receptor (Glu-106 by their numbering) (35Boess F.G. Steward L.J. Steele J.A. Liu D. Reid J. Glencorse T.A. Martin I.L. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These authors reported poor expression of Glu-129 mutants (E129A and E129Q receptors expressed too poorly to characterize them) and used a different splice variant of the receptor, which might explain these differences. Although intuitively we would not anticipate that this splice variant (which contains an extra six amino acids in the M3-M4 intracellular loop) would affect receptor function, this change is sufficient to convert m-chlorophenylbiguanide from a partial agonist to a full agonist (36Niemeyer M.I. Lummis S.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and may have as yet unexplained long distance effects on the binding pocket. The Roles of Aromatic Residues That May Interact with Granisetron (Trp-90, Tyr-153, Trp-195 and Tyr-234)—The results from these mutations suggest that these residues have specific roles in the binding of granisetron and/or the structure of the binding pocket. There is already evidence from previous studies that the aromatic residues Trp-90, Tyr-153, Trp-195, and Tyr-234 are important in antagonist binding to the 5-HT3 receptor (27Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Venkataraman P. Venkatachalan S.P. Joshi P.R. Muthalagi M. Schulte M.K. BMC Biochemistry. 2002; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of Trp-90 appears to be primarily because of its aromatic nature as removal of the aromatic ring, as in W90A (present study) and W90S (27Spier A.D. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5620-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), eliminates granisetron binding. The role of this residue is probably similar to the equivalent residue in AChBP (W53), which provides aromatic character in the binding pocket but only makes limited or no contact with agonists. Both an aromatic and a hydroxyl group are important at position 153, and we propose that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-153 forms a hydrogen bond with granisetron, as previously discussed (30Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conversely, it is difficult to assign a specific role to Trp-195, as changing it to another large aromatic residue (Tyr) or to a small uncharged residue (Ala) results in a similar large effects on granisetron binding. We suggest that Trp-195 plays an indirect role in antagonist binding and may, for example, assist the formation of the correct structure of the binding pocket. Mutation of Tyr-234, which is located on the opposite side of the binding pocket to Trp-183, has previously revealed that this residue has an important role in ligand binding and/or receptor structure. In particular the aromatic group is essential, as replacement with either serine or alanine resulted in non-binding receptors (30Price K.L. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23294-23301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This residue does not appear to form a cation-π bond with 5-HT, although the equivalent tryptophan residue in MOD-1 receptors (Trp-226) does form this type of bond with 5-HT (29Mu T.W. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6850-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We propose that in the 5-HT3 receptor Tyr-234 forms a π -π interaction with the aromatic rings of granisetron. The data from Phe-226 show that an aromatic residue is not essential here, as alanine could substitute reasonably satisfactorily for phenylalanine. This is surprising as the aligning position in the nACh receptor α1 subunit (Tyr-190) and in AChBP (Tyr-185) have important roles in ligand binding (7Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Nevertheless our data indicate that Phe-226 does not play a role in granisetron binding. The Roles of Non-aromatic Residues That May Interact with Granisetron (Arg-92, Thr-179, Ser-182, Leu-184, Ser-203, Ser-206, Ile-228, Asp-229, and Ile-230)—Arg-92 has the potential to hydrogen bond with granisetron in our model and previous data support its role in antagonist binding (38Yan D. Pedersen S.E. White M.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Arg-92 forms a salt bridge with Asp-229 and/or Glu-200 (10Maksay G. Bikadi Z. Simonyi M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which would give it a role in the local structure of the binding pocket. Our data show that D229A receptors have a lower affinity than wild type, which provides some support for a hydrogen bond. However, the higher affinity of D229E receptors compared with wild type may indicate a different interaction here, although it is also possible that the atomic distances are more favorable for such a bond in this mutant. The data from Thr-179, Ser-182, and Leu-184 are surprising given that these residues have not been previously reported as being important in either the structure or the function of 5-HT3 receptors. Radioligand binding of the Thr-179 mutants indicate that the hydroxyl group is important as replacement by serine has no effect, but removal of the hydroxyl in T179A mutant receptors results in a greatly decreased binding affinity. In support of a role of the Thr-179 hydroxyl, the model indicates it has the potential to hydrogen bond with Asn-128 and/or Glu-236. We propose that Thr-179 does not directly bind granisetron but is important in the local structure of the binding site. The model suggests that Ser-182 also has the potential to hydrogen bond with granisetron, via its backbone carbonyl, and the data support this, as the decreased binding affinity we observed occurs for both mutations. However, the aligning residue in AChBP (S142) has been proposed to have a structural role (discussed in more detail below), and we cannot yet eliminate this possibility. Leu-184 is equivalent to AChBP residue Thr-144, whose backbone carbonyl has recently been shown to hydrogen bond with Asp-85 (a highly conserved aspartate residue), which lies just outside the ligand binding pocket (7Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This aspartate forms hydrogen bonds with Ser-142 and is important for the structure of the binding pocket, although its major role is in polarizing Trp-143 (the residue equivalent to Trp-183), which allows a favorable interaction with the positively charged ligand. The present data do not show whether or not a hydrogen bond similar to the Thr-144–Asp-85 bond occurs between Leu-184 and the equivalent aspartate residue in the 5-HT3 receptor, but these data do suggest that a large hydrophobic residue is strongly preferred at this location. We propose that such a residue is important for the structure of the binding pocket and may specifically be involved in correctly locating the adjacent residue, Trp-183. The side chains of Ile-228 and Ile-230, which the model places less than 4 Å from granisetron, are probably important for shaping the binding pocket and/or for creating hydrophobicity. The radioligand binding data suggest that Ile-228 is important for creating bulk, as replacing this with the similarly bulky asparagine yields receptors with a similar Kd for [3H]granisetron binding, whereas the smaller alanine decreases affinity. Hydrophobicity is the more critical feature at position 230. At this position, replacement with alanine renders the Kd unchanged but replacement with asparagine decreases binding affinity. These observations support the model, as Ile-228 is close to the center of granisetron and may play a role in its correct location, whereas Ile-230 is close to granisetrons hydrophobic aromatic rings. The locations of Ser-203 and Ser-206 in our model are currently only tentative as they are part of loop F, which has not yet been clearly resolved in the structure of AChBP. Indeed our model suggests that these residues are located some distance from granisetron, whereas the binding data indicate they play a role. As loop F residues have been shown to play an important function in both GABAA and nACh receptor binding pockets (39Martin M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Newell J.G. Czajkowski C. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1999; 71: 369Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) we believe this region of sequence is also likely to be involved in 5-HT3 receptor function. We await further high resolution structural data to determine the exact role of these residues. Conclusion—We have identified a possible location of the specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron in the 5-HT3 receptor binding pocket using homology modeling, ligand docking, and radioligand binding. Our results suggest that the orientation of granisetron in the 5-HT3 receptor binding pocket is with its aromatic rings between Trp-183 and Tyr-234 and its azabicyclic ring between Trp-90 and Phe-226. Further high resolution structural data, particularly of the closed state of the receptor, will allow us to test our hypothesis."

Arachidonic acid (AA) released by PLA2s is metabolized via the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways to various prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively, that exhibit diverse biological activities. Several lysophospholipids or their metabolites, such as lysophosphatidic acid and platelet-activating factor (PAF), also exert various effects on cells by acting on their cognate receptors. PLA2s have also been implicated in membrane remodeling through accelerating deacylation and consequently reacylation reactions. A number of mammalian PLA2s have been identified to date, including 11 secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s; group IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, XIIA, and XIIB), 4 cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s; α, β, γ, and δ), 6 Ca2+-independent PLA2s (β, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, and η), and 4 PAF acetylhydrolases (1Murakami M.

The sPLA2 family represents a group of structurally related, disulfide-rich, and Ca2+-dependent low molecular weight enzymes with a His-Asp catalytic dyad (1Murakami M. Kudo I. Adv.

As in the case of sPLA2-IB, it has been proposed that sPLA2-X is converted from a catalytically inactive zymogen to a mature, catalytically active form after proteolytic removal of the N-terminal propeptide (5Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanism for this proteolytic processing is still obscure, because the active enzyme is spontaneously secreted from sPLA2-X-transfected cells during culture (3Murakami M.

Although these distributions suggest the potential roles of sPLA2-X in airway inflammation, reproduction, and atherosclerosis, the true physiological and pathological functions of this particular sPLA2 enzyme are still a subject of debate. During the course of our immunohistochemical analyses of various sPLA2 enzymes in human tissues (9Masuda S. Murakami M. Mitsuishi M. Komiyama K. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Masuda S. Murakami M. Matsumoto S. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 655-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we found that sPLA2-X is uniquely located in the neuronal fibers in multiple peripheral tissues. On the basis of this observation, we herein examined the expression and potential functions of sPLA2-X in neuronal cells. We show that sPLA2-X has the ability to induce neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells through production of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). We also provide evidence that the conversion of the proenzyme to the mature enzyme mostly occurs after the secretion process, thus supporting the extracellular action of this enzyme.

Cell Culture—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal horse serum (JRH Biosciences), 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences), and 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in humidified air. For neural differentiation, the cells (104 cells/ml) were cultured with appropriate concentrations of rat nerve growth factor (NGF; Sigma) in type I collagen-coated 6- or 12-well plates (Iwaki Glass) for up to 3 days (14Matsuzawa A.

Isolation and Culture of Mouse Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) Explants—Procedures for animal handling and preparation of mouse tissue sections were approved by the ethical committee of our Faculty. Mouse DRG explants were obtained from E12.5 to E13 of C57BL/6 mice (Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center) (16Lu W. Yamamoto V. Ortega B. Baltimore D. Cell. 2004; 119: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Mouse fetuses were cut from the upper cervical vertebrae to the tails along the spinal cords. The spinal cord sections were separated from the bodies, and DRG neurons attached to the spinal cords were picked up and harvested. DRG explants were then cultured for up to 36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 20 ng/ml NGF in poly-d-lysine-coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek) pre-coated with 20 μg/ml laminin (Biochemical Technologies). Northern Blotting—Equal amounts (∼10 μg) of total RNA obtained from cells by use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) were applied to separate lanes of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with appropriate cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). Hybridization and subsequent membrane washing were carried out as described previously (3Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita M. Arai H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 0.5 μg of total RNA from cells and tissues and avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer's instructions supplied with the RNA PCR kit (Takara Biomedicals). Subsequent amplification of the cDNA fragments was performed using 0.5 μl of the reverse-transcribed mixture as a template with specific primers for each sPLA2 (Fasmac). For amplification of sPLA2-IID, -IIE, -IIF, -V, and -X, a set of 23-bp oligonucleotide primers corresponding to 5′- and 3′-nucleotide sequences of their open reading frames were used as primers, as described previously (9Masuda S. Murakami M. Mitsuishi M. Komiyama K. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PCR condition for sPLA2-IID, -IIE, -V, and -X was 94 °C for 30 s and then 30 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 4 min, using the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech). The PCR condition for sPLA2-IIF was 94 °C for 30 s and then 30 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30s, using ExTaq polymerase (Takara Biomedicals). The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Immunoblotting—Lysates from 2 × 105 cultured cells or 25-μg protein equivalents of tissue homogenates in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% gels under reducing conditions with 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations in the samples were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. As required for experiments, cell culture supernatants and cells, which were lysed in a volume of cell lysis buffer equivalent to the culture supernatants, were applied to the gels. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semi-dry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore). After blocking with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membranes were probed with rabbit antibody against human or mouse sPLA2-X at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T for 2 h, and were visualized using the ECL Western blot system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described (3Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita M. Arai H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Immunohistochemistry—Studies with human tissue sections were approved by the ethical committee of our universities with informed consent from the patients. Immunohistochemical staining of human tissue sections was performed as described previously (9Masuda S. Murakami M. Mitsuishi M. Komiyama K. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Masuda S. Murakami M. Komiyama K. Ishihara M. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 655-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues embedded in paraffin were sectioned and mounted on slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations of water. The tissue sections (4 μm thickness) were incubated with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) as required, incubated for 10 min with 3% (v/v) H2O2, washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, incubated with 5% (v/v) skim milk in TBS for 30 min, washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, and incubated for 2 h with anti-sPLA2 antibodies at 1:200 dilution in TBS. Then the sections were treated with a catalyzed signal-amplified system staining kit (Dako) with diaminobenzidine substrate. The cell type was identified from conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining of serial sections adjacent to the specimen used for immunohistochemistry. Expression of sPLA2s by the Adenovirus System—Adenoviruses bearing individual sPLA2 cDNAs were prepared with the ViraPower Adenovirus Expression System (Invitrogen), as described previously (9Masuda S. Murakami M. Mitsuishi M. Komiyama K. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Masuda S. Murakami M. Matsumoto S. Eguchi N. Urade Y.

Ishii T. Kudo I. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 655-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length cDNAs for sPLA2s were subcloned into the pENTER/D-TOPO vector using the pENTER Directional TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). After purification of the plasmids from the transformed Top10 competent cells (Invitrogen), the cDNA inserts were transferred to the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) by means of the Gateway system using LR Clonase (Invitrogen). The plasmids were purified and digested with PacI (New England Biolabs). The linearized plasmids (1–2 μg) were then mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and transfected into subconfluent 293A cells (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of Opti-MEM in 6-well plates (Iwaki Glass). Then 293A cells were cultured for 1–2 weeks in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, with replacement of the medium every 2 days. When most cells became detached from the plates, the cells and culture medium were harvested together, freeze-thawed twice, and centrifuged to obtain the adenovirus-enriched supernatants. Then aliquots of the supernatants were added to fresh 293A cells and cultured for 2–3 days to amplify adenoviruses. After 2–4 times of amplification, the resulting adenovirus-containing media were used as virus stocks. Viral titers were determined by the plaque-forming assay with 293A cells. As a control, the pAd/CMV/V5-GW/lacZ vector (Invitrogen) was digested with PacI and transfected into 293A cells to produce lacZ-bearing adenovirus. Aliquots of the adenovirus-containing medium was added to PC12 cells and cultured for appropriate periods with or without NGF for subsequent analyses. Experiments with Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—A set of synthetic hairpin-forming oligonucleotides directed to rat sPLA2-X (5′-CACCGATACCTCTTCTTCCCCTCGTTCAAGAGACGAGGGGAAGAAGAGGTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAATACCTCTTCTTCCCCTCGTCTCTTGAACGAGGGGAAGAAGAGGTATC-3′ (antisense)) and that directed to rat sPLA2-IIA (5′-CACCGGACAGGAAAGAGAGCTGATTTCAAGAGAATCAGCTCTCTTTCCTGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAGACAGGAAAGAGAGCTGATTCTCTTGAAATCAGCTCTCTTTCCTGTCC-3′ (antisense)) were prepared. After annealing, the oligonucleotides were subcloned into pENTER™/U6 vector (Invitrogen) using BLOCK-iT™ U6 RNAi Entry Vector kit (Invitrogen). After transformation into Top10 competent cells and plasmid purification, the insert was transferred to the pAd/BLOCK-iT™-DEST vector (Invitrogen) by means of the Gateway system using LR Clonase. After transformation into Top10 competent cells and plasmid purification, the plasmid was linearized with PacI and transfected into 293A cells with Lipofectamine 2000 to produce adenovirus bearing the sPLA2-X or SPLA2-IIA siRNA construct. After 2–4 times of amplification, the resulting adenovirus-containing media were used for subsequent analyses. Measurement of sPLA2 Activity—sPLA2 activities in cell lysates and culture supernatants were assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled linoleic acid released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (Amersham Biosciences). For preparation of cell lysates, PC12 cells were harvested with cell scrapers, suspended in cell lysis buffer, and disrupted by sonication followed by two freeze-thawing cycles. The substrate in ethanol was dried up under N2 stream and was dispersed in water by sonication. Each reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) consisted of appropriate amounts of the required samples, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, [14C]linoleic acid was extracted, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counter, as described previously (3Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita M. Arai H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Confocal Laser Microscopy—Cells grown in subconfluency on glass bottom dishes (Matsunami) pre-coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 1 h. After three washes with TBS, the fixed cells were treated with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.5% (w/v) saponin in TBS (blocking solution) for 1 h, with rabbit anti-sPLA2 antibodies or goat anti-GM130 antibody (BD Biosciences) at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h, and then with species-matched fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or Cy3-conjugated second antibody at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h, with three washes in each interval. After six washes with TBS, specific immunofluorescent signals were visualized with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (IX70; Olympus). TLC—PC12 cells (107 cells) infected for 3 days with mock- or sPLA2-containing adenovirus in the presence of 0.2 ng/ml NGF were incubated for an additional 12 h with [14C]choline (0.5 μCi/ml). The cells were then washed with TBS and harvested, and phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). Individual phospholipids were separated on silica gel TLC plates (Sigma) with a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v) (18Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After exposure to iodine vapor, visible spots were identified by comparing their positions with those of standard phospholipids. The plates were then exposed to Kodak BioMax XAR films to visualize the incorporation of radioactivity into choline-containing phospholipids. Electrospray Ionization/Mass Spectrometry (ESI/MS)—MS spectra were obtained on a Quattro Micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with an ESI, as described previously (19Tanaka M. Kishi Y. Takanezawa Y. Kakehi Y. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts obtained from PC12 cells (100-μg protein equivalents) were reconstituted in 2:1 chloroform/methanol (100–300 μmol phosphorus/liter), and 2 μl of the sample was injected per run. As internal standards, 100 pmol of PC (C14:0–C14:1, diacyl) and LPC (C12:0) were added to the samples. The samples were introduced by means of a flow injector into the ESI chamber at a flow rate of 4 μl/min in a solvent system of acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) ammonium formate (pH 6.4). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative scan modes. The flow rate of the nitrogen drying gas was 12 liters/min at 80 °C. The capillary and cone voltages were set at 3.7 kV and 30 V, respectively; argon at 3–4 × 104 torr was used as the collision gas, and a collision energy of 30–40 V was used for obtaining fragment ions for precursor ions. sPLA2-X Is Expressed in Peripheral Neuronal Fibers in Various Tissues—While our immunohistochemical analyses of sPLA2 enzymes in human pathologic tissues were underway (9Masuda S.

On the other hand, no appreciable staining for sPLA2-IIA (Fig. 1B, a), -IID (b), -V (c), -IIE, and -IIF (data not shown) was observed in the neuronal fibers in the stomach as well as in other tissues (data not shown). In the lung, sPLA2-X staining was also found in alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1A, b), as reported recently (5Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K.

Staining for sPLA2-X in human cerebrum neurons was rather weak (data not shown), suggesting that its expression is generally restricted to neuronal fibers in peripheral tissues. To assess further the expression of sPLA2-X in peripheral neurons, DRG explants isolated from fetal C57/BL6 mice (E12.5–13) were subjected to RT-PCR for various mouse sPLA2s. As shown in Fig. 2A, the transcript for sPLA2-X and, to a lesser extent, for sPLA2-IIE, but not for sPLA2-IID, -IIF, or -V (sPLA2-IIA is intrinsically deficient in C57BL/6 mice (20MacPhee M.

Immunoblotting revealed the presence of sPLA2-X protein in the DRG neurons, where two bands (18 and 23 kDa) became apparent (Fig. 2B). As described below (see Fig. 9), the lower and upper immuno-reactive bands appeared to correspond to the proenzyme of sPLA2-X and its N-glycosylated form, respectively.Fig. 9Conversion of sPLA2-X to the active mature form after secretion from cells.A, PLA2 activity in the culture supernatants and lysates of PC12 cells infected for 3 days with mock or sPLA2-X adenovirus (mean ± S.E., n = 3).

https://openalex.org/W2081752639,"The extracellular matrix regulates many cellular processes, including survival, and alterations in the matrix or in matrix survival signals can trigger apoptosis. Previously, we showed that an altered fibronectin matrix triggers apoptosis in primary cells via a novel pathway regulated by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels. Here we report that this apoptotic mechanism is propagated by decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is linked to increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and to decreased levels of p53. FAK is physically and spatially linked to JNK and p53, which relocalize from the nucleus to the cell membrane to mediate this interaction. Further, p53 participates in a feedback mechanism with JNK to regulate this apoptotic process and is oppositely regulated by JNK1 and JNK2.

In inflammation, proteolysis of extracellular matrix molecules leads to the formation of fragments, such as fibronectin (FN) 1The abbreviations used are: FN, fibronectin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p (e.g. pJNK), phosphorylated; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; V+H–, recombinant fibronectin fragment containing the alternatively spliced V region and a mutated heparin-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol. 1The abbreviations used are: FN, fibronectin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p (e.g. pJNK), phosphorylated; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FAT, focal adhesion targeting; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; V+H–, recombinant fibronectin fragment containing the alternatively spliced V region and a mutated heparin-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol. fragments, that elicit cellular responses different from those elicited by the intact molecule (1Kapila Y.L.

For example, disease-associated fragments of FN trigger p53-mediated apoptosis of primary cells, but the intact molecule does not (6Huynh Q.N. Wang S. Tafolla E. Gansky S. Kapila S. Armitage G.

Similarly, alternatively spliced variants of FN elicit different cell responses, and specific domains of FN regulate cell survival (4Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30906-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Dazin P. Tafolla E. Mass M.J. J. Biol.

Previously we reported that an altered FN matrix triggers apoptosis in primary cells via a novel pathway that is regulated by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels in primary cells (5Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Dazin P. Tafolla E. Mass M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8482-8491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To further decipher this apoptotic pathway, we explored the possible connections between integrin/FAK-mediated signals and the down-regulation of p53. We hypothesized that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) might be at the crossroads of this signaling pathway, since FAK and associated focal adhesion proteins (Rac1/Pak1/MKK4/JNK) have been linked to p53 status in the apoptosis of primary cells (9Almeida E.A.

Carcinog. 2000; 29: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thereby influencing its activity directly. FAK is an integrin-associated protein tyrosine kinase that is important in integrin signaling. Its activation, triggered by increased phosphorylation of Tyr397 and other sites, has been implicated in many cellular processes, including cell survival. The N-terminal domain of FAK directs interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors. FAK also has a central catalytic domain, which contains Tyr397, a major autophosphorylation site and a site of interaction with the Src homology 2 domain. Its C-terminal noncatalytic domain, also known as FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK), contains sites for multiple protein-protein interactions and a focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region. Both FRNK and FAT act in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit cell spreading and migration and growth factor-mediated signals to mitogen-activated protein kinase (17Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). JNK, a group of mitogen-activated protein kinases that are activated by cytokines or environmental stress, participate in various signaling pathways, including apoptotic pathways. JNK proteins are encoded by three genes, JNK1 (46 kDa), JNK2 (54 kDa), and JNK3 (54 kDa), each of which undergoes alternative splicing to express various isoforms. JNK is activated by phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (18Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Activated JNK1 can modify p53 posttranslationally by phosphorylation. JNK2 and JNK3 can also phosphorylate p53, and all three associate with p53 in vivo (19Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine whether FAK signaling pathways communicate with p53 via JNK interactions in an altered matrix environment. Here we report that the apoptotic mechanism triggered by an altered FN matrix is propagated by decreases in FAK phosphorylation that are linked to increased phosphorylation of JNK and to decreased levels of p53, which is oppositely regulated by JNK1 and JNK2. Fibroblast Cell Culture—Primary human fibroblasts were obtained, cultured, and tested for apoptosis as described (14Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Pincus M.R. Ronai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), included the alternatively spliced V region (V+) and contained either an unmutated (H+) or a mutated, nonfunctional (H–) high affinity heparin-binding domain. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cells were incubated with the V+H– fragment, the V+H+ fragment, or control serum-free medium and lysed with 100 μl/well TNE buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm sodium chloride in Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm sodium molybdate, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were adjusted for protein concentration with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were probed with primary antibodies and developed with the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-human JNK1 (C-17), mouse anti-human JNK2 (d -2), mouse anti-human pJNK (G-7), rabbit anti-human FAK (C-20), goat anti-human pFAK (Tyr 925), mouse anti-human p53 (DO-1), anti-mouse p53 (pab 240), and goat anti-human actin (I-19) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK (pY397) phosphospecific antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK1 and -2 SAPK (pTpY 183/1850) phosphospecific antibody (all from BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Images of all Western blots were captured with a NEC TI-24A charge-coupled device camera and imported into Photoshop 5.0.3. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were incubated with the V+H– fragment, the V+H+ fragment, or control serum-free medium and lysed with TNE buffer (100 μl/well) containing the protease inhibitors mentioned above. Lysates were adjusted for protein concentration with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), precleared with protein G (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with pJNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody and protein G overnight, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min, and pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, probed with primary antibodies against p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pFAK (BIOSOURCE), and developed with ECL. Transient Expression of FAK, FAT, FRNK, JNK1, JNK2, dnJNK1, and p53—Primary cells at 60–80% confluency in 96-well tissue culture plates were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of DNA in 50 μl of serum-free medium or control vector with the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency in these cells, measured with a green fluorescent protein vector (pEGFP, Clontech), was ∼60%. Transfected cells were then rinsed, fresh serum-free medium and the V+H– FN protein were added to the test wells, and signaling was assessed. Antisense Experiments—To assess the effect of down-regulating the expression of FAK and JNK, we used the antisense oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The probes were synthesized by Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) as described (21Lallier T. Bronner-Fraser M. Science. 1993; 259: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Townsend P.A. Villanova I. Uhlmann E. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), except that the oligonucleotides were phosphorothioated at all positions to minimize intracellular cleavage by degradative enzymes and to enhance their stability (23Akhtar S. Kole R. Juliano R.L. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (level I). For each antisense oligonucleotide, we also synthesized its sense oligonucleotide as a specific and relevant control. All oligonucleotides were dissolved in double distilled water and stored in aliquots at –20 °C. Oligonucleotides (final concentration, 2 μm) were mixed with 8 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), incubated for 20 min, and transfected into cells at 60% confluence. Then cells were typically cultured in serum-free medium with the different oligonucleotides for 4 h at 37 °C; serum was added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. After removal of the serum, the cells were washed with medium, pretreated with lactalbumin hydrolysate (1 ml/well, Invitrogen), and incubated with FN proteins (V+H–) for 1, 3, or 7 h. Protein was collected, standardized by concentration with the BCA kit (Pierce), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for Western blotting. The blots were probed with primary antibodies to FAK (C-20 anti-rabbit), pFAK (rabbit anti-FAK (pY397) phosphospecific antibody), JNK1 (C-17 anti-rabbit), JNK2 (d -2 anti-mouse), pJNK (rabbit anti-JNK1 and -2 SAPK (pTpY183/185) phosphospecific antibody), p53 (pab 240 anti-mouse), and actin (I-19 anti-goat), and developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Fluorescence staining was used to localize FAK, JNK, and p53 in cells incubated with the recombinant FN proteins or with control medium for 6 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with a 3% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2–7.6, and permeabilized with acetone at –20 °C. Nonspecific staining was blocked with a biotin-avidin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). Cells were then incubated with a primary antibody against p53 (DO-1, anti-mouse antibody), pJNK (G-7 anti-mouse antibody), and FAK (G-20 anti-rabbit antibody) overnight, washed with PBS, incubated with secondary biotinylated antibodies, washed with PBS, and finally incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated streptavidin. All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After washing, cells were dried, mounted on glass slides, and examined with a Nikon E400 photomicroscope equipped with an FITC fluorescence filter, and imported into Photoshop 5.0.3. Nuclear Staining—Nuclear staining of DNA was used to assess the quality of the nucleus in cells incubated with the recombinant FN proteins or with control medium in 16-well chamber slides for 6 or 14 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol for 15 min, stained with a fluorescent groove-binding probe for DNA, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma), for 10 min, rinsed three times with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS, dried, and sealed with a coverslip and mounting medium. Cells were photographed at ×400 magnification with a Nikon E400 photomicroscope equipped with a DAPI filter. An Altered Fibronectin Matrix Activates a Signaling Pathway That Involves FAK, JNK, and p53—To examine the possibility that JNK might be at the intersection of FAK- and p53-mediated signals in apoptosis triggered by an altered FN matrix, we assessed protein expression levels in primary human fibroblasts treated with FN fragments containing the alternatively spliced V region (V+) and either a mutated (H–) or a wild-type (H+) heparin-binding domain (Fig. 1A). In cells treated with the V+H– fragment, previously shown to induce apoptosis (18Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 19Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of JNK increased in tandem with decreases in p53 and FAK phosphorylation. FAK was phosphorylated at Tyr397 but not at Tyr925. Total FAK and JNK protein levels were not altered. To determine whether JNK is physically linked to these signaling molecules, we performed immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence localization experiments in primary human fibroblasts. An antibody against phosphorylated JNK (pJNK) immunoprecipitated both p53 and pFAK under control conditions. However, upon treatment with V+H– FN fragment, these associations decreased with time (Fig. 1B); moreover, FAK localized to the cell membrane, and JNK and p53 relocalized from the nucleus to the cell membrane (Fig. 1C), indicating that FAK, JNK, and p53 are spatially coincident. The nuclei of cells treated with V+H– appeared pyknotic and condensed, indicating apoptosis, whereas the nuclei of control cells were large and oval and not apoptotic (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that in this apoptotic mechanism triggered by an altered matrix, JNK and p53 form a signaling complex that interacts with integrin/membrane/FAK signaling molecules. FAK Is an Upstream Regulator of JNK Phosphorylation and p53 Protein Levels—To examine how changes in FAK expression might affect JNK and p53 signals, we transiently transfected cells with FAK cDNA, dominant-negative deletion mutants of FAK, FAT, and FRNK, or a FAK antisense oligonucleotide. Cells transfected with FAK and treated with the proapoptotic FN fragment expressed lower levels of pJNK and higher levels of p53 than controls, whereas cells transfected with the FAT, FRNK, or FAK antisense constructs expressed higher levels of pJNK and lower levels of p53 than controls (Fig. 2). As expected, the level of phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 was sustained in FAK-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with FRNK or FAT. Studies in cells transfected with empty vector or scrambled oligonucleotides were performed to control for nonspecific alterations in protein or phosphorylation levels. These studies showed that JNK and p53 act downstream of FAK and that phosphorylation of Tyr397 in the FAK catalytic domain is likely important in this pathway. JNK1 and JNK2 Are Opposite Regulators of p53—To further examine the association of JNK with FAK and p53 signals in apoptosis triggered by an altered matrix, we performed a series of experiments in cells transfected with JNK1 or JNK2 cDNA, a dominant-negative, catalytically inactive construct of JNK1, or antisense oligonucleotides for JNK1 or JNK2. In JNK1-overexpressing cells treated with the proapoptotic FN fragment, p53 decreased more than in control cells (Fig. 3A), and JNK phosphorylation increased. The levels of FAK, FAK phosphorylated at Tyr397, and actin were unchanged. In cells transfected with a dominant-negative JNK1 construct, p53 levels increased, and JNK phosphorylation levels were unchanged (Fig. 3B). The latter finding was not surprising, because the Thr183 and Tyr185 phosphorylation sites on JNK1 had been mutated, preventing its activation by upstream signals and blocking its ability to down-regulate p53. No changes were noted in total FAK, JNK2, and actin levels or FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397. When JNK1 expression was abrogated with two different antisense oligonucleotides, p53 levels increased to a greater extent than in control cells transfected with a scrambled oligonucleotide or empty vector (Fig. 4). Levels of total FAK, actin, and FAK phosphorylated at Try397 were unchanged. In cells overexpressing JNK2, treatment with the proapoptotic FN fragment increased the levels of JNK2 and pJNK but did not decrease p53 (Fig. 5). Western blotting for pJNK identified a band at ∼54 kDa, which likely represents JNK2 because transfection with a JNK2 cDNA produced a strong, unique band of this size. Total FAK protein and phosphorylation levels were unchanged, as were JNK1 and actin protein levels. Surprisingly, abrogating JNK2 expression with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a complete or nearly complete early reduction in p53 protein levels (Fig. 6). There was nonspecific suppression of pJNK bands corresponding to JNK1, likely related to processing of the Western blot. Total FAK and actin protein levels were unchanged, as were FAK phosphorylation levels. p53 levels were also completely suppressed in JNK2-deficient cells (JNK2–/–) (Fig. 7, A and B). Cells deficient in both jnk1 and jnk2 did not express p53 (Fig. 7, C and D).Fig. 7P53 expression is suppressed in JNK2-deficient cells.

Overexpression of p53 led to a greater decrease in pJNK levels than vector-transfected controls, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism involving JNK and p53. Consistent with this finding, p53-deficient cells treated with the proapoptotic FN fragment expressed higher levels of pJNK than similarly treated wild-type controls. Total FAK, pFAK, total JNK1 and -2, and actin levels were unchanged. Previously we described a novel alternative pathway of apoptosis that is driven by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels in primary cells in response to an altered matrix. In this study, we demonstrate that this signaling mechanism is propagated by decreases in FAK phosphorylation, likely mediated by Tyr397, which are linked to increases in JNK phosphorylation and decreases in p53 protein levels. Furthermore, JNK1 and JNK2 had opposite effects in regulating p53, which appeared to participate in a feedback mechanism with JNK to facilitate this apoptotic process (Fig. 9). Several studies have shown that JNK interacts with (13Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu Z. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Pincus M.R. Ronai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chen J.M. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In fact, p53 and JNK can form a complex, and JNK is a regulator of p53 stability (13Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu Z. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Pincus M.R. Ronai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In one study, sustained activation of JNK1 down-regulated p53 expression during apoptosis (16Wang J. Friedman E. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 29: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), similar to our findings. However, we found that JNK1 and JNK2 are opposite regulators of p53. Surprisingly, treatment with antisense JNK2 suppressed p53 levels in controls and under altered FN matrix conditions. JNK1 antisense treatment, however, increased p53 levels. P53 expression was also suppressed in jnk2-deficient cells. These data indicate that JNK2 expression is tightly linked to that of p53 and that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate p53 by different mechanisms. Furthermore, increases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) decreased p53 protein levels, and decreases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) increased p53 levels. Conversely, increases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) may increase p53 levels, and decreases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) profoundly decreased p53 levels. Thus JNK1 is a negative regulator and JNK2 is a positive regulator of p53 expression. The antibody we used to detect pJNK also detects JNK1, -2, and -3, and Western blots for pJNK showed two bands at ∼54 and 46 kDa. For several reasons, however, we are confident that treatment with an altered FN matrix increased JNK1 phosphorylation only and not that of JNK2 or JNK3. First, transfection with a JNK1 construct (Fig. 3A) and a dominant-negative JNK1 construct (Fig. 3B) both showed an increase in the two bands visible in the pJNK Western blots under control conditions, indicating that both bands are JNK1 isoforms. Second, treatment with a JNK1 antisense oligonucleotide decreased both bands, indicating that they are both JNK1 isoforms (Fig. 4A). Third, transfection with a JNK2 construct induced a new higher molecular mass band at ∼54 kDa for pJNK that was not seen before with any other treatments and likely represents the phosphorylated form of JNK2 (Fig. 5). Fourth, Western analysis of jnk2-deficient cells showed two bands that likely represent two isoforms of JNK1. These bands were not seen in Western blots of cells deficient in JNK1 and JNK2. Interestingly, overexpression of p53 limited the phosphorylation of JNK normally induced by an altered FN matrix, suggesting that p53 and pJNK participate in a negative feedback mechanism. Similarly, in previous studies, introduction of p53 into p53-null cells reduced JNK activity to a low basal level (24Shklyaev S.S. Namba H. Sautin Y. Mitsutake N. Nagayama Y. Ishikawa N. Ito K. Zeki K. Yamashita A. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 2569-2575PubMed Google Scholar), possibly indicating feedback between p53 and JNK. JNKs are a family of stress-related kinases, and an altered FN matrix represents a stressful condition in which JNKs seems to play a role. At sites of inflammation, the extracellular matrix is degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the inflammatory milieu. Degraded matrix conveys messages that are different from those normally conveyed by an intact or stable matrix, and the degradation increases with the severity of the disease. In periodontal disease and arthritis, FN fragments are most abundant in the most diseased sites (6Huynh Q.N. Wang S. Tafolla E. Gansky S. Kapila S. Armitage G. Kapila Y.L. J.

Previously, we found that a proteolytic 40-kDa fragment of FN associated with the most advanced disease also induced apoptosis of periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro by down-regulating p53 and c-Myc (6Huynh Q.N.

Res. 2003; 82B (abstr.): 2213Google Scholar). This 40-kDa fragment, which is comparable with the recombinant FN fragment we tested here, induced apoptosis of fibroblasts via a novel alternative pathway that involves decreases in FAK phosphorylation and down-regulation of p53 and c-Myc. This pathway appears to be triggered by cooperative interactions between integrins and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (4Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol.

From the present findings we can further add that this inflammation-associated apoptotic pathway also involves interactions between pFAK and JNK1 and -2 and their phosphorylated isoforms, which oppositely regulate p53 expression levels.

https://openalex.org/W2068261713,"Circumsporozoite, a predominant surface protein, is involved in invasion of liver cells by Plasmodium sporozoites, which leads to malaria. We have previously reported that the amino terminus region (amino acids 27–117) of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein plays a critical role in the invasion of liver cells by the parasite. Here we show that invasion-blocking antibodies are induced by a polypeptide encoding these 91 amino acids, only when it is presented in the absence of the rest of the protein. This suggests that when present in the whole protein, the amino terminus remains immunologically cryptic. A single reactive epitope was identified and mapped to a stretch of 21 amino acids from position 93 to 113. The epitope is configurational in nature, since its recognition was affected by deleting as little as 3 amino acids from either end of the 21-residue peptide. Lysine 104, the only known polymorphic position in the epitope, affected its recognition by the antibodies, and its conversion to leucine in the protein led to a substantial loss of binding activity of the protein to the hepatocytes. This indicated that in the protein, the epitope serves as a binding ligand and facilitates the interaction between sporozoite and hepatic cells. When considered along with the observation that in its native state this motif is immunologically unresponsive, we suggest that hiding functional moieties of the protein from the immune system is an evasion strategy to preserve liver cell binding function and may be of importance in designing anti-sporozoite vaccines.

Malaria is one of the parasitic diseases for which development of a vaccine has been vigorously pursued. The infection commences with the bite of an infectious mosquito that introduces sporozoites into the microvasculature. The surface of malaria sporozoite is covered by a protein termed circumsporozoite (CS) 1The abbreviations used are: CS, circumsporozoite; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (1Ozaki L.S.

CS protein has been widely investigated as a vaccine candidate, and several CS-based vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials (10Wang R. Doolan D.L. Le T.P. Hedstrom R.C. Coonan K.M.

The protein is constituted of three modules (viz. the amino terminus, central repeat region, and carboxyl terminus region) of roughly equal sizes (Fig. 1). Immunologically, the central repeat region is the immunodominant segment of the protein, with 90% of the anti-protein antibodies directed against this region (14Zavala F. Tam J.P. Hollingdale M.R. Cochrane A.H. Quakyi I. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Science. 1985; 228: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this immune response does not lead to protection and is now believed to be a “smoke screen effect” developed by the parasite to sidetrack the attention of the host immune mechanism, which prevents the recognition of other parasitic components, whose recognition could be deleterious for the parasite (15Anders R.F. Shi P.T. Scanlon D.B. Leach S.J. Coppel R.L. Brown G.V. Stahl H.D. Kemp D.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1986; 119: 164-183PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus region of the protein encodes a cytotoxic T cell epitope (16Kumar S. Miller L.H. Quakyi I.A. Keister D.B. Houghten R.A. Maloy W.L. Moss B. Berzofsky J.A. Good M.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and most of the CS-based vaccine studies currently being performed include either the complete or selected regions of carboxyl terminus domain (10Wang R.

In contrast, the amino terminus region of the protein is widely believed to be immunologically unresponsive (17Calle J.M. Nardin E.H. Clavijo P. Boudin C. Stuber D. Takacs B. Nussenzweig R.S. Cochrane A.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2695-2701PubMed Google Scholar) and is not being utilized for vaccine purposes. We have recently demonstrated that the amino terminus of the protein plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis process by helping the sporozoite in the attachment and invasion of liver cells (6Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and suggested that structural configuration of the amino terminus region is critical for this activity. We have now performed an immunological and structural investigation of the amino terminus and demonstrate that a 21-amino acid segment is involved in binding; antibodies against this segment are protective in nature and can successfully prevent the invasion of liver cells by the sporozoites. Furthermore, we show that substitution of a single lysine residue in this domain with leucine affects the binding of the protein to liver cells. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Construction of plasmid pCS27 encoding DNA for amino acids 27–117 of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (N-terPfCSP), its expression, and its purification has been described elsewhere (6Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The construct encodes two extra amino acids (methionine and arginine) preceding the coding sequence, for translation initiation and cloning purposes, as described previously (5Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For expression, the construct was transformed in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli, and the expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. The recombinant protein was secreted into the periplasm. The periplasmic fluid containing the recombinant protein was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Biosciences), and the bound CS protein was eluted using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled, and the protein was purified to apparent homogeneity using gel filtration chromatography. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides representing the amino terminus region of CS protein were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on chlorotrityl resins. Subsequent to synthesis, the peptides were purified by reversed phase chromatography on a Luna C18 (50 × 2 mm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) by a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, to a purity of >90%. Authentication was performed by electrospray mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1100 mass spectrometer. Generation of Antibodies—BALB/c mice were subcutaneously immunized with 10 μg of recombinant N-terPfCSP in complete Freund's adjuvant. Three weeks after the first immunization, mice received two subsequent injections at 3-week intervals with 10 μg of protein delivered in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The mice were bled 2 weeks after each immunization, and serum samples were collected. ELISA—For protein ELISA, 250 ng of N-terPfCSP in 10 mm carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) were coated onto the wells of an Immunolon 4 microtiter plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. For peptide ELISA, 2 nmol of each peptide was used for coating the wells. Uncoated sites were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Different dilutions of anti-N-terPfCSP serum were added to the wells, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. For peptide competition experiments, antiserum was incubated in the presence of 4 nmol of each peptide. Unbound reagents were removed by washing the wells with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20, followed by the addition of anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate and incubation for 60 min at 37 °C. The wells were thoroughly washed to remove unbound conjugate and followed by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described (18Chattopadhyay R. Rathore D. Fujioka H. Kumar S. De La Vega P. Haynes D. Moch K. Fryauff D. Wang R. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25977-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-fold diluted test sera or monoclonal antibody (50 μg/ml) was reacted with air-dried P. falciparum sporozoites on a glass slide. Bound antibodies were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Slides were mounted using VectaShield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and evaluated using a fluorescent microscope. Sporozoite Invasion Assay—HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in complete minimal essential medium and were subsequently plated at a density of 50,000 cells/0.3 ml in ECL-coated Labtek glass slides and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The next day, the medium was removed, and different dilutions of anti-N-terPfCSP serum, N-terPfCSP, peptide P6, or anti-CS repeat monoclonal antibody was added per well (in triplicates). This was immediately followed by the addition of 20,000 sporozoites in 50 μl of medium to each well. P. falciparum (strain NF54) sporozoites were obtained from the salivary glands of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes as described by Ozaki (1Ozaki L.S. Svec P. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Godson G.N. Cell. 1983; 34: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The sporozoites were allowed to invade liver cells for 3 h followed by the washing of cells with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with cold methanol. Sporozoites were visualized by immunostaining by using NFS1 as primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate. Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate. The slides were mounted with Paramount, and intracellular sporozoites were identified and counted. Percentage inhibition of invasion was calculated with the formula, ((control – test)/control) × 100. Construction, Expression, and Purification of K104L—Plasmid pCS1 encoding the native CS protein sequence under the control of a T7 promoter (19Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used as template to introduce a single amino acid (Lys104 → Leu) change using QuikChange, a PCR-based site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), as previously described (20Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8530-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This gave rise to plasmid pK104L. The authenticity of the mutant construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of the recombinant protein was performed as described above. Binding Activity of CS Protein Mutant—HepG2, a hepatoma human cell line, was used, and the assay was performed as described (6Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50,000 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate, 36 h before the experiment. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by blocking with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Different concentrations of recombinantly expressed CS proteins were added to the cells for 1 h followed by a 30-min incubation with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the central repeat region of the protein. Unbound material was removed, and anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-coupled conjugate was added. 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate was used as substrate, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorometer with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 460 nm. Antibody Responses to N-terPfCSP in BALB/c Mice—Six mice were immunized with three subcutaneous injections of recombinantly expressed amino terminus of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (N-terPfCSP). Fig. 1 depicts the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide that was used for immunization. The serum samples were collected 2 weeks after each immunization and screened for anti-N-terPfCSP immune responses. Antibodies against the N-terPfCSP could be detected after the first immunization (data not shown). On subsequent boosting, anti-N-terPfCSP antibody titers increased significantly. Fig. 2 depicts the recognition of N-terPfCSP in serum from individual animals by ELISA. Serum from each animal recognized the antigen in a dose-dependent manner. Potent anti-N-terPfCSP antibody titers were generated as the antigen was recognized even at a 1:100,000 dilution of the serum. The recognition was specific, since (i) anti-N-terPfCSP serum did not recognize a polypeptide representing the carboxyl terminus of PfCSP and (ii) normal mouse serum did not recognize N-terPfCSP (data not shown). Identification of the Recognized Epitope—To identify the epitope(s) recognized by the antiserum, seven overlapping peptides spanning the entire N-terPfCSP were synthesized and purified by reversed phase chromatography (Fig. 1). These synthetic peptides were individually screened for their recognition by anti-N-terPfCSP serum by ELISA. The analyses revealed that the antibodies are predominantly directed against a 21-amino acid peptide P6, representing amino acids 93–113 of N-terPfCSP. Peptide P7 (amino acids 99–117), which significantly overlapped (75%) with peptide P6, was also recognized, although its recognition was reduced by 50% (Fig. 3), suggesting that exclusively amino acids 93–113 are recognized by the anti-N-terPfCSP serum. This recognition (of the P6 peptide) by the antisera was specific, since incubation with antibodies in the presence of soluble N-terPfCSP protein led to a >80% loss of reactivity in an ELISA assay (Fig. 4). That the antiserum preferentially recognizes amino acids 93–113 was further verified by performing a converse experiment where N-terPfCSP was coated onto the plate and the peptides were used as competitor to the binding of anti-N-terPfCSP antibodies to the protein. Only peptides P6 and P7 could compete the binding of antibodies to the protein (Table I).Fig. 4Recognition of peptide P6 by anti-N-terPfCSP serum is specific in nature. Recognition of peptide P6 by different dilutions of pooled antisera was evaluated in the absence (black bars) or presence of 2.5 μg of N-terPfCSP protein (hatched bars) in an ELISA. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an ELISA reader.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IPeptide P6 and P7 could compete the binding of antibodies to N-terPfCSP in an ELISAProtein/PeptideA405Decrease%N-terPfCSP1.35 ± 0.07P11.50 ± 0.01P21.40 ± 0.01P31.30 ± 0.023.8P41.32 ± .0252.3P51.28 ± 0.015.2P60.57 ± 0.0157.7P70.76 ± 0.0243.4 Open table in a new tab Effects of Polymorphism on the Recognition of Peptide P6 by Anti-N-terPfCSP Antibodies—A comparison of the P6 epitope sequence from 107 P. falciparum CS protein sequence, representing isolates from Asia, Africa, and South America available in GenBank™, revealed a single polymorphic site in the epitope at position 104, represented by a lysine residue. In isolates from Thailand (accession number AAA29555), lysine has been substituted by a threonine (K104T) (21del Portillo H.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Enea V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a second isolate from Brazil, lysine has been converted to an asparagine (K104N) (accession number AAN87594) (22Escalante A.A. Grebert H.M. Isea R. Goldman I.F. Basco L. Magris M. Biswas S. Kariuki S. Lal A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Historically, polymorphisms, especially in an epitope, are associated with immune evasion (23De La Cruz V.F. Maloy W.L. Miller L.H. Good M.F. McCutchan T.F. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3568-3575PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether these polymorphisms can attribute to a change in recognition of the peptide P6, two variant P6 peptides, P6N and P6T, where Lys104 was substituted by an asparagine and threonine, respectively, were synthesized and probed for their recognition by anti-N-terPfCSP serum. Both of the variants showed a 40% decrease in recognition in comparison with the native sequence (Table II), suggesting that these changes in the field isolates are most likely associated with immune evasion.Table IITruncated and mutated P6 peptides are poorly recognized by the antibodiesPeptidePeptide sizeSequenceDecreaseamino acids%P621DKRDGNNEDNEKLRKPKHKKLP6N21DKRDGNNEDNENLRKPKHKKL39.5P6T21DKRDGNNEDNETLRKPKHKKL41.7P6N318DGNNEDNEKLRKPKHKKL55.8P6N615NEDNEKLRKPKHKKL65.4P6N912NEKLRKPKHKKL97.4P6C318DKRDGNNEDNEKLRKPKH59.0P6C615DKRDGNNEDNEKLRK89.7P6C912DKRDGNNEDNEK96.1 Open table in a new tab Fine Mapping of the Recognized Epitope—To identify the exact epitope, six variants of peptide P6, 9–18 amino acids in length, were synthesized and used as an antigen in ELISA. In peptides P6N3, P6N6, and P6N9, 3 amino acids each were serially deleted from the amino terminus. Conversely, peptides P6C3, P6C6, and P6C9 were missing 3, 6, and 9 amino acids, respectively, from the carboxyl terminus. Deletions of as few as 3 amino acids from either end led to a 50% decrease in the recognition of the epitope by the antibodies (Table II). Loss of 6 amino acids from the amino terminus (residues 93–98, peptide P6N6) led to a 65% loss, whereas any further deletions led to a nearly complete loss of epitope recognition. This suggested that the epitope encoded in residues 93–113 is configurational in nature and that its tertiary structure is important for its recognition by the antibodies. Antibodies Recognize CS Protein Expressed on Sporozoite Surface—Anti-N-terPfCSP serum was evaluated for the recognition of CS protein expressed on P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoite surface and was compared with the recognition of the central repeat region by anti-repeat monoclonal antibody NFS1. The antibodies recognized the expression of CS protein expressed on the sporozoite surface (Fig. 5A), but its recognition was weaker in comparison with the recognition of the repeat region by NFS1 (Fig. 5B). Invasion-inhibitory Activity of Anti-N-terPfCSP Antibodies— Since antibodies recognized the expression of CS protein on the sporozoite surface, we investigated the ability of these antibodies in inhibiting the invasion of liver cells by live P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoites. Anti-N-terPfCSP antibodies were successful in preventing the invasion of liver cells in a dose-dependent manner. At 1:100 and 1:400 dilutions of serum, sporozoite invasion in HepG2 cells was inhibited by 90 and 80%, respectively. This inhibitory activity was comparable with the inhibitory activity of anti-central repeat region monoclonal antibody, which at two concentrations (100 and 25 μg/ml) inhibited the invasion by 92 and 77%, respectively (Table III). Similarly, protein N-terPfCSP and peptide P6 could also prevent the invasion of liver cells by the parasites, albeit at lower levels (Table III). This suggested that antibody responses against a short amino acid sequence can prevent the invasion of liver cells, and this epitope could be involved in receptor-ligand interactions between the host cells and the parasite.Table IIIEffect of CS protein, peptides, and anti-CS antibodies on liver cell invasion by P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoitesTreatmentConcentrationInhibition%Anti-CS-monoclonal antibody100 μg/ml91.925 μg/ml76.5Anti-N-terPfCSP serum1:10089.81:40078.9N-terPfCSP20 μg/ml61.210 μg/ml37.1Peptide P6500 μg/ml62.6250 μg/ml51.0 Open table in a new tab Role of Lysine 104 in Malaria Pathogenesis—On hepatocytes, CS protein interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on their surface (7Frevert U.

This interaction is electrostatic in nature and has been proposed to occur between positively charged (lysine and arginine) and polar residues of CSP and the negatively charged sulfate and carboxylate ions of heparan sulfate. If involved, lysine 104 and its known substituents (asparagine and threonine), all polar amino acids, will retain their capacity to interact with the host receptor, since all 3 residues have known heparin-interaction capabilities in other biological systems (25Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). This selective substitution suggested that the parasite has a limited degree of freedom for replacing lysine 104 and that the residue could be playing an important role in the biology of the parasite. To investigate this possibility, we designed a mutant CSP construct, where Lys104 was converted to leucine, a nonpolar residue, by site-directed mutagenesis, giving rise to plasmid pK104L. The construct was expressed in E. coli, and the protein was purified to homogeneity by a two-step column chromatography. Whereas the protein indeed bound onto the heparin-Sepharose column, it eluted from the column at a much lower salt concentration in comparison with the nonmutated protein (data not shown), suggesting that a single amino acid change has affected the affinity of the protein toward heparin. Binding analysis of K104L was performed on HepG2 cells and was compared with the binding activity of the nonmutated protein. The analysis revealed that the substitution of lysine 104 to leucine leads to a 75% decrease in binding activity of the protein to host cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that the residue plays a critical role in attachment of parasites to the liver cells. In biological systems, concealing information until such a time when it is advantageous to reveal, is an intrinsic mechanism and has evolved with organisms as part of their complex architecture. In pathogens, this veil of secrecy could play a critical role in the onset of infection and associated pathogenicity. Therefore, in the case of intracellular pathogens like Plasmodium, safeguarding proteins or their domains involved in host infectivity from any kind of host-led attack could be crucial for initiating a successful infection. We recently demonstrated that the amino terminus of circumsporozoite protein, a predominant parasite surface antigen, plays a critical role in the invasion of liver cells by the parasite, which sets the stage for malaria infection (6Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This region is generally believed to be immunologically inert, since immunization with the complete protein generates antibodies that primarily recognize the immunodominant central repeat region of the protein (14Zavala F.

CS protein is one of the most promising vaccine candidates, and its carboxyl terminus fragment (Fig. 1) is currently being tried as a vaccine by several investigators (11Nardin E.H. Oliveira G.A. Calvo-Calle J.M. Castro Z.R. Nussenzweig R.S. Schmeckpeper B. Hall B.F. Diggs C. Bodison S. Edelman R. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Alonso P.L.

The critical involvement of this segment in host-parasite interaction (6Rathore D. Sacci J.B. de la Vega P. McCutchan T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7092-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but its nearly total oblivion by the host immune system (17Calle J.M. Nardin E.H. Clavijo P. Boudin C.

Parasitol. 2001; 118: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) led us to investigate this segment in isolation from the whole protein. Mice were immunized with a recombinantly expressed 93-amino acid-long polypeptide representing the N terminus of P. falciparum CS protein, and the antibody responses were analyzed for both specificity and their potential to inhibit the invasion of liver cells by P. falciparum sporozoites. All of the immunized mice developed high antibody titers against the immunized polypeptide (Fig. 2). This suggested that lack of recognition of this portion of the molecule in the whole protein is not an inherent failure of the immune system to recognize or present the peptide but could be due to the crypticity of the region in the presence of the immunodominant central repeat region. Parallels for such behavior exist in biological systems, where cryptic epitopes are unmasked after the loss of immunodominant epitope (27Lally K.M. Mocellin S. Ohnmacht G.A. Nielsen M.B. Bettinotti M. Panelli M.C. Monsurro V. Marincola F.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recognition of the amino terminus was limited to a single site within the 93-amino acid peptide. It was mapped to a 21-amino acid region (peptide P6) of the protein from amino acid 93 to 113 (Fig. 3) and could be inhibited in the presence of free N-terPfCSP (Fig. 4). Alternately, peptides representing region 93–113 (P6) or part thereof (P7) could also inhibit the recognition of N-terPfCSP by the antisera (Table I), confirming the exclusivity of its recognition by the antibodies. Nonetheless, this region is sensitive to deletion of residues in the CS protein. In some field isolates from areas of acute malaria transmission and laboratory clones, a 19-amino acid (residues 81–99) segment is deleted (28Lockyer M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which will result in a loss of amino acids 93–99 from peptide P6. Mimicking this deletion led to a significant but not a total loss of recognition of this epitope (Table II). This suggested that the integrity and the associated structural conformation of this epitope were important for its optimal recognition. Immunofluorescence analysis of P. falciparum sporozoite (NF 54 strain) expressing the deleted variant of CS protein confirmed that the recognition of the truncated epitope is somewhat weaker in comparison with the recognition of the central repeat region of the protein (Fig. 5). Based on these results, we anticipated that sporozoites expressing the truncated version of CS protein might be able to evade these antibodies and successfully invade liver cells, thus providing an escape for the parasite. Surprisingly, antibodies blocked the invasion activity of P. falciparum NF54 strain sporozoites, which express CS protein lacking residues 81–99 on its surface, by 90% (Table III). These results showed that the antibodies directed against the 21-amino acid sequence (residues 93–113) of the protein not only recognize the CS protein variant expressed on the sporozoite surface; they are also capable of interrupting the invasion process. This suggests that if “efficiently” recognized by the host immune system, antibodies against this region could be able to control the malaria infection. Similarly, both N-terPfCSP and peptide P6 could also prevent P. falciparum sporozoites from invading liver cells (Table III). Whereas antibodies against the central repeat region of the protein block invasion, this region does not play a role in host cell binding and invasion. As the central repeat region is present in close proximity to residues 93–113 (Fig. 1) and contains multiple copies of the recognized epitope, we suggest that binding of antibodies to the repeat region causes a stearic hindrance, which interferes in the binding/invasion activity of the sporozoite, resulting in inhibition of invasion. Not only is this 21-amino acid sequence sensitive to truncation; sequence analysis revealed that in field isolates from Thailand and Brazil it shows polymorphism, albeit only at position 104. In these isolates, the lysine residue at position 104 was either converted to an asparagine or a threonine residue. Whereas these variations cause a 40% decrease in recognition of the epitope by the antibodies (Table II), it was noticed that all 3 residues are polar in nature and are known for their interactions with heparin, the carbohydrate moiety of the host cell (hepatocyte) receptor (25Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). This suggested that this position, while under pressure to mutate, has limited options for residue substitution, which could be due to its involvement in host-pathogen interactions. We investigated this possibility by mutating lysine 104 to leucine in the full-length protein and comparing its propensity to interact with host cells in vitro. Lys104 turned out to be an important residue for host cell binding, since its conversion to leucine, a nonpolar amino acid led to a >75% loss in the binding activity of the protein to liver cells (Fig. 6). Whereas lysine 104 is important in host-parasite interaction, it is most likely a part of a much bigger binding domain whose residues are distributed throughout the amino terminus but are structurally aligned in the final conformation of the protein. In conclusion, we have identified a 21-amino acid region in the amino terminus of CS protein, which participates in the host-parasite interaction and involves lysine 104 in this process. Part of this sequence has also been shown to be involved in the invasion of salivary glands (4Sidjanski S.P. Vanderberg J.P. Sinnis P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting a broader role for this region. Antibodies directed against this region are protective in nature, since they effectively block the sporozoite-led invasion of liver cells. Although this epitope seems cryptic when presented as part of the whole protein, reported deletions and polymorphism in the epitope suggest that it could be under immune selection pressure. In pathogens, such events are associated with immune evasion (23De La Cruz V.F. Maloy W.L. Miller L.H. Good M.F. McCutchan T.F. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3568-3575PubMed Google Scholar). The recent report of a successful field trial of an antimalarial vaccine reemphasizes the importance of P. falciparum CS protein as a target antigen for protective immunity. Here we show evidence that leads us to believe that the response to CS protein can be potentiated by opening otherwise cryptic regions of the molecule to the host immune system."

Human TE85 osteosarcoma cells were subjected to a steady shear stress of 20 dynes/cm2 for 30 min followed by 24-h incubation with IGF-I (0–50 ng/ml). IGF-I increased proliferation dose-dependently (1.5–2.5-fold). Shear stress alone increased proliferation by 70%. The combination of shear stress and IGF-I stimulated proliferation (3.5- to 5.5-fold) much greater than the additive effects of each treatment alone, indicating a synergistic interaction. IGF-I dose-dependently increased the phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 by 1.2–5.3-fold and that of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) by 2–4-fold. Shear stress alone increased Erk1/2 and IGF-IR phosphorylation by 2-fold each. The combination treatment also resulted in synergistic enhancements in both Erk1/2 and IGF-IR phosphorylation (up to 12- and 8-fold, respectively). Shear stress altered IGF-IR binding only slightly, suggesting that the synergy occurred primarily at the post-ligand binding level. Recent studies have implicated a role for integrin in the regulation of IGF-IR phosphorylation and IGF-I signaling. To test whether the synergy involves integrin-dependent mechanisms, the effect of echistatin (a disintegrin) on proliferation in response to shear stress ± IGF-I was measured. Echistatin reduced basal proliferation by ∼60% and the shear stress-induced mitogenic response by ∼20%. It completely abolished the mitogenic effect of IGF-I and that of the combination treatment. Shear stress also significantly reduced the amounts of co-immunoprecipitated SHP-2 and -1 with IGF-IR, suggesting that the synergy between shear stress and IGF-I in osteoblast proliferation involves integrin-dependent recruitment of SHP-2 and -1 away from IGF-IR.

Mechanical loading is essential for the maintenance of skeletal architectural integrity. Loading increased bone formation and inhibited bone resorption, leading to an increase in bone mass, whereas unloading decreased bone mass through an increase in resorption and a decrease in formation (1Hillam R.A. Skerry T.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the phenomenon of increased bone formation through an increase in osteoblast proliferation and activity in response to skeletal loading has been well described, the underlying mechanism(s) remains largely undefined. Loading produces strains in the bone that generate interstitial fluid flow through the lacunar-canalicular spaces (2Hillsley M.V. Frangos J.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1994; 43: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It is believed that this fluid flow exerts a shear stress at surfaces of bone cells lining the lacunar-canalicular spaces and that the shear stress generates biochemical signals in bone cells to stimulate osteoblast proliferation and activity. Shear stress stimulates bone cell proliferation and activity through multiple interacting signaling pathways (3Kapur S. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2003; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Bone growth factors function as autocrine and paracrine mediators of bone formation (4Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Clin. Orthop. Relat.

The mechanism whereby mechanical loading stimulates osteoblast proliferation and activity could involve bone growth factors and corresponding signaling pathways.

The signaling pathway of IGF-I involves Erk1/2 activation, which is essential for mechanical stimulation of bone cell proliferation (10Kapur S. Chen S.-T. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2004; 35: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the bone cell mitogenic response to mechanical strain is mediated by the IGF-IR (11Cheng M.Z. Rawlinson S.C. Pitsillides A.A. Zaman G. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies suggested that loading might have a permissive role in the IGF-I mitogenic action in bone, as skeletal unloading induces resistance to IGF-I with respect to bone formation. Accordingly, unloading blocked the ability of IGF-I to stimulate bone formation in the rat (12Sakata T. Halloran B.P. Elalieh H.Z. Munson S.J. Rudner L. Venton L. Ginzinger D. Rosen C.J. Bikle D.D. Bone. 2003; 32: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). IGF-I administration stimulates bone formation in the loaded bone, but not in unloaded bone in vivo (12Sakata T. Halloran B.P. Elalieh H.Z. Munson S.J. Rudner L. Venton L. Ginzinger D. Rosen C.J. Bikle D.D. Bone. 2003; 32: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in vitro (12Sakata T. Halloran B.P. Elalieh H.Z.

Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There is evidence that unloading-related resistance to IGF-I is mediated by inhibiting the activation of IGF-I pathway through down-regulation of integrin expression (13Sakata T. Wang Y. Halloran B.P. Elalieh H.Z. Bikle D.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because unloading blocked the osteogenic action of IGF-I, we postulated that increased loading enhances the osteogenic action of IGF-I. Accordingly, it has been suggested that loading enhances the anabolic effects of IGF-I on articular cartilage formation (14Mauck R.L. Nicoll S.B. Seyhan S.L. Ateshian G.A. Hung C.T. Tissue Eng. 2003; 9: 597-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and also in nasopremaxillary growth (15Tokimasa C. Kawata T. Fujita T. Kaku M. Kawasoko S. Kohno S. Tanne K. Arch.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) revealed that the ability of IGF-I to initiate its intracellular signals is regulated not only by its binding to its own transmembrane receptor (IGF-IR) but also by other transmembrane proteins, such as SHPS-1 and αvβ3 integrin, to recruit essential signaling proteins, such as SHP-2 and Shc. The integrin recruitment of SHP-2 is essential for regulation of the overall IGF-IR phosphorylation level (18Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the propagation of downstream signaling events (19Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3519-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, ligand occupancy of αvβ3 integrin results in phosphorylation of the β3 integrin subunit, which leads to Downstream of tyrosine kinase I (DOKI)-mediated recruitment of SHP-2 (20Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Blocking ligand occupancy of αvβ3 integrin inhibited IGF-I-dependent downstream signaling events, membrane recruitment of SHP-2, and cell migration and proliferation (21Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative mutant of the β3 integrin subunit in smooth muscle cells completely abolished the mitogenic activity of IGF-I (16Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, integrin activation may have a permissive action in the IGF-IR signaling pathway. Integrins, which consist of a large family of heterodimers of α- and β-subunits, function as cell surface adhesion receptors for extracellular matrices (23Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) and link extracellular matrix components with various intracellular signaling mechanisms (24Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 33-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is believed that mechanical strains and shear stresses are distributed to cells through extracellular matrix scaffolds that hold the cells together and that mechanical signals that propagate from the extracellular matrix converge on integrins (25Alenghat F.J. Ingber D.E. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2002/119/pe6)PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between specific bone matrix ligands and corresponding integrin receptors has been suggested to be involved in the signal transduction process linking the extracellular mechanical signals to changes in gene expression, cytoskeletal reorganization, and DNA synthesis in osteoblasts and/or osteocytes (26Carvalho R.S. Scott J.E. Yen E.H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies for several integrins blocked mechanical strain-induced cellular responses (27Salter D.M. Robb J.E. Wright M.O. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The integrin-β-catenin signal pathway has also been suggested to be involved in the cellular responses of human articular chondrocytes to mechanical stimulation (28Lee H.S. Millward-Sadler S.J. Wright M.O. Nuki G. Salter D.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, integrin activation has an important role in the transduction of mechanical signals. Consequently, we postulate that the integrin-dependent regulation of the IGF-I mitogenic signaling pathway could, in part, be involved in the mechanical stimulation of bone formation. This study investigated the potential relationship between the signaling mechanism of mechanical stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and that of IGF-I-induced osteoblast proliferation by testing two hypotheses: 1) increased mechanical strain in the form of fluid shear stress could synergistically enhance the osteogenic action of IGF-I, and 2) the synergy between IGF-I and fluid shear stress involves the integrin-dependent up-regulation of IGF-IR phosphorylation through an inhibition of SHP-mediated IGF-IR dephosphorylation.

(Cleveland, OH). [3H]Thymidine (48 Ci/mmol) and [125I]NaI (2,215 Ci/mmol) were from ICN Biochemicals (Irvine, CA). Recombinant human IGF-I and FGF-2 were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-actin, anti-IGF-IR, and anti-pErk1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-pIGF-IR and anti-pan Erk antibodies were products of BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA) and Transduction Labs (San Diego, CA), respectively. Other chemicals were from Fisher or Sigma. Fluid Shear Stress Experiments—Human TE85 osteosarcoma cells were plated on glass slides (75 × 38 mm) at 5 × 104 cells/slide in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. When the cells reached ∼80% confluency, the cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and subjected to a steady fluid shear stress of 20 dynes/cm2 for 30 min in Cytodyne flow chambers as previously described (3Kapur S. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2003; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The static controls were performed on cells grown in identical conditions in Cytodyne chambers but without exposing to the shear stress. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into cell DNA as described previously (29Lau K.-H.W. Lee M.Y. Linkhart T.A. Mohan S. Vermeiden J. Liu C.C. Baylink D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 30 min of the shear stress, the treated and corresponding static control cells were incubated with the indicated dosages of IGF-I (or FGF-2) for 24 h, and [3H]thymidine (1.5 μCi/ml) was added during the final 6 h of the incubation. Effects of a 2-h pretreatment with U0126 (10 μm) or a 24-h pretreatment with a disintegrin, echistatin (100 nm), on shear stress and/or IGF-I-induced cell proliferation were also tested. Western Immunoblot Analyses and Immunoprecipitation—Immediately following the 30-min shear stress and 10-min IGF-I treatments, the treated cells and corresponding controls were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (3Kapur S. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2003; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each extract was assayed with the bicinchoninic acid method. Ten μg of extract protein from each extract was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western immunoblot analysis. Erk1/2 activation was assessed by pErk1/2 level using the anti-pErk1/2 antibody normalized against the total Erk1/2 level. The pIGF-IR level was determined with an antibody against pIGF-IR, normalized against the level of total IGF-IR. The relative level of IGF-IR-bound SHP-1 and -2 was each measured by co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western immunoblot analyses. Briefly, 1 mg of cell extract protein each from treated cells and corresponding controls was incubated with 2 μg of anti-IGF-IR or anti-integrin β3 antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. A predetermined amount of anti-rabbit IgG beads (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) was added for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The bead-bound complex was washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The washed complex was then resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The relative amounts of co-immunoprecipitated SHP-1 or SHP-2 were analyzed by Western analysis using anti-SHP-1 or anti-SHP-2 antibodies, respectively. IGF-IR Binding Assays—Specific IGF-I binding to IGF-IR was measured by receptor-bound [125I]IGF-I in the presence of 100-fold “cold” IGF-I. Radio-iodination of IGF-I was performed by a modified chloramine T method (30Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6739) Google Scholar). Aliquots were immediately stored at –70 °C until assay. Assays were performed within 1 week of iodination. For the IGF-IR binding assay, TE85 cells were plated on glass slides and subjected to fluid shear stress as described above. Immediately after the shear stress, the treated and corresponding static control cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (binding medium). Fresh binding medium was then added, and the cells were incubated with 5 × 104 to 2 × 105 counts/min of [125I]labeled IGF-I in the absence or presence of 25–100 ng (i.e. 100-fold) of unlabeled IGF-I for total and specific binding, respectively. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and the radioactive medium was removed and the slides rinsed five times with ice-cold binding medium. The cells were then lysed in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS). The amount of bound 125I-labeled IGF-I was then quantified by γ counting. Statistical Analyses—Results are shown as mean ± S.D. with at least six replicates. The statistical significance of the differences between independent groups was determined with the two-tailed Student's t test. The dose-dependent effects were assessed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-hoc test. Interactions between two treatments (e.g. shear stress and IGF-I) were evaluated by two-way ANOVA. The difference was considered significant when p < 0.05. Effects of Fluid Shear Stress on the Bone Cell Mitogenic Action of IGF-I in TE85 Cells—IGF-I at 10–50 ng/ml concentrations significantly and dose-dependently (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) increased the proliferation (i.e. [3H]thymidine incorporation) of TE85 cells by ∼1.5–2.5-fold (Fig. 1A). The 30-min steady shear stress of 20 dynes/cm2 also significantly (p < 0.05) increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in TE85 cells by 70% compared with the corresponding static control cells. The combination of the 30-min shear stress and IGF-I treatment produced much greater than additive stimulations (3.5–5.5-fold) of each treatment alone (Fig. 1A). Two-way ANOVA indicates a highly significant (p < 0.01) interaction between the two treatments, suggesting a synergistic interaction between shear stress and IGF-I on bone cell proliferation. To test whether the synergistic interaction between shear stress and IGF-I on human bone cell proliferation is a general feature between bone cell growth factors and shear stress, we evaluated whether shear stress would also synergistically enhance the mitogenic activity of FGF-2 (another potent bone cell growth factor) in TE85 cells. Fig. 1B shows that FGF-2 alone significantly and dose-dependently (p < 0.01) stimulated the TE85 cell proliferation (by ∼1.5–2.0-fold). The combined treatment of the shear stress and FGF-2 yielded no further enhancement (not significant, two-way ANOVA) than FGF-2 alone, indicating that the synergistic interaction between shear stress and IGF-I is not universal to all bone growth factors. Effects of Fluid Shear Stress on the IGF-I-mediated Activation of the Erk1/2 Mitogenic Signaling Pathway in Human TE85 Cells—Because the mitogenic action of IGF-I is mediated through Erk1/2 activation and fluid shear stress also activates Erk1/2 in osteoblasts (3Kapur S. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2003; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Kapur S. Chen S.-T. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2004; 35: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of shear stress and/or IGF-I (or FGF-2) on Erk1/2 phosphorylation (an index of Erk1/2 activation). Fig. 2A confirms that IGF-I alone, at the test doses, significantly and dose-dependently (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) increased the pErk1/2 level (by ∼1.2–5-fold) in TE85 cells. The 30-min steady shear stress alone also significantly (p < 0.01) increased the pErk1/2 level (by ∼2.5-fold). The combination of shear stress and IGF-I treatment produced a synergistic (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA) enhancement (up to 12-fold) in Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Fig. 2B indicates that the mitogenic doses of FGF-2 (0.1 and 1 ng/ml) alone also markedly and significantly increased the pErk1/2 levels in TE85 cells (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). In contrast to IGF-I, the combination treatment of shear stress and FGF-2 did not result in a further increase in the pErk1/2 level compared with the FGF-2 treatment alone (not significant, two-way ANOVA). These findings further support the conclusions that the synergistic interaction between shear stress and IGF-I on bone cell proliferation is mediated through synergistic enhancement of IGF-I-dependent activation of the Erk1/2 mitogenic signaling pathway and that the synergy between shear stress and IGF-I on human bone cell proliferation is not shared by FGF-2. To further evaluate whether activation of the Erk1/2 mitogenic signaling pathway is essential for the synergy, we tested the effect of U0126 (a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1) on the stimulation of cell proliferation and Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by IGF-I with or without the shear stress. Fig. 3A shows that pretreatment with U0126 at 10 μm completely blocked the IGF-I-mediated as well as the shear stress-induced TE85 cell proliferation. It also completely abolished the synergistic enhancement of IGF-I and shear stress. Fig. 3B reveals that the U0126 pretreatment also completely eliminated the synergistic enhancement on Erk1/2 activation by shear stress and IGF-I. Thus, these results are consistent with the conclusion that the synergistic activation of Erk1/2 by IGF-I and shear stress is associated with the synergistic enhancement on osteoblast proliferation. These findings indicate that the synergy between shear stress and IGF-I leading to activation of bone cell proliferation occurs upstream to the Erk1/2 activation. Consistent with previous findings (3Kapur S. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2003; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Kapur S. Chen S.-T. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2004; 35: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), U0216 had no inhibitory effect on either basal proliferation or basal Erk1/2 activation, indicating that basal TE85 cell proliferation is mediated primarily through Erk1/2-independent pathways. Effect of Shear Stress on the IGF-I-mediated Phosphorylation of IGF-IR in TE85 Cells—We next tested whether the synergy between IGF-I and shear stress occurs prior to or after the phosphorylation of IGF-IR receptor. As expected, IGF-I at the test mitogenic doses significantly increased the IGF-IR phosphorylation level in a dose-dependent manner by 2–3.5-fold (Fig. 4). The 30-min steady shear stress alone also significantly (p < 0.01) increased the IGF-IR phosphorylation by 2.5-fold. The combination treatment of shear stress and IGF-I yielded a highly significant synergistic (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA) enhancement in IGF-IR phosphorylation level (up to 8-fold). Effects of Fluid Shear Stress on the Specific Binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR in TE85 Cells—Because shear stress synergistically enhanced IGF-IR phosphorylation, which is initiated by the binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR, we next assessed whether the synergistic enhancement between IGF-I and shear stress was because of an increase in IGF-I binding to IGF-IR. Fig. 5 shows that the application of a 30-min fluid shear stress at 20 dyne/cm2 led to a relatively small, but statistically significant (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) enhancement in the specific binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR in TE85 cells. However, this increase appeared to be of additive nature, as the two binding curves (i.e. with or without shear stress) were parallel to each other. Effects of Echistatin on the IGF-I- and/or Shear Stress-induced Proliferation of TE85 Cells—Because shear stress involves integrin activation in bone cells (3Kapur S. Baylink D.J. Lau K.-H.W. Bone. 2003; 32: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 26Carvalho R.S. Scott J.E. Yen E.H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Salter D.M. Robb J.E. Wright M.O. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether integrin activation is involved in the synergy between IGF-I and shear stress in TE85 cells by determining the effect of the disintegrin echistatin (a competitive integrin receptor antagonist) on IGF-I- and/or shear stress-mediated cell proliferation and IGF-IR phosphorylation. Fig. 6A shows that echistatin, not only reduced the basal (by ∼60%) and shear stress-induced TE85 cell proliferation (by ∼20%), but also completely abolished the increase in cell proliferation induced by IGF-I alone as well as that by the combination treatment. Similarly, echistatin also completely abolished the basal, shear-stress, or IGF-I-induced IGF-IR phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that the synergy between IGF-I and shear-stress on the proliferation and that on IGF-IR phosphorylation level may involve integrin activation. Effects of Fluid Shear Stress on the Association of SHP-1 or -2 with IGF-IR in TE85 Cells—To test whether integrin-dependent recruitment of SHP-2 could be involved in the synergy between IGF-I and shear stress, we determined the effect of IGF-I and/or fluid shear stress on the relative amounts of SHP-2 associated with integrin β3 or with IGF-IR, determined by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7, IP) followed by immunoblotting (IB). This study focused on integrin β3, because this integrin subunit is one of the major subunits in osteoblasts (31Gronthos S. Stewart K. Graves S.E. Hay S. Simmons P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and also because integrin αvβ3 has been implicated to be the essential integrin subunit in regulating the IGF-I-dependent cellular responses in smooth muscle cells (16Ling Y.

https://openalex.org/W2141195472,"Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (adFNDI) is a progressive, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that presents as polydipsia and polyuria as a consequence of a loss of secretion of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) from posterior pituitary nerve terminals. VP gene mutations cause adFNDI. Rats expressing an adFNDI VP transgene (Cys67stop) show a neuronal pathology characterized by autophagic structures in the cell body. adFNDI has thus been added to the list of protein aggregation diseases, along with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's, which are associated with autophagy, a bulk process that delivers regions of cytosol to lysosomes for degradation. However, the role of autophagy in these diseases is unclear. To address the relationships between mutant protein accumulation, autophagy, cell survival, and cell death, we have developed a novel and tractable in vitro system. We have constructed adenoviral vectors (Ads) that express structural genes encoding either the Cys67stop mutant protein (Ad-VCAT-Cys67stop) or an epitope-tagged wild-type VP precursor (Ad-VCAT). After infection of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells, Ad-VCAT encoded material enters neurite processes and accumulates in terminals, while the Cys67stop protein is confined to enlarged vesicles in the cell body. Similar to the intracellular derangements seen in the Cys67stop rats, these structures are of ER origin, and colocalize with markers of autophagy. Neither Ad-VCAT-Cys67stop nor Ad-VCAT expression affected cell viability. However, inhibition of autophagy or lysosomal protein degradation, while having no effect on Ad-VCAT-expressing cells, significantly increased apoptotic cell death following Ad-VCAT-Cys67stop expression. These data suggest that activation of autophagy by the stress of the expression of an adFNDI mutant protein is a prosurvival mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2140771850,"Mutations in the human gene encoding the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) cause autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (adFNDI), a rare inherited disorder that presents as polydipsia and polyuria as a consequence of a loss of secretion of VP from posterior pituitary nerve terminals. Work from our laboratories has shown that adFNDI, like other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's, is associated with autophagy. We have recently shown that the activation of autophagy in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells after adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of an adFNDI mutant VP transgene (Cys67stop) is a cell survival mechanism; its inhibition induces apoptosis. We now show that expression of Cys67stop sensitizes Neuro2a cells to the lethal effects of dopamine. This mode of cell death exhibits features typically associated with classical apoptosis. Yet inhibition of autophagy reversed these effects and rescued cell viability. We propose that autophagy-mediated cell death is a ""two-hit"" process: Following the cellular stress of the accumulation of a misfolded mutant protein, autophagy is prosurvival. However, a second insult triggers an autophagy-dependent apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2101969001,"Thiazides, such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), are used to control blood pressure and to reduce renal calcium excretion. These effects are a result of interactions with the NaCl-cotransporter (NCC). This is demonstrated by the fact that mutations within the NCC protein lead to salt-resistant hypotension and hypocalciuria, paralleled by an increase in bone mineral density. These symptoms are also known as Gitelman syndrome. It has become increasingly evident that the effect of HCTZ on blood pressure and calcium homeostasis cannot be attributed exclusively to kidney functions, where the primary action of HCTZ on NCC is postulated to occur. We demonstrated the presence of the NCC transporter in the rat small intestine (ileum and jejunum) and human HT-29 cells, by using reverse transcription-PCR, Northern blot, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, we show that HCTZ modulates Ca2+ uptake by intestinal cells, while affecting the electrical parameters of the cellular membrane, thus suggesting a functional interaction between NCC and the epithelial voltage-dependent calcium channel.

Thiazide diuretics are used in the treatment of most patients with hypertension, as suggested by the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) (1Chobanian A.V. Bakris G.L. Black H.R. Cushman W.C. Green L.A. Izzo Jr., J.L. Jones D.W. Materson B.J. Oparil S. Wright Jr., J.T. Roccella E.J. JAMA. 2003; 289: 2560-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (16699) Google Scholar). The unique role of thiazide diuretics in the management of high blood pressure is a result of their dual effect on the NaCl, as well as the Ca2+ transport. In the distal convolute tubule of the kidney they interact with the apical NaCl-cotransporter (NCC 1The abbreviations used are: NCC, NaCl-cotransporter; DCT, distal convoluted tubule; ECaC, epithelial Ca2+ channels; HCTZ, Hydrochlorothiazide; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid. ), which in turn is responsible for the majority of salt transport, and whose inhibition causes an increase in renal sodium excretion. In addition to reducing NaCl reabsorption, thiazide diuretics are also responsible for decreasing renal Ca2+ excretion. The involvement of the NCC in Ca2+ homeostasis has been demonstrated by the fact that mutations in the NCC gene are associated with Gitelman syndrome. This disease complex is characterized by hypernatriuria and hypocalciuria, paralleled by an increase in bone mineral density (2Aubin R. Menard P. Lajeunesse D.

The mechanism by which the apical NCC cotransporter in the kidney is functionally interconnected with the co-localized Ca2+ transport systems has not yet been understood in detail. However, it was shown that the inhibition of NCC by thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) leads to hyperpolarization of the apical plasma membrane. This would facilitate luminal Ca2+ entry (7Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Reilly R.F. Ellison D.H. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 277-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), possibly through epithelial Ca2+ channels (ECaC). It is generally accepted that the kidney is the cardinal target of thiazides. However, it was postulated that the distinct action of thiazide diuretics in the management of high blood pressure and calcium homeostasis cannot be attributed exclusively to this organ, but that in addition an effect of these drugs on the intestinum appears to be relevant (5Rejnmark L.

These studies were all conducted at the level of mRNA transcription by using RT-PCR (12Cremaschi D. Porta C. Botta G. Bazzini C. Baroni M.D. Garavaglia M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar) and/or Northern-Blots (13Chang H. Tashiro K. Hirai M. Ikeda K. Kurokawa K. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and more recently by using cDNA microarrays (Gene Expression Omnibus Data Bank, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In extra-renal cell types, NCC has only been investigated thus far at a functional and molecular level in osteoblasts (14Barry E.L. Gesek F.A. Kaplan M.R. Hebert S.C. Friedman P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C109-C116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), peripheral blood mononucleated cells (15Abuladze N. Yanagawa N. Lee I. Jo O.D. Newman D. Hwang J. Uyemura K. Pushkin A. Modlin R.L.

Here we show that (i) the thiazide-sensitive NaCl-cotransporter NCC and ECaC are indeed present in the intestine (rat small intestine and human HT-29 cell line), and (ii) that HCTZ modulates Ca2+ entry into the intestinal cells, by affecting the electrical parameters of the cellular membrane. Therefore, the experiments presented here underline the hypothesis of a direct involvement of the intestinal cells in the effect of HCTZ on blood pressure and calcium homeostasis. Animal Care—Animal testing was performed according to the Italian Health Ministry animal care guidelines. Drugs and Chemicals—RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, Trypsin-EDTA solution, glutamine, HEPES, EGTA, and all standard salts were purchased from Sigma. HT-29 Cell Culture—Cell cultures were performed according to standard methods. The medium consisted of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES buffer, 2 mm Na-pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and amphotericin 0.25 μg/ml. Cultures remained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After cells had become confluent, a 10-min treatment with a trypsin-EDTA mixture (final concentration 0.5–0.2 g/liter) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to detach the cells, which were subsequently reseeded at high density. RT-PCR—Male albino rats (Wistar strain, Italian Charles River), weighing 200–300 g, were used for the experiments. Under 2,2,2-tribromoethanol anesthesia, the upper jejunum or ileum was removed, and enterocytes were collected by scraping off the mucosal layer from the excised small intestine. Rats were subsequently killed by exsanguination under anesthesia. Total RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy kit, as specified by the manufacturer. RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed by using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). When poly(A)mRNA was used, it was purified from total RNA with the Qiagen mRNA easy kit. In this context 0.5 μg of poly(A)mRNA were used to induce the reverse-transcription reaction. The PCR reactions were performed using Taq polymerase (Bioline). Sequences of PCR primers and annealing temperatures are outlined below in Table I.

Such a riboprobe had already been used successfully in Northern blots performed using nonrenal tissue, which demonstrated the specificity for rat kidney NCC (14Barry E.L. Gesek F.A. Kaplan M.R. Hebert S.C. Friedman P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C109-C116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene) and sequenced thereafter. [32P]CTP-labeled cRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription by means of the Riboprobe System T3 kit (Promega, Italy). The riboprobe was purified from unpolymerized nucleotides with a Sephadex S300 spin-column (Amersham Biosciences) to be used for the Northern blot analysis. Northern Blot Analysis—4 μg of kidney total RNA (obtained as described above) and 8 μg of small intestine poly(A)mRNA (purified from total RNA with the Qiagen Oligotex mRNA kit) were separated by 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde denaturizing electrophoresis, and transferred overnight by capillarity with the TurboBlotter system (Schleicher and Schuell) to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following transfer, the membrane was UV-cross-linked. Pre-hybridization and hybridization steps were performed as described (14Barry E.L. Gesek F.A. Kaplan M.R. Hebert S.C. Friedman P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C109-C116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was kept at –80 °C up to 1 week for the final autoradiography procedure. Western Blot—The small intestine and kidney cortex were homogenized in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 30 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm N-tosyl-n-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 1.5 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4). Cellular debris was removed by centrifuging at 1,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C. Supernatant was centrifuged at 7,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged once more at 47,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended in ice-cold PBS (50 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7) containing 1% octylphenylpolyethylene glycol and 0.5% SDS. HT-29 cells membrane proteins were obtained by Triton X-114-based lysis as reported previously (19Musch M.W. vis-Amaral E.M. Vandenburgh H.H. Goldstein L. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation was performed with the N-glycosidase F deglycosylation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer instructions. Brush border or basolateral membranes were prepared as previously described by Mg2+ precipitation, followed by differential centrifugation (20Orsenigo M.N. Tosco M. Laforenza U. Faelli A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Tosco M. Orsenigo M.N. Gastaldi G. Faelli A. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 12: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Proteins from the kidney (25 μg), intestines, brush border membranes, basolateral membranes, or HT-29 cells (100 μg) were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The proteins, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, were first incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-rNCC2–112 (raised against region 2–112 of the rat kidney NCC) (22Plotkin M.D. Kaplan M.R. Verlander J.W. Lee W.S. Brown D. Poch E. Gullans S.R. Hebert S.C.

Antibody-protein complexes were then detected using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography. HT-29 Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on coverslips to ∼70% of confluence, fixed in 0.1 m PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature. After inhibition by means of 3% BSA in PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-NCC1–98 antibody at 1:600 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. After washing out the excessive primary antibody, cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy™2-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:100. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining of nuclei was performed with standard methods. Cells were imaged using a Leica TCS-NT (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscope, equipped with laser argon/krypton, 75-milliwatt multiline. A focal series of horizontal planes of section were monitored for fluorescein isothiocyanate by means of the 488 nm laser lines, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate band pass 530/30 nm filter, for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride with the Coherent Enterprise U.V. argon ion laser (Laser Innovations, Santa Paula, CA). No signal was detectable in negative controls performed by omitting the primary antibody. Immunohistochemistry—The intestine was dissected from adult rats and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.6 (5 h at 4 °C), subsequently dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (10-mm thick) were dewaxed and processed for the immunoenzymatic detection of the NCC transporter using a standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex procedure. Briefly, after quenching of free aldehyde groups with 0.05 m NH4Cl in 0.01 m PBS, pH 7.4 (30 min), sections were treated with 1% H2O2 (15 min) to inactivate endogenous peroxidase, as well as preincubated in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 (30 min). After this, the sections were incubated with the polyclonal antiserum anti-NCC1–98 diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA (48 h at 4 °C in a humid chamber). After multiple rinses in PBS, sections were incubated at room temperature in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA (75 min), rinsed in PBS, and incubated in the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector) diluted 1:100 in PBS. After rinsing in PBS and in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), sections were reacted in a fresh solution of 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.002% H2O2 in Tris-HCl buffer, and subsequently dehydrated and covered with a coverslip. Control slides were incubated in the same solutions without the primary antiserum and processed as above. As positive control, the polyclonal antiserum anti-NCC1–98 was also tested on paraffin sections of kidney, fixed, and processed as those of the intestine. Negative control sections of the intestine and kidney were processed without including the primary or secondary antiserum. All sections were examined and photographed with a Zeiss III photomicroscope. No immunoreactivity was detected when sections were incubated without the primary or secondary antiserum. Short-circuit Experiments—Approximately 5 cm of ileum was removed and placed in oxygenated, ice-cold Ringer solution, opened flat and washed for mounting in standard Ussing chambers (0.25-cm2 exposed area). Both chambers were filled (5 ml each) for control experiments with the following solution (mm): 145.3 Na+, 6.0 K+, 125.3 Cl–, 2.5 Ca2+, 1.2 Mg2+, 13.7 SO42−, 12.5 mannitol, 0.7 H2PO4–, 2.5 HPO42−, pH 7.4. Test solutions contained also HCTZ (1 mm) or 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) 50 μm. Bathing solutions were gassed with 100% O2. Short-circuited conditions were obtained by using an automatic voltage clamp device manufactured in our workshop as previously described (24Meyer G. Botta G. Cremaschi D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A chart recorder was used to register short-circuit current and transepithelial electric potential difference (Vms). Fura-2 Experiments—Experiments were performed on subconfluent HT-29 cells cultured on a glass coverslip in Petri dishes. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was measured with Fura-2 as outlined further above (25Tsien R.Y. Rink T.J. Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1985; 6: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on a glass coverslip were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2-pentakis(acetoxymethyl) ester and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were mounted into a recording chamber and placed on the stage of a microscope (Olympus IX70) equipped with a monochromator (TILL Photonics Polychrome IV) and a charge-coupled device camera (TILL Photonics IMAGO) controlled by the imaging software TILLvisION 4.01. After rinsing the cells for at least 20 min with solution A (control solution, mm: NaCl 135.0, KCl 5.0, CaCl2 2.0, MgCl2 1.2, glucose 5.0, and HEPES 10.0, pH 7.4), the dye was alternatively excited by 340 and 380 nm wavelengths through a 40× oil immersion objective, and the emitted fluorescence was measured at 510 nm from regions of interest within the cells. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration variations were evaluated by analyzing the 340/380 ratio with Microsoft Excel following background subtraction. Ca2+-free solutions were obtained by omitting CaCl2 from solution A in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. HCTZ (1 mm) was freshly dissolved 1–2 h prior to the experiment in solution A. Patch-clamp Experiments—HT29 cells for electrophysiological recordings were seeded on round coverslips (10-mm diameter), cultured as usual and employed 16–48 h after splitting. Before sealing the patch pipette to the cell, cells were kept in a nominally Ca2+-free solution containing (mm): 150 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, and 50 mannitol, pH 7.4 with CsOH to prevent Ca2+ overload. The extracellular divalent cation free solution (bath) contained (mm) 150 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 10 glucose, and 50 mannitol, pH 7.4, with CsOH. The hyperosmolarity of the extracellular solution is routinely used to prevent activation of volume-regulated anion channels. The internal (pipette) solution contained (mm): 20 CsCl, 100 cesium aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 4 Na2ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 with CsOH. Whole cell currents were measured under voltage clamp conditions, with an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Germany; sampling rate 100 μs; four-pole Bessel filter, 2.9 kHz) interfaced with a Macintosh computer running the Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik). The step protocol consisted of a series of 50-ms long voltage steps applied from a holding potential of +20 mV to voltages between –100 and +100 mV, at increments of 20 mV. To generate current voltage relation, the mean current between two cursors shown in Fig. 8 was calculated with the Pulse Fit software. Electrode resistances were between 7 and 8 mΩ; the total cell capacitance was routinely compensated, and measured 15 ± 1 picofarads (n = 8); series resistances were also compensated and currents were leak-corrected; all experiments were performed at room temperature. Statistics—Unless otherwise specified, the experimental values are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Student's t or analysis of variance tests were used (with unpaired data unless otherwise specified) for the statistical analysis. The value of p > 0.05 is indicated by ns. Expression of the NCC Protein in the Rat Small Intestine—We verified the expression of NCC mRNA in the rat small intestine by performing RT-PCRs with three different sets of primer pairs (Table I) and by using enterocyte cDNA as a template. In all PCRs a band at the expected molecular weight was obtained (Fig. 1). With the primer pair rTSC3 the PCR was performed on cDNA from ileum and jejunum, and in both experiments a positive result was obtained. The amplified fragments were sequenced and aligned with the corresponding amino acid sequence of the rat kidney NCC (GenBank™ accession number NP_062218), revealing that, within the tested regions, the intestinal and renal rat NCC sequences are identical. We confirmed the expression of the NCC mRNA by Northern blot. A 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the region 1598–1834 of the renal NCC isoform (GenBank™ accession number NM_019345) was used to identify the full-length transcript of small intestine enterocyte NCC mRNA. Cortical kidney total RNA was used as positive control, where (Fig. 2) two distinct signals corresponding to 4.4 and 3.3 kb could be identified, in good agreement with earlier reports (26Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17713-17722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that both bands correspond to NCC and varying solely by the 3′-untranslated regions. Using the intestine mRNA only one band at 4.4 kb could be observed. Even a prolonged exposure (1 week) did not reveal a second band at 3.3 kb. The expression of the NCC protein was directly assessed also by Western blot experiments, performed on membrane protein preparations obtained from small intestine epithelial cells. Membrane proteins from rat cortical kidney were used as positive control in this context as well. A signal at the expected molecular weight was obtained with two different antibodies that recognize overlapping epitopes, i.e. anti-NCC2–112 (22Plotkin M.D. Kaplan M.R. Verlander J.W. Lee W.S. Brown D. Poch E. Gullans S.R. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 174-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, a and b), and anti-NCC1–98 (23Bostanjoglo M. Reeves W.B. Reilly R.F. Velazquez H. Robertson N. Litwack G. Morsing P. Dorup J. Bachmann S. Ellison D.H. Bostonjoglo M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, c and d). Using both antibodies the characteristic broad band (from 130 to 180 kDa) of NCC could be observed in the kidney preparation (Fig. 3, a and c). The same antibodies were able to detect a band at about 140 kDa in intestine protein preparations (Fig. 3, a–c). In accordance with the RT-PCR data, the NCC protein was seen both in the ileum and jejunum (Fig. 3a). Because the kidney NCC is extensively glycosylated (27De Jong J.C. Van D.V. van den Heuvel L.P.

Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we tested if the same applies to the intestinal isoform. Western blot experiments were performed on untreated or F-glycosidase-treated intestinal membrane protein preparations (Fig. 3b). The NCC signal was shifted from 140 to 110 kDa after F-glycosidase treatment, indicating that intestinal NCC is a glycosylated protein and the size of the molecular mass of the core protein is identical to that of the kidney isoform (27De Jong J.C.

Nishio T. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) i.e. 110 kDa. Localization of the Intestinal NCC Cotransporter—To investigate the cellular localization of the NCC protein, Western blot experiments were performed on brush border membrane and basolateral membrane protein preparations of isolated enterocytes, using anti-NCC1–98 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 3d, a signal was only detected in brush border membranes, suggesting an apical localization of the transporter. Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed that the transporter is indeed specifically localized on the apical membrane of enterocytes (Fig. 4). In all sections of the jejunum, a signal was detected in the apical membrane of the epithelial cells lining the villi (Fig. 4, a–c), whereas only a faint signal was observed in the cryptal cells (Fig. 4a). As expected, in the kidney the NCC protein could only be verified on the apical membrane of distal tubular segments (Fig. 4d). Effect of HCTZ in the Rat Jejunum—To investigate the functional role of the intestinal NCC, we performed short-circuit current experiments using an Ussing-chamber. To minimize the activity of both, the Na+/H,+ as well as the Cl–/HCO3 exchanger, the bath solutions used for the experiment did not contain bicarbonate and were bubbled with 100% O2. A representative trace of the time course of the Vms in the absence of HCTZ is shown in Fig. 5a. Vms decreased exponentially over time, reflecting the expected time-dependent reduction of tissue vitality. Changing repeatedly the mucosal solution with a solution of the same composition did not cause any alteration of Vms (Fig. 5a). In contrast, the presence of 1 mm HCTZ in the mucosal solution caused a reversible and statistically significant depolarization of Vms (Fig. 5, b and c). The concentration of 1 mm HCTZ was chosen according to dose-response curves reported for experiments in intact epithelia (29Cremaschi D. Porta C. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Cremaschi D. Vallin P. Porta C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A possible nonspecific effect of HCTZ is the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (31Pickkers P. Garcha R.S. Schachter M. Smits P. Hughes A.D. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Such an effect was ruled out in our experiments, because we used bicarbonate-free solutions (see above) and, in addition, acetazolamide, a known blocker for the carbonic anhydrase, does not change ΔVms (0.43 ± 1.61%, n = 9). The HCTZ-induced depolarization of Vms could only be observed if the drug was added to the mucosal side, whereas the addition of the drug to the serosal side had no effects on Vms (data not shown), consistent with an apical localization of the cotransporter. Given that the NCC cotransporter is electroneutral, the observed rapid and immediate depolarization cannot be attributed to the inhibition of the NCC cotransporter itself. In analogy to what has been proposed for the kidney distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (7Gese"
https://openalex.org/W2165530871,"The vessel-stabilizing effect of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)/Tie2 receptor signaling is a potential target for pro-angiogenic therapies as well as anti-angiogenic inhibition of tumor growth. We explored the endothelial and vascular specific activities of the Ang1 monomer, i.e. dissociated from its state as an oligomer. A truncated monomeric Ang1 variant (i.e. ΔAng1) containing the isolated fibrinogen-like receptor-binding domain of Ang1 was created and recombinantly produced in insect cells. ΔAng1 ligated the Tie2 receptor without triggering its phosphorylation. Moreover, monomeric ΔAng1 was observed to bind α5β1 integrin with similar affinity compared with Tie2. Unexpectedly, in vitro treatment of endothelial cells with ΔAng1 showed some of the known effects of full-length Ang1, including inhibition of basal endothelial cell permeability and stimulation of cell adhesion as well as activation of MAPKs. Local treatment of the microvasculature of the developing chicken chorioallantoic membrane with the ΔAng1 protein led to profound reduction of the mean vascular length density, thinning of vessels, and reduction of the number of vessel branching points. Similar effects were observed in side-by-side experiments with the recombinant full-length Ang1 protein. These effects of simplification of the vessel branching pattern were confirmed through local gene transfer with lentiviral particles encoding ΔAng1 or full-length Ang1. Together, our findings suggest a potential use for exogenous Ang1 in reducing rather than increasing vascular density. Furthermore, we show that the isolated receptor-binding domain of Ang1 is capable of mediating some effects of full-length Ang1 independently of Tie2 phosphorylation, possibly through integrin ligation.

The angiopoietin family of morphogens exerts essential functions for vascular and lymphatic growth and remodeling (1Thurston G.

Unlike classic angiogens proposed for therapy, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factors, Ang1-mediated Tie2 activation fails to stimulate mitogenesis of ECs. Rather, Ang1/Tie2 signaling appears to affect EC activities that ultimately lead to the formation of more mature and stable vessel walls. Specifically, Ang1 was shown to mediate anti-permeability, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects (3Kim I. Kim H.G. So J.N. Kim J.H. Kwak H.J. Koh G.Y. Circ.

The Ang1-induced vessel-stabilizing effects appear to depend on tightening of EC cell junctions as well as on increased association of the endothelium with mural cells (i.e. periendothelial and smooth muscle cells) recruited to the vessel wall (5Gamble J.R.

Together, these positive effects suggest Ang1 as candidate agent for therapeutic revascularization approaches that aim at the growth of lasting blood vessels in a more coordinated way. Administration of Ang1 as a singular agent may prevent or reverse blood vessel leakiness, such as in the conditions of diabetic retinopathy: intravitreal injection of recombinant Ang1 protein, i.e. Ang1* (see below), proved successful in protecting rat retinal vasculature from inflammation, EC injury, and blood-retinal barrier breakdown, which are typically associated with this disease (12Joussen A.M.

Moreover, studies of tumor growth with human colon or breast cancer cell lines that overexpress Ang1 indicate that Ang1 may inhibit angiogenesis in tumors, possibly by its effect in stabilizing interactions between ECs and pericytes and a concomitant inhibition of initiation of tumor angiogenesis (15Stoeltzing O. Ahmad S.A. Liu W. McCarty M.F. Wey J.S. Parikh A.A. Fan F. Reinmuth N. Kawaguchi M. Bucana C.D. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3370-3377PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hayes A.J. Huang W.Q. Yu J.

Ang1 is a 498-amino acid molecule arranged in an N-terminal domain/coiled-coil domain/fibrinogen-like domain order (18Davis S. Papadopoulos N. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Huang T. Kovac L. Xu A. Leidich R. Radziejewska E. Rafique A. Goldberg J. Jain V. Bailey K. Karow M. Fandl J. Samuelsson S.J. Ioffe E. Rudge J.S. Daly T.J. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30196-30201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Dimerization and superclustering of the fibrinogen-like domain, as found in native Ang1, were found to be critical for triggering phosphorylation of the Tie2 receptor. Physiologically, native Ang1 physically associates with components of the extracellular matrix (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mechanism of liberation from the extracellular matrix is elusive. Native forms of Ang1 are very difficult to produce: the complex quaternary structure of Ang1 and its stickiness to extracellular matrix components have prevented production at high protein titers. Multiple recent attempts have been directed toward genetically engineering multimeric Ang1 constructs that are less difficult to purify but still retain their ability to stimulate Tie2 phosphorylation. Examples are the receptor-binding domain of Ang1 coupled to the angiopoietin-2 oligomerization domain (Ang1*) (21Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C.

We studied a new variant (ΔAng1) that is monomeric and comprises the soluble fibrinogen-like receptor-binding domain of Ang1. We describe unexpected functionalities of ΔAng1 in mediating effects in vitro and in vivo that copied those of oligomeric full-length Ang1. Recombinant Ang1 Vectors—Human full-length Ang1 was cloned from human aortic smooth muscle cells (kindly provided by Dr. P. Benedikt, University Hospital Zurich). Cloning was performed following standard procedures (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

All plasmids, their features, cloning strategies, and the oligonucleotide primers used for PCRs are given in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Expression and Purification of ΔAng1 and Full-length Ang1 in Insect Cells—TheΔAng1 protein was constructed for use in the insect cell expression vector pFMel (24Zhou D. Malissard M. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the full-length cDNA of human Ang1 as template. The ΔAng1 protein construct is defined by the following amino acid sequences: an insect cell secretion signal sequence (MKFLVNVALVFMVVYISYIYA) followed by DP (resulting from a BamHI site), the factor XIII transglutaminase substrate sequence NQEQVSPL, a short linker sequence (PVELP), a plasmin-sensitive cleavage motif (LIKMKP) (25Sakiyama-Elbert S.E. Panitch A. Hubbell J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1300-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and AS (resulting from an NheI site) followed by the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain of Ang1 beginning with RDCAD. The final ΔAng1 protein contains the additional 23-amino acid motif DPNQEQVSPLPVELPLIKMKPAS in front of the Ang1 fibrinogen-like domain. The non-glycosylated form of ΔAng1 has a theoretical molecular mass of 27,212 Da and an isoelectric point of 7.75. The expression and purification in Sf9 insect cells of the Myc-tagged full-length Ang1 protein have been described previously (26Fiedler U. Krissl T. Koidl S. Weiss C. Koblizek T. Deutsch U. Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Augustin H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1721-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus encoding ΔAng1 was used to produce soluble ΔAng1 protein in the Sf21 insect cell system. All insect cell culture reagents (i.e. Sf21 cells, SF-900 II SFM medium with l-glutamine, antibiotic/antimycotic solution, and Cellfectin) were obtained from Invitrogen and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The optimal expression parameters (i.e. infection cell density, 2.1 × 106 cells/ml; multiplicity of infection of 1; and time of harvest, 72 h post-infection) were elaborated according to the protocol of Weber et al. (27Weber W. Weber E. Geisse S. Memmert K. Cytotechnology. 2002; 38: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The insect cell supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and filtration. Subsequent column chromatography steps were performed using an ÄKTA fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C. In the first step, the insect cell supernatant was diluted 1:1 with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and fractionated on a cation exchange HiPrep SP FF column by gradient elution to 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 1 m NaCl. Subsequent hydrophobic interaction chromatography was performed by applying ΔAng1 supplemented with 0.7 m (NH4)2SO4 to a HiTrap phenyl HP column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 1 m (NH4)2SO4. The protein was eluted with a gradient to 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). The ΔAng1-containing eluate was then dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl) using a Spectrapor dialysis membrane with a molecular mass cutoff of 12–14 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA). The ΔAng1 dialysate was concentrated using 20-ml Vivaspin columns (Vivascience Ltd., Lincoln, United Kingdom) with a 5-kDa molecular mass cutoff and finally polished by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. The ΔAng1 protein was filter-sterilized, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Identity was confirmed by immunoblotting with Ang1-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Cloning of Lentiviral Vectors of ΔAng1 and Full-length Ang1—ΔAng1 and full-length Ang1 were cloned into the third-generation lentiviral vectors pBM14 and pMF359, respectively, using SbfI and PmeI as restriction sites (28Mitta B. Rimann M. Ehrengruber M. Ehrbar M. Djonov V. Kelm J. Fussenegger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lentiviral particles were produced and collected as described previously (28Mitta B. Rimann M. Ehrengruber M. Ehrbar M. Djonov V. Kelm J. Fussenegger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lentiviral particle-mediated production of ΔAng1 and full-length Ang1 proteins was validated in murine CHO-K1 cell culture experiments using a previously described protocol (28Mitta B. Rimann M. Ehrengruber M. Ehrbar M. Djonov V. Kelm J. Fussenegger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Ang1 proteins were resolved by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with Ang1-specific antibodies. Control cultures were transduced with lentiviral particles encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Mammalian Cell Culture—Human aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/GlutaMAX-I supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Cultures of passages 8–10 were used for Ang1 mRNA isolation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured on gelatin-coated tissue culture polystyrene plates in EC medium (PromoCell) and used at passages 4–7. EA.hy926 cells (29Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. Mile Sven MS1 cells, a mouse pancreatic islet endothelial cell line (30Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Solid-phase Binding Assay—96-Well Maxisorb microtiter plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with ΔAng1 at 2 μg/ml in TBS. The plates were washed three times and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS. After three washes with TBS, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotin-labeled soluble Tie2-immunoglobulin chimeric protein (Tie2-Fc) at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 1C in TBS and 0.1% BSA. Nonspecific binding to the plates was assessed by incubating biotin-labeled Tie2-Fc in a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled Tie2-Fc. After three washes with TBS, alkaline phosphatase-coupled streptavidin was added (1:1000 in TBS), and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS, p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added (10 mm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). Absorbance at 405 nm was recorded when a maximal absorbance of 1.0–1.5 was reached. ΔAng1 Pull-down Assay—Binding of soluble ΔAng1 to immobilized Tie2-Fc was assessed in a pull-down assay. 10 μg of ΔAng1 were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with admixtures of 50 μg of Tie2-Fc and 25 μl of protein A-agarose in 0.5 ml of 0.1% BSA. Control incubations were performed by incubating ΔAng1 or Tie2-Fc with protein A-agarose. After three washes with TBS and 0.5% Tween 20, proteins bound to protein A-agarose were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Preparation of ΔAng1-Sepharose—Coupling of the ΔAng1 protein to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) was performed following the standard protocol for affinity chromatography recommended by Amersham Biosciences. 2 mg of ΔAng1 in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) were coupled to 1 ml of resin for 60 min. Coupling was complete as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of unreacted protein. Control resin (Sepharose alone) was processed identically without the ΔAng1 protein. For blocking nonspecific protein-binding sites, ΔAng1-Sepharose and control Sepharose were preincubated with 1% BSA in TBS (pH 7.5) before use in affinity binding experiments. Affinity Binding Experiments with ΔAng1-Sepharose—Affinity isolation experiments were performed with lysates prepared from mouse MS1 endothelial cells or human foreskin fibroblasts as indicated in Fig. 3. For affinity precipitation experiments, two confluent T75 flasks of either MS1 cells or fibroblasts were overlaid with ice-cold TBS (1.5 ml/flask), collected by scraping, transferred to 15-ml centrifuge tubes, and pelleted by centrifugation. For protein solubilization, the pelleted cells were lysed in 3 ml of ice-cold detergent buffer (50 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) and sonicated for 3 min. The extract was then divided into two Eppendorf tubes and extracted for 30 min in an Eppendorf shaker. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. The resulting supernatants were subjected to a second preclearing step by a 20-min incubation with 20 μl of Sepharose alone. Finally, the cleared lysates were incubated with 20 μl of ΔAng1-Sepharose or control resin for 2 h on a rotating wheel. After incubation, the resins were collected by short centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of detergent buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of 2× reducing SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose, and immunoprobed with rabbit anti-Tie2 polyclonal antibodies (sc-324, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:200 dilution or with anti-α5 integrin antibodies (sc-10729, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:200 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from DakoCytomation AG (Zug, Switzerland). Protein signals were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Column affinity chromatography was performed in parallel with ΔAng1-Sepharose and Sepharose alone (control). MS1 endothelial cells from seven T75 flasks were used to prepare 3-ml protein lysates using the same buffers and methodology as described above. 0.9-ml volumes of each ΔAng1-Sepharose and Sepharose alone were provided in Econo-Columns (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated in detergent buffer before 1.5 ml of protein lysate were added to each column. The mixtures of resin and lysate were incubated for 2 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel. The flow-through was collected, and each resin was washed four times with 1 ml of detergent buffer. Serial elution was performed with a step gradient of sodium chloride added to detergent buffer (0.2–1 m). In each elution step, 0.5 ml of elution buffer was applied to the resin and incubated for 5 min before the eluate was collected. The final elution was performed with 2 mm EDTA in detergent buffer. Aliquots of lysate, wash fractions, and eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Cell Binding and MAPK Phosphorylation Assay—HUVEC attachment assays were performed as described previously (31Carlson T.R. Feng Y. Maisonpierre P.C. Mrksich M. Morla A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26516-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by crystal violet staining. Phase micrographs of centerfields were taken using the ×4 objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with a digital camera. Cells were counted from printed micrographs. MAPK phosphorylation assays of HUVECs plated on tissue culture polystyrene dishes coated with BSA, ΔAng1, or fibronectin were performed similarly as described (31Carlson T.R. Feng Y. Maisonpierre P.C. Mrksich M. Morla A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26516-26525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Total lysates derived from bound and unbound cells were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA). After stripping, the membranes were reprobed with anti-p44/42 MAPK antibodies. Permeability Measurements—Permeability experiments were performed similarly as described previously (32Gloor S.M. Weber A. Adachi N. Frei K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). EA.hy926 cells (7Pizurki L. Zhou Z. Glynos K. Roussos C. Papapetropoulos A.

After reaching confluency, EA.hy926 cells were incubated for 24 h with increasing amounts of ΔAng1 that were added to the medium of both the apical and basolateral chambers. Radiolabeled [3H]inulin (42.5 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) was added at a final concentration of 4 μm to the apical chamber (total volume of 0.5 ml). The appearance of radioactivity in the basolateral compartment (total volume of 1.5 ml) was determined after 1 h by scintillation counting of 20-μl aliquots of the basolateral medium. The permeability of [3H]inulin is expressed as a percent of the control value of untreated cells grown under identical conditions. Preparation of Fibrin Gels—Human fibrinogen (Fluka AG, Buchs, Switzerland) was prepared as described (33Schense J.C. Hubbell J.A. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Fibrin gels for experiments on the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) were prepared by mixing the following components to the indicated final concentrations: 7 mg/ml human fibrinogen, 2 units/ml human factor XIII (kindly provided by Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria), 2 NIH units/ml of human thrombin (Sigma), and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Gels were allowed to polymerize for at least 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere before application to the chicken CAM. Embryonic Chicken CAM Assay—Grafting experiments were performed on chicken embryos grown by the shell-free culture method (34Auerbach R. Kubai L. Knighton D. Folkman J. Dev. Biol. 1974; 41: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Grafts were formed as disc-shaped fibrin hydrogels (fibrinogen concentration of 7 mg/ml) in a 50-μl volume containing 0.5–6 μg of ΔAng1 or 6 μg of Myc-tagged full-length Ang1. The grafts were placed on top of the growing CAM at embryonic day 9. Parallel grafting experiments were performed with plain fibrin gels. On embryonic day 11, microvascular growth and blood flow at and around the fibrin graft were monitored in the living embryo with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope. Observations were performed after intravenous injections of 0.1 ml of 2.5% fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (Mr 2,000,000; Sigma) (35Djonov V. Schmid M. Tschanz S.A. Burri P.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Transduction of the embryonic CAM with lentiviral particles encoding the gene of ΔAng1, full-length Ang1, or green fluorescent protein was performed as described previously (28Mitta B. Rimann M. Ehrengruber M. Ehrbar M. Djonov V. Kelm J. Fussenegger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-μl lentiviral particles mixed with 0.5 μl of CellTracker™ Orange chloromethylbenzoylaminotetramethyl-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were applied pointwise on top of the growing CAM at embryonic day 9. The pattern of FITC-dextran-perfused vessels at and around the application site was monitored on embryonic day 12 with a Leica fluorescence microscope equipped with an XF114 filter (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) and an LE CCD Optronics video camera (Visitron System, Puchheim, Germany) using ×50 and ×100 magnifications, respectively. Morphometric Analysis of the CAM—Grayscale prints from images of the CAM vasculature perfused with FITC-dextran were used for morphometric assessment of two parameters of microvascular growth, i.e.“mean vascular length density” and “vascular end point density.” For this, the vasculature was skeletonized on grayscale prints and analyzed by the method of grid intersection as described (36Gundersen H.

https://openalex.org/W1971320986,"Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrate that ligand-mediated activation of the EphA8 receptor critically regulates cell adhesion and migration. In this report, we show that the EphA8 receptor induces neurite outgrowth in NG108-15 cells in the absence of ligand stimulation. Using various deletion mutants lacking specific intracytoplasmic regions, we confirm that the tyrosine kinase domain of EphA8 is important for inducing neurite outgrowth. However, the tyrosine kinase activity of EphA8 is not crucial for neurite outgrowth induction. Treatment with various inhibitors further reveals that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is critical for neurite outgrowth induced by EphA8. Consistent with these results, EphA8 expression induced a sustained increase in the activity of MAPK, whereas ligand-mediated EphA8 activation had no further modulatory effects on MAP kinase activity. Additionally, activated MAPK relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to EphA8 transfection. These results collectively suggest that the EphA8 receptor is capable of inducing a sustained increase in MAPK activity, thereby promoting neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells."

Systematic site-directed mutagenesis in combination with photo-cross-linking using a derivatized peptide carrying an N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence suggested a direct involvement of Stt3p in substrate recognition (3Yan Q.

An STT3 homologue has recently been discovered in the enteropathogenic bacterium Campylobacter jejuni (6Wacker M. Linton D. Hitchen P.G. Nita-Lazar M. Haslam S.M. North S.J. Panico M. Morris H.R.

Stt3p from S. cerevisiae has 50% sequence identity to the human homologues, and highly conserved stretches of residues are found throughout the protein.

A C-terminal protein A fusion to S. cerevisiae Stt3p has located the C terminus of the protein to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (2Zufferey R. Knauer R. Burda P. Stagljar I. te Heesen S. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but the number of transmembrane helices and their orientations relative to the membrane have not been determined.Here, we present in vivo and in vitro topology mapping studies of S. cerevisiae Stt3p and mouse STT3-A, using C-terminal reporter fusions and insertion of glycosylation sites in the loops between the putative transmembrane segments. We propose a common Ncyt-Clum topology with 11 transmembrane helices for the STT3 family of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Plasmid Construction and Transformation—For construction of plasmids with a Suc2 segment insertion, a SphI site was generated by the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the desired position in the STT3 gene in plasmid pRS314STT3HA (3Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47692-47700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination regions were chosen as the upstream and downstream 33 bp flanking the SphI site. A segment of the SUC2 gene encoding residues 81–133 was amplified by PCR from plasmid pJK90 (8Kim H. Yan Q. Von Heijne G. Caputo G.A. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7460-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a forward primer composed of the homologous region chosen upstream of the SphI site in pRS314STT3HA and 17 bases complementary to the 5′ end of the SUC2 segment and a reverse primer composed of 17 bases complementary to the 3′ end of the SUC2 segment and the 33-bp recombination region downstream of the SphI site in pRS314STT3HA. Yeast transformation was carried out in strain STY50 (MAT a, his4-401, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-52, HOL1-1, SUC2::LEU2) (9Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with a SphI-digested pRS314STT3HA-(N (N-terminal), 105, 113, 139, 354, 385, 404, 440, C (C-terminal)) and the SUC2 PCR product. Colony PCR was carried out on each transformant using a5′ primer complementary to the upstream sequence of the STT3 gene in pRS314STT3HA (5′-ACTTCTCTTCGCCTCTGC-3′) and a 3′ primer complementary to a region within the SUC2 insert (5′-TTGTCTTGGATCAATAG-3′). Positive colonies were selected, and plasmid was isolated and transformed into Escherichia coli for sequencing. After confirming the correct sequence of the construct, plasmid was transformed into strain QYY700 (MAT a ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 Δ stt3::his5+(Schizosaccharomyces pombe) YEp352-STT3) (3Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47692-47700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on –Ura/–Trp plates. Plasmids encoding truncated Stt3p fused to a C-terminal HA/Suc2/His4C reporter were constructed as described (10Kim H. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10208-10213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and transformed into strain STY50 (9Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Plasmids carrying truncated Stt3p with a Suc2 insertion were constructed as follows. First, pJK90 was digested with XhoI, linearizing the plasmid in between HA and the start of the SUC2 gene. In addition, for homologous recombination, the XhoI-digested pJK90 was transformed with STY50 strain and the PCR-amplified HIS8 with a stop codon (two primers, 5′-GGCTCCTATCCATATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCGGCCCATCATCATC-3′ and 5′-ATCGCTAGTTTCGTTTGTCATTCCCCGCGGATCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGG-3′, were used). Positive clones carrying HA/HIS8 tag were selected by colony PCR, and the correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and named pJK95. Second, to amplify truncated Stt3p with a Suc2 insertion, PCR was carried out with two primers (5′-GTTTGTTACGCATGCAAGCTTGATATCGAAATGGGATCCGACCGGTCGTG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTTTGTTACGCATGCAAGCTTGATATCGAAATGGGATCCGACCGGTCG-3′) and pRS314STT3HA with Suc2 insertions at various positions as a template. PCR products and an SmaI-digested pJK95 were transformed into STY50, and positive clones were selected on –Ura plates.Membrane Fractionation and Endo H Digestion—Membrane fractions were prepared as described in Ref. 11Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar with some modifications. Yeast transformants were grown overnight in 5 ml of auxotrophic media. Cells were harvested and washed with 5 ml of distilled H2O and resuspended in 200 μl of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tri-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.3 m sorbitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) and transferred to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). Cell suspensions were vortexed 5 times at full speed for 45 s with 30-s intervals on ice. Cell suspension excluding glass beads was transferred to a new tube on ice, the glass beads were washed once with 200 μl of lysis buffer, and this residual cell suspension was added to the first tube. The glass bead-treated cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 s to remove unbroken cells, and the soluble fraction was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended with 100 μl of Endo H buffer (80 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was discarded. 30 μl of each soluble fraction was aliquoted into two tubes; 1 μl of Endo H (5 units/ml) was added to one tube, and the other tube was used as a mock sample.Western Blotting Analysis—All Endo H-digested samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The blot was probed with anti-HA mouse antibody (Covance Research Products, Richmond, CA) and developed using the ECL Advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Growth Assay—Yeast transformants carrying pJK92-derived Suc2/His4C reporter fusion plasmids were streaked on –His plates supplemented with 6 mm histidinol and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Yeast transformants carrying SUC2 insertion plasmids were streaked on 5FOA plates and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days.Plasmid Construction and in Vitro Expression of Mouse STT3-A— Mouse STT3-A constructs were made as described previously (12Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, for cloning into and in vitro expression from the pGEM1 plasmid, the 5′ end of the Itm1 gene encoding STT3-A (GenBank™ accession number L34260) in the pSPORT1 plasmid (13Hong G. Deleersnijder W. Kozak C.A. Van Marck E. Tylzanowski P. Merregaert J. Genomics. 1996; 31: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was modified in two ways during PCR amplification: (i) by the introduction of a 5′ XbaI site and (ii) by changing the context of the region immediately upstream of the initiator ATG codon to a Kozak consensus ribosome binding sequence, CCACCATGG (12Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); both changes were encoded within the 5′ PCR primer. The reverse primer encoded the 3′ end of STT3, two stop codons, and an SmaI site for cloning. The STT3 gene was amplified by PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system from Roche Diagnostics and cloned into pGEM1 downstream of the SP6 promoter as an XbaI-SmaI fragment.Templates for in vitro transcription of truncated mRNA with a 3′ stop codon were prepared using PCR to amplify fragments from the pGEM1 plasmids containing the relevant STT3 constructs. The 5′ primers were the same for all clones and were situated 210 bases upstream of the translational start such that all amplified fragments contained the SP6 promoter from pGEM1 (15Mingarro I. Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. BMC Cell Biol. 2000; 1 (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/1/3): 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 3′ primers were designed according to the desired C-terminal end of the truncated protein, and tandem stop codons (TAA TAG) were introduced after codons 198, 280, 310, 498, 538, and 543 in the Itm1 gene. The amplified DNA products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).Glycosylation acceptor sites were designed as described previously (16Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), i.e. by replacing one, two, or three appropriately positioned codons with codons for the acceptor tripeptide Asn-Ser-Thr, by insertion of one or more codons for the acceptor tripeptide Asn-Ser-Thr, or by combining these two methods. In one case, a loop in the STT3-A protein was elongated by 10 residues using spacer sequences flanking an acceptor Asn-Ser-Thr tripeptide.Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing of plasmid DNA at BM labbet AB (Furulund, Sweden). All cloning steps were done according to standard procedures using restriction enzymes from Promega (Madison, OH).The DNA template for in vitro transcription was prepared by transcription of the relevant pGEM1-derived plasmid with SP6 RNA polymerase for 1 h at 37 °C. mRNA translation in nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate supplemented with [35S]Met was performed as described (17Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 1 h. All Endo H-digested samples were performed as described above. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized in a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimaging device using the Image Reader V1.8J/Image Gauge V 3.45 software.RESULTSThe membrane topology models for yeast Stt3p and mouse STT3-A predicted by the TMHMM method (18Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8882) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1. The predicted topologies differ in the number of transmembrane segments (13 for yeast, 12 for mouse) and in the location of the hydrophilic C-terminal domain (luminal in yeast, cytosolic in mouse). Guided by these predictions, we engineered glycosylation sites in most of the predicted loops and also made in-frame and C-terminal truncation reporter fusions to obtain further data on the topology of the two proteins.S. cerevisiae Stt3p—We have taken two approaches to investigate the membrane topology of yeast Stt3p. The first is to insert a 52-residue-long segment of invertase with three N-glycosylation sites into predicted loops of full-length Stt3p, and the second is to fuse the dual Suc2/His4C topology reporter (10Kim H. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10208-10213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Deak P.M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) at the C terminus of truncated Stt3p molecules. In the first approach, glycosylation of the invertase fragment indicates a luminal location of the corresponding loop; in the second approach, glycosylation of the reporter again suggests a luminal orientation, whereas the ability of transformed his4– cells to grow on media lacking histidine but including histidinol suggests a cytosolic location of the reporter (19Deak P.M. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10663-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In both approaches, a hemagglutinin tag was attached to Stt3p to allow detection by Western blotting.To insert the invertase fragment into Stt3p, we amplified an internal part of the SUC2 gene encoding a-52 amino-acid segment (residues 81–133) that contains three N-glycosylation sites. It has been shown previously that insertion of this fragment into other S. cerevisiae membrane proteins does not influence the overall topology (20Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47692-47700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since STT3 is an essential gene in S. cerevisiae, wild-type STT3 must be present on a plasmid for a haploid deletion strain to survive. To test whether the different constructs can functionally replace Stt3p, transformants were streaked onto 5FOA plates. If the Stt3 insertion construct can replace wild-type STT3, transformants will grow on 5FOA plates by releasing the URA3 plasmid carrying wild-type STT3. In contrast, if the construct does not complement the loss of wild-type Stt3p, cells cannot be cured of the wild-type STT3 plasmid and thus die on 5FOA plates due to the accumulation of toxic fluorodeoxyuridine that is formed from 5FOA and uracil in the cell.Of the different insertion constructs, the ones with insertions at residues 105 and 204 showed a very low level of protein expression (data not shown). The constructs with insertions after residues 354 and 404 expressed detectable levels of protein, but the transformants did not grow on 5FOA (data not shown). The remaining transformants allowed growth on 5FOA (Fig. 2A), showing that these insertions are compatible with Stt3p function and thus presumably allow a significant fraction of the molecules to insert with the correct topology.Fig. 2Functional complementation of the yeast stt3 deletion by Stt3p constructs with Suc2 insertions. The positions of the Suc2 insertion are indicated. A, the growth of constructs transformed into the stt3 deletion strain and selected for Suc2 insertion constructs complementing the loss of wild-type (WT) STT3 on 5FOA plates. B, the glycosylation status of the full-length Stt3p with a Suc2 insertion assayed by Endo H digestion. C, the glycosylation status of the truncated Stt3p with a Suc2 insertion assayed by Endo H digestion. In B and C, gels were probed by Western blotting with a hemagglutinin antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the location (cytosolic or luminal) of the invertase fragment in these constructs, membrane fractions were prepared from yeast transformants expressing the different constructs and subjected to Endo H digestion. Wild-type Stt3p migrates anomalously as a smeared band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (21Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As expected, the constructs with a Suc2 insertion migrated more slowly than wild-type Stt3p (Fig. 2B). The WT (wild type), N (N-terminal), 139, 385, and 440 Suc2 insertion showed only a minor mobility shift upon Endo H treatment (Fig. 2B), reflecting the only endogenous glycosylation site at Asn535 in the C-terminal domain (22Li G. Yan Q. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1864-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the Suc2 reporter domain in these constructs is not glycosylated, suggesting that the loops where the Suc2 domain was inserted are oriented to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.In contrast, insertion of the Suc2 domain after amino acid residue 354 and at the C terminus resulted in a larger molecular weight difference between Endo H non-treated and treated samples (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the reporter domain was glycosylated and thus located in the lumen of the ER. Endo H treatment of the construct with an insertion after amino acid residue 113 resulted in a more diffuse band, making it hard to assess the glycosylation status of this particular construct.To facilitate the discrimination between singly and multiply glycosylated molecules, Stt3p constructs with a Suc2 insertion at various positions were also truncated after amino acid residue 536. The site of truncation was chosen about 90 residues downstream of the last predicted TM segment to avoid any possible misinsertion of transmembrane segments into the membrane when truncated between potential TM domains. Moreover, to probe the correct translocation of the C terminus of the protein to the ER lumen, a new N-glycan site was generated at the end of the truncated Stt3p. Membrane fractions were prepared from yeast transformants carrying these constructs and treated with Endo H (Fig. 2C). The difference between one glycosylation (due to the lack of three glycosylations of Suc2 reporter if located in cytosol but one from the C terminus) and four glycosylation (three glycosylations from Suc2 domain if oriented to the luminal side of the membrane and one from the C terminus) in a truncated Stt3p was unambiguously resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). The mobility shift upon Endo H treatment clearly showed that the Suc2 reporters inserted after amino acid residues 105, 113, and 354 in the truncated Stt3p were glycosylated, whereas the reporters inserted after amino acid residue 139, 385, and 440 were not (Fig. 2C). Taken together with the results obtained for the full-length Stt3p/Suc2 constructs, we conclude that the loops corresponding to amino acid residues 139, 385, and 440 are on the cytosolic side, whereas those corresponding to amino acid residues 105, 113, and 354 are on the luminal side of the ER membrane.We finally prepared constructs in which Stt3p was truncated near the C-terminal end of predicted loops and fused to the Suc2/His4C dual reporter domain. A major advantage of using this dual reporter is that a cytosolic orientation of the fusion domain can be confirmed by growth on a selective medium (in addition to the absence of N-glycosylation) and vice versa for a luminal orientation. The C-terminal fusions at residues 78, 140, 199, 340, and 386 were all sensitive to Endo H digestion and failed to grow on media supplemented with histidinol (Fig. 3), confirming that these regions reside in the lumen of the ER. For unknown reasons, two bands were observed for the fusion at residue 140, both of which were Endo H-sensitive.Fig. 3Investigation of yeast Stt3p topology by C-terminal Suc2/His4C fusions. A, the glycosylation status of the Suc2/His4C fusions assayed by Endo H digestion and Western blotting with a hemagglutinin antibody. B, the growth of the Suc2/His4C fusions on –His plates supplemented with histidinol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fusions at residues 235 and 437 were insensitive to Endo H, and the one at residue 296 was partially sensitive. Cells carrying all three constructs grew on the selective media supplemented with histidinol. For the fusions at residues 235 and 437, the results clearly suggest a cytosolic location of the reporter domain, whereas for the fusion at residue 296, a cytosolic location of the reporter domain seems likely even if not absolutely certain.In two cases, the invertase fragment insertion and the C-terminal reporter fusion approaches gave conflicting results. The Suc2 insertion at residue 139 in full-length Stt3p was not glycosylated, whereas the C-terminal reporter fusion at residue 140 was glycosylated and did not support growth on histidinol. Likewise, the Suc2 insertion at residue 385 was not glycosylated, whereas the C-terminal reporter fusion at residue 386 was glycosylated and did not grow on histidinol. These cases are discussed further below.Mouse STT3-A—To investigate the topology of mouse STT3-A, we used glycosylation mapping (23Devoto A. Piffanelli P. Nilsson I. Wallin E.

Scand. 1998; 163: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to determine the location of the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein and of the predicted loops. When expressed in vitro in the presence of microsomes, wild-type STT3-A was inserted into the microsomal membrane with the C-terminal domain in the lumen, as seen by the glycosylation of one or more of the three acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation (Asn537-Arg-Thr, Asn544-Asn-Thr, Asn548-Asn-Thr) present in this domain (Fig. 4A). As detailed below, no glycosylation was observed for the fourth potential acceptor site in STT3-A, Asn381-Leu-Ser. This site is situated at the end of a predicted transmembrane segment between residues 361 and 383 and is presumably not glycosylated since N-linked glycosylation in the microsome system requires a minimum distance of 10–15 residues between the glycosylation site and the nearest transmembrane segment (26Nilsson I. von Heijne G.

To check whether this shorter product could also be used for topology mapping, we first determined whether it originates from the N- or C-terminal part of STT3-A. We thus translated a series of C-terminally truncated version (198, 280, 310, 498, 543 residues long) of STT3-A in the absence of microsomes (Fig. 4B). As the fragment was not seen for the three shortest constructs but was present in the longer ones, it clearly represents the N-terminal ∼340 residues of STT3-A. Whether it results from proteolysis or premature termination of the full-length protein is unclear, but since it is produced in the absence of microsomes and thus cannot result from an ER-bound proteolytic activity, we favor the latter possibility. The fragment is not glycosylated when STT3-A is translated in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 4A (lanes 2 and 3)), again as expected for an N-terminal fragment, since the first potential glycosylation site in STT3-A i"
https://openalex.org/W2034952738,"Previous microarray expression analyses have indicated autocrine human growth hormone (hGH) regulation of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Expression analysis of antioxidant enzymes revealed that autocrine hGH increased both the mRNA and protein levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase and glutamylcysteine synthetase but not that of SOD2. As a consequence, autocrine hGH increased the antioxidant capacity of mammary carcinoma cells and protected against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Catalase activity was increased by autocrine production of hGH in mammary carcinoma cells and a catalase inhibitor abrogated protection from oxidative stress afforded by autocrine hGH. Autocrine hGH transcriptionally regulated catalase gene expression in a p44/42 MAP kinase-dependent manner and inhibition of MEK concordantly abrogated the protective effect of autocrine hGH against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Given that increased cellular oxidative stress is a key effector mechanism of specific chemotherapeutic agents, we propose that antagonism of autocrine hGH will improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic regimes utilized for human mammary carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1966992118,"Overexpression of CD30 and constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation are hallmarks of the malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells. Previous investigations have demonstrated that both proliferation and survival of H-RS cells require constitutive NF-kappaB activity, which is comprised of the p50 and RelA subunits. We report here enhanced expression of NF-kappaB2/p52 and RelB-containing NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in Epstein-Barr virus-negative H-RS cells. Kinetic studies revealed that a proteasome inhibitor MG132 induced p100 accumulation with reduced p52 expression in H-RS cells, suggesting proteasome-dependent processing of p100. In addition, treatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide rapidly downregulated inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase activity in H-RS cells. We also demonstrate that overexpression of CD30 in rat fibroblasts at levels comparable to those in H-RS cells results in constitutive IkappaB kinase activation, proteasome-dependent p100 processing, and NF-kappaB-dependent cell transformation. Our results thus indicate that CD30 triggers the noncanonical NF-kappaB activation pathway, and suggest that deregulated CD30 signaling contributes to the neoplastic features of H-RS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037472014,"Cell polarity and asymmetric cell division are fundamental traits of all living cells and play an essential role in embryonic development, neuronal cell chirality formation, and maintenance of mammalian epithelial cell morphology. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved in directing cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in different organisms. However, the mechanism for G-protein-mediated cell polarity and asymmetric cell division is poorly understood. In this study, we have demonstrated that G-protein-activated phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) interacts with cell polarity proteins Par3 and Par6 (Par: partition-defective) to form protein complexes and to mediate downstream signal transduction. The interactions between PLC-β and Par proteins are direct and require the extreme C-terminal-specific sequence motifs of PLC-β and the PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains of Par proteins. Binding of Par proteins with PLC-β stimulates PLC-β enzymatic activity, leading to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and the production of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, important mediators in cell polarity and cell asymmetric division processes. Furthermore, we have shown that coexpression of PLC-β with Par proteins induces transcriptional activation coupled to intracellular Ca2+ and the Wnt signaling pathway. Therefore, our data suggest that the interaction of PLC-β with cell polarity Par proteins may serve as a nexus to transduce extracellular signals to transcriptional regulation through G-protein-mediated signaling pathway in cell polarity and cell asymmetric division."

Although the most N-terminal leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP) domain is suggested to play a role in the initial assembly of iGluR subunits, it is unclear how this domain is arranged and functions in intact iGluRs. Similarly, although recent crystallographic analyses indicate that the isolated ligand-binding lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein domain forms a 2-fold symmetric dimer, the subunit stoichiometry of intact iGluRs remains elusive. Here, we developed a new approach to address these issues. The LIVBP domain of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors was replaced by leucine-zipper peptides designed to form stable symmetric dimers, trimers, tetramers, or pentamers. All these mutant GluR1s were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and were transported to the cell surface as well as wild type GluR1. Functional and biochemical analyses indicated that these oligomerizing peptides specifically controlled the formation of the expected number of subunits in a channel complex. However, the channel function was only restored by the tetramer-forming peptide. Although the purified LIVBP domain of GluR1 formed a dimmer in solution, a dimer-forming peptide could not restore the function of GluR1. Moreover, a cross-linking assay indicated that four LIVBP domains are located in proximity to each other. These results suggest that the function of the LIVBP domain is not simply to form initial dimers but to adopt a conformation compatible with the overall tetrameric arrangement of subunits in intact AMPA receptors.

Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism that controls subunit assembly will provide key insight into the developmental and tissue-specific functions of AMPA receptors. Functional analyses have suggested that the observed phenotypes of heteromeric channels are best simulated by assuming that the channels comprise two dimers in a tetrameric formation (6Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Mansour M. Nagarajan N. Nehring R.B. Clements J.D. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Indeed, the crystallized form of the ligand-binding LAOBP domain of GluR2 forms a 2-fold symmetric dimer (8Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and rearrangement of this dimer upon ligand binding controls activation and desensitization of iGluRs (9Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Because the LIVBP domain of the AMPA receptor GluR4 dimerizes when expressed as soluble constructs (10Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it was proposed that iGluR monomers first associate through interactions between the LIVBP domain, and these dimers undergo a secondary dimerization (6Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Mansour M. Nagarajan N. Nehring R.B. Clements J.D. Rosenmund C.

However, it is completely unclear how the LIVBP domain assembles and functions in intact iGluRs. The fundamental question regarding the stoichiometry of the functional iGluRs also remains an open question. On the basis of biochemical studies (4Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E. Sullivan J.M. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22663-22671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol.

Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the original theory was that these receptors form pentamers, as do other ligand-gated channels, such as the acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine receptors (15Unwin N. Neuron. 1989; 3: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A key problem associated with these biochemical assays is the unequivocal identification of assembled high molecular weight oligomers. In contrast, several functional assays support the theory that iGluRs form tetramers similar to those formed by voltage-gated K+ channels (6Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Mansour M. Nagarajan N. Nehring R.B. Clements J.D. Rosenmund C.

These functional studies were based on either the simulation of single-channel kinetics or the probability of observing certain phenotypes in heteromeric channels by expressing two subunits with different phenotypes. Therefore, this theory that iGluRs form tetramers is dependent on the model, and it is difficult to eliminate the more elaborate structures (i.e. those with more than four subunits) that may interact in a complicated manner. In addition, although precise control of the expression level of two subunits is crucial for distinguishing the subtle difference between tetramer- and pentamer-based models, it is technically challenging to achieve such control in heterologous expression systems using cRNA or cDNA. Indeed, on the basis of a similar modeling approach, a pentameric structure was proposed for iGluRs (18Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2741-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Premkumar L.S. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the recent identification of GluR0 (20Chen G.Q. Cui C. Mayer M.L. Gouaux E. Nature. 1999; 402: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), a prokaryotic ionotropic glutamate receptor with a K+-selective pore, has supported the theory of a tetrameric structure and strengthened the idea that K+ channels and glutamate receptors are structurally related. However, the structure of GluR0 can significantly differ from that of eukaryotic GluRs. GluR0 forms a K+-selective pore, whereas eukaryotic AMPA receptors form a Ca2+-permeable relatively nonselective pore. In addition, GluR0 lacks the LIVBP domain, which may determine the stoichiometry of eukaryotic GluRs. Therefore, a more direct test that does not rely on models or protein expression levels is desired to clarify the subunit stoichiometry of iGluRs. In the present study, we have developed a new approach that does not rely on mathematical models to elucidate the function of the LIVBP domain and the quaternary structure of iGluRs. cDNA Constructs—The LIVBP domain (N23–R377) of the flip version of rat GluR1 cDNA was deleted by the modified overlap extension method and replaced with ClaI and SacI sites. The final amino acid sequence of mutant GluR1 lacking the LIVBP domain (GluR1ΔLIV) was P22IDAELK378. DNA encoding the following peptide sequence was amplified by primers containing a ClaI site in the 5′-region and a SacI site in the 3′-region and inserted into GluR1ΔLIV: dimer (GCN-IL), RMKQLEDKIEELLSKIYHLENEIARLKKLIGER; trimer (GCN-II), RMKQIEDKIEEILSKIYHIENEIARIKKLIGER, tetramer(GCN-LI), RMKQIEDKLEEILSKLYHIENELARIKKLLGER; and pentamer(COMP), GDLAPQMLRELQETNAALQDVRELLRQQVKEITFLKNTVMECDACG. We added cDNA that encoded the flexible linker peptide GSGGGSGGS to the 3′-end of GCN-IL, GCN-II, GCN-LI, and COMP to create GluR1di-link, GluR1tri-link, GluR1tet-link and GluR1pent-link, respectively. Moreover, we added cDNA that encoded the linker peptide GSGGGSGGSGSGGGSGGS to the 3′-end of GCN-IL to create GluR1di-link x2 .We also added cDNA that encoded a hemagglutinin (HA), FLAG, or His6 tag to the 3′-end of the wild type and mutant GluR1 cDNAs; these added sequences were immediately upstream of the stop codon. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified open reading frames were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. The cDNAs were cloned into the expression vectors pTracer-EGFP (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of the plasmid was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells by using the CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The incubation of cells, the processing of samples, and the immunoblotting analysis were performed as described previously (21Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) Protein Expression and Sucrose Density-gradient Centrifugation— The 3′-end of the cDNA encoding the LIVBP domain was tagged with a region encoding His6, and the entire fragment was cloned into pIVEX2.3d (Roche Diagnostics). The LIVBP protein was expressed in the cell-free in vitro translation system (RTS 100 Escherichia coli HY kit; Roche Diagnostics) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Synthesized LIVBP domain was subjected to a Talon metal affinity column (BD Biosciences). The column was washed with 5-column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton-X) containing 10 mm imidazole. Bound GluR1 proteins were eluted by 300 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Purified LIVBP domain was overlaid on linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradients in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 20 h at 30,000 rpm (SW41Ti; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Ferritin, catalase, aldolase, and albumin (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular weight-marker proteins. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. The 3′-ends of cDNAs encoding GluR1tet or GluR1di were tagged with a His6-encoding region, the fragments were cloned into pTracer-EGFP (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of the plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells (293-tsA; a kind gift of Dr. Richard Horn, Thomas Jefferson University Medical School, Philadelphia, PA) by using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24–36 h, the cells from the 12 6-cm dishes were solubilized in 10 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1.5% Triton-X) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). After the addition of 5 mm imidazole, the soluble fraction was subjected to a Talon metal affinity column as described above. Purified GluR1 proteins (100 ng) were overlaid on a linear 20–80% (v/v) glycerol density gradient in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X and centrifuged for 16 h at 38,000 rpm (SW41Ti). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-penta-His antibody (Qiagen, Alameda, CA). Immunohistochemical Analysis—The cDNA encoding a HA tag was added to the 5′-end of the wild type and mutant GluR1 cDNAs; these sequences were added to the 3′-end of the signal sequence to create NT-HA-GluR1. The cDNAs encoding wild type or mutant NT-HA-GluR1 were cloned into a pTracer-EGFP and transfected into HEK 293 cells. Immunocytochemical analysis was carried out as described previously (22Wang Y. Matsuda S. Drews V. Torashima T. Meisler M.H. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Experiments—The cDNA encoding a thrombin cleavage site was added to the 3′-end of the LIVBP domain of NT-HA-GluR1wt to create NT-HA-GluR1thro. NT-HA-GluR1wt or NT-HA-GluR1thro was expressed in HEK 293 cells as described above. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and incubated with various concentrations (0–2 mm) of covalent cross-linker BS3 (Pierce). After quenching the reaction by adding 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, GluR1 proteins were immunoprecipitated as described previously (21Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and 5 units of thrombin (Sigma) were added to the precipitated fraction. After 12 h of incubation, thrombin was removed by p-aminobenzamidine-agarose (Sigma), and the supernatant was subjected to an immunoblot analysis using anti-HA antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA). Electrophysiology Studies—We used the calcium phosphate precipitation method to transfect each dish of HEK 293 cells with 4 μg of plasmid (dish diameter, 35 mm; Corning). 24–48 h after transfection, cells were transferred to a new dish coated with poly-l-lysine and incubated for at least 2 h before recordings were made. Cells or outside-out patch membranes were voltage-clamped at –40 mV by using Axo-patch 200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The piezo device-based method was used to apply drugs as described previously (23Kohda K. Wang Y. Yuzaki M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, results are shown as the means ± S.E. Substitution of the LIVBP Domain of GluR1 with Artificial Peptides—The LIVBP domain of iGluRs has sequence similarity with the corresponding region of metabotropic GluR1, which forms a 2-fold symmetric dimer (24Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). To confirm that the LIVBP domain of iGluRs also forms a dimer, we expressed the LIVBP domain of the GluR1 subunit by using an in vitro translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine and analyzed the product by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. The major peak migrated to a position representing ∼80 kDa, which is approximately twice the size of the monomeric LIVBP domain (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the isolated LIVBP domain of GluR1 dimerized in solution just like those of the GluR4 subunit (10Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and metabotropic GluR1 (25Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McIlhinney R.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To examine the function of the LIVBP domain of GluR1, we constructed vectors that express wild type GluR1 (GluR1wt) and GluR1ΔLIV. Then, we introduced artificial oligomerization peptides GCN4-LI, GCN4-II, and GCN4-IL into GluR1ΔLIV to produce tetramers (GluR1tet), trimers (GluR1tri), and dimers (GluR1di) (Fig. 1C). The leucine zipper-based GCN4-LI peptide forms extremely stable, parallel helices (Tm > 100 °C) arranged in a tetrameric conformation (26Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). By changing only a few amino acids, the mutants GCN4-II and GCN4-IL forms very stable trimers and dimmers, respectively (Fig. 1D) (26Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). In addition, we created pentamers (GluR1pent) by introducing the stable pentamer-forming coiled coil peptides, which are based on a cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (27Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses confirmed the normal expression of all mutant GluR1 subunits in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether mutant GluR1 subunits were expressed on the cell surface, we conducted immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing receptors whose N termini were attached to a HA tag. Cells were stained by an anti-HA antibody under non-permeabilizing conditions and subsequently by an anti-C-terminal GluR1 antibody under permeabilizing conditions. The fluorescence intensity of the HA staining, which corresponded to the surface receptors, was normalized by that of the GluR1 staining. We found that expression of GluR1ΔLIV, GluR1di, GluR1tri, or GluR1pent on the cell surface was at the same level as that of GluR1wt (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the deletion of whole LIVBP domain or replacement of the domain with artificial peptides had no effect on protein expression levels and cell surface transport of GluR1 subunits. Similar results are reported for GluR4 that completely lacked the LIVBP domain (28Pasternack A. Coleman S.K. Jouppila A. Mottershead D.G. Lindfors M. Pasternack M. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49662-49667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, partial deletions within the LIVBP domain inhibited the surface transport of GluR1 (29Xia H. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47765-47769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and GluR4 (28Pasternack A. Coleman S.K. Jouppila A. Mottershead D.G. Lindfors M. Pasternack M. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49662-49667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the LIVBP domain of iGluRs is not necessary for their cell surface expression; however, when the part of the domain is lost, the mutant iGluRs could be easily detected by quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum. Specific Restoration of Channel Function by a Tetramer-forming Peptide—To test the function of GluR1 mutants, we performed whole-cell patch clamp assays in HEK 293 cells by using the piezo device-based method of fast drug application (23Kohda K. Wang Y. Yuzaki M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although rapid application of glutamate (3 mm) to lifted cells expressing GluR1wt induced large, rapidly desensitizing currents, the application induced ∼5-fold smaller currents in cells expressing GluR1ΔLIV (Fig. 3, A and B). Of the artificial oligomerizing peptides introduced into GluR1ΔLIV, only the tetramer-forming peptide restored the channel function of GluR1wt (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding suggests that although all mutant GluR1s were transported to the cell surface, only the tetramer-forming peptide could effectively initiate the formation of functional channels. The reduction of glutamate-activated current amplitude in cells expressing various GluR1 mutants could be caused by changes in current kinetics, slowing of channel activation, or accelerated desensitization (30Rothberg B.S. Shin K.S. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, analyses of current kinetics in whole-cell recordings did not reveal any significant changes in these parameters (Fig. 3C). Because of small current amplitudes associated with mutant GluR1 channels, we studied the current kinetics of only GluR1tet in more detail in the outside-out patch configuration (described below). The distance between each subunit immediately after the LIVBP domain could have been different when the LIVBP domain was substituted with oligomerization peptides (Fig. 1D). Thus, it was possible that the reason why the tetramer-forming peptide restored the GluR1 channel function may not be directly related to its specific conformation (i.e. tetramer) but rather the intersubunit distance between the post-LIVBP domain regions. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a flexible linker (GSGGGSGGS, in a one-letter amino acid code) (31Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) near the C-terminal end of the dimer-forming peptide (GluR1di-link). Although glutamate-induced current was partially restored by the addition of the linker (Fig. 3B), it never reached the amplitude of GluR1tet or GluR1wt. We obtained similar results when a flexible linker was introduced near the C-terminal end of the trimer- or pentamer-forming peptide (GluR1tri-link and GluR1pent-link; Fig. 1D). Furthermore, a longer flexible linker (GSGGGSGGSGSGGGSGGS) inserted near the C-terminal end of the dimer-forming peptide (GluR1di-link x2) was no better than the shorter version in restoring channel function (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the inability of these oligomerization peptides to restore the channel function of GluR1 cannot be explained by the constraints introduced by these peptides. Control of Assembly Status by Artificial Oligomerization Peptides—To confirm that oligomerization peptides in the LIVBP domain control the assembly of GluR1, we examined the intermolecular interactions between each mutant subunit. Each mutant was individually tagged with HA or FLAG, and both were coexpressed in HEK 293 cells. The amount of FLAG-tagged GluR1ΔLIV receptors that coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged GluR1ΔLIV was approximately half that of FLAG-tagged GluR1wt that coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged GluR1wt (Fig. 4, A and B). This result was consistent with findings from the electrophysiological assay (Fig. 3) and supports the theory that the LIVBP domain plays a crucial role in the assembly of AMPA receptors (6Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Kuusinen A. Abele R. Madden D.R. Keinanen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28937-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The dimer-, trimer-, tetramer-, and pentamer-forming peptides rescued the reduced intermolecular interaction observed with GluR1ΔLIV (Fig. 4, A and B), although the channel function was rescued by only the tetramer-forming peptide. When FLAG-tagged GluR1 proteins were expressed alone, anti-HA antibody did not precipitate any GluR1 proteins (Fig. 4A, lower panel). This result confirms the specificity of the antibody and excludes the possibility of the precipitation of aggregated mutant receptors. It should be noted that residual intermolecular interactions among GluR1ΔLIV were observed (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine the level of nonspecific interaction in our coimmunoprecipitation assay, we examined the interaction between GluR1 and GluR6, which do not form functional heteromeric channels (6Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33Partin K.M. Patneau D.K. Winters C.A. Mayer M.L. Buonanno A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The quantitative analysis indicated that the interaction between GluR1ΔLIV is significantly higher than that between GluR1 and GluR6 (p < 0.05; Fig. 4B). This residual intermolecular interaction may also explain the rudimentary currents observed in cells expressing GluR1ΔLIV, GluR1tri, and GluR1pent (Fig. 3). Therefore, although the LIVBP domain plays an important role, other regions of iGluRs also contribute to subunit assembly. To examine whether the artificial peptides control subunit assembly in a specific stoichiometry, the native molecular weight of GluR1di and GluR1tet was determined by glycerol density centrifugation (Fig. 4C). A peak of GluR1di was observed between marker proteins albumin (66 kDa) and aldolase (160 kDa), whereas the peak of GluR1tet migrated to the position of catalase (230 kDa). Because the monomeric molecular mass is ∼60 kDa for both GluR1di and GluR1tet, we suggest that GluR1di predominantly exited as a dimer and GluR1tet as a tetramer under this condition. Therefore, oligomerization peptides in the LIVBP domain can control the GluR1 subunit assembly in a specific stoichiometry. Dominant Effect of Tetramer-forming Peptides on Channel Assembly—To assess whether the tetramer-forming peptide at the N-terminal domain of GluR1 can control the stoichiometry at the channel domain, we examined whether TM2 of GluR2 could participate in the channel formed by GluR1tet. When the channel domain contains one GluR2 subunit, which has an arginine (R) residue in the TM2, the channel shows a linear current-voltage (I-V) curve caused by the dominant effect of the arginine residue (34Verdoorn T.A. Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Science. 1991; 252: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Indeed, when GluR2 was coexpressed with GluR1wt (ratio of coexpression, 1:3), cells displayed a linear I-V relationship (Fig. 5A). However, cells cotransfected with GluR2 and GluR1tet at the same ratio displayed a rectifying I-V curve, which is typical of GluR1 homomeric channels (34Verdoorn T.A. Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Science. 1991; 252: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The rectification index, i.e. the ratio of current amplitudes at +40 mV and those at –60 mV, clearly indicated that GluR2 was not incorporated into the channel formed by GluR1tet (Fig. 5B). Formation of GluR1-GluR2 heteromeric channels was further examined by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Expression vectors fo"

Recently, the detailed chemical structure and the S-layer glycan biosynthesis (slg) gene cluster of Geobacillus stearothermophilus strain NRS 2004/3a have been published (3Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T.

These analyses support the general concept of a three-partite architecture of S-layer glycoproteins from organisms of the domain Bacteria. Usually, they are O-glycosidically linked to the S-layer polypeptide, and they possess relatively conserved core structures but extensive variations of the S-layer glycans, even within a given species (1Schäffer C. Messner P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Messner P. Schäffer C. Herz W. Falk H. Tamm C. Progress in the Chemistry of Organic Natural Products. Springer-Verlag, Wien, Germany2003: 51-124Google Scholar). The size distribution of S-layer glycans can vary from short heterosaccharides (5Christian R. Schulz G. Schuster-Kolbe J. Allmaier G. Schmid E.R. Sleytr U.B. Messner P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) up to chains with ∼50 repeat units (6Altman E. Brisson J.-R. Gagné S.M. Kolbe J. Messner P.

J. 2004; 20: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), S-layer glycan biosynthesis and LPS O-antigen biosynthesis may follow similar routes (10Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev.

These are in principle the Wzy (polymerase)-dependent and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent biosynthesis routes. Recently, nonreducing terminal modifications have been shown to determine the chain length of O-antigens of Escherichia coli (12Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35709-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Currently, the slg gene cluster of Geobacillus tepidamans GS5–97T is under investigation. 2S. Zayni, R. Novotny, P. Messner, and C. Schäffer, unpublished data. Preliminary results indicate that the formation of its S-layer glycan may involve enzyme activities comparable with those proposed for the biosynthesis pathway of the G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a S-layer glycan (4Novotny R. Schäffer C. Strauss J. Messner P. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A major difference, however, is the absence of O-methyl groups as capping elements at the nonreducing end of the S-layer glycan chains of G. tepidamans strain GS5–97T (this paper). Instead, (R)-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and GlcNAc, two major constituents of bacterial peptidoglycan (13van Heijenoort J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 25R-36RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been found. In this report, we describe the complete S-layer glycoprotein glycan structure of G. tepidamans strain GS5–97T and suggest that the MurNAc and GlcNAc peptidoglycan components are involved in chain length determination of S-layer glycans. Bacterial Strain and Growth Conditions—G. tepidamans GS5–97T (ATCC BAA-942T, DSM 16325T) was enriched from a sample of sugar beet extraction juice (obtained from Dr. F. Hollaus; Zuckerforschung Tulln GmbH, Tulln, Austria) (14Schäffer C. Franck W.L. Scheberl A. Kosma P. McDermott T.R. Messner P. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) upon cultivation in modified SVIII medium (SVIII/Glc, containing 0.5% glucose instead of sucrose) under increased aeration at 55 °C. For analysis of the S-layer glycoprotein, the organism was grown under steady-state conditions as described elsewhere (3Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Kählig H. Scheberl A. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6230-6239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was stored at –20 °C. Analytical and General Methods—Monosaccharide and amino acid analyses were performed according to published procedures (3Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Kählig H. Scheberl A. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol.

Wugeditsch T. Scheberl A. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Chemical deglycosylation of S-layer glycoprotein was performed by the method of Edge et al. (16Edge A.S. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining for protein and periodic acid-Schiff staining for carbohydrates was carried out as described previously (17Altman E. Schäffer C. Brisson J.-R. Messner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of glycoproteins and glycopeptides according to standard protocols (7Bock K. Schuster-Kolbe J.

Electron microscopy of thin-sectioned and freeze-etched preparations of bacterial cells as well as of negatively stained assembled S-layer glycoprotein was performed according to published procedures (18Messner P. Hollaus F. Sleytr U.B. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1984; 24: 202-210Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Isolation and Purification of S-layer Glycoprotein Species—The isolation of S-layer glycoprotein and the preparation of S-layer self-assembly products followed published methods (17Altman E. Schäffer C. Brisson J.-R. Messner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For separation of individual glycoprotein species, the S-layer glycoprotein (self-assembly products) was suspended at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue, incubated for 2 min at 100 °C, and pelleted. Separation of batches of 30 mg of S-layer glycoprotein by preparative SDS-PAGE with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 192 mm glycine and 0.1% SDS (running buffer), was performed over 21 h at a constant power of 50 watts at room temperature, using the Bio-Rad model 491 Prep Cell electrophoresis apparatus. The supernatant was loaded onto a gel tube (diameter = 38 mm) consisting of 10 ml of a 4% stacking gel (in 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8) and 60 ml of 6% resolving gel (in 325 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8). Elution was done with running buffer without SDS at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min; fractions of 8 ml were collected, and the total eluent volume was 1200 ml. Fractions were pooled according to the protein banding pattern on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels upon silver staining (19Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Individual pools were dialyzed at 4 °C against distilled water until salt-free and lyophilized. Preparation of S-layer Glycopeptides—S-layer glycopeptides were obtained after proteolytic degradation (20 h) of S-layer self-assembly products with V8 protease (Sigma). Purification of glycopeptides is described in detail elsewhere (20Schäffer C. Dietrich K. Unger B. Scheberl A. Rainey F.A. Kählig H. Messner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5482-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except that chromatofocusing was performed using a pH gradient between 8.5 and 5.5. The glycopeptide pools (designated CF I through CF VI) were desalted using Sephadex G-10 and finally purified by semi-preparative RP(C18)-HPLC (8Schäffer C. Müller N. Christian R. Graninger M. Wugeditsch T. Scheberl A. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HPAEC Analysis of MurNAc—To distinguish which isomer of MurNAc was present in the S-layer glycan, hydrolysates were analyzed by HPAEC according to Ref. 21Gunawardena S. Reddy G.P. Wang Y. Kolli V.S. Orlando R. Morris J.G. Bush C.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 309: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Briefly, ∼0.5 mg of S-layer glycopeptide preparations CF II and CF IV were hydrolyzed using 25%(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 4 h. The samples were analyzed on a PA-1 column (Dionex); elution was started isocratically in 16 mm NaOH, containing 2 mm sodium acetate (0–21 min), followed by a linear increase to 100 mm NaOH (21–27 min). Then in 100 mm NaOH, the sodium acetate concentration was raised linearly to 75 mm sodium acetate (27–32 min), before isocratic elution of muramic acid in 100 mm NaOH, containing 75 mm sodium acetate (32–59 min). Subsequently, the column was washed and equilibrated in 200 mm NaOH (59–65 min) and in 16 mm NaOH, containing 2 mm sodium acetate (65–80 min), respectively. For identification and verification of the peaks the sample was spiked with authentic (R)-N-acetylmuramic acid standard (Sigma). Mass Spectrometry—Positive mode electrospray Q-TOF mass spectrometry (ESI Q-TOF MS) was performed on a Waters Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global apparatus (Waters Micromass, Manchester, UK). For instrument tuning and calibration, the typical fragment ions of desialylated, dabsyl-labeled glycohexapeptide from bovine fibrin were used (22Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The sample was subjected to off-line infusion ESI Q-TOF MS after dilution in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.5% formic acid. Spectra acquisition was performed over an m/z range from 900 to 3000 Da using 3.1-kV capillary and 100-V cone voltage. Desolvation gas flow was set at 300 liters/h and cone gas at 50 liters/h. Sample was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The instrument was controlled by MassLynx 4.0 software (Waters Micromass, Manchester, UK). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX 600 NMR spectrometer at resonance frequencies of 600.13 MHz for 1H and 150.90 MHz for 13C (3Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Kählig H. Scheberl A. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6230-6239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For structural assignment ∼5 mg of purified glycopeptide CF II dissolved in 0.6 ml of D2O was used. All experiments were done at a temperature of 300.0 K, stabilized by a Bruker BCU05 cooling unit. Experiments included gradient selected double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy, TOCSY (10–120 ms MLEV-17 spin-lock), NOESY (150–300 ms mixing time including a bipolar purge gradient), gradient selected HSQC and HMBC (5 Hz typical long range coupling constant), gradient selected HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC-NOESY, and one-dimensional diffusion difference spectra. Detailed parameters for the used pulse sequences have been reported previously (20Schäffer C. Dietrich K. Unger B. Scheberl A. Rainey F.A. Kählig H. Messner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5482-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Schäffer C. Kählig H. Christian R. Schulz G. Zayni S. Messner P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1575-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the diffusion difference procedure was followed (24Kählig H. Dietrich K. Dorner S. Monatsh. Chem. 2002; 133: 589-598Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For analysis of the peptide and the amino sugar portion, most of the experiments were additionally performed on solutions in 0.6 ml of 90% H2O, 10% D2O using pulsed field gradients for coherence selection and 3-9-19 WATERGATE with magic angle gradients for solvent suppression as described previously (23Schäffer C. Kählig H. Christian R. Schulz G. Zayni S. Messner P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1575-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After running the spectral series in H2O, the sample was again lyophilized and re-dissolved in D2O. Processing was done off-line on Silicon Graphics workstations using the Bruker software XWIN-NMR 3.1. Detailed spectral analysis was accomplished with the NMR assignment and integration software Sparky 3 (provided by T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). The chemical shifts are average values from all assigned two-dimensional cross-peaks with standard deviations of 0.003 ppm for 1H and 0.015 ppm for 13C. The proton-proton coupling constants were extracted from experimental or calculated (program XSIM 971120, provided by K. Marat, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) 1H NMR spectra. 1H-13C coupling constants were taken from appropriate slices of coupled two-dimensional HSQC spectra. General Description of the Organism—Electron microscopy of freeze-etched cells of G. tepidamans GS5–97T revealed that the bacterium is completely covered with an oblique S-layer glycoprotein lattice. The recently determined lattice parameters (a = 11.2 nm, b = 7.9 nm, γ ∼ 80°) were confirmed in that culture (14Schäffer C. Franck W.L. Scheberl A. Kosma P. McDermott T.R. Messner P. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The overall degree of glycosylation of the S-layer protein is ∼8.5% (w/w). On SDS-PAGE gels, the S-layer glycoprotein showed a four-banded protein staining pattern, with the individual bands corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 106, 123, 140, and 166 kDa. The three high molecular mass bands, but not the 106-kDa band, gave an intensive periodic acid-Schiff staining reaction on the gel. Upon chemical deglycosylation of the S-layer glycoprotein, a single band corresponding to the 106-kDa band remained visible on the gel, indicating that this band represents the nonglycosylated protomeric unit of the S-layer glycoprotein lattice of G. tepidamans GS5–97T. Characterization of S-layer Glycoprotein Species—Starting with ∼350 g (wet pellet) of biomass of G. tepidamans GS5–97T, ∼500 mg (dry weight) of S-layer glycoprotein was obtained. Negative staining of the self-assembly products formed upon dialysis of the guanidinium hydrochloride-extracted S-layer glycoprotein revealed predominantly open-ended cylinders of glycoprotein monolayers, with an average diameter of 200 nm and an average length of 1.6 μm. 60 mg of that material was used for purification of the nonglycosylated S-layer species GPS I and the three glycosylated forms GPS II through GPS IV by preparative electrophoresis. The obtained yields were 2.1 (GPS I), 5.0 (GPS II), 12.3 (GPS III), and 22.9 mg (GPS IV). N-terminal sequencing revealed identical N termini with the sequence ATNVDAVVN on the individual S-layer species. Concerning the S-layer glycan portion, GPS II, GPS III, and GPS IV revealed Rha and Fuc in an approximate molar ratio of 1:1 as major carbohydrate constituents. For characterization of the S-layer glycoprotein, from the proteolytic degradation mixture of 1 g (dry weight) of S-layer self-assembly products, six crude glycopeptide pools, designated CF I through CF VI, were obtained after chromatofocusing. Yields of glycopeptides were 1.6 mg for CF I (pH range of elution 8.9–8.3), 9.8 mg for CF II (pH range 8.1–7.9), 10.4 mg for CF III (pH range 7.8–7.6), 5.3 mg for CF IV (pH range 7.2–7.0), 8.9 mg for CF V (pH range 6.9–6.8), and 1.7 mg for CF VI (pH range 6.7–6.0). After desalting and final purification by RP(C18)-HPLC, the CF pools were analyzed by HPAEC/PAD for their carbohydrate composition, indicating rhamnose and fucose as major components in addition to minor amounts of galactose, GlcNAc, and N-acetylmuramic acid in each pool. Based on amino acid analysis and initial NMR measurements, CF II and CF IV were selected for detailed investigations. Compositional data of these samples were Fuc:Rha:Gal:GlcNAc:Asx:Ser:MurNAc:Ala = 17:21:0.8:0.8:0.8:1:0.8:1 for CF II and Fuc:Rha:Gal:GlcNAc:Thr:MurNAc:Glx = 16.5:20:0.9:0.9:1:1:0.9:0.9 for CF IV. (The putative linkage amino acids are underlined.) Setting the putative linkage amino acid Ser (CF II) and Thr (CF IV), respectively, to the value of 1 indicated identical carbohydrate composition of the two glycopeptides. The finding of MurNAc and GlcNAc in molar ratio of 1:1 in both preparations was initially interpreted as a contamination of these S-layer glycopeptide preparations with peptidoglycan. Repeated RP-HPLC purification, however, did not result in removal of these components. Optical rotation measurement gave a value of [α]D20 +65° (c 0.5, H2O) for CF II. Analysis of possible isoforms of N-acetylmuramic acid in glycopeptides CF II and CF IV indicated that, even after spiking with authentic standard, only one peak appeared on the HPAEC (41.6 min), confirming the exclusive presence of (R)-N-acetylmuramic acid in the S-layer glycopeptides. NMR Studies—Structural investigations by NMR spectroscopy were performed on a sample of 5.3 mg of purified CF II. In the 1H NMR spectrum, two intense signals were observed in the anomeric region (Fig. 1, δ = 5.143 and 4.995) as well as two intense aliphatic CH3 groups (δ = 1.312 and 1.195) suggesting two deoxy sugars for the repeating unit. Detailed analysis of these spin systems revealed a rhamnose (sugar E; for the indication of the residues see Fig. 2) and a fucose (sugar F) residue, both as pyranosyl units, and according to the measured coupling constants for the anomeric signals (Table I, 3JH,H = 1.0 and 3.7 Hz and 1JH,C = 170.0 and 169.7 Hz) both in α-configuration. In two-dimensional HMBC spectra, cross-peaks via the glycosidic bonds (Fig. 2 and Table II) proved a 1→3 linkage from Rhap to Fucp and a 1→2 linkage from Fucp to Rhap. Regarding the absolute stereochemistry of the two sugar units, the observed glycosylation effects on the 13C chemical shifts of the anomeric carbons (Table III) clearly required a consecutive change between the d- and the l-series of the two moieties. In addition, the measured optical rotation of +65° resulted in a calculated molar rotation of +189° for the glycopeptide preparation, which fits to the calculated value of +232° for the molar rotation of an l-Rhap-d-Fucp polysaccharide (due to the strong levorotation of l-Fuc, an inverse assignment would lead to a pronounced negative value for the optical rotation). Consequently, the repeating unit of the S-layer glycan possesses the structure [→2)-α-l-Rhap-(1→3)-α-d-Fucp-(1→]n. As derived from NMR integration, the average number (n) of repeating units of the mature glycan chain is about 20. To our knowledge, this is the first report on an S-layer glycoprotein glycan containing α-d-Fuc residues.Fig. 2HMBC spectrum of glycopeptide CF II showing the glycosidic linkages between the sugar residues (A–F, see Table I and Fig. 5) and from GalpJ to the serine K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I1H and 13C NMR chemical shift data (in ppm) of the S-layer glycopeptide CF IICarbohydrate signals2-N-Acetyl3-O-Lactyl123456COCH3NHCOCHCH3A, β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→I 4.544 (7.9)3.7233.7723.5073.3703.895/3.7772.041103.34 (162.2)56.8573.5070.3876.8661.35174.9123.42IIaThe chemical shift data set II was measured in a solution of 90% H2O, 10% D2O. 4.5043.7693.7713.5143.3652.0397.949 (8.4)IIIbThe chemical shift data set III derive from the sample after re-exchange the solvent from H2O back to D2O. 4.4923.7783.7723.5193.3663.898/3.7812.037103.8556.6173.4970.2576.7961.3023.33B, α-d-MurNAc-(1→I 5.271 (3.1)3.657 (3.1/10.6)3.7643.7443.9433.835/3.7192.1294.628 (7.2)1.443 (7.2)98.33 (170.5)55.2177.5673.2060.34174.8023.55182.1978.9419.43II 5.2803.6783.7603.94610.046 (3.3)4.6201.436III 5.2923.5983.7673.7433.9423.839/3.7022.1354.6131.43198.3555.2177.2060.2879.4419.54C,→2,3)-α-l-Rhap-(1→I 5.119 (1.4)4.0903.8333.3423.7541.272102.09 (173.8)77.5480.1171.9671.1117.44III 5.1174.0453.8133.3163.7451.267102.0477.9380.4671.6971.0017.30D,→3)-α-d-Fucp-(1→I 4.9773.8773.9883.9241.19498.6668.0777.90III 4.9813.8673.9891.186E,→2)-α-l-Rhap-(1→I 5.143 (1.0)4.065 (1.0/3.1)3.975 (3.1/9.7)3.554 (9.7/9.6)3.862 (9.6/6.1)1.312 (6.1)100.55 (170.0)77.02 (150.5)70.25 (145.1)72.63 (145.3)70.24 (143.0)17.33 (128.4)F,→3)-α-d-Fucp-(1→I 4.995 (3.7)3.891 (3.7/10.7)4.018 (10.7/2.0)3.919 (2.0/1.5)4.417 (1.5/6.5)1.195 (6.5)98.67 (169.7)67.92 (147.8)78.58 (142.5)72.60 (147.3)67.91 (142.2)15.94 (128.3)G,→2)-α-l-Rhap-(1→I 5.1654.0673.9731.322100.61 (170.1)77.0370.24H,→3)-α-l-Rhap-(1→I 5.0374.1803.9443.5613.7541.307103.08 (171.4)70.7379.4370.13I, →3)-α-l-Rhap-(1→I 5.0264.1713.9083.5763.8381.294103.05 (171.4)70.6379.0772.0570.1017.26J, →3)-β-d-Galp-(1→I 4.533 (7.2)3.7243.7334.0243.7443.795/3.758103.23 (161.1)70.7381.0169.1976.3161.78III 4.546 103.023.7193.746Amino acid signalsαββ′γNHaThe chemical shift data set II was measured in a solution of 90% H2O, 10% D2O.COK, →O)-l-Ser-I4.343 (6.8/4.2)4.279 (11.1/6.8)4.172 (11.1/4.2)53.8468.09167.48II4.3374.192III4.335 (7.2/4.6)4.251 (11.3/7.2)4.193 (11.3/4.6)53.8467.91L, -l-Ala-I4.401 (7.3)1.428 (7.3)50.8417.27174.93II4.4111.4288.714 (5.9)III4.412 (7.1)1.427 (7.1)50.6917.22M, -l-AsxI4.7072.95150.5136.69175.59cThe assignments are interchangeable.174.47cThe assignments are interchangeable.II4.6272.8988.210 (7.9)III4.508 (4.9/7.2)2.840 (16.2/4.9)2.777 (16.2/7.2)52.2738.35a The chemical shift data set II was measured in a solution of 90% H2O, 10% D2O.b The chemical shift data set III derive from the sample after re-exchange the solvent from H2O back to D2O.c The assignments are interchangeable.

During in vitro reactions, the phage-encoded gp59 stimulates loading of the replicative helicase, gp41, onto branched intermediates, including origin R-loops. However, although gp59 is essential for recombination-dependent replication from D-loops, it does not appear to be required for origin-dependent replication in vivo. In this study, we have analyzed the origin-replicative intermediates formed during infections that are deficient in gp59 and other phage replication proteins. During infections lacking gp59, the initial replication forks from two different T4 origins actively replicated both leading- and lagging-strands. However, the retrograde replication forks from both origins were abnormal in the gp59-deficient infections. The lagging-strand from the initial fork was elongated as a new leading-strand in the retrograde direction without lagging-strand synthesis, whereas in the wild-type, leading- and lagging-strand synthesis appeared to be coupled. These results imply that gp59 inhibits the polymerase holoenzyme in vivo until the helicase-primase (gp41-gp61) complex is loaded, and we thereby refer to gp59 as a gatekeeper. We also found that all origin-replicative intermediates were absent in infections deficient in the helicase gp41 or the single-strand-binding protein gp32, regardless of whether gp59 was present or absent. These results argue that replication from the origin in vivo is dependent on both the helicase and single-strand-binding protein and demonstrate that the strong replication defect of gene 41 and 32 single mutants is not caused by gp59 inhibition of the polymerase.

The initiation of DNA replication at origin sequences generally involves localized unwinding within an AT-rich region of the origin, promoted by either an initiator protein or an origin transcript (for review, see Ref. 1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). The unwound region provides an assembly site for the replication apparatus, beginning with the replicative helicase that is responsible for more extensive unwinding of the parental strands. In the well studied Escherichia coli system, DnaA binds to specific sequences within the origin of replication, oriC, and promotes localized unwinding of the DNA and recruitment of the replicative helicase, DnaB. DnaB catalyzes further unwinding of the region, and DnaG primase then synthesizes RNA primers for both leading- and lagging-strand synthesis (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). In the ColE1 replicon of certain plasmids and also in mitochondrial DNA, RNA polymerase generates an origin transcript that forms a persistent R-loop. The origin R-loop thereby provides an unwound region that serves as assembly site for the replicative helicase, in addition to providing the primer for leading-strand synthesis (2Kues U. Stahl U. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 491-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee D.G. Clayton D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T4 uses two major replication initiation mechanisms that are regulated to occur during certain phases of the infective cycle (5Luder A. Mosig G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Kreuzer K.N. Morrical S.W. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

At early times, origin-dependent replication proceeds from several origins, including the well characterized ori(uvsY) and ori(34) (8Kreuzer K.N. Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Kreuzer K.N. Engman H.W. Yap W.Y. J. Biol.

Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of both origins consists of a promoter just upstream of a DNA unwinding element (Fig. 1B, top). In vivo studies measuring permanganate hypersensitivity demonstrated that the origin transcript forms a persistent R-loop within the DNA unwinding element, supporting an R-loop initiation mechanism (12Carles-Kinch K. Kreuzer K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As the T4 infection progresses, origin-dependent replication is repressed and recombination-dependent replication predominates. Recombination-dependent replication is dependent upon T4 recombination proteins and involves initiation from D-loops formed by strand invasion (13Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 6Kreuzer K.N. Morrical S.W. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 28-42Google Scholar). T4 recombination-dependent replication overcomes the problem of replicating the ends of the infecting linear T4 DNA, which are left partially single-stranded after origin-dependent replication. Because T4 DNA ends are terminally redundant and circularly permuted, these unreplicated 3′-ends can undergo strand invasion into a homologous internal region of another molecule or the opposite end of the same molecule. Strand invasion results in the formation of a D-loop with a displaced single strand that serves as an assembly site for the replication machinery. As with the R-loop mechanism described above, the invading 3′-end (DNA, in this case) serves as a primer for leading-strand synthesis (5Luder A. Mosig G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Kreuzer K.N. Morrical S.W. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

We have previously analyzed the mechanism of T4 origin firing in vivo using neutral-neutral (N/N) 1The abbreviations used are: N/N, neutral-neutral; N/A, neutral-alkaline. two-dimensional gel analyses. In this technique, restriction fragments are separated on the basis of mass in the first dimension and mass and shape in the second dimension (14Brewer B. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Branched DNA molecules thereby migrate more slowly than linear DNA molecules in the second dimension. Families of Y-shaped and θ-form replicative intermediates form distinctive arc patterns that deviate from the diagonal of linear DNA molecules. A restriction fragment containing the T4 chromosomal ori(uvsY) resulted in a novel arc referred to as the comet arc, rather than the characteristic bubble arc that is generally seen with replication origins (15Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The replicative intermediates that comprise the comet arc consist of Y-molecules with the branch points within the origin transcription unit. The structure of these molecules provides strong evidence that the RNA within the origin R-loop is used to prime leading-strand synthesis in vivo (15Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The heaviest region of the comet, referred to as the comet nucleus, contains intermediates with branch points very near the 5′-end of the transcript. The intermediates within the comet arc result from the delay between the initiation of the two different replication forks during the two-stage bidirectional replication pathway; these are molecules in which only the first fork has initiated and already exited the restriction fragment (see Fig. 1B). Why do some molecules have a branch point downstream of the transcription start site? We infer that the 5′-end of the RNA is processed to varying extents in these molecules and the parental DNA strands rewind as the RNA is degraded, prior to synthesis of the first Okazaki fragment. This would generate Y-shaped molecules with branch points throughout the transcription unit, i.e. the molecules within the comet tail (see Fig. 1B). Evidence supporting this model includes the formation of a comet with only a nucleus in DNA isolated from an RNaseH-deficient infection or from a mutant origin with a very short origin transcript (15Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies with a circular synthetic R-loop substrate confirmed that the T4 replication machinery efficiently uses R-loops to initiate replication (16Nossal N.G. Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Unit-length nascent leading-strands and Okazaki fragments were synthesized in the presence of the T4 DNA polymerase (gp43), clamp and clamp loader (gp45 and gp44/62), replicative helicase (gp41), helicase loader (gp59), primase (gp61), single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32), and topoisomerase (gp39/52/60). The further addition of T4 RNaseH and DNA ligase allowed generation of completely intact replicated products. In reactions using a synthetic R-loop comprised of a radiolabeled transcript in the absence of RNaseH, the unit-length products were radiolabeled, demonstrating that the origin transcript served as the primer for leading-strand synthesis (16Nossal N.G. Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These in vivo and in vitro results argue that T4 initiates bidirectional replication in a two-step process. In the initial replication fork, the origin transcript is used to prime leading-strand synthesis, and in the delayed retrograde replication fork, the 3′-end of the first Okazaki fragment from the initial fork is presumably used as primer for leading-strand synthesis. In the in vitro system, the leftward fork was not detected. In this case, the initial replication fork travels around the relatively small (5.7-kb) circular substrate rapidly, leaving only a short window of time that is apparently insufficient for assembly of the retrograde fork. The loading of the replicative helicase is presumably quite different for the initial and retrograde replication forks. The displaced strand of the R-loop provides an attractive target for loading the helicase on the initial fork. However, a single-stranded region presumably must be generated near the branch point to allow loading of the helicase for the retrograde replication fork, and this could explain the delay in the retrograde fork. Another key factor in helicase loading is the phage-encoded gp59 protein (17Barry J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 9: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18Morrical S.W.

The gp59-mediated assembly of gp41 onto gp32-coated single-stranded DNA most likely involves a ternary complex between these three proteins (23Ma Y. Wang T. Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Morrical S.W.

Recent in vitro studies indicate that gp59 travels with the replication fork, perhaps playing a role in the coupling of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis (30Ishmael F.T.

As judged by in vivo plasmid model systems, gp59 is essential for the process of recombination-dependent replication but dispensable for origin-dependent replication (9Kreuzer K.N. Engman H.W. Yap W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11348-11357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kreuzer K.N. Yap W.Y. Menkens A.E. Engman H.W. J. Biol.

In addition, gp59-deficient mutants replicate some phage chromosomal DNA early, implying successful origin-dependent replication (34Wu R. Ma F.-J. Yeh Y.-C.

In this report, we have found that chromosomal origin replication does indeed occur in gp59-deficient infections; however, the mechanism of initiation in the absence of gp59 is altered. In particular, the leading-strand for the retrograde replication fork is significantly extended without lagging-strand synthesis, arguing that gp59 normally holds the polymerase in check until the replicative helicase is loaded. These in vivo results are consistent with recent in vitro results that revealed an inhibitory effect of gp59 on T4 DNA polymerase (see “Discussion”). Materials—Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Taq DNA polymerase from Invitrogen, radiolabeled nucleotides from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Nytran membranes from Schleicher & Schuell. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Luria broth contained bacto-tryptone (Difco Laboratories) at 10 g/liter, yeast extract (Difco Laboratories) at 5 g/liter, and NaCl at 10 g/liter. E. coli and Bacteriophage T4 Strains—E. coli strains include CR63 (K12, supD λr) (38Edgar R. Denhardt G. Epstein R.

Bacteriophage T4 strains included K10 (amB262 (gene 38) amS29 (gene 51) nd28 (denA) rIIPT8 (denB-rII deletion)), which is considered as the wild-type for these studies, K10-59am (as K10, with gene 59 amber mutation amHL628) (9Kreuzer K.N.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6960-6968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). K10-59am 41am and K10-59am 32am were generated by crossing the appropriate single mutant K10 strains and identifying the double mutant progeny. K10-59am-GC was created by crossing K10-GC (15Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with K10-59am and identifying the double mutant progeny. T4 strain KD1 was constructed using the T4 insertion/substitution system (40Selick H.E. Kreuzer K.N. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11336-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kreuzer K.N. Selick H.E. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 452-454Google Scholar). Briefly, triple overlapping SwaI restriction sites were inserted into the phage genome within the intergenic region between gene 34 and rnh (map position 150773, all map positions in this report are from the T4 genome data base 3/2003 release; insert sequence 5′-TTTAAATTTAAATTTAAAT-3′ oriented counterclockwise with respect to the T4 map). Triple overlapping sites were used to facilitate complete digestion of T4-modified DNA for the two-dimensional gel analyses. After the recombination steps of the insertion/substitution system (40Selick H.E. Kreuzer K.N. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11336-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kreuzer K.N. Selick H.E. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 452-454Google Scholar), a phage strain containing the SwaI insert in its chromosome was identified by PCR followed by SwaI restriction analysis and was verified by DNA sequencing. Phage strain KD1-59am was constructed by crossing phage strains KD1 and K10-59am and identifying the double mutant (SwaI insert and 59am) progeny. Two-dimensional Neutral-Neutral Agarose Gel Analyses—E. coli AB1 cells were grown in Luria broth to an A560 of 0.5 (∼4 × 108 cells/ml) at 37 °C and then infected with the appropriate phage at a multiplicity of 6 plaque-forming units/cell. At the indicated time points, 1.5-ml aliquots were removed, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and frozen quickly in dry ice/ethanol bath, and total nucleic acids were cross-linked with 5-methyl-psoralen (trioxsalen) and purified as previously described (42Belanger K.G. Mirzayan C. Kreuzer H.E. Alberts B.M. Kreuzer K.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The first dimension of the N/N two-dimensional gels was run in 0.5× TBE buffer (1× = 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm Na3EDTA) at 1 V/cm for 29 h. The second-dimension gel contained ethidium bromide at 0.3 μg/ml; electrophoresis was at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer containing ethidium bromide (0.3 μg/ml) at 4.5 V/cm for 16 h (with buffer recirculation). Gels were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with a probe prepared using the Random Primed kit (Roche Applied Science). Southern blots were visualized by exposures to x-ray film. For the PacI-SwaI digests of ori(uvsY) (4.5-kb fragment), DNA samples were digested with PacI for 12–14 h at 37 °C, followed by an additional 12–14-h digestion at 25 °C with SwaI. The first-dimension gel contained 0.4% agarose, and the second-dimension gel contained 1% agarose. The probe consisted of a radioactive 1.4-kb HindIII T4 DNA fragment corresponding to T4 map coordinates 114,420–115,771 bp. For the PsiI digest of ori(uvsY) (2.1-kb fragment), DNA samples were digested with PsiI for 12–14 h at 37 °C. The first-dimension gel contained 0.6% agarose, and the second-dimension gel contained 1.2% agarose. The probe consisted of a radioactive 0.815-kb PCR fragment corresponding to T4 map coordinates 115,004–115,819 bp. For the SwaI digest of ori(34) (5.4-kb fragment), DNA samples were digested with SwaI for 12–14 h at 25 °C. The first-dimension gel contained 0.4% agarose, and the second-dimension gel contained 1% agarose. The probe consisted of a radioactive 2.2-kb PCR fragment corresponding to T4 map coordinates 150,782–152,975 bp. Two-dimensional Neutral-Alkaline Agarose Gel Analyses—The conditions for the first-dimension (neutral) gel are as described above for the PacI-SwaI ori(uvsY) N/N agarose gel. The appropriate gel slice was soaked in 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm Na3EDTA at room temperature for 15 min twice with shaking. The second-dimension gel contained 1% agarose and was run at 4 °C in 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm Na3EDTA at ∼1 V/cm for 42 h with recirculation. Gels were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using radioactive RNA transcripts (see below) as probe. After analysis of the nascent leading-strand, the probe was removed from the blot and the blot reprobed with an RNA transcript that hybridizes to the nascent lagging-strand. The Southern blots were analyzed by exposure to a Phosphorimager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of RNA Probes—The template for in vitro transcription reactions consisted of a PCR product from ori(uvsY) DNA (position +462 to +1004, with respect to the ori(uvsY) promoter transcription) (10Menkens A.E. Kreuzer K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11358-11365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a T7 promoter at one end and an SP6 promoter at the other. Transcription from the T7 promoter generated an RNA transcript that hybridized to the nascent leading-strand, whereas the transcript generated from the SP6 promoter hybridized to the nascent lagging-strand. PCR reactions used T4 DNA as the template. The transcript was labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]UTP residues, using the MAXIscript SP6/T7 kit (Ambion Co.). Replication from ori(uvsY) Occurs in the Absence of gp59 —A major function of gp59 in vitro is the efficient loading of gp41, but previous in vivo experiments indicated that gp59 is not required for origin-dependent replication (see the Introduction). We therefore began by determining whether origin-replicative intermediates are formed during a gene 59 amber mutant infection of a non-suppressing E. coli strain (an rpsL mutation was included to reduce the leakiness of an amber mutation; see Refs. 44George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 43Karam J.D. O'Donnell P.V. J. Virol. 1973; 11: 933-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using N/N two-dimensional gel analyses, replicative intermediates were indeed detected on ori(uvsY)-containing restriction fragments generated from the gp59-deficient infection (Fig. 2B). The intermediates migrated along the simple Y-arc and were similar, but not identical, to those in the comet arc from the wild-type infection (compare Fig. 2A and 2B). As a control, we also analyzed DNA isolated from a gene 41 amber mutant infection, deficient in the replicative helicase. In this case, only the diagonal line of linear DNA was detected, with no significant accumulation of replicative intermediates (Fig. 2C). Therefore, replication can initiate from ori(uvsY) in the absence of the helicase loader gp59, but not in the absence of the replicative helicase gp41. The initiation of replication in the absence of gp59 strongly suggests that gp41 can be loaded at the origin without gp59. However, an alternate interpretation is that gp41 is not required for origin replication and that gp59 inhibits gp41-independent replication; this possibility is explored below. The replicative intermediates detected during a time course of wild-type and gp59-deficient infections were distinct. In both cases, the branched replicative intermediates were present at the early 4-min time point, reduced at the 6-min time point, and absent at the 8-min time point (Fig. 2, A and B). We have previously found that the UvsW helicase, which is expressed as a late protein, is responsible for turning origin replication off at this time by unwinding the R-loop intermediate (45Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the comets produced by the 59 mutant and wild-type were quite similar at the 4-min time point, there was a definite lengthening of the comet beyond the apex of the simple Y-arc in the 59 mutant infection. This trend was much more pronounced with the 6-min sample, where a large fraction of the intermediates from the 59 mutant infection were near the apex. We conclude that the replicative intermediates formed in the absence of gp59 are structurally unique. The branch points of the wild-type ori(uvsY) intermediates in the comet nucleus are very near the origin promoter (see the Introduction). Therefore, molecules in the extended comet of the 59 mutant infection presumably have branch points upstream of the origin promoter, suggesting that retrograde replication had occurred in some of these replicative intermediates. Replication in the Absence of gp59 Is Origin-dependent—An alternative explanation of the extended comet is that replication forks initiated from outside the restriction fragment get blocked or stalled upstream of ori(uvsY) in the 59 mutant. To distinguish between these models, we examined DNA from a 59 mutant phage that also carried a GC-rich insertion mutation in ori(uvsY). This GC-rich insertion abolishes replication from ori(uvsY) but does not affect transcription from the origin promoter (15Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, there were no detectable replicative intermediates in the double mutant phage infection, providing strong evidence that the intermediates in the extended comet from gp59-deficient infections originate from an active ori(uvsY). The 59 Mutant Produces Extended Comets at Another T4 Replication Origin—Another well characterized T4 replication origin is ori(34), which, like ori(uvsY), consists of a promoter just upstream of a DNA unwinding element.

https://openalex.org/W2141383025,"Most prokaryotes require Asp-tRNAAsn for the synthesis of Asn-tRNAAsn. This misacylated tRNA species is synthesized by a non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) that acylates both tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn with aspartate. In contrast, a discriminating AspRS forms only Asp-tRNAAsp. Here we show that a conserved proline (position 77) in the L1 loop of the non-discriminating Deinococcus radiodurans AspRS2 is required for tRNAAsn recognition in vivo. Escherichia coli trpA34 was transformed with DNA from a library of D. radiodurans aspS2 genes with a randomized codon 77 and then subjected to in vivo selection for Asp-tRNAAsn formation by growth in minimal medium. Only proline codons were found at position 77 in the aspS2 genes isolated from 21 of the resulting viable colonies. However, when the aspS temperature-sensitive E. coli strain CS89 was transformed with the same DNA library and then screened for Asp-tRNAAsp formation in vivo by growth at the non-permissive temperature, codons for seven other amino acids besides proline were identified at position 77 in the isolates examined. Thus, replacement of proline 77 by cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, serine, or valine resulted in mutant D. radiodurans AspRS2 enzymes still capable of forming Asp-tRNAAsp but unable to recognize tRNAAsn. This strongly suggests that proline 77 is responsible for the non-discriminatory tRNA recognition properties of this enzyme. Most prokaryotes require Asp-tRNAAsn for the synthesis of Asn-tRNAAsn. This misacylated tRNA species is synthesized by a non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) that acylates both tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn with aspartate. In contrast, a discriminating AspRS forms only Asp-tRNAAsp.

This strongly suggests that proline 77 is responsible for the non-discriminatory tRNA recognition properties of this enzyme. Accurate aminoacyl-tRNA formation, the basis for error-free protein synthesis, is achieved by the exquisite substrate specificity of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). For better quality control, many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have also developed editing mechanisms to hydrolyze the potentially harmful misaminoacylated tRNAs (2Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gingras L. Translation Mechanisms. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2004: 34-64Google Scholar, 3Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M.

Cell. 2004; 16: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One surprising result of the analysis of the many microbial genomes is the discovery of the extensive use of Asp-tRNAAsn and Glu-tRNAGln for the biosynthesis of Asn-tRNAAsn and Gln-tRNAGln (6Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Min B. Namgoong S. Salazar J. Orellana O. Söll D. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2004: 314-319Google Scholar). For example, Asp-tRNAAsn is required for Asn-tRNAAsn formation in most bacteria and archaea because of the lack of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase in these organisms. This misacylated aminoacyl-tRNA is formed by a synthetase with relaxed tRNA specificity, the non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-AspRS). 1The abbreviations used are: AspRS, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; ND-AspRS, non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; D-AspRS, discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. 1The abbreviations used are: AspRS, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; ND-AspRS, non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase; D-AspRS, discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme, unlike the discriminating AspRS (D-AspRS) that forms only Asp-tRNAAsp, does not discriminate tRNAAsn from tRNAAsp and therefore synthesizes Asp-tRNAAsn in addition to Asp-tRNAAsp (7Becker H.D. Kern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12832-12837Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Deinococcus radiodurans is among a small number of organisms that have two AspRSs, a discriminating AspRS1 and the non-discriminating AspRS2 (8Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread presence of ND-AspRS enzymes in the microbial world (6Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Min B. Namgoong S. Salazar J. Orellana O. Söll D. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2004: 314-319Google Scholar), our understanding of tRNA selection by ND-AspRS is still fragmentary. Although the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus ND-AspRS is known (9Charron C. Roy H. Blaise M. Giegé R. Kern D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the lack of a tRNA-bound AspRS structure limits our ability to understand the tRNA specificity of the enzyme. Moreover, the absence of any tRNAAsn structure, either free or complexed with an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, complicates the attempts to model the interaction of tRNAAsn and AspRS. The discriminating and non-discriminating forms of the archaeal-type AspRS (e.g. Thermococcus kodakaraensis AspRS and D. radiodurans AspRS2) (10Tumbula-Hansen D. Feng L. Toogood H. Stetter K.O. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37184-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) are highly similar and differ systematically only at two amino acid positions (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both positions, one in the β1 strand and one in the L1 loop, are located in the N-terminal domain responsible for tRNA anticodon recognition by the enzyme (Fig. 1). Although histidine (position 28 in D. radiodurans AspRS2) and proline (position 77 in D. radiodurans AspRS2) are conserved at these positions in ND-AspRSs, glutamine/tryptophan and lysine are found in the corresponding positions in D-AspRS enzymes (Fig. 1). A single amino acid change was sufficient to convert the T. kodakaraensis D-AspRS to a non-discriminating enzyme by introducing the W26H and K85P mutations into the discriminating T. kodakaraensis AspRS individually or in combination (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A structure-based model points to a direct interaction between Lys-85 in the L1 loop of the enzyme and C36 of tRNAAsp (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This anticodon nucleotide (C36 in tRNAAsp or U36 in tRNAAsn) is a key identity element that differentiates tRNAAsp from tRNAAsn (12Pütz J. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Giegé R. Science. 1991; 252: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Becker H.D. Giegé R. Kern D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7447-7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mischarging of tRNAAsn was also achieved by replacing the entire L1 loop of the discriminating T. kodakaraensis AspRS with that of the non-discriminating T. thermophilus enzyme (9Charron C. Roy H. Blaise M. Giegé R. Kern D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a similar strategy, substitution of the Escherichia coli lysyl-tRNA synthetase L1 loop with that of E. coli AspRS enabled the former to mischarge tRNAAsp (14Brevet A. Chen J. Commans S. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30927-30935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The examples above are based on an expansion the tRNA specificity of a discriminating enzyme and tested by in vitro experiments. We wondered how the tRNA recognition of a non-discriminating AspRS could be limited to tRNAAsp and whether this could be confirmed in vivo. Therefore we tested the necessity of Pro-77 and His-28 on tRNAAsx (tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn) recognition by D. radiodurans AspRS2 in vivo and in vitro. The importance of the conserved Pro-77 was further analyzed by random mutagenesis of codon 77 of D. radiodurans aspS2 (gene encoding AspRS2) followed by in vivo selection. Expression of D. radiodurans AspRSs in E. coli—Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Mutant D. radiodurans aspS2 genes (8Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were generated by overlap extension PCR. For in vivo analyses, each gene was inserted into pCBS200 between NdeI and BglII to yield pCBSDRaspS2 constructs. The pCBS200 vector was kindly provided by Tong Li (Yale University) and is a derivative of pCBS1 (15Li T. Graham D.E. Stathopoulos C. Haney P.J. Kim H.S. Vothknecht U. Kitabatake M. Hong K.W. Eggertsson G. Curnow A.W. Lin W. Celic I. Whitman W. Söll D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This low copy vector confers ampicillin resistance and allows expression from the constitutive trpS promoter. The vector pCBS200 additionally contains the polylinker NdeI-MscI-NcoI-KpnI-SmaI-XhoI-XbaI-BglII. To obtain purified protein, the mutant aspS2 genes were also cloned as an intein fusion construct into pTYB11 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) between SapI and EcoRI. The untagged enzymes were recovered by cleavage of the purified fusion proteins on a chitin-agarose column (New England Biolabs). AspRS mutations were verified by sequencing of plasmid minipreparations obtained from the same cultures used for AspRS purification. All enzymes were >95% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In Vivo Complementation—Electrocompetent trpA34 or CS89 cells were transformed with pCBS200 vectors, and single colonies were isolated and grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. For complementation of trpA34, equal amounts of cells were washed twice in M9 salts and plated on minimal medium (M9 salts supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μg/ml thiamine) or diluted 100-fold in the liquid medium before monitoring the cell growth in the presence or absence of tryptophan (20 μg/ml). For complementation of CS89, cells were instead washed in low salt (0.05% NaCl) LB medium (16Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. Mutat. Res. 1991; 264: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Random Mutagenesis—Random mutagenesis was accomplished by PCR amplification of the region from the unique NdeI and XhoI sites in the aspS2 gene cloned in pCBS200. Mutagenic primers contained randomized nucleotides at each of the three positions of the Pro-77 codon. The digested PCR product was ligated with the large NdeI/XhoI fragment of the pCBS200-aspS2 vector to generate the P77 variant library. Sixteen individual clones from the library were sequenced to confirm the degeneracy at codon 77 (data not shown). No colonies were obtained in the absence of the insert, indicating that there was no carryover of the original wild type aspS2 gene. Genes in which mutations were introduced by PCR outside of the randomized position were not considered in this study. Mutations tested for various phenotypes were confirmed upon reisolation of the plasmid, transformation, and sequencing. Preparation of tRNA Transcripts—Three tRNAAsp genes are encoded by D. radiodurans, and the sequence of tRNAAsp used in this study and a previous study (17Min B. Pelaschier J.T. Graham D.E. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2678-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) corresponds to those of tRNAAsp-2 and tRNAAsp-3, which are identical. Cloning of D. radiodurans tRNAAsp has been reported (17Min B. Pelaschier J.T. Graham D.E. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To allow the presence of the natural U1-A72 base pair in D. radiodurans tRNAAsn, the gene was cloned into pUC119 between EcoRI and BamHI with a 5′-cis acting hammerhead ribozyme under the control of the T7 promoter (18Fechter P. Rudinger J. Giegé R. Théobald-Dietrich A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All tRNA clones were confirmed by sequencing. In vitro transcription of BstNI-digested templates was carried out as described (10Tumbula-Hansen D. Feng L. Toogood H. Stetter K.O. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37184-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Run-off transcripts were extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and fractionated on a Q-Sepharose column as described (10Tumbula-Hansen D. Feng L. Toogood H. Stetter K.O.

RNA was extracted from the crushed gel slice containing the appropriate transcript and purified by extractions with phenol and chloroform, ethanol precipitation, and desalting with a NAP-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified tRNA transcripts were stored in water at -80 °C. Each transcript was renatured prior to aminoacylation assays as described (10Tumbula-Hansen D. Feng L. Toogood H. Stetter K.O. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37184-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analyses—Aminoacylation and measurement of kinetic parameters were performed as described previously (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). [3H]Asp (242 μm, 17 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Aminoacylation was carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 10–50 nm AspRS. For tRNAAsp, the reaction additionally contained 500 μm [3H]Asp (0.85 Ci/mmol) and 0.2–5 μm transcript. For tRNAAsn, the reaction contained 750 μm [3H]Asp (0.57 Ci/mmol) and 0.5–12 μm transcript. The concentration of aspartate was kept at least 2-fold higher than the Km for the amino acid. Initial velocities were determined from the average of duplicated sets of data at varying tRNA concentrations. The percentage of renatured tRNA that could be aminoacylated was determined for each transcript and is around 40% for tRNAAsp and 50–60% for tRNAAsn. The concentration reported therefore reflects the amount of chargeable tRNA. The values of kcat and Km were calculated by non-linear regression fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. In Vivo Selection Reveals the Importance of Pro-77 for the Non-discriminating Nature of D. radiodurans AspRS2—Given the strict conservation of Pro-77 in the known archaeal ND-AspRS proteins (Fig. 1), we decided to completely randomize codon 77 in the D. radiodurans aspS2 gene and test the amino acid preference for tRNAAsx recognition at this position in vivo. Transformation of the E. coli trpA34 strain, a tryptophan auxotroph containing an Asn-60 (19Shirvanee L. Horn V. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6624-6625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) instead of the universally conserved active site residue Asp-60 present in all known tryptophan synthetase α-subunits, with the mutant library DNA should allow the selection of AspRS enzymes capable of forming the Asp-tRNAAsn missense suppressor required for restoration of tryptophan synthetase activity and thus prototrophic growth of the transformed strains (20Min B. Kitabatake M. Polycarpo C. Pelaschier J. Raczniak G. Ruan B. Kobayashi H. Namgoong S. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3524-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Approximately 200 tryptophan prototrophic colonies were isolated and retested; then the aspS2 genes from 21 isolates were sequenced. All 21 isolates contained Pro-77 (Table I), suggesting that proline is preferred for tRNAAsn recognition by D. radiodurans ND-AspRS. In contrast, when the temperature-sensitive aspS E. coli CS89 strain (16Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. Mutat. Res. 1991; 264: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was transformed with the same D. radiodurans aspS2 mutant library DNA, 12 (of 16) aspS2 isolates, which endowed strain CS89 with “wild type-like” growth (Fig. 2) at the non-permissive temperature of 40 °C, contained seven different amino acids at position 77 (4 isolates with Pro-77) (Table I). The amino acid variations observed at position 77 in the CS89 isolates also demonstrated the efficiency of the randomization procedure. However, none of these non-wild type Pro-77 isolates of D. radiodurans AspRS2 supported the growth of trpA34 in the absence of tryptophan (Fig. 3), consistent with the dominant isolation of proline in our randomized mutagenesis experiment (Table I).Table ID. radiodurans aspS2 genes, isolated after random mutagenesis of codon 77, from viable transformants of either E. coli trpA34 or E. coli CS89Transformed strainCodon 77Amino AcidNo. of isolatesaIndividual isolates were obtained following selection for growth of E. coli trpA34 in minimal medium without tryptophan at 37 °C or of E. coli CS89 at the non-permissive temperature of 40 °CtrpA34CCCProline19trpA34CCAProline2CS89bBoth fast and slow growing colonies were observed.

D. radiodurans AspRS1, a bacterial-type discriminating AspRS (17Min B. Pelaschier J.T. Graham D.E. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The P77K variant was tested because of the strict conservation of Lys-77 in the archaeal D-AspRSs (Fig. 1). Compared with wild type D. radiodurans AspRS2, which showed a slight preference for tRNAAsn over tRNAAsp, P77K led to a reverse tRNA preference and a 3-fold (i.e. 2.2/0.7) increase in specificity for tRNAAsp over tRNAAsn (Table II). The tRNA selection of D. radiodurans AspRS2 could also be tilted toward tRNAAsp in vitro by introducing the other mutation, H28Q (Fig. 1), but at a cost of aminoacylation efficiency (Table II). However, the simultaneous introduction of H28Q and P77K did not result in a further gain of tRNAAsp recognition in D. radiodurans AspRS2 (Table II), suggesting a negative interaction between these two positions. The smaller changes observed in the D. radiodurans AspRS2 mutant enzymes compared with those found with the reciprocal mutations in the T. kodakaraensis AspRS (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) could be a result of context-dependent recognition of tRNAAsx by these AspRSs. Based on their ability to support the growth on LB agar plates of E. coli CS89 at 40 °C but not the growth of trpA34 in the absence of tryptophan (data not shown), all three mutant AspRSs (P77K, H28Q, P77K/H28Q) could charge tRNAAsp but not tRNAAsn in vivo. Therefore, a small in vitro effect could lead to a significant response in vivo. Similar results have been reported with other mischarged aminoacylated tRNAs (21Kowal A.K. Köhrer C. RajBhandary U.L.

Replacement of this proline in D. radiodurans AspRS2 with seven other amino acids (lysine, serine, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine) did not affect tRNAAsp recognition in vivo (Fig. 2) but reduced Asp-tRNAAsn formation to undetectable levels in vivo. The importance of proline in tRNAAsn recognition was further illustrated by the universal appearance of this amino acid in our in vivo missense suppression selection (Table I). The intolerance of other amino acids at position 77 in D. radiodurans AspRS2 when selecting in vivo for Asp-tRNAAsn formation (Fig. 3 and Table I) explains the strict conservation of this proline in all the archaeal-type ND-AspRS enzymes (Fig. 1). Because of its unique backbone structure, proline at this position may avoid a potential clash between the protein backbone and the U36 base of the tRNAAsn anticodon (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a conserved proline is also found at the equivalent position in a subgroup of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetases (14Brevet A. Chen J. Commans S. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30927-30935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Berthet-Colominas C. Seignovert L. Härtlein M. Grotli M. Cusack S. Leberman R.

U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the semi-conserved histidine in the β1 strand appears to be important for both tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn recognition (Table II), but the molecular basis for this is unclear (11Feng L. Tumbula-Hansen D. Toogood H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5676-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the corresponding L1 loop in the bacterial-type AspRSs has diverged in sequence and length and does not show the strict conservation of proline in the ND-AspRSs and lysine in the D-AspRSs described here. Therefore, a different mechanism might be used by the bacterial-type AspRSs to achieve the non-discriminating tRNAAsx recognition.

To identify the enzymes metabolizing 2-chloroacrylate, we carried out comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the proteins from 2-chloroacrylate- and lactate-grown bacterial cells. As a result, we found that a protein named CAA43 was inducibly synthesized when the cells were grown on 2-chloroacrylate. The CAA43 gene was cloned and shown to encode a protein of 333 amino acid residues (Mr 35,788) that shared a significant sequence similarity with NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli (38.2% identity). CAA43 was overproduced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified protein catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond of 2-chloroacrylate to produce (S)-2-chloropropionate, which is probably further metabolized to (R)-lactate by (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase in Burkholderia sp. WS. NADH did not serve as a reductant. Despite the sequence similarity to quinone oxidoreductases, CAA43 did not act on 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone. 2-Chloroacrylate analogs, such as acrylate and methacrylate, were also inert as the substrates. In contrast, 2-bromoacrylate served as the substrate. Thus, we named this novel enzyme 2-haloacrylate reductase.

Organohalogen compounds are useful as herbicides, insecticides, plastics, solvents, and synthetic precursors and have been produced in large quantities by the chemical industry. In addition to these man-made compounds, >3,800 kinds of organohalogen compounds are produced biologically or by natural abiogenic processes, such as the eruption of volcanoes (1Gribble G.W. Chemosphere. 2003; 52: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Although some of these compounds are persistent, others are biologically degraded in many ways to disappear from nature. To decompose these compounds, organisms, particularly microorganisms, have developed a variety of enzymes that act on organohalogen compounds (2Janssen D.B. Oppentocht J.E. Poelarends G.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3de Jong R.M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been carried out on these enzymes, partly because they are useful in the bioremediation of environments contaminated with organohalogen compounds (4Copley S.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These enzymes are also useful in the chemical industry in which organohalogen compounds are converted into other compounds in a regiospecific and stereospecific manner (5Swanson P.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Various metabolic pathways for saturated organohalogen compounds and aromatic organohalogen compounds have been clarified (2Janssen D.B. Oppentocht J.E. Poelarends G.J. Curr. Opin.

For example, haloalkanes, 2-haloalkanoic acids, and haloalcohols are dehalogenated by haloalkane dehalogenase, 2-haloacid dehalogenase, and haloalcohol dehalogenase, respectively (6Janssen D.B. Curr.

Compared with the available information on the metabolisms of these organohalogen compounds, the information on the metabolisms of unsaturated aliphatic organohalogen compounds is limited. Only three enzymes catalyzing the dehalogenation of such compounds have been reported. One is corrinoid/iron-sulfur-cluster-containing reductive dehalogenase, which catalyzes the dehalogenation of tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene (14Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W. Annu. Rev.

To gain insight into the biological systems that decompose unsaturated organohalogen compounds, we previously isolated bacterial strains that assimilate 2-chloroacrylate as a sole carbon source (18Hasan A. Takada H. Koshikawa H. Liu J. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1599-1602Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 2-Chloroacrylate is a bacterial metabolite of 2-chloroallyl alcohol, which is an intermediate or byproduct in industrial herbicide synthesis (19van der Waarde J.J. Kok R. Janssen D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 528-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rats excrete 2-chloroacrylate when they are treated orally with herbicides containing a haloallyl substituent (20Marsden P.J. Casida J.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1982; 30: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, various halogenated acrylic acids are produced by red algae (21Woodlard F.X. Moore R.E. Roller P.P. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 617-620Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, no enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 2-chloroacrylate has been identified. 2-Chloroacrylate structurally resembles 2-haloalkanoic acids but does not serve as the substrate for 2-haloacid dehalogenase (22Liu J.Q. Kurihara T. Hasan A.K. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a novel enzyme involved in the degradation of unsaturated organohalogen compounds was expected to be discovered from the studies on the metabolic pathway of 2-chloroacrylate. Here, we first identified the enzyme involved in the degradation of 2-chloroacrylate in a 2-chloroacrylate-grown bacterium, Burkholderia sp. WS (formerly Pseudomonas sp. WS) (18Hasan A. Takada H.

Tetrahedron: Asymmetry. 2004; 15: 2837-2839Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzed the reduction of 2-chloroacrylate to produce (S)-2-chloropropionate, which is supposed to be dehalogenated by (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase. The enzyme is a new member of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily with the highest sequence similarity with NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli (24Riveros-Rosas H.

This study revealed a new pathway for the biodegradation of unsaturated organohalogen compounds. Moreover, the enzyme is useful for the production of (S)-2-chloropropionate, which is used in a large quantity as a synthetic precursor for the industrial production of aryloxyphenoxypropionic acid herbicides (26Haga T.

WS were harvested at the late logarithmic phase, washed with a standard buffer (a 60 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.1), resuspended in the standard buffer, and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the crude extract was stored at –80 °C. Two-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins of 2-chloroacrylate- and lactate-grown cells were compared by two-dimensional PAGE. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) 1The abbreviations used are: IEF, isoelectric focusing; MS, mass spectrometry. was performed in a vertical disc format as follows. The lower reservoir was filled with 10 mm H3PO4, and the upper reservoir was filled with 20 mm NaOH. The IEF gel mixture contained 8 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 2.0% Bio-Lyte, pH 3–10 (Bio-Rad) in 0.8% polyacrylamide gel with N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide as a cross linker. The gel was then consecutively pre-run at 200 V for 15 min, 300 V for 15 min, and 400 V for 30 min. After pre-run, the crude cell extract dissolved in 8 m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2% Bio-Lyte, pH 3–10, and 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol was loaded onto the IEF gel. The IEF gel was run at 400 V for 12 h and then at 800 V for 1 h. After isoelectric focusing, the gel was treated with an equilibration buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) for 20 min. The equilibrated IEF gel was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Amino Acid Sequencing—To determine the amino acid sequences of the 2-chloroacrylate-inducible proteins (CAA43 and CAA67), proteins of the 2-chloroacrylate-grown cells were separated by two-dimensional PAGE. For N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the proteins in the gel were blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The spots were excised, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined with a Shimadzu PPSQ-21 protein sequencer (Kyoto, Japan). Internal amino acid sequencing was performed by the APRO Life Science Institute, Inc. (Naruto, Japan). Gene Cloning—A part of the CAA43 gene was amplified by degenerate PCR with a sense primer (5′-ATGGCIGCIGTIATHCAYAA-3′), an antisense primer (5′-CCIGCIARRTGIACRTCGTC-3′), the genomic DNA of Burkholderia sp. WS, and TaKaRa LA TaqDNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). The program for the PCR was as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 47.9 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The 3′-region of the CAA43 gene was obtained by using an LA PCR in vitro cloning kit (Takara Shuzo). XbaI was used for the digestion of the genomic DNA. The oligonucleotides 5′-CGCCCCTCGGTGCCTACAGC-3′ and 5′-CTACCCCGCCGAAAAACTGA-3′, which anneal to the internal region of the CAA43 gene, were used for the first and the second PCR, respectively. The 5′-region of the CAA43 gene was obtained by inverse PCR. PCR was performed using primers 5′-CCGGGCGAGCCAACCTTAAC-3′ and 5′-CGCCCCTCGGTGCCTACAGC-3′ and the self-ligated SalI-digested genomic DNA as a template with the following program: denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 4 min. The amplified fragment contained the 3′-region of the CAA67 gene. The 5′-region of the CAA67 gene was obtained by using an LA PCR in vitro cloning kit with PstI-digested genomic DNA. Primers 5′-CATGAAATTCGGGACACACT-3′ and 5′-AGAAGGTGCCTGTGAGTGAA-3′ were used for the first and the second PCR, respectively. Expression of CAA43 and CAA67 with Recombinant E. coli Cells—A DNA fragment coding for CAA43 and CAA67 was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CACCAGGAGGAGGATGTTCATGTCGG-3′ and 5′-CTACGCTTGCGGAAGCAAA-3′ and the genomic DNA of Burkholderia sp. WS as a template. The program was as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 120 s followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 61.1 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 210 s. A DNA fragment coding for CAA43 was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CACCAGGAGACTTTATCATGGTAATGG-3′ and 5′-CTACGCTTGCGGAAGCAAA-3′ and the genomic DNA as a template. The program was as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 120 s followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 57.5 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 80 s. The amplified products were cloned into the expression vector pET101/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) downstream of the T7 promoter. The plasmid for the expression of the CAA43 gene was named pET101/D-TOPO-CAA43, and that for the co-expression of the CAA43 gene and the CAA67 gene was named pET101/D-TOPO-CAA67&CAA43. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Each of the recombinants was grown in an LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. After cultivation for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were harvested, suspended in the standard buffer, and disrupted by sonication. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Purification of CAA43—Recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET101/D-TOPO-CAA67&CAA43 were grown in a 1-liter LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. After additional cultivation for 32 h, the cells were harvested, washed with the standard buffer, and stored at –80 °C until use. The stored cells were suspended with 80 ml of the standard buffer and disrupted by sonication. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used immediately for the purification of CAA43. All of the purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cell-free extract was applied to a TOYOPEARL DEAE-650M column (2.5 × 15 cm) (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with the standard buffer. CAA43 was eluted with 400 ml of the standard buffer, and the active fractions were collected. The enzyme fraction was applied to an Orange-Sepharose CL-4B column (3 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the standard buffer. After the column was washed with 160 ml of the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of a 60–500 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol with a total volume of 400 ml. The purified enzyme was dialyzed against the standard buffer and stored at –80 °C. Enzyme Assay—The standard assay mixture for 2-haloacrylate reductase contained a 60 mm Tris sulfate buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-chloroacrylate, 0.6 mm NADPH, and enzyme. Absorbance at 340 nm was monitored at 35 °C. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH/min. To determine the enzyme activity toward other substrates, 2-chloroacrylate was replaced by the respective substrates of the same concentration. Ethanol was added to a final concentration of 1% for water-insoluble substrates. The decrease of 2-chloroacrylate and the increase of (S)-2-chloropropionate in the course of the enzyme reaction were monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as follows. A 500-μl reaction mixture containing a 60 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.1, 5 mm 2-chloroacrylate, 5 mm NADPH, and enzyme was incubated at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, filtrated, diluted with acetonitrile/10 mm ammonium acetate (1:1), and then introduced into a mass spectrometer (API3000 liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS system, PE Sciex, Foster City, CA) at 5 μl/min. The molecular ions of 2-[35Cl]chloroacrylate and 2-[37Cl]chloropropionate were detected in the negative ion mode at m/z 105 and 109, respectively. Determination of the Configuration of 2-Chloropropionate Enzymatically Produced—A 500-μl reaction mixture containing a 60 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.1, 5 mm 2-chloroacrylate, 5 mm NADPH, and enzyme was incubated at 30 °C. After overnight incubation, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1 with 200 μl of 6 n HCl. 2-Chloropropionic acid in the mixture was extracted with 700 μl of ethyl acetate and converted into methyl ester with trimethylsilyldiazomethane. The configuration of the methyl 2-chloropropionate was determined with a gas chromatography-MS system (AutoSystem XL Gas Chromatograph, TurboMass Mass Spectrometer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a WCOT-fused silica column (0.32 mm × 25 m, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The injection port was maintained at 200 °C. The column temperature program was 40 °C for 2 min, 5 °C/min to 70 °C, and 70 °C for 4 min. The ion source was maintained at 220 °C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at 0.63 p.s.i. The mass spectrometer was operated with an ionization voltage of 70 eV. In the selective ion-monitoring mode, m/z of 59, 63, 87, 91, and 122 were used to detect 2-chloropropionate methyl ester. Methyl-(S)-2-chloropropionate and methyl (R)-2-chloropropionate were eluted at 5.5 and 6.0 min, respectively. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters—To determine the apparent Vmax and Km values of the enzyme, the standard assay was performed with various concentrations of substrates as follows: 0.1–10 mm sodium 2-chloroacrylate; 0.1–10 mm sodium 2-bromoacrylate; and 0.05–0.5 mm NADPH. Effects of pH and Temperature on the Enzyme Activity—To examine the effect of pH on the enzyme stability, the standard assay was performed with the enzyme preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the following buffers (60 mm): citrate-NaOH (pH 5.5–6.5); potassium phosphate (pH 6.0–8.0); Tris sulfate (pH 7.0–9.0); and glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0–10.5). To examine the effect of pH on the enzyme activity, the initial reaction velocities were measured by the standard assay method with the buffers (60 mm) of various pH values listed above. The effect of the temperature on the stability of the enzyme was determined by incubating the enzyme at different temperatures from 25 to 50 °C for 30 min prior to the standard assay. The effect of the temperature on the enzyme activity was determined by performing the standard assay at different temperatures from 25 to 50 °C. Molecular Weight Determination—The subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry with an API3000 liquid chromatography-MS/MS system. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was analyzed by gel filtration with an ÄKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Superose 12 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Assay—The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Nacalai Tesque) according to the manufacturer's instructions with bovine serum albumin as a standard. NADPH-dependent Reduction of 2-Chloroacrylate and Inducible Nature of the Enzyme Catalyzing This Reaction—We found that 2-chloroacrylate is converted into 2-chloropropionate in the presence of NADPH and the cell-free extract of 2-chloroacrylate-grown Burkholderia sp. WS (Fig. 1, A–C). We also confirmed that NADPH is converted into NADP+ under the same condition (data not shown). The results suggest that an NADPH-dependent reductase acting on 2-chloroacrylate occurs in the 2-chloroacrylate-grown cells. Other reducing agents, such as NADH and the reduced form of FAD, did not substitute for NADPH (data not shown). The increase of peaks with m/z values of 89 and 87 (Fig. 1, B and C) suggests that 2-chloropropionate is further metabolized to lactate (m/z = 89) and pyruvate (m/z = 87). We next examined whether the enzyme is constitutively produced or inducibly produced when the cells are grown on 2-chloroacrylate. As shown in Fig. 1D, 2-chloroacrylate was not degraded when the cell-free extract from the lactate-grown cells was used. 2-Chloroacrylate-dependent oxidation of NADPH was not observed under this condition. Thus, the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 2-chloroacrylate to produce 2-chloropropionate is inducibly synthesized when the cells are grown on 2-chloroacrylate as a carbon source. Identification of Proteins Inducibly Synthesized by 2-Chloroacrylate—Proteins from 2-chloroacrylate-grown cells and lactate-grown cells were compared by two-dimensional PAGE to identify proteins inducibly synthesized in Burkholderia sp. WS grown on 2-chloroacrylate. Two major proteins (Fig. 2, arrowheads) were found only in the 2-chloroacrylate-grown cells, suggesting their involvement in the metabolism of 2-chloroacrylate. These proteins were named CAA43 and CAA67, as indicated in Fig. 2. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of CAA43 and CAA67 were VMAAVIHKKGGPDNFV and XDVLVTDVLVVXE, respectively, and the following internal amino acid sequences were determined: DLDLDDVHLAGLMLK (CAA43) and VFVDFRETKPEEWAPDSLTGTFLGK (CAA67). Cloning of the Genes Coding for CAA43 and CAA67—Degenerate primers were designed based on the amino acid sequences of CAA43 and CAA67, and the genes coding for these proteins were cloned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The genes coding for CAA43 and CAA67 were found to be located next to each other on the genome of Burkholderia sp. WS (GenBank™ accession number AB196962). The CAA43 gene was located downstream of the CAA67 gene, and their distance was 267 bp. The CAA43 gene contained an open reading frame of 1,002 nucleotides coding for 333 amino acid residues (Mr 35,788), and the CAA67 gene contained an open reading frame of 1,644 nucleotides coding for 547 amino acid residues (Mr 58,684). Putative Shine-Dalgarno sequences, AGGAGG and AGGAG, were found in the upstream regions of the initiation codons of the CAA67 gene and the CAA43 gene, respectively. Possible –35 (CTTGATGT) and –10 (TTTAAT) sequences were found only in the upstream region of the CAA67 gene. Structural Characteristics of CAA43 and CAA67—CAA43 shares the highest sequence similarity with NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase from E. coli (NCBI accession number 131763) (38.2% identity), which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of various quinones, among the proteins in the data base with known function (Fig. 3) (25Thorn J.M. Barton J.D. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Edwards K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Edwards K.J. Barton J.D. Rossjohn J. Thorn J.M. Taylor G.L. Ollis D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CAA43 has a nucleotide binding motif, AXXGXXG, in the region from 153 to 159 and is supposed to bind to NADH or NADPH. The crystal structure of the quinone oxidoreductase from E. coli complexed with NADPH showed that the 2′-phosphate group of NADPH is surrounded by polar and positively charged residues, Lys177, Tyr192, and Arg317 (25Thorn J.M. Barton J.D. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Edwards K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These residues provide a positively charged pocket that accepts the phosphate group. All of these residues are conserved in CAA43, suggesting that CAA43 is an NADPH-dependent enzyme. CAA67 has a weak but significant sequence similarity with l-aspartate oxidase from E. coli (NCBI accession number 5542180) (17.6% identity) and fumarate reductase (subunit A) from Wolinella succinogenes (NCBI accession number 37538290) (17.2% identity), which require FAD as a cofactor (data not shown) (28Bossi R.T. Negri A. Tedeschi G. Mattevi A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3018-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Lancaster C.R. Kroger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Reduction of 2-Chloroacrylate Catalyzed by CAA43—The amino acid sequence analyses suggested that CAA43 and CAA67 require NADPH and FAD, respectively, as a cofactor. Thus, CAA43 was supposed to be involved in the reduction of 2-chloroacrylate because NADPH was required for the reduction of 2-chloroacrylate by the extract of the 2-chloroacrylate-grown cells as described above. We constructed a recombinant E. coli strain that produces CAA43 under the control of the T7 promoter to see whether CAA43 catalyzes the reduction of 2-chloroacrylate. We measured the 2-chloroacrylate-reducing activity in the cell-free extracts prepared from the recombinant E. coli cells producing CAA43 and the cells not producing CAA43 by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (data not shown). When the extract containing CAA43 was used, the peak corresponding to 2-[35Cl]chloroacrylate (m/z = 105) was decreased and the peak corresponding to 2-[37Cl]chloropropionate (m/z = 109) was increased. The reaction did not proceed in the absence of CAA43. The result indicates that CAA43 catalyzes the conversion of 2-chloroacrylate to 2-chloropropionate. Purification of CAA43—E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET101/D-TOPO-CAA67&CAA43 was used for purification of CAA43, because the amount of CAA43 was more abundant in the cells harboring pET101/D-TOPO-CAA67&CAA43 than in the cells harboring pET101/D-TOPO-CAA43 (data not shown). Although the cells harboring pET101/D-TOPO-CAA67&CAA43 produced both CAA43 and CAA67, the majority of CAA67 was recovered in the insoluble fraction when the cell-free extract was prepared. Table I summarizes the results of the purification of CAA43. The enzyme was purified 5.0-fold with 30% recovery, and the purified enzyme was found to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). CAA67 was not co-purified with CAA43.Table IPurification of CAA43 from recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET101/D-TOPO-CAA67&CAA43Purification stepTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationunitsmgunits/mg%-foldCrude extract33830.401001TOYOPEARL DEAE22171.3673.3Orange-Sepharose105.02.0305.0 Open table in a new tab The purified CAA43 was shown to catalyze the conversion of 2-chloroacrylate into 2-chloropropionate by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 4). 1 mol of NADPH was converted into NADP+ when 1 mol of 2-chloroacrylate was converted into 2-chloropropionate. Molecular Weight and Subunit Structure of CAA43—The purified CAA43 lacked the N-terminal methionine residue. The molecular weight of the subunit of CAA43 was estimated to be ∼37,000 by SDS-PAGE, which is in good agreement with the value (35,656) calculated from the primary structure of CAA43 without the N-terminal methionine residue. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the molecular weight of the purified CAA43 was 35,695, suggesting the association of a potassium ion to the enzyme. Gel filtration analysis showed that the molecular weight of the native enzyme is ∼30,000, suggesting that the enzyme is monomeric. Effects of pH and Temperature on CAA43—The effect of pH on the activity of CAA43 was examined over the pH range from 5.5 to 10.5, and an optimum pH was found to be ∼8.0. CAA43 was stable between pH 7.0 and 8.0 for 30 min at 30 °C. CAA43 exhibited its maximum activity at 40 °C and was stable at 35 °C or lower temperatures for 30 min. Determination of the Configuration of 2-Chloropropionate Produced with CAA43—2-Chloroacrylate was incubated with the purified CAA43 in the presence of NADPH. After the reaction, the product was esterified and analyzed by gas chromatography-MS with a chiral resolution column. The product was co-eluted with (S)-2-chloropropionate methyl ester. A molecular ion of m/z 122 and fragment ions of m/z 59, 63, 87, and 91, which are identical to those of authentic (S)-2-chloropropionate methyl ester, were found in the mass spectrum of the product (data not shown). (R)-2-Chloropropionate methyl ester was not detected in the chromatogram of the product. Thus, CAA43 catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of 2-chloroacrylate to produce (S)-2-chloropropionate. Substrate and Cofactor Specificity—The substrate specificity of CAA43 was examined. The enzyme acted on 2-chloroacrylate and 2-bromoacrylate, but 2-fluoroacrylate did not serve as the substrate. The specific activity toward 2-bromoacrylate was comparable to that toward 2-chloroacrylate. The apparent Km and Vmax values for 2-chloroacrylate were 0.45 mm and 1.9 μmol/min/mg, respectively. The apparent Km and Vmax values for 2-bromoacrylate were 0.19 mm and 2.8 μmol/min/mg, respectively. Although the velocity versus substrate plot for 2-chloroacrylate showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the reductase activity was inhibited by the high concentration (>2.5 mm) of 2-bromoacrylate. Analogs of 2-chloroacrylate, such as acrylate, methacrylate, 2-cloro-1-propene, 2-chloroacrylonitrile, phosphoenolpyruvate, and fumarate, were inert as substrates, suggesting that a free carboxyl group and a halogen atom bound to the α-position of acrylic acid are required for the substrates. Although CAA43 resembles NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase in its primary structure, CAA43 did not act on 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone, which serve as the substrates of the quinone oxidoreductase (25Thorn J.M. Barton J.D. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Edwards K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Shimomura Y. Sumiguchi-Agari K. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Fukuyama K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected from the primary structure, CAA43 required NADPH for its catalytic activity and no reductase activity was observed when NADH was used instead of NADPH. The apparent Km value for NADPH was 0.090 mm. Occurrence of 2-Haloacrylate Reductase—We discovered an NADPH-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of a carbon-carbon double bond of 2-chloroacrylate and 2-bromoacrylate. 2-Haloacrylate analogs such as acrylate and methacrylate did not serve as the substrate. The inducible nature of the enzyme in Burkholderia sp. WS suggests that 2-haloacrylate is a physiological substrate of this enzyme. Although the enzyme shares significant sequence similarity with NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase from E. coli (25Thorn J.M. Barton J.D. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Edwards K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the enzyme is clearly different from quinone oxidoreductase in its substrate specificity. We named this novel enzyme 2-haloacrylate reductase. NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductases belong to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (24Riveros-Rosas H. Julian-Sanchez A. Villalobos-Molina R. Pardo J.P. Pina E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3309-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which includes proteins such as ζ-crystallin (31Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (32LeBrun L.A. Park D.H. Ramaswamy S. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3014-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, quinone oxidoreductase from E. coli shares the highest sequence similarity with 2-haloacrylate reductase (38.2%) (25Thorn J.M. Barton J.D. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Edwards K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other proteins in the superfamily are much more distantly related to 2-haloacrylate reductase. For example, ζ-crystallin from guinea pig (NCBI accession number 117549) and alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver (NCBI accession number 625197) share only 22.5 and 15.6% sequence identities, respectively, with 2-haloacrylate reductase (31Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32LeBrun L.A. Park D.H. Ramaswamy S. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3014-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Metabolism of 2-Haloacrylate—We detected the activity of (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase, which catalyzes the hydrolytic dehalogenation of (S)-2-haloalkanoic acids (7Liu J.Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Li Y.F. Hata Y. Fujii T. Hisano T. Nishihara M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15035-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), in the crude extract of 2-chloroacrylate-grown Burkholderia sp. WS (data not shown), although we previously failed to detect the enzyme because of its low activity (18Hasan A. Takada H. Koshikawa H. Liu J. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1599-1602Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also identified the gene coding for this enzyme (GenBank™ accession number AB196963). Recombinant E. coli cells expressing this gene exhibited dehalogenase activity. Thus, in Burkholderia sp. WS, 2-haloacrylate reductase probably catalyzes the first step of the assimilation of 2-chloroacrylate to produce (S)-2-chloropropionate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to (R)-lactate by (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase (Fig. 5). Janssen and co-workers (19van der Waarde J.J. Kok R. Janssen D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 528-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a 2-chloroallylalcohol-assimilating bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. JD2, in which 2-chloroallylalcohol is proposed to be degraded via 2-chloroacrylate. Although the metabolic pathway for 2-chloroacrylate and the enzymes involved in this pathway are unidentified, 2-haloacrylate reductase may occur in this bacterium and catalyze the reduction of 2-chloroacrylate to produce 2-chloropropionate. The presence of dehalogenase that acts on 2-chloropropionate in this bacterium supports this speculation. Dehalogenases that catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond of 3-haloacrylates to produce malonate semialdehyde occur in Pseudomonas pavanaceae 170 and a coryneform bacterium strain, FG41 (15de Jong R.M.

In this reaction, 3-haloacrylate is first hydrated to form an unstable halohydrin species, which subsequently degrades to produce malonate semialdehyde. Unlike this reaction, 2-haloacrylate is first reduced and then dehalogenated by two distinct enzymes in Burkholderia sp. WS. Possible Function of CAA67—The CAA67 gene is located in the immediate upstream region of the 2-haloacrylate reductase gene. Because the –35 and –10 sequences were found only in the upstream region of the CAA67 gene, the two genes probably constitute an operon. The fact that CAA67 is inducibly synthesized together with 2-haloacrylate reductase when the cells are grown on 2-chloroacrylate supports this view. Thus, CAA67 probably plays a role in the assimilation of 2-chloroacrylate. Because CAA67 shares sequence similarity with FAD-dependent enzymes such as fumarate reductase and l-aspartate oxidase (28Bossi R.T. Negri A. Tedeschi G. Mattevi A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3018-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Lancaster C.R. Kroger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that CAA67 is an oxidoreductase functioning in the metabolic pathway of 2-chloroacrylate. Perhaps it is involved in the regeneration of NADPH consumed by 2-haloacrylate reductase or in the catabolism of (S)-2-chloropropionate produced by 2-haloacrylate reductase (Fig. 5). We currently have no experimental data that allow us to determine the role of CAA67. The function of CAA67 is now under investigation by biochemical analysis of the purified protein as well as by disruption of the CAA67 gene. Application of 2-Haloacrylate Reductase to the Production of Chiral Compounds—2-Chloropropionate is a building block for the synthesis of the aryloxyphenoxypropionic acid herbicide, which is one of the most abundantly used herbicides in the world (26Haga T. Crosby K.E. Schussler J.R. Palmer C.J. Yoshii H. Kimura F. Kurihara N. Miyamoto J. Chirality in Agrochemicals. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom1998: 175-197Google Scholar). Because the (R)-isomer of the aryloxyphenoxypropionic acid has the herbicidal activity, it is desirable to use (S)-2-chloropropionate for the production of the herbicide (note that the reaction proceeds with the inversion of the configuration). (S)-2-Chloropropionate is currently produced by optical resolution in which the (R)-isomer of a racemic 2-chloropropionate is selectively degraded with (R)-2-haloacid dehalogenase (33Breuer M. Ditrich K. Habicher T. Hauer B. Kesseler M. Sturmer R. Zelinski T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 788-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Because the theoretical maximum yield of (S)-2-chloropropionate by this procedure is only 50%, it is desirable to develop a new method to produce (S)-2-chloropropionate in a much better yield. 2-Haloacrylate reductase catalyzes the asymmetric reduction of 2-chloroacrylate to produce (S)-2-chloropropionate and may be used for this purpose. The system for the production of (S)-2-chloropropionate is under construction by coupling the 2-haloacrylate reductase reaction with an NADPH-regeneration system."

This protein was purified 5800-fold from membranes prepared from Drosophila heads. The protein was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m sodium chloride and then purified using an α-cobratoxin column followed by a lentil lectin affinity column. The purified protein had a specific activity of 3.9 μmol of 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding sites/g of protein. The subunit composition of the purified receptor was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This subunit profile was identical with that revealed by in situ labeling of the membrane-bound protein using the photolyzable methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate derivative of 125I-α-bungarotoxin. The purified receptor reveals two different protein bands with molecular masses of 42 and 57 kDa. From sedimentation analysis of the purified protein complex in H2O and D2O and gel filtration, a mass of 270 kDa was calculated. The receptor has a s20,w of 9.4 and a Stoke's radius of 7.4 nm. The frictional coefficient was calculated to be 1.7 indicating a highly asymmetric protein complex compatible with a transmembrane protein forming an ion channel. The sequence of a peptide obtained after tryptic digestion of the 42-kDa protein allowed the specific identification of the Drosophila Dα5 subunit by sequence comparison. A peptide-specific antibody raised against the Dα5 subunit provides further evidence that this subunit is a component of an α-bungarotoxin binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the central nervous system of Drosophila.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. are key elements of fast cholinergic synaptic transmission (1Changeux J.P.

They are part of a large superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels comprising 5HT3, GABAA, and GABAC, glycine, and invertebrate anionic glutamate receptors. nAChRs are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition to their occurrence in the highly specialized tissue of the electrical organ of certain species of fish (Torpedo californica, Electrophorus electricus), nAChRs are mostly found at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction and the nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates (3Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Structurally, nAChRs are formed by assembly of their subunits into a pentameric membrane protein complex. Subunits carrying two conserved adjacent cysteines in the amino-terminal domain in the vicinity of the acetylcholine binding site are classified as α-subunits, while the remainder of the subunit types are designated non-α or -β. The individual subunits have a large amino-terminal domain, which includes the binding site for the ligand, followed by four membrane spanning domains M1–M4. The M2 segments of the five subunits form the lining of the ion channel, which is transiently permeable to cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+) upon binding of the ligand acetylcholine (ACh). Between M3 and M4 a large intracellular loop exists, which contains several phosphorylation sites required for receptor stabilization (for reviews, see Refs. 3Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 5Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, and 6Stroud R.M. McCarthy M.P. Shuster M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11009-11023Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of receptors subunits composition in a variety of species as well the information obtained from the sequencing of the genome of humans, mice, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster indicates a large number of genes encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from muscle have an invariant subunit composition ((α1)2(β1)δγ (fetal) or ϵ). Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are composed of α and non-α-subunits with a stoichoimetry of (α)2(non-α)3. The large number of genes encoding nAChR subunits in the nervous system can give rise to an array of functionally distinct nAChRs. Since the vertebrate nervous system also contains homomeric nAChRs (e.g. (α7)5) the entire range of subunit combinations in the formation of physiological diverse nAChRs is currently unknown. The physiological significance of this subunit diversity, as well as the mechanism governing expression and receptor assembly, are important issues that need to be addressed. The model organism D. melanogaster offers many of the molecular and genetic tools to study these questions in an in vivo system. In Drosophila, as in insects in general, expression of nAChRs is restricted to the nervous system (7Leech C.A. Sattelle D.B. EXS. 1993; 63: 81-97PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike in the mammalian central nervous system, nAChRs are part of a major neurotransmitter system in insects with 900–1000 fmol of 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding sites/mg of protein. The sequence of the Drosophila genome predicts seven α- and three non-α-subunits. The characterization of four of the α-subunits (ALS, SAD, Dα3, and Dα4) (8Bossy B. Ballivet M. Spierer P.

Little information is currently available about the nature of the receptor subtypes assembled from the various subunit genes in Drosophila. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the ALS and SAD subunits might be part of a receptor complex while Dα3 and ARD might be part of a different receptor subtype (17Chamaon K. Smalla K.H. Thomas U. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that it has not been possible to reconstitute functional nAChRs from Drosophila in a heterologous system with any of these subunit combinations tested so far (18Lansdell S.J. Schmitt B. Betz H. Sattelle D.B. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Schulz R. Bertrand S. Chamaon K. Smalla K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Bertrand D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2537-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Purification and/or affinity labeling with several ligands in situ allowed the identification of several proteins but no correlation was established between the known Drosophila nAChR subunits and the proteins detected (20Schloss P. Mayser W. Gundelfinger E.D. Betz H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 145: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Tomizawa M. Latli B. Casida J.E. J.

In this paper we show that after a 5800-fold purification of nAchRs from Drosophila heads two major bands with masses of 42 and 57 kDa can be identified. The sequence of a peptide obtained after tryptic digestion and microbore HPLC of the 42-kDa protein allowed the specific identification of the Drosophila Dα5 subunit as part of this receptor. Chemicals—Protease inhibitors pepstatin A, leupeptin, and antipain were obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA); benzamidine, bacitracin, iodoacetamide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Sigma as well as carbamylcholine, nicotine-tartrate, d-tubocurarine, hexamethonium chloride, atropine sulfate, physostigmine, acetylcholine bromide, and deoxycholate. Methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside was obtained from Pfanstiehl Laboratories (Waukegan, IL). α-Bungarotoxin, κ-toxin, and Naja naja siamensis crude venom were purchased from Miami Serpentarium Laboratory (Punta Gordia, FL). Na125I was received from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Trypsin was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Drosophila Cultures—The wild-type Oregon R strain of D. melanogaster was used in all experiments. Flies were raised on a standard cornmeal agar medium (23Lewis E. Drosophila Inform. Serv. 1960; 34: 117-118Google Scholar) in polypropylen boxes at 23 ± 2 °C and 65% relative humidity. Flies were harvested in a cold room (2 °C) and stored frozen at –75 °C. Preparation of 125I-α-Bungarotoxin—α-Bungarotoxin was iodinated as described (33Schmidt-Nielsen B.K. Gepner J.I. Teng N.N. Hall L.M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 29: 1013-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The initial specific activity was in the range of 40–80 Ci/mmol. For competitive binding assays monoiodinated α-bungarotoxin was prepared by chromatography on CM-Sephadex essentially as described previously (24Blanchard S.G. Quast U. Reed K. Lee T. Schimerlik M.I. Vandlen R. Claudio T. Strader C.D. Moore H.P. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The specific activity was adjusted by addition of unlabeled α-bungarotoxin to a range of 60–120 Ci/mmol. Buffers and Solutions—The following buffers and solutions were used: assay buffer, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% cytochrome c, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; washing buffer, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; homogenization buffer, 1% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, 5 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; solubilization buffer, 2% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, 5 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; dialysis buffer 1, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm NaN3, l mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; dialysis buffer 2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm NaN3 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; column buffer 1, 1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; column buffer 2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mm NaN3, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3; column buffer 3, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 0.1% deoxycholate, 100 mm NaPi, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA; buffer 4, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 m NaCl, 100 mm NaPi, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA; Lentil lectin column storage buffer, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 2% mannopyranoside, 3 mm NaN3; protease inhibitor, 10 mm iodoacetamide; protease inhibitor mixture 1, 20 KIU/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 mm benzamidine, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na2S2O5,2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm PMSF; protease inhibitor mixture 2, same as protease inhibitor mixture 1, except aprotinin is omitted; protease inhibitor mixture 3, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na2S2O5, 1 mm PMSF; blotting buffer, 80% 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol (v/v). Determination of 125I-α-Bungarotoxin Binding Activity—Samples of membrane-bound and solubilized binding protein were incubated, if not stated otherwise, with 5 nm 125I-α-bungarotoxin in a final volume of 0.3 ml of assay buffer for 60 min at 23 °C. At the end of the incubation period the assay mixture was collected on a double thickness of DEAE-filter disk, which was prewetted with washing buffer, using a filtration manifold apparatus (Earle Sandbek, Airville, PA). The filter disks were washed twice with 4 ml each of washing buffer, dried, and counted in a LKB γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubating samples in the presence of d-tubocurarine at a final concentration of 10–4 m for 20 min. All binding data represent the mean of triplicate determinations. The IC50 for several cholinergic ligands was determined by preincubating the respective receptor fraction with the various ligand at 10 different concentrations for each ligand for 20 min followed by incubation with 5 nm 125I-α-bungarotoxin for 1 h. Protein Determination—A modification of the Lowry protein assay procedure, which allows determination of micrograms of proteins in the presence of detergents, was used (25Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Protein Precipitation—Protein precipitation of membrane proteins was carried out as described (26Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Electrophoresis was carried out in 10% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 37.5:1) according to the procedure of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The following prestained molecular weight markers were used: 2-macroglobulin (Mr = 180,000), β-galactosidase (Mr = 116,000), fructose-6-phosphate kinase (Mr = 84,000), pyruvate kinase (Mr = 58,000), fumarase (Mr = 48,500), lactic dehydrogenase (Mr = 36,500), and triosephosphate isomerase (Mr = 26,600) Preparation of the Methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate Derivative of 125I-α-Bungarotoxin—The derivatized α-bungarotoxin was synthesized essentially as described by (28Ji I. Shin J. Ji T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A solution containing 200–400 nm monoiodo-125I-α-bungarotoxin, 60 mm NaCl, and 3.3 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, was adjusted to pH 9.5 by the addition of 20 mg Na2CO3 and 25 mg NaHCO3. All subsequent steps were conducted in the dark using a Wratten no. 2 safe light. At 0, 2, 4, and 7 h, 1 mg of methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate was added to the toxin, and the mixture was stirred continuously at 4 °C for a total of 22 h. Cytochrome c (1 mg) was then added as a carrier and the mixture was purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.7 cm × 30 cm), which was equilibrated and eluted with 3.3 mm NaPi buffer, pH 7.3. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the first major peak fractions were pooled and stored in the dark at 4 °C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3. Methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate was synthesized according to published procedure (29Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1566-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiography—Gels were soaked for 2 h in a solution containing 0.1% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, dried on filter paper in a gel dryer, and exposed for autoradiography using Kodak XAR film and Cronex intensifying screens (DuPont Co.). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Linear 5–20% sucrose gradients were prepared in either H2OorD2O containing 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm NaN3, 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3. Centrifugation was carried out essentially as described by Martin and Ames (49Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. The standards used were β-galactosidase (s20,w = 15.9), catalase (s20,w = 11.3), and alcohol dehydrogenase (s20,w = 7.6). Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was carried out using a siliconized glass column (50 × 1 cm) with Sepharose 4B in the same buffer used for gradient centrifugation. The Stoke's radii of the protein markers used were thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), β-galactosidase (6.9 nm), ferritin (6.1 nm), catalase (5.2 nm), and alcohol dehydrogenase (4.5 nm). Preparation of Affinity Resins—α-Cobratoxin was purified from the crude venom of N. naja siamensis as described (30Cooper D. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3008-3013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels and by sequencing using 15 degradation cycles on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. α-Cobratoxin was coupled to Separose 4B (2 ml of gel/mg of toxin) as described by March et al. (31March S.C. Parikh I. Cuatrecasas P. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar) without the 2 m urea wash step. The obtained affinity gel had a capacity of about 35 pmol of 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding sites/ml of gel. Lentil lectin was purified essentially as described (32Hayman M.J. Crumpton M.J. Biochem.

Coupling was carried out at a ratio of 1:1.8 (ml of gel/mg of lectin) as described for α-cobratoxin. When used as the second affinity column this gel had a capacity of 35 pmol of 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding sites per ml of gel. Photoaffinity Labeling—Photoaffinity labeling of the membrane-bound and solubilized receptor was carried out as described (28Ji I. Shin J. Ji T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1566-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture 1. The labeling reaction was equilibrated in the dark for 40 min on ice before radiation with a small UV lamp (330 nm) for 40 min. Purification of the Acetylcholine Receptor—Unless otherwise noted all steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Heads from Drosophila were essentially prepared as described (33Schmidt-Nielsen B.K. Gepner J.I. Teng N.N. Hall L.M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 29: 1013-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with the modification that an equal amount of powdered dry ice was added during both the disjoining and sieving step to assure that the tissue was kept well frozen. The isolated heads were stored overnight in a deep freezer at –75 °C to allow the dry ice to sublimate. Membranes for receptor purification were prepared by suspending heads at a concentration of 100 mg of heads/ml in homogenization buffer containing 10 mm iodoacetamide in addition to protease inhibitor mixture 1. The heads were homogenized using a VirTis-23 homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g in a GSA rotor (Sorvall), and the supernatant was filtered through a double layer of cheesecloth. The pellet was resuspended to 100 mg of heads/ml of homogenization buffer plus protease inhibitor mixture 1 and homogenized and centrifuged as described above. The two supernatants were combined and diluted by one volume of the homogenization buffer and then centrifuged for 40 min at 17,000 × g (GSA rotor). The upper pink part of the pellet was resuspended to 160 mg of heads/ml of homogenization buffer plus inhibitors and homogenized in a Teflon pestle-glass homogenizer using 30 strokes at 1700 rpm at 0 °C. This membrane fraction was used for subsequent solubilization and purification. If not used immediately it was stored in 50-ml plastic tubes in liquid nitrogen. Receptors were solubilized by diluting the membrane fraction with an equal volume of solubilization buffer containing 10 mm iodoacetamide and protease inhibitor mixture 1. The suspension was homogenized with 30 strokes at 1700 rpm in a Teflon pestle-glass homogenizer and centrifuged for 30 min at 235,000 × g (Type Ti45 rotor, Beckman). The supernatant was dialyzed in Spectrapor 2 tubing for 1–2 h against two changes (5 liters of each) of dialysis buffer until the conductivity was equivalent a 100 mm NaCl solution. The dialyzed preparation was subjected to affinity chromatography on an α-cobratoxin column. Two columns (2.5 × 6-cm gel bed in a 60-ml plastic syringe) were washed with 60 ml of column buffer 1 and protease inhibitor mixture 2. The dialysate was then applied to the column. The column was washed with 120 ml of column buffer 2. The receptor was eluted from the column with 120 ml of column buffer 2 containing 200 mm carbamylcholine, and the entire 120 ml of eluate was applied immediately to the lentil lectin affinity column as described below. The cobratoxin column was regenerated by washing with 60 ml of column buffer 1 containing 1 m carbamylcholine followed by 120 ml of column buffer 2 without the protease inhibitors and stored at 4 °C for reuse. The lentil lectin column (2.5 × 3-cm gel bed) was washed with 100 ml of column buffer 2, and the eluate from the α-cobratoxin column was applied. The column was washed with 30 ml of column buffer 1 and then with 30 ml of column buffer 2, both containing protease inhibitor mixture 2 and than 15 ml of column buffer 3 containing protease inhibitor mixture 3. The receptor was eluted by incubating the column for 30 min with 15 ml of column buffer 3 containing 15% methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside and protease inhibitor mixture 3 and then eluting with the same buffer until a total of 30 ml had been collected. The lentil lectin column was washed with 60 ml of column buffer 1 containing 20% methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside followed by 50 ml of lentil lectin column storage buffer and stored at 4 °C for later use. Final purification was achieved by concentrating the eluate from the lentil lectin column in Amicon 8050 and Amicon 8010 concentrators using a Diaflo Ultrafiltraton membrane YM100 (Amicon Division, W. R. Grace & Co.) under pressure of 20 p.s.i. argon to a volume of 0.5–1 ml on ice. Sequence Analysis—Proteins separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis were blotted on nitrocellulose membrane at 20 mA for 16 h. Transfer was verified by briefly staining the membrane with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid. Tryptic digestion of the membrane was carried out according to Aebersold et al. (34Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2/acetonitrile 95:5 (v/v) containing 0.2% Ca2+ overnight. Tryptic digest were extracted from the membrane by acidification with 10% trifluoroacetic acid. Extracts were separated by microbore HPLC on a Brownlee Aquapore RP-300 column (2.1 × 100 mm) in the following buffer system: Buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, Buffer B: 0.09 trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/H2O, 70:30 (v/v) using a gradient of 0–100% Buffer B at 25 °C at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Eluting peptides were monitored at 220 nm using a Waters 490 detector and collected manually. Fractions were either lyophylized or loaded directly on a glass fiber filter for sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 477A automated sequencer coupled to an on-line 120A HPLC system. Generation of Dα5 Antibodies—A peptide-specific antibody was generated in rabbits against the peptide NH2-CSDTSSERKHQILSDVELK-COOH corresponding to amino acids 650–664 of the Dα5 sequence. The production and affinity purification of the antibody was carried out by BioSynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of protein fractions to be analyzed were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels, followed by blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight in blocking solution, incubated with Dα5 antibody (1:500 dilution), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:8000) (Bio-Rad). For antibody visualization the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) was used. Photoaffinity Labeling of the Acetylcholine Receptor Protein— Derivatization of 125I-α-bungarotoxin with methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate had no noticeable effect on the ability of the toxin to bind to the membrane bound α-bungarotoxin-binding protein. The dissociation kinetics of the derivatized toxin by unlabeled α-bungarotoxin prior to photoactivation was also unaffected displacing more than 80% of the derivatized toxin in 2 h. After photoactivation more than 80% of the photolyzable toxin derivative bound irreversible to the membrane and could not be displaced by a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled α-bungarotoxin (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 1 labeling of the membrane fraction from Drosophila heads allows detection of two major bands with masses of 42 and 57 kDa (after correction for the mass of the toxin). Preincubation of the membranes with the cholinergic ligands α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgtx), α-cobratoxin (α-Cbtx), κ-toxin, Ach, or nicotine (Nic) prevented labeling of the two major bands of 42 and 57 kDa as well as three very weak bands of 78 and 26 kDa. Fig. 2 shows the results if the affinity labeling is carried out after preincubation of the membrane fraction with either increasing concentrations of Ach (Fig. 2A) or increasing concentrations of α-bungarotoxin (Fig. 2B).

RNAi in African trypanosomes has been shown to be involved in regulating the transcript abundance of retroposons, and the process currently represents the method of choice in gene function studies of the parasite. However, little is known concerning the mechanistic and structural aspects of the processing reaction. This is in part due to the absence of a trypanosome-specific RNAi in vitro system. Here we demonstrate that both the Dicer and the RNA-induced silencing complex steps of the RNAi reaction pathway can be monitored in vitro using cell-free trypanosome extracts. The two in vitro activities and the generated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are characterized by features known from other organisms, and we demonstrate that chemically as well as enzymatically synthesized siRNAs are functional in the parasite. Thus, the transfection of synthetic siRNAs can be used to rapidly monitor gene knockdown phenotypes in Trypanosoma brucei, which should be helpful in genome-wide, RNAi-based screening experiments.

In animals, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; PNK, polynucleotide kinase; nt, nucleotide; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate. has been shown to induce a gene-specific silencing reaction known as RNA interference (RNAi) (2Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar, 3Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). The phenomenon is characterized by the ribonucleolytic degradation of the dsRNA into 21–26-nt-long RNA molecules, which have been termed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siRNAs represent trans-acting specificity determinants of the RNAi reaction pathway, which results in the degradation of homologous transcripts. The in vivo function of RNAi seems to be an adaptive genome defense reaction against viruses and mobile genetic elements in addition to functioning in the developmental regulation of gene expression (1Tomari Y.

The reaction pathway has been shown to be widely conserved, and as a consequence, has become a powerful experimental tool to study gene knockdown or loss-of-function phenotypes in many organisms (3Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar, 15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T.

The current knowledge of the mechanism and the participating molecular components of the RNAi pathway is mainly derived from cell-free RNAi in vitro systems (18Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar, 19Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3191-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). It was shown that the dsRNA trigger is first processed by the nuclease Dicer, which is a member of the class 3 ribonuclease III superfamily. Dicer contains two RNaseIII domains (18Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar), and each domain coordinates a Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion. The cations function as nucleophiles in the hydrolysis of the two RNA strands (22Blaszczyk J. Tropea J.E. Bubunenko M. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Court D.L. Ji X. Structure. 2001; 9: 1225-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 149-174Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction generates the above described 21–26-nt siRNAs, which are double-stranded with 2-nt single-stranded 3′ overhangs. The 5′ termini are phosphorylated, whereas the 3′ ends contain hydroxyl groups (13Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). For recombinant human Dicer, it was shown that the dsRNA cleavage is an endonucleolytic reaction (25Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The Dicer-generated siRNAs are assembled together with accessory proteins, such as Drosophila R2D2, into a so-called “RNA-induced silencing complex” (RISC) (1Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J.

Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For the sequence-specific mRNA recognition, siRNAs become unwound in an ATP-dependent reaction in the presence of AGO2 (30Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 31Nykanen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability at either end of the siRNA determines which of the two strands of the symmetric molecule remains in the RISC complex and guides the recognition of the mRNA via base pairing (1Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 32Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). After the hybridization, the mRNA is endonucleolytically cleaved by the endonuclease Slicer (4Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2004; 305: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), and the resulting mRNA fragments are likely subjected to nonspecific degradation processes in the cytoplasm. RNAi has been identified in higher eukaryotic organisms as well as in lower eukaryotes such as Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite (33Ullu E. Tschudi C. Chakraborty T. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Hannon G.J. Rossi J.J. Nature. 2004; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). This suggests that the reaction pathway emerged early during evolution, although not all protozoan organisms are RNAi-positive (33Ullu E. Tschudi C. Chakraborty T. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 35DaRocha W.D. Otsu K. Teixeira S.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 133: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For T. brucei, which is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in Africa, it was shown that siRNAs with a length of 24–26 nt appear after transfection or expression of dsRNA in vivo. About 30% of these siRNAs encode sequences from retroposons, which indicates that RNAi, at least in part, is involved in the control of retroposon transcripts (37Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1522-1530PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to other organisms, only one RNAi component has so far been identified in the parasite. The polypeptide is a member of the AGO protein family and has been termed TbAGO1 (38Durand-Dubief M. Bastin P. BMC Biol. 2003; 1 (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/1/2): 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TbAGO1 is essential for RNAi in insect stage trypanosomes and was shown to be assembled in siRNA-associated ribonucleoprotein particles, which are important for the stabilization and/or generation of siRNAs (39Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the T. brucei genome data base is near to completion, data base mining has up to now failed to identify a Dicer homologue (33Ullu E. Tschudi C. Chakraborty T. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biochemical in vitro systems for the characterization of putative RNAi components have not been described, despite the fact that the RNAi pathway is the preferred technology to down-regulate gene expression in the parasite (for recent reviews, see Ullu et al. (33Ullu E. Tschudi C. Chakraborty T. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Motyka and Englund (6Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Here we present two in vitro assays that recapitulate the dsRNA processing and mRNA degradation steps of the RNAi pathway in T. brucei cell-free extracts. The dsRNA processing reaction shows Dicer-like characteristics, and the in vitro-generated siRNAs are characterized by structural features known from other organisms (13Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that synthetic siRNAs are capable of mediating a sequence-specific mRNA degradation reaction in vitro and that the transfection of siRNAs results in a sequence-specific knockdown in vivo. Parasite extracts were prepared from the insect life cycle stage of T. brucei strain 427, which was grown in SDM79 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (42Brun R. Schonenberger Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanosome cells (final cell density 2.5 × 109 cells/ml) were washed in 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 100 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2 and hypotonically shocked in 1 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. After mechanical cell breakage, the buffer conditions were adjusted to 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 100 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and were typically in the range of 4–5 mg/ml. T. brucei cell-free extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 200,000 × g. The supernatant (50 μl, protein concentration 2–3 mg/ml) was mixed with 60 pm radioactively labeled α-tubulin dsRNA in 50 μlof 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 100 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP and incubated for 60 min at 28 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of phenol, and a 5′ radioactively labeled 18-nt RNA molecule was added as an internal standard. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the RNA was analyzed in urea-containing polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive signals were detected by phosphor-imaging and analyzed using the software Image Gauge 3.41 (Fuji). T. brucei cell-free extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 12 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (50 μl, protein concentration ≤4 mg/ml) was mixed with 10 pm radioactively labeled α-tubulin sense or antisense RNA and 10–100 nm siRNA si-315 in 50 μl of 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 100 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 500 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.2 units/μl RNasin (Promega). After incubation (28 °C, 60 min), the reaction was terminated by the addition of phenol and further treated as described for the Dicer in vitro assay. Sense and antisense α-tubulin RNAs (GeneDB Tb927.1.2360, position 299–414) were synthesized by in vitro transcription from PCR templates derived from plasmid pZJM-αTubTrunc. Transcription reactions were performed in 20 μl containing 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase, 500 ng of PCR product, 1 mm GTP, CTP, UTP, 20 μm ATP, and 80 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 40 units of RNasin. After incubation (2 h, 37 °C), the two RNAs were purified by phenol extraction followed by gel filtration. Annealing of α-tubulin dsRNA was performed by heating (1 min, 95 °C) of equimolar amounts of sense and antisense RNA followed by cooling to 25 °C at a rate of 0.02 °C/s. Residual single-stranded RNA was digested with 250 units of RNaseT1 for 30 min at 37 °C. Annealed dsRNA was separated in native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, excised, and gel-eluted. Template DNA for the synthesis of siRNA si-315 was amplified by PCR using the oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers si-315-5′: 5′-ACCTGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGCGTGGCCACTACACCATTGGTAAAGAAAAGTTACC-3′ (T7 promoter underlined) and si-315-3′: 5′-CTCGTGGCCACTACACCATTGGTAACTTTTTCTTTACC-3′. Transcription reactions were performed as described above with 50 μg of PCR template in a reaction volume of 4 ml. After annealing and RNaseT1 digestion (5000 units of RNaseT1, 1 h, 37 °C), si-315 was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. 5′ phosphorylation and 3′ dephosphorylation was performed with 100 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and 1 mm ATP in PNK buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. si-315 RNA was finally separated in 5% (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and gel-eluted. siRNAs si-329 (sense strand, 5′-UUGGUAAGGAGAUCGUCGACCUU-3′, antisense strand, 5′-GGUCGACGAUCUCCUUACCAAUU-3′), si-956 (sense strand, 5′-CCGUGGUGACGUUGUGCCAAAUU-3′, antisense strand, 5′-UUUGGCACAACGUCACCACGGUU-3′) and si-315-26 (sense strand, 5′-CGUGGCCACUACACCAUUGGUAAGAA-3′, antisense strand, 5′-CUUACCAAUGGUGUAGUGGCCACGAG-3′) were chemically synthesized using 2′-t-butyldimethylsilyl-protected phosphoramidite chemistry. The RNAs were annealed and radioactively end-labeled following standard procedures. The thermodynamic stability of siRNAs was calculated as in Ref. 44Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D.

RNaseT1 digestion of siRNAs was performed using 10 units/μl RNaseT1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 for 60 min at 27 °C. Reactions were terminated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Digestion products were analyzed in denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The dephosphorylation of 3′-terminal phosphate groups was performed by incubation with 10 units of T4 PNK in PNK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA). The dephosphorylation of both 3′- and 5′-phosphate groups was achieved with 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA (8Schwarz D.S. Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 787-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After incubation (1 h, 37 °C), the siRNAs were extracted with phenol and chloroform and analyzed in denaturing 18% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. pZJM-Timer—The coding region of Fluorescent Timer (45Terskikh A.

After digestion with XhoI and HinDIII, the PCR product was inserted into pZJM (46Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

After digestion with XhoI and HinDIII, the PCR product was inserted into pZJM (46Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

Plasmid pRNAi-Timer contains a constitutive expression site for Fluorescent Timer (45Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I.

For the construction of pRNAi-Timer, the vector pZJM-Timer was digested with BamHI and KpnI. The resulting 1280-bp RNAi site was ligated into the EcoRI restriction site of vector pLew82-TimerΔOp, which is an operator-minus derivative of pLew82 (47Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To eliminate the operator, pLew82 was digested with BglII and religated. The coding region of Fluorescent Timer was amplified as described for pZJM-Timer with the exception of the timer-antisense primer. The luciferase gene in pLew82 was substituted by the PCR product, using the BamHI and HinDIII restriction sites. T. brucei 29-13 (48Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) parasites containing a stably integrated pRNAi-Timer gene construct were grown in SDM79 (42Brun R. Schonenberger Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in the presence of 15 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Parasites were washed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm K2HPO4, 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2,5mm MgCl2,2mm EDTA and resuspended to a cell density of 4 × 108 cells/ml. For transfection, 108 parasites were electroporated with 10–100 μg of RNA at 1.6 kV, 25 microfarads, and 24–32 ohms. Two pulses were delivered, and cells were transferred into 10 ml of supplemented SDM79. Cells were monitored 18 h after electroporation by fluorescence microscopy. Digital images were processed with IPlab 3.6 (Scanalytics) and PhotoShop 7.0 (Adobe). Dicer in Vitro Assay—siRNA transfection has been demonstrated as a fast and efficient method to knock down gene expression in higher eukaryotic organisms (15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 49Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Although siRNAs have been identified in African trypanosomes (37Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1522-1530PubMed Google Scholar), the technique has so far not been used in the protozoan parasite. In addition, structural and mechanistic aspects of the RNAi reaction in trypanosomes are only poorly understood. This is in part due to the absence of an RNAi in vitro system to monitor the individual steps of the RNA processing reaction. siRNAs have been shown to be generated by the ribonucleolytic action of the RNaseIII-type enzyme Dicer (18Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Thus, we tried to identify a Dicer-like activity in cell-free extracts of trypanosomes. Fig. 1A shows a representative example of the Dicer in vitro assay. Incubation of a 131-bp internally 32P-labeled dsRNA with a cell-free protein extract of insect-stage T. brucei resulted in the processing of the dsRNA into a population of siRNA-like molecules with a length of about 25 nt. The extent of cleavage was dependent on the extract concentration and on the duration of the incubation. siRNA-like molecules appeared after 15 min and reached a maximal level around 90 min. Two dsRNA processing intermediates with lengths diagnostic of a gradual removal of one or two siRNA units appeared with a similar kinetic. At a time point of 180 min, >95% of the input dsRNA was processed. Titration experiments (Fig. 1, B and C) revealed that the Dicer-like activity is dependent on the presence of optimally 1 mm ATP and that it requires divalent cations such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ but not Ca2+. ATP can be substituted by ADP and by the ATP analogues ATPγS and AMP-CPP, which contain only one hydrolyzable phosphoanhydride bond (data not shown). The Dicer-like activity further showed a pH optimum of pH 8 and a temperature optimum of 27 °C, which represents the optimal growth temperature of the insect life cycle stage of the parasite (data not shown). Hydrolysis of the in vitro-generated siRNAs with the single strand-specific RNase T1 verified that the short RNAs are mostly double-stranded (Fig. 2A). However, an increase in the electrophoretic mobility suggested the presence of short single-stranded overhangs of about 1–2 nt, which was confirmed by nuclease S1 digestion (data not shown). Further experiments demonstrated that both strands of the input dsRNA were present in the siRNA-like molecules (Fig. 2C). Since 5′-phosphate groups are important for the recruitment of siRNAs into the RISC-catalyzed mRNA cleavage reaction (1Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 31Nykanen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), we addressed the phosphorylation state of the generated siRNAs. The RNAs were incubated with either alkaline phosphatase or T4 PNK, which contains a 3′-phosphatase activity. High resolution PAGE at denaturing conditions was used to detect differences in the electrophoretic mobility. Although alkaline phosphatase-treated siRNA-like molecules migrated with a reduced mobility of about 0.5 nt, PNK-treated siRNAs showed no difference (Fig. 2B). Thus, the in vitro-generated siRNAs are 5′-monophosphorylated. The data further demonstrated that the majority (≥75%) of the generated siRNAs have a length of 24–26 nt, which is in agreement with published data from in vivo studies (37Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1522-1530PubMed Google Scholar). However, shorter RNAs with a length of 22 and 23 nt as well as molecules of 27 nt were also detected. To verify whether the long siRNAs might act as precursors for the generation of shorter siRNAs, we chemically synthesized a 26-nt siRNA (si-315-26) and incubated the molecule with a Dicer-competent T. brucei extract. No processing was observed over a period of up to 90 min (see supplemental figure). Design of siRNAs and Knockdown Experiments—The described experiments established that cytosolic extracts of T. brucei contain a Dicer-like activity capable of generating short RNAs that resemble the siRNAs in higher eukaryotes (15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 18Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). To test whether chemically or in vitro transcribed siRNAs can be used as reagents to knock down gene expression in trypanosomes, we designed several α-tubulin-specific siRNAs (Fig. 3A). α-Tubulin was chosen because its gene silencing has been shown to cause a well defined morphologic phenotype known as FAT cells (17Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The design of the siRNAs was based on the recently determined correlation between the internal thermodynamic stability of siRNAs and their silencing efficiency in higher eukaryotic organisms (32Schwarz D.S.

https://openalex.org/W2042925111,"p53 plays a central role in the maintenance of the genome integrity, both as a gatekeeper and a caretaker. Sequence-specific recognition of DNA is underlying the ability of p53 to transcriptionally transactivate target genes during checkpoint control and to regulate DNA replication at the TGCCT repeat from the ribosomal gene cluster (RGC). In contrast, suppression of recombination by p53 has been observed with nonconsensus DNA sequences. In this study, we discovered that wild-type p53 stimulates homologous recombination adjacent to the RGC repeat, whereas downregulation is seen with a mutated version thereof and with a microsatellite repeat sequence. Analysis of the causes possibly underlying the enhancement of homologous recombination revealed that p53 binding to the RGC element delays DNA synthesis. This was demonstrated after integration of the corresponding DNA fragments into our Simian virus 40-based model system, which was used to study recombination on replicating minichromosomes. Differently, with plasmid-based substrates, p53 did not stimulate recombination at the RGC sequence. Thus, in combination with our previous findings, p53 may promote homologous recombination by two separate mechanisms involving either molecular interactions with topoisomerase I or/and by specific binding to certain genomic regions, thereby causing replication fork stalling and recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2041846160,"Programmed cell death (PCD), best exemplified by apoptosis, is a genetically programmed process of cellular destruction that is indispensable for normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and related cytokines are employed by host defenses to eliminate virally infected cells through induction of apoptosis. Many viruses have evolved specific gene products to modulate this process. We have recently shown that the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6 and E7 genes independently sensitize mouse cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. In this report, we investigated the effect of E6 and E7 expression on Fas-mediated apoptosis. In contrast to TNF-mediated apoptosis, E6 and E7 demonstrated opposite effects: while E7 potentiated apoptosis triggered by an agonistic Fas antibody, E6 attenuated the effect. The mitochondrial pathway leading to the activation of caspases appears to be involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis in C127 cells. To further explore the mechanisms by which E6 and E7 modulate Fas-mediated apoptosis, we examined the surface expression of Fas in cells expressing E6 and E7. Significantly, levels of surface Fas expression correlated with the opposing effects of E6 and E7 on Fas-mediated apoptosis. Specifically, while E7 increased the surface expression of Fas, E6 reduced surface Fas expression. Mutational analysis demonstrated a correlation of E6's ability to downregulate surface Fas expression and apoptosis. Since the tumor suppressor p53 can be targeted for degradation by human papillomavirus and has been shown to induce apoptosis by upregulating surface Fas expression, we investigated the role of p53 in BPV-1 E6 and E7 modulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that the modulatory effects by E6 and E7 could occur in the absence of p53. Interestingly, the reduced Fas protein level on the cell surface is not accompanied by a decrease in total Fas levels in E6-expressing cells. Instead, considerably more Fas protein is found in the cytoplasm of cells expressing E6. These results highlight a novel activity of E6 and E7 that may be involved in viral pathogenesis."
