https://openalex.org/W2127810309,"We generated transgenic mice in which red, green, yellow, or cyan fluorescent proteins (together termed XFPs) were selectively expressed in neurons. All four XFPs labeled neurons in their entirety, including axons, nerve terminals, dendrites, and dendritic spines. Remarkably, each of 25 independently generated transgenic lines expressed XFP in a unique pattern, even though all incorporated identical regulatory elements (from the thyl gene). For example, all retinal ganglion cells or many cortical neurons were XFP positive in some lines, whereas only a few ganglion cells or only layer 5 cortical pyramids were labeled in others. In some lines, intense labeling of small neuronal subsets provided a Golgi-like vital stain. In double transgenic mice expressing two different XFPs, it was possible to differentially label 3 neuronal subsets in a single animal."

Based on the fluorescence microscopic observations of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, we found that various arginine-rich peptides have a translocation activity very similar to Tat-(48–60). These included such peptides as the d-amino acid- and arginine-substituted Tat-(48–60), the RNA-binding peptides derived from virus proteins, such as HIV-1 Rev, and flock house virus coat proteins, and the DNA binding segments of leucine zipper proteins, such as cancer-related proteins c-Fos and c-Jun, and the yeast transcription factor GCN4. These segments have no specific primary and secondary structures in common except that they have several arginine residues in the sequences. Moreover, these peptides were able to be internalized even at 4 °C. These results strongly suggested the possible existence of a common internalization mechanism ubiquitous to arginine-rich peptides, which is not explained by a typical endocytosis. Using (Arg)n (n = 4–16) peptides, we also demonstrated that there would be an optimal number of arginine residues (n ∼ 8) for the efficient translocation.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By genetically or chemically hybridizing these carrier peptides, the efficient intracellular delivery of various oligopeptides and proteins was achieved. One of the most amazing examples is the Tat-β-galactosidase fusion protein (4Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), which has a molecular mass as high as 120 kDa. Intraperitoneal injection of the protein resulted in delivery of the protein with β-galactosidase activity to various tissues in mice, including the brain. The peptide-mediated approaches would allow the incorporation of peptides containing unnatural amino acids or nonpeptide molecules such as fluorescence probes. These methods would become powerful tools not only for therapeutic purposes as an alternative to gene delivery, but also for the understanding of the mechanisms behind fundamental cellular events, such as signal transduction and gene transcription. Besides the potential of Tat-(48–60) as a protein carrier, the internalization mechanism of the peptide attracted our interest. For example, Tat-(48–60) (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) is a highly basic and hydrophilic peptide, which contains 6 arginine and 2 lysine residues in its 13 amino acid residues. However, the peptide was reported to be translocated through the cell membranes in 5 min at a concentration of 0.1 μm (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Internalization of the peptide was not inhibited even at 4 °C. The peptide is less toxic to cells than other basic membrane-interacting agents. The above features suggested that the internalization mechanism of Tat-(48–60) was completely different from the typical transmembrane mechanisms reported so far. Questions arise as to whether such an efficient translocation is specific for Tat-(48–60) and Antennapedia-(43–58) peptides and what is the mechanism of the highly efficient internalization. Based on experiments using synthetic peptides, we suggest the possible presence of a very similar translocation mechanism to Tat-(48–60) present among the various arginine-rich peptides. We also suggest the possible existence of the optimum chain length of arginine peptides for the internalization. All the peptides used in this study were chemically synthesized by Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Rink amide resin as reported previously (12Futaki S. Ishikawa T. Niwa M. Kitagawa K. Yagami T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of the peptides was conducted by the treatment with 1.5 eq of 5-maleimidofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) in dimethylformamide-methanol (1:2) for 3 h followed by reverse-phase HPLC purification. The fidelity of the products was ascertained by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Carbonic anhydrase in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was simultaneously treated with fluorescein-5(6)-carboxamidocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) andN-(6-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (Dojin) (15 eq, each) at room temperature for 1 h to introduce the fluorescein and the maleimide function to the protein. After the removal of the unreacted reagents by gel-filtration on a Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, the cysteine of the respective arginine-rich peptides was allowed to react with the maleimide moiety on the above fluorescein-labeled protein at room temperature for 16 h, and then the unreacted peptides were removed by gel-filtration. Based on the molecular weight estimation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, one or two molecules of basic peptides and fluorescein per protein were incorporated, respectively. Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown on 60-mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 to ∼70% confluence. A subculture was performed every 3–4 days. For each assay, 4 × 104/ml cells were pelleted on a eight-well Lab-Tek-II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc) (250 μl/well) and cultured for 16 h. After complete adhesion, the culture medium was exchanged. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with the fresh medium (250 μl) containing fluorescein-labeled peptides or proteins. The concentrations of the peptides and proteins were adjusted before addition to the cell based on their fluorescent intensity. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with acetone-methanol (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS again, and then mounted in fluorescent mounting medium containing 15 mmNaN3 (Dako). The distribution of fluorescein-labeled peptides was analyzed on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope using a 100× oil immersion lens. Cells were grown, incubated with proteins, and fixed basically as described above. Cells were then treated with PBS containing 5 μm propidium iodide (200 μl) at room temperature for 30 min, washed four times with PBS, and mounted in glycerol:PBS (9:1) containing 1%p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Data were obtained using a confocal scanning laser microscope MRC 1024 (Bio-Rad) equipped with a 60× oil immersion lens or LSM 510 (Zeiss) equipped with a 40× lens. The MTT assay was conducted basically in the same manner as reported previously (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 104/well) were cultured in 96-microtiter plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of peptides (HIV-1 Tat-(48–60): GRKKRRQRRRPPQ-amide; R9-Tat: GRRRRRRRRRPPQ-amide; HIV-1 Rev-(34–50): TRQARRNRRRRWRERQR-amide; FHV coat-(35–49): RRRRNRTRRNRRRVR-amide) at 10 or 100 μm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 24 h before addition of MTT (Sigma, 5 mg/ml in PBS) for 4 h. The precipitated MTT formazan was dissolved overnight in 0.04 n HCl in isopropanol (100 μl). The absorbance at 570 nm was then measured. Cell viability was expressed as the ratio of the A 570 of cells treated with peptide over the control samples. To obtain insight into the translocation mechanisms of the Tat-(48–60) peptide, Tat-(48–60), its d-amino acid-substituted analog (d-Tat) and arginine-substituted analog (R9-Tat), where residues corresponding to positions 49–57 were replaced with arginine, were synthesized (Fig.1 a). An extra cysteine amide was incorporated into the C terminus of each peptide for the fluorescent labeling. The peptides corresponding to nuclear localization sequences (NLS) derived from simian virus 40 (13) and nucleoplasmin (14Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) were also synthesized as references. Treatment of the peptides with 5-maleimidofluorescein diacetate gave the corresponding fluorescein-labeled peptides. Internalization of the peptides was monitored by fluorescence microscopic observation after a 3-h incubation of the peptides with mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells at 37 °C. As a result, d-Tat and R9-Tat were internalized into the cell as efficiently as the Tat-(48–60) peptides, and localization into both the cytoplasm and nucleus was observed (Fig. 2). A similar internalization of the d-amino acid analog of Tat was reported by Huq et al. (15Huq I. Ping Y.-H. Tamilarasu N. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a linear peptide corresponding to residues 37–72. These results would contradict the idea that a specific receptor may play a crucial role in the translocation of the Tat-(48–60) peptide. On the other hand, the simian virus 40-derived and nucleoplasmin-derived peptides showed a much lower degree of internalization. These NLS-derived peptides are rich in lysine. The above results suggested that arginine residues would play an important role in the translocation.Figure 2Translocation of the arginine-rich Tat-related peptides through the cell membranes. RAW264.7 cells were treated with fluorescein-labeled peptides derived from HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) (a), R9-Tat (b),d-Tat (c), and nucleoplasmin-NLS (d) (10 μm each) for 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Arginine-rich basic segments are used by a variety of RNA-binding proteins to recognize specific RNA structures (16Tan R. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). If arginine in the sequence plays an important role in the translocation, peptides corresponding to these RNA-binding segments may translocate through the cell membranes. To test this hypothesis, 10 arginine-rich RNA-binding peptides bearing a C-terminal Gly-Cys-amide (Fig. 1 b) were similarly prepared, fluorescein-labeled, and applied to the macrophage cells. To our surprise, all the peptides other than the human U2AF-(142–153) peptide translocated through the cell membranes and accumulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3). As judged from the fluorescent intensity, the efficiency of incorporation into the cells showed a tendency to correspond to the number of arginine residues in the sequence. Internalization activity of the HIV-1 Rev-(34–50), FHV coat-(35–49), HTLV-II Rex-(4–16), and BMV Gag-(7–25) peptides, which have more than seven arginine residues in their sequences, were comparable with that of the Tat-(48–60) peptide. Fluorescence was observed in the cells as early as 5 min after the addition of these peptides (1 μm) to the medium. Less extensive internalization was observed in the case of the λ N-(1–22), φ21 N-(12–29), and yeast PRP6-(129–144) peptides that have five arginine residues in their sequences. The fluorescent intensity in the cells treated with the former peptides (0.1 μm) was judged not to be less than that in those treated with the latter peptides (10 μm). The P22 N-(14–30) and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus Gag-(7–25) peptides that have six arginine residues showed a moderate degree of translocation. HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) is reported to translocate through the cell membranes and accumulate in the nucleus, especially the nucleolus (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). A similar tendency was observed with the above peptides. Not only the RNA-binding peptides but also the DNA-binding peptides corresponding to the basic leucine zipper segments derived from cancer-related proteins, c-Fos and c-Jun, and the yeast transcription factor, GCN4, which were also rich in arginine (Fig. 1 c), were internalized into the cells with almost the same efficiency as that of Tat-(48–60) (Fig.4).Figure 4Translocation of DNA-binding peptides through the cell membranes. RAW264.7 cells were treated with the fluorescein-labeled peptides derived from human c-Jun-(252–279) (a) and yeast GCN4-(231–252) (b) (1 μm each) for 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) was reported to induce little toxicity to HeLa cells (2Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Using R9-Tat, HIV-1 Rev-(34–50), and FHV coat-(35–49) peptides as representatives of the above arginine-rich peptides, cytotoxicity of the peptides was investigated. Determined by the MTT assay, the above peptides did not show a significant cytotoxicity to the macrophage cells during the treatment with a peptide (10 μm) for 24 h. At 100 μm, cell viability of the cells treated with R9-Tat became 70%, whereas viability of those treated with other peptides as well as HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) was still greater than 95%. These results suggested that many of the arginine-rich peptides can be of low cytotoxicity as reported for the HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) peptide. The above experiments showed that a variety of arginine-rich RNA/DNA-binding peptides were able to translocate through the cell membranes. Little homology in these sequences was observed, except that they all have 5–11 arginine residues. Moreover, thed-amino acid substituted Rev-(34–50) peptide (1 μm) was internalized as efficiently as thel-peptide in 3 h (data not shown). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the HIV-1 Tat-(48–60), R9-Tat, and FHV coat-(35–49) peptides in methanol were suggestive of their not having a significant secondary structure (Fig.5), whereas the HIV-1 Rev-(34–50) peptide showed a spectrum typical of an α-helical peptide. The U2AF peptide, which was only slightly internalized into the cell, showed a spectrum very similar to that of the FHV coat-(35–49) peptide. These results were suggestive of the absence of even a common secondary structure in the membrane-permeable peptides. When the cells were incubated with a peptide (1 μm) at 4 °C for 30 min, no significant decrease in fluorescent intensity in the cell was observed using the HIV-1 Rev-(34–50), and FHV coat-(35–49) peptides (Fig.6). These results suggested that typical endocytosis pathways so far established would not play a crucial role in the translocation of these arginine-rich peptides.Figure 6Effect of temperature on HIV-1 Rev-(34–50) peptide internalization. The cells were incubated with the peptide (1 μm) for 30 min at 4 °C or at 37 °C. In the former case, the cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h before addition of the peptide. All the following procedures were also conducted at 4 °C until the completion of the fixation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next focused on the question whether the entry of arginine-rich peptides into the cells is one-way or not. The cells were treated with the HIV-1 Rev-(34–50) peptide (1 μm) for 3 h, then the medium was exchanged with a fresh one not containing the peptide. The fluorescence intensity from the cells 1 h later was almost comparable with or only slightly less than that of the cells just before the medium exchange. However, a substantial decrease in the fluorescence intensity was recognized in the cells 6 h later, and complete disappearance of the fluorescence was observed 24 h later. To examine if the above results were due to the leakage of the peptide from the cells, the medium was analyzed by an HPLC equipped with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. No peak was detected at the retention time corresponding to the peptide; however, peaks were observed that eluted at positions identical with those of the peptide treated with trypsin (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the cells mainly resulted from the degradation of the peptides, and not from the leakage of the intact peptide. The question whether the ingested peptide had a certain effect on the cell growth was also examined. The above HIV-1 Rev-(34–50)-treated cells were harvested 24 h later and counted. The cell number for the peptide-treated cells was comparable with that for the control cells (without peptide treatment). Thus, the peptide-ingesting cells were judged to remain viable to divide with little effect by the peptide. It would be plausible that the peptide evenly distributes in each of the daughter cells upon cell division, since significant differences in the florescence intensity were not observed among the adjoining cells 6 h later. Considering the doubling time of the cell, which was estimated to be about 18 h, a certain amount of cells must have divided within the 6 h. If the peptides would preferentially stay in one of the daughter cells upon cell division, a certain discrepancy in the fluorescence intensity will be observed among the adjacent cells. However, further study will be necessary to adequately address this question. To examine the applicability of the above basic peptides as protein carriers, we prepared basic peptide-protein conjugates. Carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) was selected as a model protein. Basic peptide-carbonic anhydrase conjugates were prepared using N-(6-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (EMCS) as a cross-linking agent (17Tachibana R. Harashima H. Shono M. Azumano M. Niwa M. Futaki S. Kiwada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). A fluorescein moiety was introduced into the protein using the fluorescein-5(6)-carboxamidocaproic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester simultaneously with EMCS. As judged from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the conjugates, one to two molecules of the basic peptide and fluorescein moiety were introduced into a molecule of carbonic anhydrase, respectively. Carbonic anhydrase was successfully delivered into the cells with the help of the HIV-1 Rev-(34–50), FHV coat-(35–49), and R9-Tat peptides as efficiently as with the HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) peptide (Fig. 7 B). Accumulation of the conjugates in the cytosol and nucleus was also observed by fluorescence microscopy of the cells without fixation (Fig. 7 B). Confocal microscopic analysis of these conjugates demonstrated both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization and not just attachment to the cellular membranes (Fig. 7 C). On the other hand, fluorescein-labeled protein without a carrier peptide was located in a limited part of the cytosol (Fig. 7 C). This result suggested that the protein was captured in the endosomes and was not able to be released into the cytosol. Myoglobin (17 kDa) was also introduced into the cell with the help of these carrier peptides (data not shown). The above data strongly suggested the importance of arginine residues in the internalization. The possible existence of the unique internalization mechanism common in these arginine-rich peptides was also suggested. We then examined the effect of the number of arginine residues in the sequences. For simplification, peptides that are composed of 4–16 residues of arginine were prepared (Fig.1 d). To their C termini, the Gly-Cys-amide segment was also attached for the fluorescein labeling. These results are shown in Fig.8 A. Considerable difference was recognized on the translocation efficiency and intracellular localization among these peptides. R4 showed extremely low translocation activity. R6 and R8 exhibited the maximum internalization and accumulation in the nucleus. What is interesting is that the degree of internalization decreased as the chain length further increased. For the R16, internalization of the peptide was not significant. The same kind of difference was recognized in the experiments using the conjugates of carbonic anhydrase with the arginine peptides (Fig. 8 B). A similar tendency was observed on the protein delivery using R8 and R16 as the carrier molecules. Based on the confocal laser microscopic observations, the R8-carbonic anhydrase conjugate was efficiently internalized into the macrophage cells and accumulation in the nucleus was observed as was seen in the case of the HIV-1 Rev-(34–50) conjugate. In contrast, the R16-conjugate seemed to mainly reside on the cell membranes after a 3-h incubation with the conjugate, but significant accumulation in the nucleus was not observed. In this report, we have shown that not only Tat-(48–60) but also various arginine-rich peptides were able to translocate through the mouse macrophage membranes. These peptides include the d- and arginine-substituted HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) analogs, RNA-binding peptides derived from proteins, such as HIV-1 Rev, HTLV-II Rex, BMV Gag, and FHV coat proteins, and the DNA-binding segments from c-Fos, c-Jun, and the GCN4 proteins. There seems a common or very similar mechanism for the internalization among these peptides. The mechanism is explained neither by adsorptive-mediated endocytosis nor by receptor-mediated endocytosis because the peptides were internalized by the cell at 4 °C, and there seemed little homology both in the primary and secondary structures among these membrane-permeable peptides except that they have several arginine residues in the sequences. These results strongly suggest the possible presence of the common and undefined internalization mechanisms ubiquitously laying among the arginine-rich basic peptides. As one more new finding concerning the features of the internalization, we have shown that the number of arginine residues has a significant influence on the method of internalization and that there seems to be an optimal number of arginine residues for the internalization. There still remain questions why such efficient translocation is possible for the arginine-rich peptides. Possible hydrogen bond formation of arginine with lipid phosphates (18Calnan B.J. Tidor B. Biancalana S. Hudson D. Frankel A.D. Science. 1991; 252: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) or interaction with extracellular matrices such as heparan sulfate (19Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) may be involved in the initial step during the mechanism. However, as was seen in the case of the R16peptide, it is not enough to explain the mechanism only by considering adsorption of peptides on the membranes. Tat-(48–60) has been reported to carry various proteins into the cells not only into cultured cells but also into the various organs of a living mouse (4Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). As the arginine-rich peptides examined here seem to have a similar ability as carriers of proteins, further study of the arginine-based peptides may result in finding peptides penetrating to some specific cells by themselves or with the help of other address peptides. The results obtained here not only shed light on the possible presence of new types of ubiquitous transmembrane mechanisms for the arginine-rich peptides, but also on the development of novel carrier molecules for the intracellular protein delivery. We are grateful to Drs. S. Tanaka and Y. Sugimoto (Kyoto University) and Professor H. Harashima (Hokkaido University) for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1966476278,"We have identified a stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA) that promotes neural differentiation of mouse ES cells. SDIA accumulates on the surface of PA6 stromal cells and induces efficient neuronal differentiation of cocultured ES cells in serum-free conditions without use of either retinoic acid or embryoid bodies. BMP4, which acts as an antineuralizing morphogen in Xenopus, suppresses SDIA-induced neuralization and promotes epidermal differentiation. A high proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons producing dopamine are obtained from SDIA-treated ES cells. When transplanted, SDIA-induced dopaminergic neurons integrate into the mouse striatum and remain positive for tyrosine hydroxylase expression. Neural induction by SDIA provides a new powerful tool for both basic neuroscience research and therapeutic applications."

Genes of the PSYN group showed a different combination of decreased expression across subjects. Over 250 other gene groups did not show altered expression. Selected PSYN microarray observations were verified by in situ hybridization. Two of the most consistently changed transcripts in the PSYN functional gene group, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor and synapsin II, were decreased in ten of ten and nine of ten subjects with schizophrenia, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1976824219,"Multipotent stem cells that generate both neurons and glia are widespread components of the early neuroepithelium. During CNS development, neurogenesis largely precedes gliogenesis: how is this timing achieved? Using clonal cell culture combined with long-term time-lapse video microscopy, we show that isolated stem cells from the embryonic mouse cerebral cortex exhibit a distinct order of cell-type production: neuroblasts first and glioblasts later. This is accompanied by changes in their capacity to make neurons versus glia and in their response to the mitogen EGF. Hence, multipotent stem cells alter their properties over time and undergo distinct phases of development that play a key role in scheduling production of diverse CNS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090919511,"Chitinases are ubiquitous chitin-fragmenting hydrolases. Recently we discovered the first human chitinase, named chitotriosidase, that is specifically expressed by phagocytes. We here report the identification, purification, and subsequent cloning of a second mammalian chitinase. This enzyme is characterized by an acidic isoelectric point and therefore named acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase). In rodents and man the enzyme is relatively abundant in the gastrointestinal tract and is found to a lesser extent in the lung. Like chitotriosidase, AMCase is synthesized as a 50-kDa protein containing a 39-kDa N-terminal catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain. In contrast to chitotriosidase, the enzyme is extremely acid stable and shows a distinct second pH optimum around pH 2. AMCase is capable of cleaving artificial chitin-like substrates as well as crab shell chitin and chitin as present in the fungal cell wall. Our study has revealed the existence of a chitinolytic enzyme in the gastrointestinal tract and lung that may play a role in digestion and/or defense. Chitinases are ubiquitous chitin-fragmenting hydrolases. Recently we discovered the first human chitinase, named chitotriosidase, that is specifically expressed by phagocytes. We here report the identification, purification, and subsequent cloning of a second mammalian chitinase. This enzyme is characterized by an acidic isoelectric point and therefore named acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase). In rodents and man the enzyme is relatively abundant in the gastrointestinal tract and is found to a lesser extent in the lung. Like chitotriosidase, AMCase is synthesized as a 50-kDa protein containing a 39-kDa N-terminal catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain.

Parasit. 1994; 79: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are endo-β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidases that can fragment chitin and have been identified in several organisms (6Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Until a few years ago it was generally assumed that man lacks the ability to produce a functional chitinase. Our observation of a markedly elevated chitotriosidase activity in plasma of symptomatic Gaucher patients formed the basis for the subsequent identification of a human phagocyte-specific chitinase, named chitotriosidase (7Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J.

Tissue macrophages can synthesize large amounts of chitotriosidase upon an appropriate stimulus, such as the massive lysosomal lipid accumulation that occurs in macrophages of Gaucher patients (7Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Chitotriosidase is largely secreted as a 50-kDa active enzyme containing a C-terminal chitin binding domain (10Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A. Donker-Koopman W.E. van den Berg M. Muijsers A.O.

In macrophages some enzyme is proteolytically processed to a C-terminally truncated 39-kDa form with hydrolase activity that accumulates in lysosomes of these cells (10Renkema G.H. Boot R.G.

The 50-kDa chitotriosidase form is also synthesized by progenitors of neutrophilic granulocytes (9Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol.

Chitotriosidase is remarkably homologous to chitinases from plants, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and insects (8Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol.

Analogous to some plant chitinases, recombinant chitotriosidase has been found to inhibit hyphal growth of chitin-containing fungi such as Candida andAspergillusspecies. 1R. G. Boot, E. F. C.

Aerts, manuscript in preparation.The specific expression by phagocytes also suggests a physiological role in defense against chitin-containing pathogens. A recessively inherited deficiency in chitotriosidase activity is frequently encountered (7Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 13Guo Y.F. He W. Boer A.M. Wevers R.A. Debruijn A.M. Groener J.E.M.M. Hollak C.E.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Galjaard H. Van Diggelen O.P. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). About 1 in 20 individuals is completely deficient in enzymatically active chitotriosidase, because of a 24-base pair duplication in the chitotriosidase gene (14Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M.

This duplication, which occurs panethnically, leads to strongly reduced amounts of an abnormally spliced mRNA only, encoding an enzymatically inactive protein that lacks an internal stretch of 29 amino acids (14Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A. Bliek J. de Meulemeester T.M. Mannens M.M. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25680-25685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In Caucasian populations, up to 35‥ of all individuals carry this abnormal chitotriosidase allele and about 5‥ are homozygous for this allele (14Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A.

The prevalence of deficiency suggests that chitotriosidase no longer fulfills an important defense function under normal circumstances or, alternatively, that other mechanisms may compensate the lack of functional chitotriosidase. To test whether compensatory mechanisms exist, we have searched for other chitinases in mammals. The discovery of a second mammalian chitinolytic enzyme is described here. The properties of this acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase)2are reported, and the possible implications of its existence are discussed. Chitinase enzyme activity was determined with the fluorogenic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-N,N′-diacetylchitobiose (4MU-chitobiose; Sigma) and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-N,N′,N“-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma). Assay mixtures contained 0.027 mm substrate and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin in McIlvaine buffer (100 mmcitric acid, 200 mm sodium phosphate) at the indicated pH. The standard enzyme activity assay for human chitotriosidase with 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-N,N′,N”-triacetylchitotriose substrate was performed at pH 5.2, as previously described (7Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The standard AMCase enzyme activity assays with 4MU-chitobiose substrate were performed at pH 4.5.

The chitin fragments were analyzed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis as described by Jackson (15Jackson P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Measurements of chitin formation during regeneration of fungal spheroplasts was performed as described by Hector and Braun (16Hector R.F. Braun P.C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, spheroplasts were prepared from the Candida albicans strain CAi-4 (ura3), grown overnight in YPD medium (1‥ yeast extract, 2‥ peptone, 2‥ glucose) at 28 °C. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation and incubated with 2.5 mg/ml zymolyase (100T, ICN Immuno Biologicals, Costa Mesa, CA) in buffer containing 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.2 m sorbitol, and 27 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 60 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing, spheroplasts were allowed to regenerate in 96-well microtiter plates in regeneration buffer (0.25‥ (w/v) MES buffer, pH 6.7, containing 0.17‥ (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and ammonium sulfate; Sigma), 0.15‥ (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2‥ (w/v) glucose, 1.2 m sorbitol, 20 μg/ml uridine) at 37 °C. Chitinase enzyme preparations were added to a final concentration of 3 μg/ml. After a 2-h incubation, 50 μl of 300 μg/ml Calcofluor white (Sigma) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.2 m sorbitol was added. After 5 min the plates were washed with buffer only, and fluorescence was determined using a LS 50 Perkin Elmer fluorimeter (excitation, 405 nm; emission, 450 nm). Detergent-free extracts of mouse tissues were prepared by homogenization in 10 volumes of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, using an Ultra-turrax and centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The mouse intestine extract was adjusted to pH 5.0 by the addition of citric acid (0.2 m); NaCl was added to a final concentration of 2m. A chitin column was prepared by mixing 10 g of swollen Sepharose G25 fine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 300 mg of colloidal chitin, followed by equilibration with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 m NaCl. The extracts were applied onto the column with a flow speed of 0.4 ml/min. After extensive washing, bound chitinase was eluted from the column with 8 m urea, which was subsequently removed by dialysis. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fractions containing chitinase activity were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (8Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). N-terminal protein sequencing was performed as described using a Procise 494 sequencer (Applied Biosystems Perkin Elmer) (8Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Colloidal chitin was prepared as described by Shimahara and Takiguchi (18Shimahara K. Takiguchi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 417-423Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech phast gel system, according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using 12.5‥ polyacrylamide gels, followed by silver staining. Glycol-chitin electrophoresis was conducted as described by Escott and Adams (19Escott G.M. Adams D.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4770-4773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for an extension of the renaturation time to 8 h. Glycol-chitin was prepared from glycol chitosan (Sigma) as described by Trudel and Asselin (20Trudel J. Asselin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The native isoelectric point of chitinases was determined by flat bed isoelectric focusing in granulated Ultrodex gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (8Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (Biosolve, Barneveld, The Netherlands) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Northern blots, using 15 μg of total RNA, were performed as described (9Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Human and mouse RNA Master Blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used to examine the tissue distribution of transcripts according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The following probes were used: the full-length mouse acidic chitinase cDNA, the human EST clone oq35c04.s1 (GenBankTM accession number AA976830) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as control. Radiolabeling and hybridization was conducted as described previously (9Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Quantification of radioactivity was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments were generated from mouse lung total RNA using degenerate oligonucleotides, as described (9Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Obtained fragments were cloned in pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), sequenced, and compared with the amino acid sequence established by N-terminal protein sequencing. A comparison with the GenBankTM mouse EST (expressed sequence tag) data base using the Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information showed that several EST clones matched the mouse chitinase cDNA sequence, for example, ms33 h09.y1 (GenBankTM accession number AI892792). This clone was obtained and sequenced. Antisense primers were generated complementary to the most 3′ region of the EST clone (A tail primer, 5′-TTTTGGCTACCAATTTTATTGC-3′) and two internal antisense primers (MAS1, 5′-CAGCTACAGCAGCAGTAACCATC-3′ and MAS2, 5′-TTCAGGGATCTCATAGCCAGC-3′). The MAS1 and MAS2 primers were used to clone the most 5′ end of the mouse acidic chitinase cDNA using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends and the Marathon-Ready mouse Lung cDNA kit (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To obtain the complete coding sequence a 5′ sense primer was generated (MS1, 5′-CGATGGCCAAGCTACTTCTCGT-3′). The total cDNA sequence was subsequently generated using MS1 and the A tail primer. The fragments of two independent PCRs were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and the nucleotide sequences of two independent clones from each PCR were sequenced from both strands by the procedure of Sanger using fluorescent nucleotides on an Applied Biosystems 377A automated DNA sequencer following Applied Biosystems protocols. Comparison of the mouse AMCase cDNA sequence with the human EST data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information) revealed the presence of a human EST clone oq35c04.s1 (GenBankTM accession number AA976830) highly homologous to the mouse acidic chitinase. Following the same strategy, the full-length human AMCase cDNA was cloned using human stomach total RNA (CLONTECH) for the reverse transcription PCR with the same degenerate primers. A human Marathon-Ready Lung cDNA was used to clone the most 5′ end of the cDNA by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the following primers: HAS2 (5′-TCTGACAGCACAGAATCCACTGCC-3′) and HAS3-A tail (5′-TTGACTGCTGATTTTATTGCAG-3′). The total cDNA sequence was subsequently generated using HS1 (5′-GCTTTCCAGTCTGGTGGTGAAT-3′) and HAS3-A tail. The fragments of two independent PCRs were cloned in pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced as described above. Transient expression of the various cDNAs in COS-1 cells was performed exactly as described previously (9Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To obtain more insight into the potential occurrence of multiple mammalian chitinases, tissues of mouse and rat were examined for chitinolyic activity using the chitin-like 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-chito-oligosaccharide substrates. In extracts of stomach and intestine, a high level of activity was detected, whereas extracts of lung, tongue, kidney, and plasma showed significant but lower activities. Isoelectric focusing of a mouse lung extract revealed a major peak of chitinolytic activity with pI of 4.5, whereas minor peaks were found with pI levels of 5.5–6.5 (Fig.1). Extracts of other mouse and rat tissues showed similar profiles of chitinolytic activity upon isoelectric focusing. The observed rodent chitinase with acidic isoelectric point (pI 4.5 form) differs strikingly from human chitotriosidase which has an apparent neutral/basic pI. The mouse acidic chitinase activity was found to bind to chitin particles with high affinity. Chitin affinity chromatography was used to purify the enzyme, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The procedure resulted in a 30,000-fold purification of an apparently homogeneous 50-kDa protein. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 3.9 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferyl-chitotrioside hydrolyzed per mg per hour at pH 5.2, which is almost identical to that of human chitotriosidase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified acidic chitinase was determined (Fig. 2) and was found to be almost identical to that of other known members of the chitinase family. This amino acid sequence allowed the cloning of the corresponding full-length mouse acidic chitinase cDNA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The full-length cDNA predicts the synthesis of a 50-kDa (pI 4.85) protein with a characteristic signal peptide (Fig. 2). Expression of this cDNA in COS-1 cells led to the secretion of an 50-kDa active chitinase with a pI of 4.8. The mouse acidic chitinase protein shows considerable sequence homology to human chitotriosidase. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of both mature proteins revealed an identity of 52‥ and a similarity of 60‥. Like the human chitotriosidase, the mouse enzyme is predicted to contain an N-terminal catalytic domain of about 39 kDa, a hinge region, and a C-terminal chitin binding domain (Fig. 2). The mouse acidic chitinase, like chitotriosidase, is predicted to lackN-linked oligosaccharides, explaining the observed absence of binding to concanavalin A (data not shown). Several different assays revealed that the mouse acidic chitinase is able to degrade chitin and therefore has to be considered to be a true chitinase. Firstly, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis analysis revealed that recombinant mouse chitinase, like chitotriosidase, releases mainly chitobioside fragments from chitin (Fig. 3). Secondly, like chitotriosidase and some other nonmammalian chitinases, the mouse acidic chitinase is strongly inhibited (IC50 of 0.4 μm) by the competitive chitinase inhibitor allosamidin (21Milewski S. O'Donnel R.W. Gooday G.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Dickinson K. Keer V. Hitchcock C.A. Adams D.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1417-1421PubMed Google Scholar, 23McNab R. Glover L.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 82: 79-82Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, the mouse acidic chitinase and chitotriosidase were both able to digest chitin in the cell wall of regenerating spheroplasts of C. albicans. The chitin content of the cell wall was determined with the Calcofluor white stain (see “Experimental Procedures”). When regenerating cells were incubated for 2 h with 3 μg/ml recombinant chitotriosidase or 3 μg/ml recombinant mouse acidic chitinase, the chitin content was reduced by 27 and 33‥, respectively. Concomitant presence of allosamidin during the incubation completely abolished the effect of both recombinant chitinases. The apparent molecular masses of identically produced recombinant human chitotriosidase and recombinant mouse acidic chitinase are comparable when run on a SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. However, under nonreducing conditions, the mouse acidic chitinase migrates significantly slower than the human chitotriosidase (Fig.4 A). Upon gelelectrophoresis (under nonreducing conditions) in polyacrylamide gels containing glycolchitin, followed by regeneration of active enzyme and detection of the local digestion of glycolchitin using Calcofluor staining, the mouse acidic chitinase migrates slightly faster than human chitotriosidase (Fig. 4 B). A further striking difference between human chitotriosidase and the mouse acidic chitinase is their behavior at acidic pH. The mouse acidic chitinase shows a pronounced pH optimum at pH 2.3 and a less pronounced optimum at more neutral pH (pH 4–7). Chitotriosidase, however, shows only a broad pH optimum (Fig.5 A) and is completely inactivated by pre-incubation at low pH (Fig. 5 B). In the presence of 0.5‥ (w/v) trichloroacetic acid 58‥ of chitotriosidase is precipitated, whereas under similar circumstances the mouse acidic chitinase remains in solution. At 2.5‥ (w/v) trichloroacetic acid all chitotriosidase precipitates, whereas 26‥ of mouse acidic chitinase remains unprecipitated (Fig. 5 C). Another major difference between human chitotriosidase and the mouse acidic chitinase is revealed by comparison of RNA expression patterns. Although human chitotriosidase mRNA is mainly found in lymph node, bone marrow, and lung, the mouse acidic chitinase mRNA is predominantly found in stomach, submaxillary gland, and, at a lower level, in the lung (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, no mouse acidic chitinase mRNA can be detected in the small intestine, suggesting that the protein in the intestine is probably derived from the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach. In rat tissues a comparable acidic chitinase was observed. Our findings indicate that the acidic chitinase in rodents is distinct from human chitotriosidase. The discrete enzyme is therefore referred to as acidic mammalian chitinase or AMCase. It was investigated whether such an acidic chitinase is also present in man. Screening the human EST data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information with the mouse acidic chitinase cDNA revealed the presence of a highly homologous human EST clone (oq35c04.s1, GenBankTM accession number AA976830). The tissue distribution of this human mRNA was examined using a human Masterblot (CLONTECH). The expression pattern of this mRNA is similar to the expression pattern of the mouse acidic chitinase (Fig.7), being highly expressed in the stomach and at a lower level in the lung. Using degenerate oligonucleotides directed against members of the chitinase family, we were able to amplify other regions of the human acidic chitinase, generating enough information to clone the full-length human acidic chitinase cDNA (Fig. 8 A). Screening the GenBankTM data base using the full-length human cDNA revealed that it was almost identical to TSA1902-L (GenBankTM accession number AB025008) and TSA1902-S (GenBankTM accession number AB025009) from a lung cDNA library described by Saito et al. (24Saito A. Ozaki K. Fujiwara T. Nakamura Y. Tanigami A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These two sequences are most probably splice variants of the human acidic chitinase mRNA. Only expression of full-length human AMCase cDNA in COS-1 cells led to the production of a protein with chitinolytic activity (data not shown). Sequence comparison of the human acidic chitinase and the mouse acidic chitinase revealed an 82‥ identity and a similarity of 86‥ (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Human AMCase cDNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that the gene encoding TSA1902 is located on chromosome 1p13 indicates that mammals contain indeed at least two discrete genes that encode functional chitinases, being chitotriosidase (locus 1q32) and AMCase (locus 1p13). Definitive proof for the existence of at least two distinct, functional mammalian chitinase genes was recently obtained by the partial cloning of chitotriosidase cDNA from the rat. The cloned rat cDNA (80‥ of the complete cDNA) encodes a protein that is 80‥ identical to the human counterpart. For many years the existence of chitinase has been well documented for a large variety of organisms, including bacteria, plants, insects, and fungi (for an overview see Ref. 6Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become clear that mammals also contain such enzymes. Chitotriosidase was the first mammalian chitinase that had been cloned and characterized (7Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin.

Besides this human phagocyte-specific chitinase, several inactive members of the mammalian chitinase protein family have also been identified.

All three SREBP isoforms (SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2) are subject to feedback regulation by cholesterol, which blocks their proteolytic release from membranes. Previous data indicate that the SREBPs are also negatively regulated by unsaturated fatty acids, but the mechanism is uncertain. In the current experiments, unsaturated fatty acids decreased the nuclear content of SREBP-1, but not SREBP-2, in cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. The potency of unsaturated fatty acids increased with increasing chain length and degree of unsaturation. Oleate, linoleate, and arachidonate were all effective, but the saturated fatty acids palmitate and stearate were not effective. Down-regulation occurred at two levels. The mRNAs encoding SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c were markedly reduced, and the proteolytic processing of these SREBPs was inhibited. When SREBP-1a was produced by a cDNA expressed from an independent promoter, unsaturated fatty acids reduced nuclear SREBP-1a without affecting the mRNA level. There was no effect when the cDNA encoded a truncated version that was not membrane-bound. When administered together, sterols and unsaturated fatty acids potentiated each other in reducing nuclear SREBP-1. In the absence of fatty acids, sterols did not cause a sustained reduction of nuclear SREBP-1, but they did reduce nuclear SREBP-2. We conclude that unsaturated fatty acids, as well as sterols, can down-regulate nuclear SREBPs and that unsaturated fatty acids have their greatest inhibitory effects on SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, whereas sterols have their greatest inhibitory effects on SREBP-2.

Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Genes involved in fatty acid oxidation are induced, and genes involved in fatty acid synthesis or lipogenesis are repressed (2Price P.T. Nelson C.M. Clarke S.D. Curr. Opin.

The increase in genes responsible for oxidation is achieved in part by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (4Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neither of these two pathways is required for the decreased expression of lipogenic genes elicited by unsaturated fatty acids (6Jump D.B. Thelen A. Ren B. Mater M. Prostaglandins, Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). New candidates for fatty acid-mediated regulation of lipogenic genes have emerged in the form of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs).1 SREBPs are a unique family of membrane-bound transcription factors that activate genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids and their uptake from plasma lipoproteins (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The regulation of SREBPs has been studied most intensively in fibroblast-like cultured cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. These studies showed that the SREBPs are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors averaging 1150 amino acids in length. The NH2-terminal domain of ∼480 amino acids is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family. This is followed by a 90-amino acid membrane attachment domain consisting of two membrane-spanning helices separated by a short hydrophilic loop. The third domain is a COOH-terminal regulatory domain of ∼590 amino acids. The SREBPs are oriented in a hairpin fashion with their NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains facing the cytosol and the short hydrophilic loop projecting into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Immediately after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the SREBPs form complexes with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic membrane protein that escorts them to the Golgi complex (9Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Nohturfft A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Scheek S. Goldstein J.L.

Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Here the SREBPs are cleaved sequentially by two proteases that release the NH2-terminal domain into the cytosol. The released fragment travels to the nucleus, where it binds to sterol regulatory elements located in the 5′-flanking regions of more than 20 genes involved in lipid synthesis and uptake. Target genes include the low density lipoprotein receptor and the cholesterologenic enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase and reductase as well as the lipogenic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase (8Brown M.S.

The proteolytic processing of SREBPs is under feedback control by cholesterol. Thus, when sterols accumulate in cells, the SCAP·SREBP complex fails to move to the Golgi, and SREBPs are not processed (17Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The nuclear SREBPs are rapidly degraded by a proteasomal process, and the synthesis of sterols and fatty acids (primarily 18:1 unsaturates) declines. Three isoforms of SREBP have been identified (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Two of these proteins, designated SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, are derived from a single gene through use of alternate transcriptional start sites producing different forms of exon 1 that are spliced to a common exon 2. The SREBP-1a isoform has a relatively long NH2-terminal acidic activation domain, and it is a potent transcriptional activator. The SREBP-1c isoform has a short acidic activation domain, and it may require post-translational modification to activate transcription (18Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The third isoform, SREBP-2, derived from a separate gene, is ∼50% identical to the SREBP-1 isoforms, and it contains a long activation domain. Although the target genes for the SREBPs overlap, the two SREBP-1 isoforms are relatively more potent in stimulating fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 acts primarily on the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 16Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ratio of SREBP-1a to -1c isoforms varies markedly among different cells. In most adult tissues, including the liver, SREBP-1c predominates (19Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), but the reverse is true in cultured cells (19Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The amount of SREBP-2 is generally approximately equal to the combined total of SREBP-1a and -1c (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as unsaturated fatty acids are end-products of SREBP action, several laboratories have sought to determine whether fatty acids exert feedback effects on SREBP activity. In general, these studies have shown regulatory effects, but the details have been contradictory. In the first of these studies, Thewke et al. (20Thewke D.P. Panini S.R. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21402-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that oleate synergized with sterols in reducing the amounts of nuclear SREBP-1 (nSREBP-1) and nSREBP-2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, oleate without sterols had no effect. Worgall et al. (21Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) found that unsaturated fatty acids (but not saturated fatty acids) without sterols decreased the amount of nSREBP-1 in several types of cultured cells and lowered the mRNA levels for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, an SREBP target gene. Xuet al. (22Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) fed oils rich in n-6 orn-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to rats and observed a decrease in nSREBP-1 in liver cells. Both n-6 andn-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased the amount of mRNA for SREBP-1, but they did not appear to affect transcription of the SREBP-1 gene as determined by nuclear run-on assays. In contrast, Xu et al. (22Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) found no inhibitory effect on SREBP-1 expression with dietary monounsaturated triolein. Kim et al. (23Kim H.-J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25892-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) found that long-term feeding (5 months) of a fish oil diet enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased nSREBP-1 and nSREBP-2 levels in the livers of mice. The mRNA for SREBP-1c was reduced dramatically and that of SREBP-2 was reduced partially, but there was no effect on SREBP-1a. In agreement with the earlier results of Xu et al. (22Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), Kim et al.(23Kim H.-J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25892-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) found that oleic acid-enriched safflower oil had little effect in their animals. The current studies were undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of various fatty acids on the levels of mRNA and protein for all three isoforms of SREBP in nonhepatic human cells (HEK-293 cells) maintained in tissue culture. The results show that unsaturated fatty acids lowered the levels of nSREBP-1, even in the absence of exogenous sterols. In general, the inhibitory effect of the fatty acids increased with increasing chain length and degree of unsaturation. The decrease in nSREBP-1 was accompanied by a decrease in the mRNAs encoding both SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c. However, even when the level of mRNA for SREBP-1a was held constant through transfection, arachidonic acid still reduced nSREBP-1a, indicating that fatty acids have actions at the level of SREBP-1a protein as well as at the level of mRNA. Arachidonic acid did not have an effect on cells that were engineered to express a truncated form of SREBP-1a that enters the nucleus without a requirement for proteolysis, suggesting that the post-transcriptional effect is exercised at the level of proteolytic processing of the SREBP-1a precursor. In the absence of sterols, unsaturated fatty acids had very little effect on the levels of SREBP-2 mRNA or the nSREBP-2 isoform. We obtained affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; anti-rabbit IgG from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; monoclonal antibodies IgG-HSV-Tag and IgG-T7-Tag from Novagen; free fatty acids from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. and Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human SREBP-1 (amino acids 31–175 of the SREBP-1a isoform) and human SREBP-2 (amino acids 48–403) were prepared as previously described (24Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum (d > 1.215 g/ml) was prepared by ultracentrifugation (25Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Other reagents were obtained from previously described sources (9Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J.

Fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.) was delipidated by a modification of the method of Cham and Knowles (27Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ml of serum was mixed with 400 ml of n-butanol and 600 ml of isopropyl ether at room temperature for 20 min, followed by a 20-min incubation on ice. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was re-extracted with 200 ml of isopropyl ether, recentrifuged, subjected to evaporation under a stream of nitrogen gas, lyophilized, reconstituted with 200 ml of distilled water, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Multiple aliquots were stored at −20 °C. The concentration of free fatty acids in the reconstituted delipidated serum was measured with the Free Fatty Acid, Half-micro Test assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); the concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides were measured as previously described (28Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Bucolo G. David H. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). In 12 preparations of delipidated fetal calf serum, the mean concentration of free fatty acids was reduced from 840 to 7.7 μm, the mean concentration of cholesterol was reduced from 280 to 7.5 μg/ml, and the mean concentration of triglycerides was reduced from 600 to 23 μg/ml. A 5 or 10 mm stock solution of each fatty acid was prepared by diluting the free fatty acid in ethanol and precipitating it with the addition of NaOH (final concentration of 0.25 m). The precipitated sodium salt was then evaporated under nitrogen gas, reconstituted with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and stirred at room temperature for 10 min with defatted BSA (final concentration at 10% (w/v) in 0.15m NaCl). Each solution was adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and stored in multiple aliquots at −20 °C protected from light in tubes evacuated under nitrogen gas. pTK-HSV-BP1a is an expression vector that produces epitope-tagged human SREBP-1a under control of the HSV TK promoter (30Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). pTK-HSV-BP1a-T7 encodes human SREBP-1a flanked at the NH2terminus by two tandem copies of the HSV epitope tag and at the COOH terminus by three tandem copies of the T7 epitope tag sequence. This TK-driven plasmid was constructed as follows: pTK-HSV-BP2-Ras-T7 (26Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was digested with BspD I and Nde I to isolate a 6-kb fragment that contained the HSV and T7 epitope repeats but not the sequence of the SREBP-2/Ras fusion protein. A pair of primers, 5′-CAGCCTGAACTCGCTCCAGAGG-3′, corresponding to amino acids 1–7 of the second HSV tag, and 5′-GCTAGCCATATGGCTGGAAGTGACAGTGGTCCCAC-3′, corresponding to amino acid residues 1140–1147 of human SREBP-1a, was used to amplify the coding region of SREBP-1a. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested withBspD I and Nde I, and a 3.4-kb fragment encoding amino acids 1–1147 of SREBP-1a was isolated. The two isolated fragments were ligated to generate pTK-HSV-BP1a-T7, which was sequenced in its entirety. A plasmid encoding the nuclear form of human SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–490), designated pTK-HSV-BP1a(Stop 490), was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pTK-HSV-BP1a. Mutagenesis to introduce the indicated stop codon was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting expression vector was sequenced in its entirety to confirm the mutation. Two different clones of the mutant plasmid were independently transfected. Unless otherwise stated, monolayers of human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were set up on day 0 (7 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) and cultured in 8–9% CO2 at 37 °C in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. Unless otherwise stated, on day 2 the cells were washed once with PBS and refed with medium A supplemented with 5% (v/v) delipidated FCS in the absence or presence of BSA-bound fatty acids (100 μm) and/or sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol added in a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v) ethanol) as indicated in the legends. After incubation with fatty acids and/or sterols at 37 °C for 14 h, ALLN was added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml unless otherwise stated. 2 h later, the cells were harvested by scraping in the medium, and the cell suspension from triplicate dishes was pooled and centrifuged at 103 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting cell pellet was washed by recentrifugation in PBS at 4 °C, after which the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors that included 2.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml ALLN, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc). The cell suspension was passed through a 23-gauge needle 20 times and centrifuged at 103 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min. The 103 × g pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer B (20 mmHepes-KOH at pH 7.6, 0.42 m NaCl, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and the above mixture of protease inhibitors). This suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 105 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor. The resulting supernatant is designated as the nuclear extract fraction. The supernatant of the original 103 × g spin was centrifuged at 104× g for 15 min at 4 °C, after which the pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml of SDS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and the above mixture of protease inhibitors) and designated as the membrane fraction. HEK-293 cells were transfected for 3 h with the indicated plasmids using the MBS kit (Stratagene) as described previously (31Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of nuclear extract and membrane fractions was measured with a BCA kit (Pierce). A given amount of nuclear extract or membrane fraction was mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer (1× loading buffer contains 30 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 3% SDS, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). After boiling for 5 min, aliquots of the proteins (50 μg) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C extra-nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were incubated with antibodies as described in the figure legends. Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG using the SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers (New England BioLabs). Filters were exposed to Reflection NEF0496 film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature for the indicated time. The intensity of the nuclear bands was quantified with the National Institutes of Health IMAGE 1.61 software. Total RNA was prepared from triplicate dishes of monolayers of HEK-293 cells using the RNA Stat-60 kit (Tel-test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. For Northern gel analysis, 30 μg of total RNA was mixed with RNA sample loading buffer (containing 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide) (Sigma), denatured with formaldehyde and formamide, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, and transferred to Hybond N+membranes. The cDNA probes for human SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were prepared by excising a 1.4-kb Not I/Xba I fragment from pIND-BP1c-FLAG (18Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and a 1.2-kb Hin dIII fragment from pTK-HSV-BP2 (30Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for human β-actin was obtained from CLONTECH. cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Rediprime II Random Labeling kit. The membranes were hybridized with the indicated32P-labeled probes (2 × 106 cpm/ml) for 15 h at 65 °C using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); washed twice with 0.1% (w/v) SDS/2× SSC at room temperature for 10 min followed by 0.1% (w/v) SDS/0.1× SSC at 65 °C for 15 min and exposed at −80 °C to film with intensifying screens for the indicated time. The amount of radioactivity was quantified using the NIH IMAGE 1.61 software. The cDNA fragments for human SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c used as templates for cRNA probe synthesis were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the plasmids pIND-BP1a-FLAG and pIND-BP1c-FLAG (18Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify SREBP-1a were: 5′ primer, 5′-CGCTCCCTAGGAAGGGCCGTA-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-ACTGTCTTGGTTGTTGATAAGC-3′. The primers used to amplify SREBP-1c were: 5′ primer, 5′-AGGGGTAGGGCCAACGGCCT-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CAAGCTGCCTGGGGAGCTGGTA-3′. The amplified human SREBP-1a fragment corresponds to 66 bp of 5′-untranslated region, exon 1a and 36 bp of exon 2. The amplified human SREBP-1c fragment corresponds to 54 bp of 5′-untranslated region, 15 bp of exon 1c, and 128 bp of exon 2. Note that exon 2 is common to SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). After linearization of plasmid DNA with Xba I, antisense RNA was transcribed with [α-32P]CTP (20 mCi/ml) using bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (19Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA (50 μg) from each sample were incubated with the above SREBP-1 cRNA probe plus a cRNA probe for the mRNA of human β-actin (19Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) plus the reagents contained in the HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion). In preparing the probes, we adjusted the specific activity of the [α-32P]CTP to give comparable signals for β-actin and SREBP-1. After digestion with RNase A/T1, protected fragments were separated on 8 m urea/5% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography by using reflection film and BioMax intensifying screens (Kodak). To assess endogenous regulation, an SREBP-1c cRNA probe was used. The protected fragments corresponding to SREBP-1a (129 bp) and SREBP-1c (198 bp) were visualized on gels analyzed quantitatively with the NIH IMAGE 1.61 software. For studying transfected cells, a SREBP-1a cRNA probe was used to distinguish the endogenous SREBP-1a as a 189-bp protected fragment and transfected SREBP-1a as a 123-bp fragment. The level of β-actin mRNA in each sample was used to normalize signals obtained for the SREBP mRNAs. In previous studies from this laboratory, the sterol-mediated regulation of SREBP processing was measured in cultured cells that were grown in lipoprotein-deficient serum, which is essentially devoid of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, owing to the removal of low density lipoprotein by ultracentrifugal flotation (25Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugation does not remove free fatty acids, which are bound to albumin. To delipidate serum more completely, in the current studies we used a solvent extraction procedure that employs butanol and isopropyl ether (see “Experimental Procedures”). The concentrations of free fatty acids in medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 5% delipidated serum were 18 and 0.39 μm, respectively (45-fold reduction). Fig. 1 shows the content of SREBPs in membrane fractions and nuclear extracts of HEK-293 cells that were incubated for 16 h in medium containing either lipoprotein-deficient serum or delipidated serum with or without added sterols or arachidonate. Inasmuch as our antibody does not differentiate between SREBP-1a and"

To directly investigate the role of SHP-2, we employed dominant negative strategies in transfected cells. We show that a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 blocks leptin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation by the long leptin receptor, ObRb.

The phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is required for both pathways, whereas activation of ERK via Tyr-985 of ObRb also requires tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2.

The intracellular signaling pathways by which leptin regulates these genes are unknown, and further studies in this area are, therefore, likely to be critical for the understanding of the mechanism(s) leading to the leptin resistance characterizing human obesity. Leptin is structurally related to cytokines and acts on receptors that belong to the cytokine-receptor superfamily (6Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J.

Several different leptin receptor isoforms exists, including a long form (ObRb),1 which is highly expressed in regions of the hypothalamus, and a short form (ObRa), which is highly expressed within microvessels of the blood-brain barrier (6Tartaglia L.A.

Although ObRb has a 302-amino acid long intracellular domain, ObRa is predicted to encompass only a 34-residue cytoplasmic domain. Leptin receptors lack intrinsic catalytic activity, and analogous with other cytokine receptor systems, leptin stimulation results in activation of intracellular Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) that are associated with conserved JAK-binding motifs present in the membrane proximal region of leptin receptors (25Ghilardi N. Skoda R.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Activated JAKs then phosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of ObRb (26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). ObRa does not contain any intracellular tyrosine residues. The murine ObRb receptor contains three intracellular tyrosine residues, located at positions 985, 1077, and 1138. These amino acids are conserved among known species of long form leptin receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation sites provide binding motifs for src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing proteins, such as STATs (signal transducer and activator of transcription) (27Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 28Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 1138 is located 3 residues N-terminal to a glutamine residue (YXX Q), generating a consensus STAT3-binding motif (29Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). STATs then become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to JAK activation and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. Consistently, removal of Tyr-1138 severely reduces leptin-induced STAT3 activation (30Baumann H. Morella K.K. White D.W. Dembski M. Bailon P.S. Kim H. Lai C.-F. Tartaglia L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It therefore seems likely, but yet unproven, that STAT3 activation is a crucial component in leptin's pathway(s) to regulate body weight. In addition to STAT3 activation, other key signaling components are likely to be regulated by leptin receptors. In vitro orin vivo studies show that leptin can stimulate insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation (26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

The roles of the phosphatase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 in regulation of signaling pathways are not well characterized and may differ in different signaling systems. Data suggest that Tyr-985 of ObRb mediates negative regulation of the STAT pathway (32Carpenter L.R. Farruggella T.J. Symes A. Karow M.L. Yancopoulos G.D. Stahl N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6061-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have recently provided a mechanism for this observation by demonstrating that SOCS-3, a leptin-inducible SH2-domain containing protein, requires binding to phosphorylated Tyr-985 to efficiently inhibit ObRb signaling (49Bjørbæk C. Lavery H.J. Bates S.H. Olson R.K. Davis S.M. Flier J.S. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40649-40657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that both ObRa and ObRb have the ability to stimulate the ERK pathway (26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) and that SHP-2 is likely to play a positive role in ERK activation via Tyr-985 of ObRb (33Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). However, because the exact requirements for different leptin receptor domains and SHP-2 functions are unclear in leptin signaling to the ERK pathway, we decided to more carefully examine this by applying dominant-negative SHP-2 strategies. Our data show that SHP-2 is a positive regulator of the ERK pathway by both short and long leptin receptors. We conclude that SHP-2 affects ERK activation via two pathways. One pathway does not require the intracellular domain unique for ObRb, whereas the other requires tyrosine residue 985 of ObRb. The phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is required for both pathways, whereas activation of ERK via Tyr-985 of ObRb also requires tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. We speculate that SHP-2 is also an indirect positive regulator of STAT signaling by competitive inhibition of SOCS-3 binding to Tyr-985. Recombinant mouse leptin was obtained from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). 125I-leptin was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Murine erythropoietin (EPO) was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The expression vectors encoding long (ObRb) and short (ObRa) murine leptin receptors were generated as described earlier (26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

Marshall (Institute of Cancer Research, London). The socs-3 promoter-luciferase construct was kindly given by Dr. S. Melmed (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA), whereas the STAT-responsive-luciferase (GAS) reporter plasmid was from Dr. L. Stancato and Dr. R. Pine (Sphinx Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC). Dr. G. Walz (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston) kindly provided the egr1-luc construct. All reagents for transfection were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Anti-phosphotyrosine (pY, 4G10) and phospho-specific STAT3 (Y705) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). JAK1, JAK2, and monoclonal SHP-2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The phospho-specific MAPK antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). The leptin receptor antibody was generated as described by Bjørbæket al. (26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

For experiments shown in Fig. 6 A (see below) we used an antigen affinity-purified rabbit phospho-specific JAK2 antibody generated against a dual-tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to tyrosine residues (Tyr-1007, Tyr-1008) in the activation loop of murine JAK2. A rabbit SHP-2 antibody generated against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the entire SHP-2 molecule (50Myers Jr., M.G. Mendez R. Shi P. Pierce J.H. Rhoads R. White M.F. J. Biol.

Cells stably expressing mutant or wild-type chimeric ELR isoforms were generated as described earlier (33Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol.

CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. COS-1 and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All cells were serum-deprived for 12–15 h before stimulation with hormones. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE according to the recommendations by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested by rinsing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraping into ice-cold lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated as described below. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described earlier by Bjørbæk et al.(26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Briefly, clarified lysates were incubated at 4 °C with antibodies together with protein A-agarose beads. After three washes in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in nonfat dry milk or bovine serum albumin. After incubation with antibodies, nitrocellulose membranes were washed and targeted proteins were detected using either enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia International, Buckinghamshire, UK), or by using125I-protein A (ICN). After cell lysis, aliquots were used for luciferase assay as described earlier (12Bjørbæk C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and assay buffer were injected simultaneously and measured for 20 s by a Luminometer (LB 9501, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). β-Galactosidase activities were determined using Galacton (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) as described by the manufacturer and measured for 5 s by the Luminometer. COS-1 cells were transfected as described above, serum-deprived for 12–15 h, and incubated with 100,000 cpm of 125I-leptin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% of bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 4 h, in the presence or absence of 200 nmunlabeled leptin. Cells were then washed four times with ice-cold binding medium, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured in a gamma counter. Male C57Bl/6J and ob/ob mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals and procedures used were in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committees. For phospho-MAPK Western blotting, ob/ob mice were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant leptin or vehicle and sacrificed 20 min later. Hypothalami were isolated and lysed. After normalization of protein, lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies. For mRNA quantification, overnight food-deprived C57 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of recombinant leptin or vehicle. At different times following injection, mice were deeply anesthetized by inhalation of Metofane (Mallinckrodt Veterinary, Inc., Mundelein, IL) and then decapitated. The skull was reflected from the brain, and the hypothalamus was isolated and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative 32P-PCR was done as described earlier (12Bjørbæk C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for specific amplification of socs-3, egr-1, andβ-actin cDNAs: SOCS-3A, 5′-accagcgccacttcttcacg-3′, and SOCS-3B, 5′-gtggagcatcatactgatcc-3′ (450-bp product, 25 cycles); Egr-1A, 5′-tttccacaacaacagggagacc-3′, and Egr-1B, 5′-acaggcaaaaggcttctcgc-3′ (425-bp product, 22 cycles); and Actin-A, 5′-cgtaccacgggcattgtgatgg-3′, and Actin-B, 5′-tttgatgtcacgcacgatttccc-3′ (200-bp product, 17 cycles). We have demonstrated previously that leptin has the ability to activate MAPK (ERK1) kinase activity via both long and short leptin receptors in transfected COS and CHO cells (26Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data show that maximal phosphorylation of ERK by leptin requires tyrosine 985 of ObRb (33Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This residue is also required for binding of SHP-2 to ObRb and for tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 by leptin (32Carpenter L.R. Farruggella T.J. Symes A. Karow M.L. Yancopoulos G.D. Stahl N. Proc.

Although these data are suggestive, the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2, and the importance of the phosphatase activity of SHP-2, in the regulation of the ERK pathway by leptin is unclear. We therefore directly examined effects of SHP-2 on ERK activation by leptin, by applying dominant negative SHP-2 strategies. CHO cells were transiently transfected with ObRb, JAK2, and HA-ERK1 expression vectors, together with vectors encoding either wild-type SHP-2 (SHP-2 WT), catalytically inactive SHP-2 (SHP-2 C-S), or a SHP-2 variant with two C-terminal GRB-2 tyrosine-binding sites mutated into phenylalanine (SHP-2 Y2F). After serum deprivation, cells were treated with 20 nm leptin for various periods of time followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blottin"
https://openalex.org/W2085733039,"Most mammalian cells package neutral lipids into droplets that are surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and a specific set of proteins including the adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP; also called adipophilin), which is found in a wide array of cell types, and the perilipins, which are restricted to adipocytes and steroidogenic cells. TIP47 was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, yet its sequence is highly similar to the lipid droplet protein, ADRP, and more distantly related to perilipins. Hence, we hypothesized that TIP47 might be associated with lipid droplets. In HeLa cells grown in standard low lipid-containing culture media, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the cells had few lipid droplets; however, TIP47 and ADRP were found on the surfaces of the small lipid droplets present. When the cells were grown in media supplemented with physiological levels of fatty acids, the amount of neutral lipid stored in lipid droplets increased dramatically, as did the staining of TIP47 and ADRP surrounding these droplets. TIP47 was found primarily in the cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells and murine MA10 Leydig cells grown in low lipid-containing culture medium, while ADRP was undetectable in these fractionated cell homogenates. When HeLa and MA10 Leydig cells were lipid-loaded, significant levels of ADRP were found in the floating lipid droplet fractions and TIP47 levels remained constant, but the distribution of a significant portion of TIP47 shifted from the cytosolic fractions to the lipid droplet fractions. Thus, we conclude that TIP47 associates with nascent lipid droplets and can be classified as a lipid droplet-associated protein."

A recombinant PSACH mutant COMP in which Asp-469 was deleted (D469Δ) and a MED mutant COMP in which Asp-361 was substituted by Tyr (D361Y) were both secreted into the cell culture medium of human cells. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed only small changes in the secondary structures of D469Δ and D361Y, demonstrating that the mutations do not dramatically affect the folding and stability of COMP. However, the local conformations of the type 3 repeats were disturbed, and the number of bound calcium ions was reduced to 10 and 8, respectively. In addition to collagen I and II, collagen IX also binds to COMP with high affinity. The PSACH and MED mutations reduce the binding to collagens I, II, and IX and result in an altered zinc dependence.

All mutations in the COMP gene, which are known to cause PSACH or MED, result in either a single amino acid substitution, a small deletion, or an insertion of one or two amino acids (4Hecht J.T.

Most (44 of 48) known mutations in COMP affect residues in the T3 repeats, whereas 4 mutations are located in the carboxyl-terminal domain. 72% of the mutations affect acidic residues.

Thus far, no mutations have been reported for the α1 chain of collagen IX that complements the α2 and α3 chains in the heterotrimeric nonfibrillar collagen IX (42van der Rest M. Mayne R. Mayne R.

Collagen IX is a structural component of cartilage and was suggested to play a stabilizing role in collagen fibrils (44Bruckner P. Mendler M. Steinmann B. Huber S. Winterhalter K.H. J. Biol.

The findings that mice expressing α1(IX) collagen chains with a central deletion develop a mild dwarfism and osteoarthritis (45Nakata K. Ono K. Miyazaki J. Olsen B.R. Muragaki Y. Adachi E.

To understand the consequences of mutations in COMP that cause PSACH and MED, we used recombinant COMP and several fragments thereof to demonstrate that the T3 repeats are responsible for calcium binding and that calcium binding is affected by the mutations. We also show that mutated COMP is still able to bind to collagens, but with altered zinc dependence. The fact that COMP also binds to collagen IX and that this binding is interfered with by the mutations points to a common mechanism for the development of phenotypes in patients affected in either the COMP or collagen IX gene. The cDNA clone coding for full-length COMP (8Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Å. Oldberg (Lund University, Lund, Sweden) and served as the template for PCR amplification of the different cDNA fragments. The cDNA coding for COMP lacking the signal peptide (rCOMP) was amplified according to standard protocols with Expand Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) with primer 1 (5′-GCCCGCTAGCCCAGGGCCAGATCCCGC-3′) and primer M1 (5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCCTAGGCCCTCCGCAG-3′). The EGF-T3 cDNA encoding residues 227–524 was generated with primer 3 (5′-GCCCGCTAGCCCACTTCTGCCCCGACG-3′) and primer M2 (5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTTAGGCGTTCTCGGGGCAC-3′), and the T3 cDNA encoding residues 268–524 was amplified with primer 4 (5′-GCCCGCTAGCCCGCGACACAGACCTGG-3′) and primer M2. The PCR products were cloned in pUC18 linearized with EcoRV. Excision of the NheI/NotI fragments and ligation into the pCEP-Pu expression vector (48Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) linearized withNheI/NotI joined the 5′ end of the cDNA to the 3′ end of the coding sequence for the BM40 signal peptide. T3-D361Y cDNA was generated by PCR using primer 4 and mutagenesis primer 361m (5′-GGTCTGTATACTTCTGGTCATCATTC-3′). A separate reaction was performed with primer M2 and primer 361c (5′-GACCAGAAGTATACAGACCGGGATG-3′). These PCR products served as the template for a final PCR with primer 4 and primer M2 to amplify T3-D361Y cDNA that was ligated into the pCEP-Pu. T3-D469Δ cDNA was generated using the combination of mutagenesis primer 469m (5′-GTCGTCGTCATCGCATGCATCACCCTT-3′) with primer 4 and primer 469c (5′-GGTGATGCATGCGATGACGACGAC-3′) with primer M2. Additional silent mutations created a novel Bst1107I in T3-D361Y and a newSphI site in T3-D469Δ to identify mutated clones. D361Y and D469Δ cDNA clones were constructed by digesting T3-D361Y and T3-D469Δ, respectively, with ClaI/BstBI and ligating these fragments into theClaI/BstBI-digested rCOMP cDNA. Correct sequences of all clones were confirmed by sequencing (ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer; Applied Biosystems). For stable episomal expression, 5 × 105 human embryonic kidney cells (293-EBNA; Invitrogen) were electroporated with 3 μg of purified plasmid. The transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Secretion of recombinant proteins into the medium was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of samples from transfected and nontransfected cells. Serum-free culture medium was harvested, supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mm Tris-HCl to give a pH of 8.6, and filtered through Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This medium was applied to a Q-Sepharose FastFlow ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and eluted with a gradient of 50–1000 mm NaCl in the same buffer. COMP-containing fractions were subjected to gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. Final purification and concentration were achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on a Resource Q or a Source Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using buffers as described in the first ion-exchange chromatography. The buffer of the purified sample was changed to 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. The purity and size of all proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE with or without prior reduction of disulfide bonds. Amino-terminal sequencing on an ABI473A/476A Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) confirmed the identity of the proteins. Collagen I and II were purchased from Sigma. Collagen I had been isolated after pepsin digestion from bovine dermal skin, and collagen II had been isolated from bovine nasal septum. Each collagen was dissolved in 0.5m acetic acid. Recombinant collagen IX was produced as described previously (49Pihlajamaa T. Perala M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ligand binding studies were performed in solid-phase assays with collagens (2 μg/ml in 0.18 macetic acid) coated to 96-well plates (Maxisorb; Nunc) overnight at 20 °C. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), the wells were blocked for 1.5 h with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TBS at room temperature. After washing the wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with ligands tCOMP, rCOMP, D361Y, and D469Δ diluted in TBS containing 0.5 mm ZnCl2. The ligands were used at different concentrations for the determination of affinity. Nonspecific binding was controlled for each ligand concentration in wells lacking a collagen coat but otherwise treated identically. In separate experiments, the zinc-dependent binding was measured with ligands (5 nm) diluted in TBS containing zinc at different concentrations. Also the washing buffers were supplemented with ZnCl2. Bound tCOMP, rCOMP, D361Y, and D469D were detected using a polyclonal antiserum against COMP (50Di Cesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) followed by peroxidase-coupled swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) using tetramethylbenzidine as chromogenic substrate, and absorbance was recorded at 450 nm. Identical titers of the antibodies against wild-type and mutant COMP were confirmed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titrations in which wild-type and mutant COMP were coated onto plastic and detected with different dilutions of the polyclonal antiserum. The BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to characterize the interaction between wild-type and mutant COMP and collagens. Immobilization of tCOMP, rCOMP, D361Y, and D469Δ to the carboxymethylated matrix of the CM5 sensor chip was performed as described previously (20Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The immobilization resulted in 9,100 resonance units for tCOMP, 4,600 resonance units for rCOMP, 3,300–3,600 resonance units for D361Y, and 3,400–5,200 resonance units for D469Δ. A blank surface was used as control. Binding was determined at different concentrations of collagen I (2–136 nm) and collagen IX (11–88 nm). The collagens were added to 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20 containing 0.05 mm zinc chloride before injection to avoid fiber formation. A flow rate of 80 μl/min was used. BIAevaluation software version 3.0 was used to calculateKd of the binding. Only curves in which the association resulted in a signal response of more than 10 resonance units were used for calculations. CD spectra in the far UV region were recorded in a thermostated quartz cell of 1 mm optical path length in a JASCO 715 CD spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Spectra were measured with the proteins dissolved in TBS (less than 5 μmCa2+) and after the addition of 0.25 and 1.5 mmCaCl2. Reversal of the conformational change was examined after the addition of 4 mm EDTA to the Ca2+-containing samples. Mean molar ellipticities [Θ] (expressed in degrees cm2 dmol−1) were calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. Five spectra were accumulated to improve the signal/noise ratio, and the spectra of buffers were subtracted. The percentage change in CD at 215 nm was calculated as Δ[Θ]215 = 100 × ([Θ]Ca − [Θ]EDTA)/ [Θ]Ca, with [Θ]Ca representing the signal at Ca2+saturation, and [Θ]EDTA representing the CD signal in the presence of excess EDTA. Calcium titrations were performed by the addition of small aliquots of CaCl2 stock solution followed by incubation for 5 min and recording of the CD signal at 215 nm or recording of spectra. Secondary structure analysis was performed using the variable selection method SelCon (51Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrophotometer in 10-mm pathlength rectangular cells at 25 °C. Intrinsic fluorescence was excited at 280 nm for all recombinant proteins (1 μm). Emission maxima were between 346 and 353 nm. Spectra were recorded in TBS (less than 5 μm Ca2+) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and after the subsequent addition of 4 mm EDTA. The percentage change in fluorescence intensity at 350 nm was calculated as ΔF350= 100 × (FCa − FEDTA)/FCa, with FCa representing the signal at Ca2+saturation, and FEDTA representing the fluorescence signal in the presence of excess EDTA. Calcium titrations were performed as described above. The number of bound calcium ions per COMP molecule was determined by equilibrium dialysis in microdialysis chambers (Membrapure, Bodenheim, Germany). 150 μl of protein (10 μm) dissolved in TBS was dialyzed against 150 μl of TBS containing 0.2 μCi of 45Ca2+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and different 40CaCl2concentrations. After 16–20 h, 10-μl aliquots were removed from each dialysis chamber and counted in a scintillation counter. The number of bound calcium ions B was calculated as B = Δcpm/cpmtotal ×nCa/nprotein, with Δcpm representing the difference in radioactivity between both dialysis chambers, cpmtotal representing the sum of the activities,nCa representing the number of calcium ions, andnprotein representing the number of protein molecules in the system. The free calcium concentration was calculated as the difference between the total and the bound calcium concentration. Protein concentrations were determined according the method of Gill and von Hippel (64Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The degree of saturation Y was calculated from the signals S, corrected for dilutions, asY = (S −S0)/(SCa −S0), where SCa andS0 represent the signals at Ca2+saturation and 0 Ca2+, respectively. The free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from Y and the corresponding total calcium concentration Ca2+tot to: Ca2+free = Ca2+tot − Y ×n × Ptot, with nrepresenting the number of calcium binding sites/molecule,Ptot representing the total protein concentration, and n × Ptot representing the total concentration of binding sites present. We initially usedn = 13 for the number of Ca2+ binding sites/molecule, as determined for thrombospondin-1 (33Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the protein concentrations used were much lower than Ca2+tot, n had only a negligible effect on Ca2+free. Thus, variation ofn between 10 and 20 and between 3 and 10 for the mutant T3 repeats had no significant effect on the calculatedKd values and Hill coefficients. The degree of saturation Y in a model including two independent classes of binding sites can be described by Y = a× Y1 + (1 − a) ×Y2, with Y1 andY2 representing the degrees of saturation of the first and second class of binding sites, and the parameter arepresenting the percentage contribution of the signal induced by saturation of the first class of binding sites to the whole signal. Using the Hill equation to describe cooperativity between the sites within each class of binding sites Y is given by Y=a×([Ca]nH1/Equation 1 (Kd1nH1+[Ca]nH1))+(1−a)×([Ca]nH2/(Kd2nH12+[Ca]nH12))where [Ca] represents the free Ca2+ concentration,Kd1 and Kd2 represent the equilibrium dissociation constants, and nH1 andnH2 represent the Hill coefficients. The program Grafit (Erithacus software) was used to fit the model to the experimental data with nonlinear least-square fit procedures. For visualization by electron microscopy, wild-type and mutant COMP and collagens (0.1 μm) were dialyzed against 0.15 m ammonium formate, pH 7.4. ZnCl2 was added to give 0.5 mmZn2+. The sample was diluted 1:1 with 80% glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried in vacuum, and rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon (52Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The replicas were floated off onto destilled water, picked up on 400-mesh copper grids, and examined in a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. We expressed rCOMP as well as several fragments thereof in a eukaryotic expression system to ensure proper disulfide bond formation and posttranslational modifications. Because it was unclear whether the thrombospondin T3 repeats are independently folded, a construct EGF-T3, encompassing the fourth EGF domain plus the eight T3 repeats, and a construct T3, encompassing only the eight T3 repeats, were produced (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we introduced two mutations in the cDNA for COMP. The point mutation G1106T results on the amino acid level in the change of Asp-361 to Tyr (D361Y). This mutation was originally found in a large family with seven affected members suffering from MED (28Loughlin J. Irven C. Mustafa Z. Briggs M.D. Carr A. Lynch S.A. Knowlton R.G. Cohn D.H. Sykes B. Hum. Mutat. 1998; Suppl. 1: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The second mutation was a deletion of one of the five triplets (nucleotides 1430–1444) encoding five consecutive aspartic acid residues 469–473 (D469Δ). This is the most commonly found mutation in COMP and causes severe PSACH (4Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K. Lennon G.G. Deere M.

A signal peptide targeted the recombinant proteins into cell culture media used to purify the proteins to homogeneity (Fig. 2). rCOMP was present in the culture medium as a pentamer of about 550 kDa, although bands migrating at lower molecular masses were also observed under nonreducing conditions. A band at 100 kDa was isolated, and amino-terminal sequencing revealed that the sequence started at amino acid 78 within the linker between the coiled-coil domain and the first EGF-like domain (results not shown). Apparently, a protease present either within the cells or in the culture medium is able to cleave the COMP subunits, yielding the cleaved carboxyl-terminal parts of 100 kDa and fragments with one to five intact subunits connected via the pentameric coiled-coil domain. The smaller fragments including the 100-kDa band could be removed chromatographically, and a preparation of pentameric COMP with a portion of COMP particles lacking the carboxyl-terminal part of one subunit was obtained. Under reducing conditions, this preparation showed a single band at 110 kDa (Fig. 2). Amino-terminal sequencing confirmed that that this band represents the full-length COMP. Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing confirmed the mainly pentameric structure of rCOMP. As seen earlier for tCOMP (7Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), five globular domains are connected by thin flexible strands to a central assembly domain (Fig. 3).Figure 3Electron microscopy of rCOMP and its mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2106733037,"The activation of human platelets by α-thrombin is mediated at least in part by cleavage of protease-activated G-protein-coupled receptors, PAR-1 and PAR-4. Platelet glycoprotein Ibα also has a high affinity binding site for α-thrombin, and this interaction contributes to platelet activation through a still unknown mechanism. In the present study the hypothesis that GpIbα may contribute to platelet activation by modulating the hydrolysis of PAR-1 on the platelet membrane was investigated. Gel-filtered platelets from normal individuals were stimulated by α-thrombin, and the kinetics of PAR-1 hydrolysis by enzyme was followed with flow cytometry using an anti-PAR-1 monoclonal antibody (SPAN 12) that recognizes only intact PAR-1 molecules. This strategy allowed measurement of the apparentk cat/K m value for thrombin hydrolysis of PAR-1 on intact platelets, which was equal to 1.5 ± 0.1 × 107m−1sec−1. The hydrolysis rate of PAR-1 by thrombin was measured under conditions in which thrombin binding to GpIb was inhibited by different strategies, with the following results. 1) Elimination of GpIbα on platelet membranes by mocarhagin treatment reduced the k cat/K m value by about 6-fold. 2) A monoclonal anti-GpIb antibody reduced the apparent k cat/K m value by about 5-fold. 3) An oligonucleotide DNA aptamer, HD22, which binds to the thrombin heparin-binding site (HBS) and inhibits thrombin interaction with GpIbα, reduced the apparentk cat/K m value by about 5-fold. 4) Displacement of α-thrombin from the binding site on GpIb using PPACK-thrombin reduced the apparentk cat/K m value by about 5-fold, and 5) mutation at the HBS of thrombin (R98A) caused a 5-fold reduction of the apparentk cat/K m value of PAR-1 hydrolysis. Altogether these results show that thrombin interaction with GpIb enhances the specificity of thrombin cleavage of PAR-1 on intact platelets, suggesting that GpIb may function as a “cofactor” for PAR-1 activation by thrombin.

The activation of human platelets by thrombin is mediated by at least two receptors belonging to the family of protease-activated receptors (PARs),1 i.e. PAR-1 and PAR-4 (1Coughlin S.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These receptors are activated upon cleavage by thrombin and mediate transmembrane signaling by coupling to G-proteins (1Coughlin S.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). α-Thrombin also binds with high affinity to the platelet glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) that belongs to the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins (3Buchanan S.T. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin binding to GpIb contributes to platelet activation by the enzyme, as demonstrated by the finding that Bernard-Soulier platelets, which lack the GpIb-IX-V complex, have a delayed response to thrombin stimulation (4Nurden A.T. Didry D. Rosa J.P. Blood Cells. 1983; 9: 333-358PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several in vitro studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of thrombin binding to GpIb by different strategies causes a reduction in thrombin-induced platelet activation (5Ward C.M.

The mechanism by which the binding of α-thrombin to GpIb contributes to platelet activation is not clear. Numerous studies have shown that a proteolytic-active enzyme is required to activate platelets. PPACK-thrombin, which retains its ability to bind to GpIb, does not induce platelet aggregation (10Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jones G.D. Kornauser R. Jackson B. Yamamoto N. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, GpIb does not undergo cleavage by thrombin. On the other hand, the cleavage of G-protein-coupled PARs seems to be essential in platelet activation and transmembrane signaling. The finding that thrombin binding to GpIb involves a distinct thrombin domain, the HBS, which is far from the thrombin catalytic site and the fibrinogen recognition site (7De Candia E.

In the present study, the hypothesis that thrombin binding to GpIb may affect the hydrolysis of PAR-1 by the enzyme on intact platelets was investigated. The hydrolysis of PAR-1 was evaluated as a paradigm to construct a model where GpIb acts as a cofactor for PAR(s) cleavage. Human α-thrombin was purified and characterized as previously reported (11De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutant thrombin R98A, which contains an alanine substitution at Arg-98 (thrombin B-chain numbering), 2Amino acid residues were numbered according to the thrombin sequence where the first amino acid of the B-chain was designated as number 1. (Arg-98 corresponds to Arg-101 in the chymotrypsin numbering system.) and recombinant wild-type (WT) human thrombin were obtained and characterized as described previously (12Hall S.W. Nagashima M.

The mutant form retains its catalytic activity, although its ability to interact with heparin was severely impaired, as demonstrated by in vitro studies on heparin-catalyzed thrombin inhibition by anti-thrombin III. PPACK-thrombin was obtained and characterized as previously reported (13Ketner C. Shaw E. Thromb. Res. 1979; 14: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Mocarhagin was purified from cobra venom, as described previously (14De Luca M. Dunlop L.C. Andrews R.K. Flannery J.V. Ettling R. Cumming D.A. Veldman G.M. Berndt M.C. J. Biol.

HD22, a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT-3′, which binds with high affinity to the heparin binding site of thrombin (15Tasset D.M. Kubik M.F. Steiner W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Prof. J. I. Weitz, (McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario). The PAR-1-(38–60) peptide, LDPRSFLLRNPNDKYEPFWEDEE, was synthesized and characterized by mass spectrometry at Primm s. r. l. (Milan, Italy). The monoclonal antibody LJ1b10, which is able to selectively inhibit thrombin-GpIb interaction, was a generous gift from Dr. Zaverio Ruggeri (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Platelets from normal donors were obtained by gel filtration of platelet rich plasma onto Sepharose 2B columns (25 × 1 cm) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 0.2% albumin, pH 7.4. EDTA (1-mmfinal concentration) was added to PRP prior to gel filtration to avoid activation during washing procedures. The platelet count was adjusted to 1 × 105/μl with washing buffer in all the experiments. GpIb-depleted platelets were prepared by using the cobra venom metalloproteinase, mocarhagin, which selectively cleaves GpIb between Glu-282 and Asp-283 residues, according to a previously reported method (9De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, gel-filtered platelets were incubated with 10 μg/ml mocarhagin and 1 mm Ca2+ for 20 min at 37 °C. The mocarhagin activity was stopped by 2 mm EDTA. An aliquot of intact platelets (i.e. not exposed to mocarhagin) from the same donor was subjected to the same incubation with 1 mm Ca2+ for 20 min at 37°, addition of 2 mm EDTA and was used as a control. Evaluation of GpIb cleavage was performed by flow cytometry using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-GpIb monoclonal antibody CD42b (SZ2 clone) (Immunotech, Marseille, France), whose epitope on GpIbα is lost following mocarhagin treatment (5Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 4929-4938Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Gel-filtered platelets, intact or GpIb-depleted, were exposed to α-thrombin, whose final concentration ranged from 1 nm to 10 nm in different experiments. At different times (from 15 to 600 s), aliquots of 50 μl of stimulated platelets were drawn into tubes containing 100 nm hirudin, which abolished the thrombin activity. The tubes were placed in ice to stop internalization of cleaved PAR-1 molecules (16Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Blanchard N. Stadel J.M. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In different experiments, intact platelets were stimulated by α-thrombin in the presence of either 130 μg/ml anti-GpIb SZ2 mAb, 400 nm HD22 aptamer, or 140 nmPPACK-thrombin. In the experiments using the R98A thrombin mutant and the recombinant WT human thrombin, gel-filtered platelets were stimulated by the enzymes at a concentration of 1 nm. The presence of intact PAR-1 molecules on the platelet membrane at different times after thrombin stimulation was measured by using a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-PAR-1 mAb, SPAN12 clone (Immunotech). SPAN12 recognizes the NH2-terminal peptide of PAR-1 residues 35–46 (NATLDPR↓SFLLR), where “↓” indicates the cleavage site by thrombin. This mAb reacts only with uncleaved PAR-1 molecules (16Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Blanchard N. Stadel J.M. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, PE-SPAN12 was added to 1 × 106 platelets at increasing amounts (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 μg) for 30 min at 4 °C. Platelet suspensions were subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA at 1500 rpm for 5 min. An optimal resolution of control and test histograms was obtained with 2 μg of anti-PAR-1 mAb/1 × 106 platelets. Thus, this saturating dose was chosen for subsequent experiments. Background fluorescence was determined using a PE-conjugated isotype-matched irrelevant mAb. At the end of stimulation by thrombin, 2 μg of SPAN-12 was added to each tube containing platelets and hirudin. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, platelets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA, and samples were run through a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm. PE signals were collected and recorded at 575 nm; gain setting stability was verified daily with Calibrite BeadsTM®(Becton Dickenson). A minimum of 20,000 events were acquired in list mode using CellQuestTM software (Becton Dickenson); forward (FSC) and side (SSC) scatter were collected with logarithmic amplification, and fluorescent emissions were collected on a 4-decade logarithmic scale. Levels of silver expression were measured in terms of the geometric mean of specific fluorescence. Hydrolysis of the PAR-1-(38–60) peptide by thrombin was followed by measuring the release of the peptide LDPR, resulting from the cleavage of the NH2 terminus of PAR-1, according to a previously described method (7De Candia E. De Cristofaro R De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μm PAR-1-(38–60) peptide was incubated with 0.1 nm WT thrombin or 0.1 nm R98A thrombin in HEPES (10 mm), NaCl (0.15 m), polyethylene glycolM r 6000 (0.1%) pH 7.5 at 25°. At time intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 15 min) the reaction was stopped with 0.3 m HClO4, and the cleaved peptide was measured by reversed-phase HPLC, using a 250 × 4.6 mm RP-304 column (Bio-Rad). Experimental concentrations of PAR-1-(38–60) peptide cleaved at timet (P t), were fitted to the following equation,Pt=P∞(1−exp(−kobst))Equation 1 where P ∞ is the peptide concentration at t = ∞ and k obs is the pseudo first-order rate of PAR-1 hydrolysis, equal to e0 ×k cat/K m (e0 is the thrombin concentration). Gel-filtered platelets were suspended in HEPES buffer, as detailed above, containing 2 mmCaCl2 and used at a final count of 200,000/μl. Platelet aggregation by thrombin was studied using a 4-channel PACKS-4 aggregometer (Helena Laboratories, Sunderland, UK), according to the Born method. In some experiments, platelets were stimulated by recombinant human WT thrombin and R98A thrombin at concentrations ranging from 0.39 nm to 50 nm. In other experiments, platelets were stimulated by WT thrombin at concentrations ranging from 0.625 to 20 nm, or by R98A thrombin at concentrations ranging from 3.125 to 100 nm, in the absence and in the presence of monoclonal antibody LJIb10 (0.15 mg/ml, final concentration). The velocity of absorbance change was measured and expressed as percent/min. Measurement of PAR-1 hydrolysis by α-thrombin was accomplished by a cytofluorimetric method, using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody, SPAN-12, that recognizes only the intact NH2-terminal portion of the receptor. After cleavage, the mAb does not interact with the receptor, so that disappearance of the mAb signal reflects the hydrolytic reaction. Internalization of the receptor, which could also lead to loss of signal, has been shown to occur only for cleaved PAR-1 molecules (16Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Blanchard N.

Under the conditions of the study, using intact gel-filtered platelets, the concentration of PAR-1 present on the platelet membrane (100–2000 copies of PAR-1/platelet, Refs. 19Mazzucato M.

Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman, New York1985: 105Google Scholar). kobs=e0kcat/KmEquation 2 In the experimental setup, the fluorescent signal given by the SPAN-12 mAb was monitored as a function of time at fixed thrombin concentrations. Although the antibody staining procedure is relatively long compared with PAR-1 cleavage kinetics at the concentrations of thrombin used, this limitation was overcome by performing the staining on ice and using high concentrations of hirudin to completetly inhibit thrombin activity. Fluorescence signals measured as a function of time were fitted to the following equation,Flt=Fl0exp(−kobst)+Fl∞Equation 3 where Flt is the fluorescence at time t, Fl0 is the initial, Fl∞ is the final fluorescence value, and k obs is the observed rate constant for the single exponential decay. Knowing the enzyme concentration and using Eq. 2, thek cat/K m value could be calculated. Additional experiments were carried out to confirm the validity of this experimental approach. From Eq. 2 it follows that if the k obs value actually reflects thek cat/K m value of the hydrolytic reaction, then it must depend on the enzyme concentration. Thus, the observed rate constant was measured at different thrombin concentrations, ranging from 0.5 to 8 nm. The above analysis assumes that the concentration of the uncleaved receptor does not change during the time course of the experiments. To test this hypothesis, control experiments were carried out with a different mAb, WEDE-15, directed against the COOH-terminal domain of the PAR-1 cleavage site. Using thrombin in the nanomolar range, only a decrease in WEDE-15 binding to gel-filtered platelets was observed, consistent with an internalization process of the hydrolyzed PAR-1 receptor, which has been previously reported (16Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Blanchard N. Stadel J.M. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 26: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 17Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This implies that over the time course of the experiments, newly exposed receptors (present in the surface connecting system) did not significantly alter the total PAR-1 concentration and that loss of WEDE-15 binding to platelets is likely because of an internalization process involving the cleaved receptor molecules. These findings therefore allow calculation of the apparentk cat/K m value pertaining to thrombin-PAR-1 interaction as outlined above. As shown in Fig. 1, the pseudo first-order rate constant of PAR-1 cleavage increased as a function of α-thrombin concentration ranging from 0.5 to 8 nm, consistent with the canonical Michaelis scheme for serine protease activity that predicts a linear relation between the catalytic rate and the enzyme concentration (Eq. 2). The inset in Fig. 1demonstrates this relationship with the slope of the straight line expressing the apparentk cat/K m value, which is equal to 1.5 ± 0.1 × 107m−1sec−1. This value is similar to that for thrombin hydrolysis of the PAR-1-(38–60) peptide in solution (see below), supporting the validity of the cytofluorimetric strategy used in this investigation. The effect of inhibiting thrombin-GpIb interaction on the enzyme hydrolysis rate of PAR-1 was evaluated by five different experimental strategies: 1) elimination of the thrombin binding site on GpIbα by mocarhagin treatment of gel-filtered platelets, 2) use of a monoclonal antibody SZ2, which binds to GpIbα and inhibits thrombin interaction, 3) use of the DNA aptamer HD22, which specifically interacts with the heparin binding site (HBS) of thrombin and inhibits enzyme binding to GpIbα, 4) use of a thrombin mutant, R98A, which bears a perturbation of the HBS structure, and 5) use of PPACK-thrombin in competition experiments with α-thrombin. The removal of the NH2-terminal 1–282 region of GpIbα by mocarhagin severely impaired the PAR-1 hydrolysis by thrombin. As shown in Fig. 2, thek obs value for PAR-1 hydrolysis by 1 nm α-thrombin was reduced by about 6-fold in GpIb-depleted platelets compared with untreated platelets. Theinset in Fig. 2 shows that thek cat/K m value of PAR-1 hydrolysis in mocarhagin-treated platelets, which was 2.8 ± 0.3 × 106m−1sec−1, decreased 5.4-fold in comparison with untreated platelets. Similar results were obtained by using two different competitive inhibitors of thrombin binding to GpIb, the mAb SZ2, which interacts with the thrombin binding site on GpIbα (5Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 4929-4938Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the DNA aptamer HD22, which interacts with the thrombin HBS. Fig.3 clearly shows that in both cases a roughly 5–6-fold reduction in k obs was obtained using a large excess of the inhibitors. Although the targets of the inhibitors were different, the effect was the same, as in both cases the thrombin-GpIb interaction was inhibited. Altogether these results show that inhibition of thrombin binding to GpIbα causes a marked reduction of the apparent catalytic specificity constant of the thrombin-PAR-1 interaction.Figure 3Measurement of thek obs value pertaining to PAR-1 hydrolysis in the presence of inhibitors of thrombin-GpIb interaction. Quantification of PAR-1 hydrolysis was accomplished as reported in the legend to Fig. 1, using 2 nmα-thrombin, but in the presence of 400 nm HD22 aptamer (●)or 130 μg/ml anti-GpIb SZ2 mAb (■), both inhibiting the thrombin-GpIb interaction. The kinetics of PAR-1 hydrolysis in the absence of any inhibitor, but in the presence of 130 μg/ml human IgG used as control, is reported as well (○). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from two different determinations.

PPACK-thrombin, which is catalytically inactive, yet still able to interact with GpIb, did not cause aggregation of gel-filtered platelets, even at 200 nmand did not induce any intracytoplasmic Ca2+ flux (data not shown), in accordance with numerous previous reports (6De Candia E. De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3308-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jones G.D. Kornauser R. Jackson B. Yamamoto N. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, competition experiments showed that a high concentration of PPACK-thrombin (140 nm), by displacing α-thrombin from GpIbα, reduced by about 3-fold the apparentk cat/K m value of PAR-1 hydrolysis on intact platelets, as shown in Fig.4. Again, this experiment is in accord with the other functional experiments described above and corroborates the hypothesis that thrombin-GpIb interaction is able to enhance the specificity of thrombin cleavage of PAR-1 on intact platelets. This hypothesis was further supported by the finding that a thrombin mutant, R98A, bearing an alanine substitution in the HBS of thrombin at Arg-98, showed a similar reduction of the k obsvalue of PAR-1 hydrolysis compared with recombinant WT human thrombin, as shown in Fig. 5. In control experiments, this diminished activity of PAR-1 hydrolysis on platelets could not be attributed to an intrinsic reduction of the catalytic efficiency of the thrombin mutant. Solution experiments employing the PAR-1-(38–60) peptide, bearing both the cleavage and the recognition site for thrombin (23Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J.W., II Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), demonstrated that thrombin R98A cleaved the solution peptide with ak cat/K m that was slightly higher than that of WT thrombin, as shown in Fig.6. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction of thek cat/K m value of PAR-1 hydrolysis on intact platelets is likely because of a defective interaction of the thrombin mutant with GpIbα. Moreover, the biological effect of this mutation on platelet activation can be seen in Fig. 7, which shows that the EC50 value for platelet aggregation by R98A is roughly 10-fold higher compared with WT thrombin.Figure 6Measurement of thek cat /K m value pertaining to the PAR-1-(38–60) peptide hydrolysis by wild-type and the R98A thrombin mutant.

The vacuole, like the lysosome in animal cells, is the primary site of degradation. Our understanding of the hydrolytic vacuolar enzymes that serve in protein turnover is well advanced. Progress has also been made in elucidating mechanisms that deliver the substrates of these vacuolar hydrolases. While research has focused on the biosynthesis and function of the vacuolar proteases, little is known about how lipids are recycled in this organelle, and a lipase that functions in membrane recycling has not been identified. Nearly all vacuolar/lysosomal delivery pathways involve packaging of cargo within membrane-enclosed transport compartments. Because the vacuole/lysosome serves as the final destination for these numerous vesicle-mediated transport pathways, the issue of how membranes reaching the vacuole are recycled is an important one. Macroautophagy is the major degradative process in eukaryotes and is essential during starvation conditions (1Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In yeast, autophagy overlaps with a biosynthetic process, the Cvt pathway, that delivers the hydrolase aminopeptidase I (API1; Ref.2Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) from its site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the vacuolar lumen. Cvt and autophagy employ many of the same molecular components and are mechanistically related (3Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Both pathways involve the formation of double-membrane cytosolic vesicles, sequestering either precursor aminopeptidase I (prAPI) specifically, or in the case of autophagy, also enveloping bulk cytosol in a nonselective manner. Fusion of these vesicles with the vacuole results in the release of single-membrane subvacuolar vesicles within the lumen. These pathways require a mechanism for specific lysis of the internalized vesicles, so that vesicle cargo can be released into the vacuole lumen, and further require a mechanism for degradation of vesicle lipids. To understand the molecular basis of these import and degradation pathways, we carried out a genetic screen for mutants defective in delivery of prAPI to the vacuole. We isolated a series of mutants,cvt, which accumulate the precursor form of API. Thecvt mutants overlap with mutants defective in autophagy. The majority of these mutants are blocked at a stage involving formation of the sequestering vesicle (reviewed in Ref. 1Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). One mutant,cvt17, was found to be blocked in the breakdown of subvacuolar vesicles, suggesting that Cvt17 acts at a late stage of the import process (6Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We report in this paper the cloning of the gene encoding CVT17. Immunological and biochemical studies demonstrate that Cvt17 is a glycosylated, integral membrane protein that transits through the secretory pathway. Cvt17 contains a domain that is conserved among lipases of the α/β-hydrolase-fold superfamily. Mutation of the putative lipase active site abolishes Cvt17 function in the Cvt and autophagy pathways, suggesting that lipase activity is critical to the role of this protein in these import processes. Wild type yeast strain SEY6210, was described previously (7Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell.

We followed standard procedures to prepare antiserum to Cvt17, using synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 131–152 and 295–312 (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA). Additional antisera were described previously (13Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L.

TheCVT17 gene was cloned by transforming the cvt17-1strain with a plasmid genomic library and screening for complementation of the starvation-sensitive phenotype on plates containing phloxine B (18Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). A secondary screen for prAPI accumulation was carried out as described previously (2Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Subcloning of a complementing plasmid identified YCR068w as the complementing CVT17 ORF. Thecvt17Δ strain (KTYD17) was made by inserting theLEU2 gene into the CVT17 ORF of strain SEY6210. At the time of this analysis, the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) sequence had shown YCR068w as a 1.289-kilobase coding sequence. We amplified this region and subcloned it into pCu426 using PCR (all primer sequences available upon request). This construct (pCuCVT17ΔC(426)) failed to complement the prAPI defect of cvt17Δ. The construct was sequenced, and comparison to the SGD sequence revealed a single cytosine insertion in the PCR amplified gene, at nucleotide 956 of the ORF. Sequencing of the original genomic plasmid revealed an identical sequence to the PCR product, suggesting an error in the SGD sequence. A recent revision of the chromosome III sequence has corrected this error. The rectified CVT17 sequence shifts the frame of the coding sequence, increasing the length of the encoded protein. The longer, full-length coding sequence was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCu426 to generate pCuCVT17(426). For analysis of Cvt17 expression driven by the native promoter, CVT17 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pRS416 and pRS426, with inclusion of 0.5 kilobase before the start codon and 0.432 kilobase after the stop codon. A PCR-based overlap-extension strategy was used in site-directed mutagenesis of CVT17. Serine 332 was converted to alanine by changing the T at nucleotide 994 to G. Cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled proteins, nitrogen starvation sensitivity, prAPI protease sensitivity, and reversal in SD-N were performed as described previously (8George M.D. Baba M.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 1 mm PMSF. After boiling for 7 min, an equal volume of 0.1% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol was added, then boiled for 7 min. Denatured proteins were incubated overnight at 37° C in the presence of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 16 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% SDS, 5 mmPMSF, and 2 units of Endo H. A second immunoprecipitation recovered the Cvt17 proteins. Construction of the GFPAut7 fusion protein and FM 4-64 labeling of cells are described elsewhere. 2Kim, J., Huang, W.-P., and Klionsky, D. J. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 152,in press Cells were examined using a Nikon Eclipse E-800 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured by a Hamamatsu C4742–98 digital camera. Previous analysis of cvt17-1 by electron microscopy suggested a defect in the breakdown of subvacuolar, prAPI-containing vesicles, called Cvt bodies (3Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We isolated theCVT17 gene and disrupted the chromosomal locus to generate acvt17Δ strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). The null phenotype was accumulation of prAPI (Fig.1 A), as seen previously with the cvt17-1 mutant. To determine the site of action of Cvt17, we analyzed the state of precursor API in cvt17Δ. Yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts and subjected to osmotic lysis. Addition of exogenous protease allowed us to determine whether the accumulated prAPI was blocked at a stage prior to Cvt vesicle formation/completion (protease-sensitive) or at a point following enclosure but prior to fusion with the vacuole or vesicle breakdown (protease-protected). As controls, we examined prAPI protease sensitivity in two strains that are defective in prAPI import. Apg5 is part of a novel protein conjugation complex that is required for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways (20Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The apg5Δ strain is blocked in the completion of Cvt vesicles and accumulates membrane-associated, but protease-sensitive, prAPI (8George M.D. Baba M. Scott S.V. Mizushima N. Garrison B.S. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ypt7 is a rab GTPase that is required for fusion of Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes with the vacuole (1Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Theypt7Δ mutant accumulates prAPI in a protease-resistant state within completed cytosolic vesicles. Precursor API was found in a pelletable fraction in cvt17Δ, as it was in theapg5Δ and ypt7Δ mutant strains (Fig.1 A). In the apg5Δ strain, prAPI was sensitive to exogenous protease, even in the absence of detergent, consistent with a block in vesicle formation (8George M.D. Baba M. Scott S.V. Mizushima N. Garrison B.S. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, ypt7Δ and cvt17Δ cells contained prAPI that was not degraded to the mature form in the presence of exogenously added proteinase K unless detergent was also added, indicating that prAPI was within a membrane enclosed compartment (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 21Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These data, coupled with the vesicle accumulation phenotype ofcvt17-1, suggest that prAPI was accumulating within subvacuolar Cvt vesicles in the cvt17Δ strain. To assess whether the vesicles accumulating in cvt17Δ are indeed Cvt bodies, we examined whether a Cvt vesicle marker accumulated within subvacuolar vesicles during vegetative growth conditions. Aut7 is a component that is required for Cvt vesicle formation and is itself enclosed within Cvt vesicles (22Huang W.-P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated the utility of a GFPAut7 construct as a marker for following the formation and movement of Cvt vesicles in vivo. 2Kim, J., Huang, W.-P., and Klionsky, D. J. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 152,in press To visualize the vacuole membrane, we used FM 4-64, a lipophilic red dye. Incvt17Δ, GFPAut7 is localized to Cvt bodies, seen as punctate structures accumulating within FM 4-64-labeled vacuoles (Fig.1 B, top panels). Some GFPAut7 punctate staining was also observed outside the vacuole. Mutants in the PEP4gene, encoding vacuolar proteinase A, accumulate subvacuolar vesicles, including Cvt bodies by electron microscopy (5Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous observations, GFPAut7-labeled Cvt bodies also accumulated in the vacuoles of a pep4Δ strain (Fig. 1 B,bottom panels) but did not accumulate in the vacuoles of wild type yeast (data not shown). The FM 4-64 vacuolar staining incvt17Δ differed from that in other strains, includingpep4Δ; we observed a relative increase in the number of FM 4-64-labeled compartments per cell in the cvt17Δ strain (Fig. 1 B). While we do not know the molecular basis for the change in vacuolar morphology, the microscopy data provide direct evidence that cvt17Δ accumulates Cvt bodies within the vacuole. While many molecular components are shared between the Cvt and autophagy pathways, some cvt mutants are not defective in autophagy (3Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Scott S.V. Nice III, D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I. Funakoshi T. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25840-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To test whether cvt17Δ has a defect in autophagy, we examined whether the strain can survive growth in nitrogen-depleted media. Because transport to the vacuole by autophagy is the primary mode for degradation of cytoplasmic constituents under starvation conditions, the process is essential for viability during nutrient limitation. Wild type cells can withstand nutrient deprivation for long periods of time, while autophagy mutants such asapg1Δ or protease-deficient strains such aspep4Δ show reduced viability following a shift from growth in nutrient-rich medium to nitrogen-deficient medium (Fig.2 A). Like apg1Δ and pep4Δ, the cvt17Δ strain was starvation-sensitive. Growing yeast cells transport prAPI to the vacuole via Cvt vesicles, while under nutrient deprivation, prAPI can be transported by autophagosomes (4Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). If cvt17Δ is defective in lysis of autophagic bodies, as its starvation sensitivity suggests, we should see a block in prAPI maturation not only in rich media but also under starvation conditions. Indeed, both the Cvt and autophagic routes of delivery are blocked, as indicated by analysis of API following a shift to SD-N medium (Fig. 2 B). Autophagy mutants display differential blocks in API import under nutrient-rich versusstarvation conditions. For example, mutants such as aut7Δ that do not have a complete defect in autophagy accumulate prAPI in nutrient-rich media but are able to mature prAPI under starvation conditions (Ref. 19Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar; Fig. 2 B). In contrast, strains that have more severe autophagy defects, including apg1Δ, accumulate prAPI even after prolonged growth in SD-N. Thecvt17Δ strain did not exhibit a rescue of the prAPI processing defect when cells were shifted to SD-N, indicating that it is defective in autophagy as well as the Cvt pathway (Fig.2 B). From these results we conclude that Cvt17 is involved in the lysis of autophagic bodies, as well as Cvt bodies. Our original analysis ofCVT17 revealed an SGD error in the coding region of this ORF (see “Experimental Procedures”). We discovered that the predicted coding sequence that was given in the data base at that time did not complement the prAPI accumulation phenotype in cvt17Δ (Fig. 3 A, ΔC-term. 2 μ). Sequencing revealed the presence of an extra cytosine base in the gene, at nucleotide 956 of the ORF. This insertion shifts the predicted reading frame, resulting in a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 58.5 kDa, rather than the 49.9 kDa predicted in the original data base. The full-length gene is able to complement thecvt17Δ strain, as shown by the accumulation of mAPI (Fig.3 A, 2μ and CEN). Importantly, the frameshift occurred just 5′ to a consensus site that is conserved in lipases and esterases (EC 3.1.1.3). The presence of this motif was revealed by a BLOCK search using the full-length, correct Cvt17 sequence. The sequence from amino acid 324 to 338 matches the consensus pattern of serine-active lipases (PROSITE reference PS00120; [LIV]-X-[LIVFY]-[LIVMST]-G-[HYWV]-S-X-G-[GSTAC]; Fig. 3 B). A BLAST search identified related proteins in several distinct fungi, including Candida albicans(GenBankTM accession number AL033391; 43% identity), as well as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (GenBankTM accession number Z99753; 48% identity) and the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum(GenBankTM accession number Y14554; 38% identity (23Coleman M. Henricot B. Arnau J. Oliver R.P. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 1106-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)). Alignments of the partial sequences over an area of significant homology are shown in Fig. 3 B. Cvt17 is most similar to the subfamily of fungal lipases within the larger α/β-hydrolase-fold superfamily (24Cousin X. Hotelier T. Giles K. Toutant J.P. Chatonnet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Derewenda Z.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Triglcyeride lipases are lipolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the ester bond of triglycerides. In addition to the conserved serine within the active site consensus motif, a histidine residue and an aspartic acid residue act in hydrolysis in a charge-relay system (26Blow D. Nature. 1990; 343: 694-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found two well conserved aspartic acid residues in Cvt17 and other related fungal genes as well as a conserved histidine (Fig.3 B). To determine whether the serine of the putative lipase domain is required for the function of Cvt17, we mutated the serine at position 332 to an alanine residue. Western blot analysis of API in thecvt17Δ strain that contained the mutated gene (cvt17S332A) showed accumulation of the precursor form of API, even when the mutant gene was expressed from a high copy plasmid (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the wild type gene allowed for prAPI maturation on both high and low copy plasmids. Thus, Cvt17 cannot function to break down subvacuolar vesicles and allow prAPI to be released into the vacuole without this serine within the G-X-S-X-G lipase motif. The potential assignment of Cvt17 as a lipase required for the degradation of subvacuolar vesicles led us to examine its biosynthesis. To this end, we generated polyclonal antiserum against the protein. Immunoprecipitation revealed a single predominant band of ∼70 kDa. This band was not detected in the cvt17Δ strain, and expression of CVT17 from a high copy plasmid greatly increased the abundance of this protein (Fig.4 A, 2μlanes), suggesting that the serum was specific for Cvt17. We also immunoprecipitated Cvt17 from the strain harboring the mutant protein, which lacked the putative catalytic serine (cvt17S332A 2μ). The altered protein was recovered in equivalent amounts to the wild type protein, indicating that the single point mutation did not affect the stability of the protein. Analysis of the Cvt17 primary sequence indicates a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (residues 13–35) that might serve as a membrane anchor for the protein. Following osmotic lysis and subcellular fractionation, Cvt17 was predominately localized to a 13,000 × g pelletable fraction (Fig. 4 B). We investigated whether this localization was due to direct interaction with a membrane by subjecting the P13 fraction to different wash conditions. Alkali extraction efficiently removed the peripheral membrane protein Vma2 from the membrane but had no effect on Cvt17 or the integral membrane protein Dpm1 (data not shown). Treatment with the detergent Triton X-100 resulted in the solubilization of all three proteins. These results suggest that Cvt17 is an integral membrane protein. The predicted molecular mass of Cvt17 is 58.5 kDa; however, the protein migrated with a molecular mass of 70 kDa following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 A). The Cvt17 sequence has three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites. To determine whether the aberrant migration was due to glycosylation, we treated immunoprecipitated Cvt17 with Endo H. Following treatment with the deglycosylating enzyme, the molecular mass of Cvt17 shifted to ∼61 kDa (Fig. 5 A). This change in molecular mass correlates well with the predicted removal of three N-linked carbohydrate side chains. This post-translational modification reveals that Cvt17 must reside at least temporarily in the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the observation that Cvt17 is glycosylated allows us to infer the membrane topology of the protein. All three putative glycosylation sites are C-terminal to the transmembrane domain, suggesting that Cvt17 is a type II integral membrane protein. Upon integration into the ER membrane, the N-terminal 13 amino acids would remain exposed to the cytosol, with the majority of the protein located in the lumen of the ER. The phenotype of the cvt17 mutant, accumulation of subvacuolar vesicles, coupled with its characterization as a secretory pathway protein suggests that Cvt17 might function within the vacuole lumen. Accordingly, we attempted to localize the Cvt17 protein. Subcellular fractionation based on velocity sedimentation indicated that Cvt17 was predominantly localized within a 13,000 ×g fraction (Fig. 4 B). The P13 fraction contains various subcellular compartments, including the vacuole. To directly determine whether Cvt17 was located within the vacuole, we purified vacuoles from yeast spheroplasts. However, we were unable to detect Cvt17 in the vacuolar fraction using this technique (data not shown). As an alternative approach, we fractionated cell lysates on an OptiPrep density gradient. Using this technique, in the presence of substantial amounts of protease inhibitors, we were able to detect small amounts of Cvt17 in fractions that contained the vacuolar protein marker alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). However, the majority of the Cvt17 was found in fractions that were distinct from the vacuole fractions. Thus, Cvt17 is found predominately in a membrane fraction residing outside the vacuole under steady-state conditions. To examine the localization of Cvt17 in vivo, we engineered GFP fusions with the protein at both the N and C termini. Both constructs only partially complemented the Cvt trafficking defect of the cvt17Δ strain, as assessed by API Western blotting (data not shown). Furthermore, we were unable to visualize strong fluorescent signals anywhere in cells containing these GFP fusion constructs. An explanation for this lack of signal might be an inherent instability of Cvt17. To examine stability of Cvt17 directly, we carried out a pulse-chase analysis. Yeast cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and subjected to a nonradioactive chase. At each time point, samples were removed and immunoprecipitated. We found that Cvt17 was unstable in wild type cells; the protein was degraded with a half-life of ∼45 min (Fig.5 B). The inherent instability of this protein made its localization problematic as much of it was degraded during fractionation procedures. We have identified a protein that is required for the turnover of membrane vesicles in the vacuole of yeast. Sequence analysis of this protein reveals the presence of a domain found in lipases and esterases, and we have confirmed the importance of this domain by using site-directed mutagenesis of a putative active site serine residue within the lipase motif. Phenotypic analysis of yeast expressing the altered Cvt17 protein shows that the protein is inactive in the Cvt pathway without this residue. The cvt17Δ mutant is unable to degrade both Cvt bodies and autophagic bodies and is extremely sensitive to starvation (Fig. 2 A). The ability to degrade membranes that are released into the vacuole lumen is required for starvation survival. In the absence of this degradative capacity, the cell is unable to break down lipid and, as a result, is unable to access cargo contained within autophagic bodies. The occurrence of genes with similarity to CVT17 in other fungi suggests that this may be a conserved protein in the kingdom. The maintenance of membrane-bound vesicles in the cvt17Δ strain suggests a role for the protein in degrading a phospholipid bilayer. Sequence comparisons, however, place the protein in a class of hydrolytic enzymes that act primarily on triglycerides, not phospholipids. It will be necessary to perform biochemical studies with the purified enzyme to investigate its substrate specificity. To function properly, lipases must be targeted to the appropriate substrates. The membrane source of Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes is not known. If Cvt17 is incorporated into Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes, its topology would place the Cvt17 active site on the outer surface of the Cvt and autophagic bodies. To prevent membrane degradation during transit, it is possible that Cvt17 becomes active only in the vacuole. If this is the case, the lytic activity of this protein must be suppressed during transit. Some aspect of the vacuolar milieu may then activate Cvt17 as is thought to be the case for proteinase A. If Cvt17 acts directly to degrade subvacuolar vesicles, it should reside within the vacuole. Subcellular fractionation did reveal a small population of vacuolar Cvt17 that may play a primary role in directly degrading Cvt and autophagic bodies. Most of the protein, however, did not cofractionate with this organelle. In agreement with these results, the rapid Cvt17 degradation that we observed (Fig. 5 B) was independent of the major vacuole proteases (data not shown). The reasons for maintaining a sizable population of Cvt17 outside the vacuole are as yet obscure. It is possible that Cvt17 performs some additional unknown function outside the vacuole. Another possibility is that Cvt17 acts exclusively outside the vacuole and only indirectly influences the lytic competence of subvacuolar vesicles; Cvt17 might act as a lipase to specifically alter the lipid composition of Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes as they form. Specific lipid composition might be a requirement for the subsequent lysis of Cvt bodies and autophagic bodies. Lipids could even provide the molecular basis for recognition within the vacuole lumen, allowing an alternate vacuolar lipase to distinguish between subvacuolar vesicles destined for degradation and the bounding vacuolar membrane, which must remain intact. Cvt17 function, and specifically the function of a lipase active site domain, is required for the lysis of subvacuolar Cvt and autophagic bodies. Characterization of this protein is an important first step in understanding vacuolar function in the turnover of lipids and in the terminal steps of the Cvt and autophagic pathways. Continued analysis of Cvt17 will provide important information about membrane recycling in the vacuole.

Furthermore, using a GAP-inactive mutant, we have shown that the GAP activity of MgcRacGAP is required for cytokinesis, suggesting that inactivation of the Rho family of GTPases may be required for normal progression of cytokinesis. guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase activating protein interleukinn-6 phosphate-buffered saline: FCS, fetal calf serum glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction internal ribosomal entry site 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate enhanced green fluorescence protein A cell divides into two daughter cells through nuclear division and cytokinesis. In cytokinesis, formation of an actomyosin-based contraction ring separates the cytoplasm to two daughter cells (1Glotzer M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Mabuchi I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 101: 175-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A small GTPase RhoA localizes in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis and plays important roles in cytokinesis (3Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopuseggs, microinjection of a Rho-specific inhibitor C3, an exoenzyme fromClostridium botulinum, prevents the progression of cytokinesis (4Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 95-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Other members of the Rho family of GTPases may also be involved in cytokinesis. A human cell line expressing a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42, as well as a Dictyostelium strain lacking the RacE gene encoding a Rac/Cdc42 related protein, produced multinucleated cells as a result of impaired cytokinesis (5Dutartre H. Davoust J. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 77-367Google Scholar,6Larochelle D.A. Vithalani K.K. De Lozanne A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 9-1321Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently, putative cytoplasmic targets of the Rho family of GTPases have been identified, and some of which, including Gic, Bni1p, and citron kinase, seem to be specifically involved in cytokinesis (7Brown J.L.

Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases, represented by RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, act as molecular switches of diverse biological functions involving remodeling of cytoplasmic actin and microtubules (11Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar, 12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound Rho protein is an active form, while the GDP-bound form is inactive. Activation of the Rho family is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 which catalyze the replacement of bound GDP by GTP. The GTP-bound form of the Rho family can specifically interact with their effectors or targets and transmit signals to downstream molecules. On the other hand, they are inactivated through hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by their intrinsic GTPase activities, assisted by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (13Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Several GEFs are known to play roles in cytokinesis. For example, Vav-3, a novel Vav family protein which has a GEF activity for RhoA, RhoG, and Rac, has an important role in cytokinesis (14Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Another GEF for the Rho family, ECT2, is implicated in cytokinesis (15Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, Pbl, a homologue of mammalian ECT2, was found to be required for initiation of cytokinesis (16Prokopenko S.N. Brumby A. O'Keefe L. Prior L. He Y. Saint R. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2301-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). On the other hand, which GAPs inactivate the Rho family of GTPases involved in cytokinesis has been largely unknown. In a search for molecules involved in macrophage differentiation, we identified a murine cDNA for Rac/Cdc42-specific GAP, whose antisense cDNA inhibited macrophage differentiation of mouse leukemic M1 cells induced by IL-6. Moreover its overexpression induced differentiation of human leukemic HL-60 cells into macrophage. This Rac/Cdc42-specific GAP is a homologue of a previously identified human RacGAP, MgcRacGAP (17Toure A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jegou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, our clone encoded an additional 106 amino acids at the N terminus that has a myosin-like sequence (18Kawashima T. Hirose K. Satoh T. Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the human counterpart we identified had a similar myosin-like domain, indicating that the previously reported cDNA for human MgcRacGAP encoded a protein with an N-terminal deletion. Overexpression of MgcRacGAP retarded proliferation and induced formation of multinucleated cells in all cell lines examined. In addition, the highest expression level of MgcRacGAP mRNA was observed at the G2/M phase. These data prompted us to determine whether MgcRacGAP regulates cell proliferation through the control of cytokinesis. Immunohistochemical studies showed that MgcRacGAP colocalized with the mitotic spindle in metaphase, and was transferred to the midzone in anaphase and telophase, and moved to the midbody in cytokinesis. Analysis of deletion mutants of MgcRacGAP showed that overexpression of a myosin-like domain-deletion mutant or a GAP activity defective mutant of MgcRacGAP halted cell division and led to form multinucleated cells. We also showed that MgcRacGAP associated with microtubules in vivo through the N-terminal myosin-like domain. These data indicated that MgcRacGAP plays key roles in the cell cycle machinery, especially in the G2/M phase, through binding to microtubules. HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips, and the next day the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The permeabilized cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The antibodies, anti-mouse α-tubulin (Sigma clone No. DM 1A), mouse anti-Flag (Sigma clone No. M2), and rabbit anti-Flag (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, placed as a drop on the coverslips, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed six times with PBS and covered with a solution containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Wako), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Sigma), and DAPI (4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole) at 1 μg/ml for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed six times with PBS. After the final wash, the coverslips were mounted with glycerin containingpara-phenylenediamine at 10 mg/ml and viewed with a fluorescence microscope IX70 (Olympus) equipped with SenSys/OL cold CCD camera (Olympus) and IP-Lab software (Signal Analytics Co.). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and seeded into a 6-cm dish at 1 × 106/dish. On the following day, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the wild type or the mutant forms of MgcRacGAP using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 ng/ml of mouse IL-3. HL-60 and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Immunoprecipitation from the cell lysates was performed as described previously (19Feng Y. Hodge D.R. Palmieri G. Chase D.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in TCSD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% CHAPS, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 1 h, with occasional shaking. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Equal aliquots of the supernatant fractions were incubated overnight with appropriate antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C. After this incubation period, Sepharose beads were washed five times with TCSD buffer. Proteins bound on the beads were released by boiling them in the SDS sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar) for 5 min, then loaded on a polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Synchronization of the cell cycle was achieved by double thymidine block (21Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, HeLa cells in the exponential growth phase were exposed to 2.5 mm thymidine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% FCS for 12 h and then incubated in fresh medium for 12 h. Cells were once again exposed to 2.5 mm thymidine for 12 h, after which the block was released by replacing the medium with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% FCS. Flow cytometry was performed for analysis of cell cycle as previously described. (22Bischoff J.R. Friedman P.N. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4766-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) To generate the anti-MgcRacGAP antibodies, a fusion protein between glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and C terminus domain of MgcRacGAP was produced in Escherichia coli. For preparation of a polyclonal antibody against MgcRacGAP, C-terminal 275 amino acids was purified and injected into rabbits. The antibody was purified from whole serum using the C terminus of MgcRacGAP on an affinity column. A Flag-tagged MgcRacGAP was cloned into EcoRI and NotI sites of a mammalian expression vector pME 18S (pME-MgcRacGAP) (23Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5082-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The deletion construct that defects the N-terminal myosin-like domain (ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP) was generated by PCR with a 5′ primer that contained an EcoRI site (5′-GAAAGAATTCCGAGAGATGCTCATGTGTGA-3′), and the 3′ primer that is located downstream of the BstXI site in MgcRacGAP (5′-TTCACCAACAGCTTGGTACAT-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BstXI, and subcloned into pME-MgcRacGAP (pME-ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP). A mutant MgcRacGAP lacking the cysteine-rich domain (pME-ΔCys-MgcRacGAP) was generated by overlapping extension, using PCR. GTPase activating activity defective mutant (R386A*-MgcRacGAP) was generated by overlapping extension PCR mutagenesis. PCR was carried out using a high fidelity DNA polymerase Pyrobest (Takara). The PCR amplified sequence was confirmed by an automated sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A cDNA for MgcRacGAP was cloned intoEcoRI-NotI sites of a retrovirus vector pMX-IRES-EGFP (24Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), upstream of IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence so that both MgcRacGAP and EGFP were expressed from a single mRNA (pMX-MgcRacGAP-IRES-EGFP). High titer retroviruses were produced from pMX-MgcRacGAP-IRES-EGFP, using a transient retrovirus packaging cell line PLAT-E (25Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), as described previously (26Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We first established stable transfectants expressing the ecotropic viral receptor (27Baker B.W. Boettiger D. Spooncer E. Norton J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). For infection, HL-60 and Jurkat cells transduced with the ecotropic viral receptor and Ba/F3 cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 10 ml of the retroviruses in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide (10 μg/ml) (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were washed, and refed with growth medium. Two days after infection, the infected cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and then sorted based on EGFP expression by a FACS Vantage (Becton Dickinson). The sorted cells were then expanded in a growth medium. The myosin-like domain (Myo; amino acids 1–124), the cystein-rich domain (Cys; amino acids 280–340), and three blocks conserved in RhoGAPs (GAPD; amino acids 345–620) were derived from MgcRacGAP and each domain was cloned into a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The transformed bacteria (DH5α) were grown, incubated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), lysed, and the GST fusion proteins were purified according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Using retrovirus-mediated expression screening, we identified a full-length cDNA for MgcRacGAP in the antisense configuration based on the ability to inhibit IL-6 induced differentiation of M1 cells. Overexpression of MgcRacGAP induced macrophage differentiation in HL-60 (18Kawashima T. Hirose K. Satoh T. Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that expression of MgcRacGAP partially inhibited proliferation in the cell line HL-60, M1, Ba/F3, and TF-1 (data not shown). Thus, MgcRacGAP seemed to regulate differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells. To determine the mechanisms by which MgcRacGAP regulates cell proliferation, HL-60, M1, Ba/F3, Jurkat, and HeLa cells were transduced with a bicistronic retrovirus vector pMX-IRES-EGFP carrying a full-length cDNA for MgcRacGAP, where EGFP expression guarantees the expression of exogenous MgcRacGAP. EGFP-positive cells transduced with these viruses were sorted by FACS 2 days after infection. EGFP-positive cells transduced with a control pMX-IRES-EGFP vector were similarly sorted and served as a negative control. Overexpression of MgcRacGAP retarded proliferation of all cell lines tested in this study. Unexpectedly, morphological analysis of Jurkat and Ba/F3 cells overexpressing MgcRacGAP detected a significant number of multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 1). A small number of multinucleated cells were also found in HL-60 and HeLa cells overexpressing this GAP (data not shown). These results suggested that MgcRacGAP was playing some roles in cytokinesis. To determine whether MgcRacGAP overexpression blocked the normal progression of mitosis, we performed cell cycle analysis in HL-60 overexpressing MgcRacGAP. However, no remarkable change was observed when compared with control cells, except for marginal increase of the cells in G2/M phase, which may have been caused by the presence of multinucleated cells (data not shown). Because MgcRacGAP was implicated in cytokinesis, we investigated if the expression levels of MgcRacGAP change throughout the cell cycle. To this end, HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by double thymidine block, and followed through to completion of mitosis. After release from the G1/S transition, the cells were analyzed for expression of MgcRacGAP mRNA. The DNA content at each time point was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig.2 a). The mRNA levels for MgcRacGAP were gradually increased as the cells progressed through S phase, and reached the maximum at 9–12 h after the release, corresponding to the G2/M phase (Fig. 2 b). Thus expression of MgcRacGAP mRNA was cell cycle-dependent, and peaked during the G2/M phase. These observations, together with the findings that overexpression of MgcRacGAP induced formation of multinucleated cells, suggested that MgcRacGAP functions during mitosis, in particular during cytokinesis. To further examine the function of this protein during the cell cycle, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a recombinant protein corresponding to the C-terminal half of MgcRacGAP was prepared, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This antibody specifically recognized an 85-kDa protein (Fig.3 a). To observe the subcellular distribution of the endogenous MgcRacGAP, HeLa cells were fixed, and MgcRacGAP was immunostained using the antibodies. In interphase, MgcRacGAP was mainly localized in the nucleus although no Rho family proteins have been reported to localize in the nucleus. MgcRacGAP was also detected in the cytoplasm as a reticular pattern, along with microtubules (Fig. 3 b, panel A). MgcRacGAP spread throughout the cytoplasm in prometaphase and accumulated in the mitotic spindle in metaphase (Fig. 3 b, panels B and C). In anaphase and telophase, MgcRacGAP formed a distinct fine band extending across the midzone (Fig. 3 b, panels D-E). As the cell progressed to cytokinesis, MgcRacGAP became more sharply concentrated in the midbody (Fig. 3 b, panel F). To exclude the possibility that the antibodies we used in this study cross-reacted with some protein other than MgcRacGAP, we introduced Flag-tagged MgcRacGAP, followed by immunodetection with an antibody against Flag (M2 monoclonal antibody). In this experiment, Flag-tagged MgcRacGAP was also detected in the midbody of dividing cells, thus confirming that anti-MgcRacGAP antibodies specifically recognize MgcRacGAP in immunostaining (Fig.4). MgcRacGAP contains three conserved domains, including an N-terminal myosin-like coiled-coil domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and a C-terminal GAP-conserved domain. To determine which domain of MgcRacGAP was important for the control of cytokinesis, we constructed three mutants of MgcRacGAP; ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP lacking the myosin-like domain, ΔCys-MgcRacGAP lacking the cysteine-rich domain, and R386A*MgcRacGAP with a GAP-inactivating mutation (Fig.5 a). All of these mutants were Flag-tagged at the C terminus, and were introduced into a mammalian expression vector pME 18S (23Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5082-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Expression of these mutant proteins was confirmed by transient expression in 293T cells, through lipofection. These mutant proteins as well as the wild type protein were expressed at similar levels in 293T cells (Fig. 5 b). Next we co-transfected pME-EGFP with a vector harboring the wild type or each mutant of MgcRacGAP into HeLa cells. pME 18S (23Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5082-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was used as a vector control. The morphology of the EGFP-positive cells was assessed 72 h after transfection. When the wild type and mutant MgcRacGAPs were overexpressed in HeLa cells, some populations of the cells became multinuclear. Interestingly, expression of the ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP and R386A*MgcRacGAP produced multinucleated cells more frequently (32 and 28% of the EGFP positive cells, respectively) than that of the wild type and ΔCys-MgcRacGAP did (10.5 and 8.5%, respectively) (Fig.5 b). These data demonstrated that the GAP activity and the N-terminal myosin-like domain of MgcRacGAP were required for cytokinesis. It has to be noticed that this procedure may increase the frequency of the cells with lower expression levels of the transduced wild type or mutant MgcRacGAP, which may lead to underestimation of the frequencies of multinucleated cells after 72 h. Analysis of deletion mutants indicated that the myosin-like domain and the GAP activity of MgcRacGAP were both required for completion of cytokinesis. Next, to identify the molecular mechanisms by which ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP and R386A*MgcRacGAP hampered cytokinesis, we expressed each mutant of MgcRacGAP in HeLa cells and immunostained using the anti-Flag antibody. Both mutant proteins entered the nucleus during interphase, as did the wild type of MgcRacGAP. However, unlike other mutants in cytokinesis, ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP was not detected in the midbody of dividing cells (Fig. 4). These results demonstrated that the N-terminal myosin-like coiled-coil domain was indispensable for localization to the midbody during cytokinesis, and also indicated that completion of cytokinesis requires the GAP activity of MgcRacGAP. Immunohistochemical studies suggested that MgcRacGAP associates with microtubules and plays important roles in cytokinesis. To determine whether MgcRacGAP associates with microtubules in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using cell lysates from HeLa cells with the anti-MgcRacGAP antibodies followed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies against α-, β-, and γ-tubulins. As shown in Fig.6 a, all tubulin isoforms were co-precipitated with MgcRacGAP from the cell lysates, indicating that MgcRacGAP associates with microtubules in vivo (Fig.6 a). To confirm the association between MgcRacGAP and α-, β-, and γ-tubulins, reciprocal immunoprecipitations were also performed. MgcRacGAP was detected in the precipitates of α-, β-, and γ-tubulins (Fig. 6 b). In these experiments, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with a lysis buffer containing detergent and high concentrations of salt as described under “Experimental Procedures” to avoid nonspecific binding between MgcRacGAP and tubulins as much as possible. To determine which domain of MgcRacGAP is required for its association with tubulins, we transiently transfected deletion mutants of MgcRacGAP that were Flag-tagged (Fig.4 a) into 293T cells. Two days after transfection, the cell lysates were prepared and expression of each mutant was examined with the anti-Flag antibody (Fig.7 a, upper panel). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin. The wild type MgcRacGAP, ΔCys-MgcRacGAP, and R386A*MgcRacGAP were detected in α-tubulin immunoprecipitates, whereas no ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP mutant was detected (Fig. 7 a, lower panel), demonstrating that MgcRacGAP binds tubulin through its myosin-like domain. Duplicate immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies against β- and γ-tubulin, with essentially the same results (data not shown). To further confirm this result, GST fusion proteins containing each domain of MgcRacGAP were incubated with HeLa cell lysates, and the precipitates were analyzed for the presence of α-, β-, and γ-tubulins. As shown in Fig. 7 b, all tubulin isoforms were precipitated by GST-Myo (myosin-like domain), but not by the other domain constructs. These results indicated that the N-terminal myosin-like domain mediates the association of MgcRacGAP and tubulin. In this study, we have shown that MgcRacGAP plays critical roles in cytokinesis, which is mediated by its localization to the central spindle and the midbody through binding to microtubules in the late M phase. Originally, we cloned the cDNA for MgcRacGAP through functional expression cloning which inhibited IL-6 induced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells, when expressed in the antisense configuration (18Kawashima T. Hirose K. Satoh T. Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of MgcRacGAP retarded cell growth and induced a significant number of multinucleated cells in all cell lines tested including HL-60, M1, Ba/F3, Jurkat, and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). These data implicated that MgcRacGAP has some roles in cytokinesis. In addition expression levels of the mRNA for MgcRacGAP increased by 3–4-fold in the G2/M phase (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with a previous study by Wooltorton et al. (29Wooltorton E.J. Haliotis T. Mueller C.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). They showed that expression of MgcRacGAP in 3T3-L1 cells and C2C12 cells were growth-regulated. We thus assumed from these findings that MgcRacGAP controls cell proliferation through regulating the progression of the G2/M phase. However, how MgcRacGAP retarded cell proliferation remains to be determined. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that in interphase, MgcRacGAP localized in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm along with microtubules, then redistributed to the central spindle in anaphase and to the midbody in late telophase (Fig. 3 b). This distribution implied the possibility that MgcRacGAP interact with microtubules. In fact, we found by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that MgcRacGAP was associated with α- and β-tubulin. Immunostaining showed that the N-terminal myosin-like domain of MgcRacGAP was required for its localization to the midbody of dividing cells (Fig. 5). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the myosin-like domain is responsible for its association with tubulin (Fig. 7). The myosin-like domain of MgcRacGAP contains a coiled-coil structure (30Arar C. Ott M.O. Tour A. Gacon G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and tubulin also does. Therefore, it is predicted that interaction of these two coiled-coil domains mediates binding of MgcRacGAP to tubulins. Moreover, the overexpression of ΔMyo-MgcRacGAP led to failure of cytokinesis, which was demonstrated by a markedly increased number of multinucleated cells. However, transfection of the wild type MgcRacGAP also causes abortive cytokinesis albeit at a low level. We assume from these data that expression of this protein at physiological levels and/or changes of the expression level through these cell cycles are important for normal progression of cytokinesis. It was previously reported that tubulin mediates nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor and the vitamin D receptor (31Amizuka N. Ozawa H. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1992; 55: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Pratt W.B. Sanchez E.R. Bresnick E.H. Meshinchi S. Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Welsh M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2222s-2229sPubMed Google Scholar). It was also proposed that c-Myc translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm along with tubulin (33Alexandrova N. Niklinski J. Bliskovsky V. Otterson G.A. Blake M. Kaye F.J. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5188-5195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that tubulin binding allows MgcRacGAP to use the microtubule network for its translocation in the mitotic phase. Taken together MgcRacGAP apparently plays important roles in cytokinesis through interaction with and movement on microtubules. Tubulin and microtubules have been shown to interact with regulatory components of the cell cycle apparatus as well as cellular oncogene products. For example, tubulin was shown to associate with neurofibromin to inhibit the Ras GAP activity (34Bollag G. McCormick F. Clark R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In an analogy, the association of tubulin with MgcRacGAP may regulate the GAP activity for Rac and Cdc42 in the mitotic structure and then control the cytokinesis. The association of MgcRacGAP with α- and β-tubulins prompted us to examine whether MgcRacGAP also binds to γ-tubulin, and we found that MgcRacGAP associated with γ-tubulin as well. γ-Tubulin has been identified in the centrosomes (35Schiebel E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the midbody (36Shu H.B. Li Z. Palacios M.J. Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) during the mitotic phase. Observation with a confocal laser scanning microscope and in situ extraction immunostaining revealed that MgcRacGAP also localized to centrosomes in the mitotic phase. 2K. Hirose, T. Kawashima, I. Iwamoto, T. Nosaka, and T. Kitamura, unpublished results. Disruption of γ-tubulin during anaphase by injection of either antibodies or antisense RNA led to failure of midbody formation and consequently a failure of cytokinesis (36Shu H.B. Li Z. Palacios M.J. Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Julian M. Tollon Y. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Moisand A. Mazarguil H. Puget A. Wright M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 145-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the nucleation of new microtubules may be important for the formation or maintenance of the midbody. Whether or not MgcRacGAP has a role in the microtubule nucleation or midbody formation and/or maintenance remains to be determined. During the preparation of this manuscript, Jantsch-Plunger et al. (38Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) published an article which contains a genetic, biochemical, and cell biological analysis of the CYK-4 protein fromCaenorhabditis elegans. Many features of MgcRacGAP that we present here using the mammalian system are similar to those reported by these authors in the nematode system. CYK-4 localizes to the central spindle and persists at cell division remnants. They have also shown that central spindle assembly was defective in the cyk-4(t1689ts) allele that carries a mutation at the N terminus. This is probably because the N-terminal myosin-like domain is required for its correct localization and association with microtubules and is indispensable for the cytokinesis in an analogy with MgcRacGAP shown in the present paper. Jantsch-Plunger et al. speculated that RhoA is the target of CYK-4 GAP activity for cytokinesis. In fact, RhoA was reported to be essential for cytokinesis and to be localized to the midbody (10Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 39Nishimura Y. Nakano K. Mabuchi I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Kimura K.

Biol. 1997; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CYK-4 activates GTP hydrolysis not only by Rac1 and Cdc42 but also by RhoA, albeit to a weaker extent with a much slower time course. Toure et al. (17Toure A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jegou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) also showed that MgcRacGAP had 30 times less GAP activity on Rho compared with Rac and Cdc42. However, in contrast to these reports, we did not detect any GAP activity of MgcRacGAP on RhoA (18Kawashima T. Hirose K. Satoh T. Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although our data showed that the GAP activity of MgcRacGAP is required for cytokinesis (Fig.5 b), it is not clear at present which small G protein is a target of MgcRacGAP in the central spindle and the midbody. While in lower eukaryotes, a human homologue of Rac has been shown to be involved in cytokinesis (6Larochelle D.A. Vithalani K.K. De Lozanne A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 9-1321Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 42Guillen N. Boquet P. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1729-1739PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no report that implicated Rac in cytokinesis in mammals. Concerning Cdc42, expression of a constitutively active Cdc42 in a Xenopus egg and a human cell line induced formation of multinucleated cells (5Dutartre H. Davoust J. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 77-367Google Scholar, 41Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Hall A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These data indicated that Cdc42 is involved in cytokinesis. However, there is no data showing that Cdc42 localizes to the mitotic spindle or the midbody in mammals. Although further studies will be required to define the target of MgcRacGAP in the mitotic spindle, one possible explanation is that there is an unknown GTPase, which is involved in cytokinesis and localized to the central spindle and the midbody. It is also possible that MgcRacGAP changes its specificity toward Rho with some modification when it localizes to the central spindle and the midbody. In fact, we have some preliminary data suggesting that MgcRacGAP is phosphorylated in the midbody. Recently various midbody-localized protein kinases have been isolated in vertebrate cells, including AIM-1 (43Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), AUR 1 (44Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Some of these kinases may function as regulators of MgcRacGAP localization and/or GAP activities, and these possibilities are now under investigation. In summary, we have shown that MgcRacGAP associates with microtubules and plays important roles in cytokinesis. Recently there have been several notable developments in the field of cytokinesis. However, a molecular understanding of cytokinesis still remains elusive. We believe that further work on MgcRacGAP will provide some new insights into cytokinesis. But, how overexpression of MgcRacGAP induced macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells, and how antisense MgcRacGAP inhibited IL-6-induced differentiation of M1 cells is still open to question.

https://openalex.org/W2034917867,"Lipoxygenases are key enzymes in the synthesis of oxylipins and play an important role in the response of plants to wounding and pathogen attack. In cultured potato cells treated with elicitor from Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight disease, transcripts encoding a linoleate 9-lipoxygenase and a linoleate 13-lipoxygenase accumulate. However, lipoxygenase activity assays and oxylipin profiling revealed only increased 9-lipoxygenase activity and formation of products derived therefrom, such as 9-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid and colneleic acid. Furthermore, the 9-lipoxygenase products 9(S),10(S),11(R)-trihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic and 9(S),10(S),11(R)-trihydroxy-12(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid were identified as novel, elicitor-inducible oxylipins in potato, suggesting a role of these compounds in the defense response against pathogen attack. Neither 13-lipoxygenase activity nor 13-lipoxygenase products were detected in higher amounts in potato cells after elicitation. Thus, formation of products by the 9-lipoxygenase pathway, including the enzymes hydroperoxide reductase, divinyl ether synthase, and epoxy alcohol synthase, is preferentially stimulated in cultured potato cells in response to treatment with P. infestans elicitor. Moreover, elicitor-induced accumulation of desaturase transcripts and increased phospholipase A(2) activity after elicitor treatment suggest that substrates for the lipoxygenase pathway might be provided by de novo synthesis and subsequent release from lipids of the endomembrane system."
https://openalex.org/W1965476824,"The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in algae and plants takes place within plastids. In these organelles, carotenoids occur either in a free form or bound to proteins. Under stress, the unicellular green alga Haematococcus pluvialisaccumulates secondary carotenoids, mainly astaxanthin esters, in cytoplasmic lipid vesicles up to 4% of its dry mass. It is therefore one of the favored organisms for the biotechnological production of these antioxidative compounds. We have studied the cellular localization and regulation of the enzyme β-carotene oxygenase in H. pluvialis that catalyzes the introduction of keto functions at position C-4 of the β-ionone ring of β-carotene and zeaxanthin. Using immunogold labeling of ultrathin sections and Western blot analysis of cell fractions, we discovered that under inductive conditions, β-carotene oxygenase was localized both in the chloroplast and in the cytoplasmic lipid vesicles, which are (according to their lipid composition) derived from cytoplasmic membranes. However, β-carotene oxygenase activity was confined to the lipid vesicle compartment. Because an early carotenogenic enzyme in the pathway, phytoene desaturase, was found only in the chloroplast (Grunewald, K., Eckert, M., Hirschberg, J., and Hagen, C. (2000)Plant Physiol. 122, 1261–1268), a transport of intermediates from the site of early biosynthetic steps in the chloroplast to the site of oxygenation and accumulation in cytoplasmic lipid vesicles is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2123866098,"There is growing evidence suggesting that cholesterol metabolism is linked to susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease by influencing amyloid β-protein (Aβ) metabolism. However, the precise cellular linkage sites between cholesterol and Aβ have not yet been clarified. To address this issue, we investigated Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) model cells and NPC mutant cells, which showed aberrant cholesterol trafficking. We observed a remarkable Aβ accumulation in late endosomes of both NPC model cells and mutant cells where cholesterol accumulates and a significant accumulation in the NPC mouse brain. This Aβ accumulation was independent of its constitutive secretion and production through an endocytic pathway. In addition, it is characterized by a marked predominance of Aβ42 and insolubility in SDS, suggesting the presence of aggregated Aβ in late endosomes. Most importantly, Aβ accumulation is coupled with the cholesterol levels in late endosomes. Thus, late endosomes of NPC cells are a novel pool of aggregated Aβ42 as well as cholesterol, suggesting a direct interaction between aggregated Aβ and cholesterol.

Nature. 1999; 399 (suppl.): 23A-31ACrossref Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Aβ, a small protein ofM r ∼4,000, is cleaved out sequentially with β- and γ-secretases from a large membrane protein called β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), and secreted into the extracellular space. There are two major species of Aβ that are defined by their C-terminal lengths; Aβ40 terminates at Val-40, and Aβ42 terminates at Ala-42. The latter has a much stronger tendency to aggregate into fibrils and accounts for less than 10% of secreted Aβ. However, Aβ42 is the most predominant form found in senile plaques and is considered the initial species to be deposited in aged and AD brains (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar, 3Iwatsubo T. Mann D.M. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Three causative genes, APP, presenilin 1 (PS1), and PS2 have been identified in early onset familial AD (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 (suppl.): 23A-31ACrossref Scopus (1534) Google Scholar), and their mutations appear to converge on an increased production of Aβ42. However, the pathological mechanisms of sporadic AD, explaining more than 90% of AD patients, remain unknown. Interestingly, there is growing evidence for a significant linkage between Aβ and cholesterol metabolism. First, cholesterol loading or depletion affects Aβ generation both in vitro (4Xu H. Gouras G.K. Greenfield J.P. Vincent B. Naslund J. Mazzarelli L. Fried G. Jovanovic J.N. Seeger M. Relkin N.R. Liao F. Checler F. Buxbaum J.D. Chait B.T. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Wang R.

Second, the levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, but not those of HDL-cholesterol, in the serum correlate with the amount of Aβ42 in AD brains (7Kuo Y.-M. Emmerling M.R. Bisgaier C.L. Essenburg A.D. Lampert H.C. Drumm D. Roher A.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Third, aggregated Aβ preferentially binds to cholesterol in vitro (8Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.S. Vassiliev A.V. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fourth, a substantial fraction of intracellular Aβ is localized in the detergent-insoluble membrane domain that is rich in glycosphingolipid and cholesterol (9Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Fifth, the presence of an E4 isoform of apolipoprotein E, an essential molecule for cholesterol metabolism, is a strong risk factor for developing AD (11Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3731) Google Scholar). Sixth, high dietary cholesterol accelerates AD-related pathologies, including Aβ deposition, in a transgenic mouse model (12Refolo L.M. Pappolla M.A. Malester B. LaFrancois J. Bryant-Thomas T. Wang R. Tint G.S. Sambamurti K. Duff K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). However, no detailed mechanisms for clarifying Aβ-cholesterol interacting sites are known. We hypothesized that both cholesterol and Aβ metabolisms are linked intracellularly, and to examine this possibility, we focused on Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. NPC is an autosomal recessive neurovisceral storage disease (13Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet W.S. Sly J. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2625-2639Google Scholar), characterized by the presence of numerous foam cells in the bone marrow and visceral organs. Its hallmark is an intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids, especially sphingolipids, in vacuoles resembling late endosomes (14Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A major gene (NPC1) responsible for NPC has recently been identified by positional cloning (15Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B. Chang T.Y. Liscum L.

Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence predicts a 1,278-residue polytopic integral membrane protein (NPC1) containing a putative cholesterol-sensing domain. The main features of the NPC phenotype can be mimicked by cultured cells exposed to a variety of reagents called class 2 amphiphiles, such as U18666A (17Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now believed that these reagents act directly on the NPC1 protein (18Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Based on these facts, we hypothesized that intracellular Aβ metabolism might be changed in these cholesterol-perturbed cells. In this study, we investigated the intracellular Aβ in two cell lines. These were NPC model cells treated with a class 2 amphiphile, and a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant line that is deficient in NPC1 protein due to premature termination of its translation (19Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We found that intracellular cholesterol levels strongly affect Aβ42 accumulation and aggregation in late endosomes and that this Aβ42 accumulation was also observed in NPC mouse brains. CHO cells, stably transfected with wild-type (7WD10) and C-terminally truncated (ΔC) APP751 cDNAs (20Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with APP695 cDNA (K295) (21Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

For cholesterol depletion studies, monolayers of 7WD10 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in cholesterol starvation medium (F-12 medium; Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% delipidated fetal calf serum, 35 μm oleic acid (Sigma), 50 μmmevinolin, and 230 μm mevalonate (Sigma). Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, blocks the synthesis of steroidal and nonsteroidal isoprenoids (22Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Delipidated fetal calf serum was prepared according to a procedure modified by Cadigan et al. (22Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Water-soluble cholesterol and methyl-β-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma. For transient transfection, APP695 cDNA was cloned into the vector pCXN (23Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) and transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). To avoid contamination of the cell lysate with the cell surface-adsorbed Aβ, cells were harvested by incubation with trypsin at 37 °C. A 1% Triton X-100 (Triton)-insoluble fraction of whole cell homogenates was prepared as described previously (10Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient centrifugation was performed according to Lange et al. (24Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Late endosomes were isolated according to van der Goot (25van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2689-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using sucrose gradients containing 3 mm imidazole (pH 7.4). Three interfaces, at 8.5/25% (interface 1), 25/35% (interface 2), and 35/40.6% (interface 3) were carefully aspirated (800 μl each) and pelleted. Each fraction obtained by subcellular fractionation was centrifuged at 540,000 × g for 20 min in a TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resulting pellets were extracted with 70% formic acid at room temperature for 30 min, and the extract was dried by Speed Vac (Savant Instruments). The proteins solubilized with the sample buffer were subjected to Western blotting as described previously (26Enya M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Yoshimura M. Shinkai Y. Kusui K. Khan K. Games D. Schenk D. Sugihara S. Yamaguchi H. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cellular APP was extracted with 1% Triton in Tris saline (TS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and was subjected to Western blotting. In the present study, the samples were adjusted by their volumes and loaded on gels, except for that in Fig. 6 A. The Aβ antibodies used were BAN50 (epitope: Aβ1–10), 6E10 (Aβ1–17: Senetek PLC), BA27 (specific for Aβ40), and BC05 (specific for Aβ42) (27Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (5A3/1G7) recognize the midportion of APP (20Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to Rab7 and Rab5a were purchased from CytoSignal and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The antibodies to caveolin 1 and BiP were from Transduction Laboratories and StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., respectively. The 6C4 anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. J. Gruenberg (University of Geneva) (28Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

ELISAs for Aβ in mouse brains were performed by a procedure described elsewhere (31Sawamura N. Morishima-Kawashima M. Waki H. Kobayashi K. Kuramochi T. Frosch M.P. Ding K. Ito M. Kim T.W.

For flow cytometry, samples from interface 1 were incubated with 50 μg/ml filipin (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C and immediately analyzed using a FACSVantage flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson Immunocytometry systems). The flow rate for analysis and sorting was about 2,000 events/s. The nozzle tip was 50 μm in diameter. Lipids were extracted from the samples with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v), and evaporated under nitrogen flow. The cholesterol content of each sample was determined using a cholesterol determination kit (Kyowa Medix, Tokyo). We first assessed the Aβ levels within NPC model cells. CHO cells, stably expressing APP751 (7WD10), were treated with 3 μg/ml U18666A for 24 h (14Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat.

After harvesting by incubation with trypsin, the cells were homogenized with 1% Triton in TS, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 540,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting Triton-insoluble pellet was then extracted with 70% formic acid, and the Aβ levels in the extract were assessed by Western blotting (Fig.1 A). The U18666A treatment remarkably enhanced Aβ immunoreactivity in the Triton-insoluble fraction, whereas Aβ was barely detected in the same fraction of nontreated cells. Increased signal intensities of Aβ monomers at ∼4 kDa and dimers at ∼5–6 kDa on the blot were apparent (26Enya M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Yoshimura M. Shinkai Y. Kusui K. Khan K. Games D. Schenk D. Sugihara S. Yamaguchi H. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Those signals in the high molecular mass range should represent nonspecific reactivities, because the secondary antibody alone labeled most of these bands. Compared with the BA27 immunoreactivity, there was an enormous increase in the BC05 immunoreactivity, indicating that the major Aβ species that accumulates following U18666A treatment is Aβ42. When Triton-soluble fractions were similarly analyzed, the signal for BC05 immunoreactivity was also increased by the treatment, whereas the intensities of BA27-immunoreactive bands at 4 and ∼3 kDa (presumably representing a truncated species of Aβ) were unchanged (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, the Aβ dimer, that was prominent in the Triton-insoluble fraction, was undetectable in the Triton-soluble fraction. We found that the Triton-soluble fraction consistently contained a greater amount of Aβ than did the Triton-insoluble fraction (data not shown). The U18666A treatment did not alter the expression level of APP (Fig. 1 C); thus, an increase of Aβ was not a result of overproduction of its precursor. To examine whether these phenomena are independent of the cell type, we applied the same experimental conditions to K295 cells and obtained the same results (data not shown). Next, we determined the particular cellular compartment in which Aβ accumulates. Since NPC cells accumulate mainly unesterified cholesterol, we simply speculated that Aβ resides in cholesterol-rich compartments. Thus, we fractionated cell homogenates on Percoll gradients according to an established protocol widely used for separating cholesterol-rich compartments (24Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Aβ42 was recovered only in fraction 1 in which free (unesterified) cholesterol was accumulated after the U18666A treatment (Fig.2, A and B). However, due to the fractionation process, endosomal and lysosomal markers were distributed over the fractions (data not shown), and thus this protocol was judged not to be useful for determining the compartment in which Aβ accumulates. Because free cholesterol accumulates in late endosomes of NPC cells (14Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we isolated late endosomes directly, using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This protocol enabled us to fractionate late endosomes into interface 1 and early endosomes and plasma membrane into interfaces 2 and 3 (Fig. 2 C) (25van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2689-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 C, a U18666A-induced increase of free cholesterol was observed in interface 1. To confirm the validity of this fractionation, each fraction was probed for specific markers including the 6C4 antigen (for late endosomes) (Fig. 2 D), Rab7 (for late endosomes), and Rab 5a (for early endosomes) (Fig. 2 E). The obtained results clearly showed that interface 1 indeed represents the late endosome-rich fraction, in which a remarkable increase in the level of Aβ42 was observed by the U18666A treatment (Fig. 2 E). These findings indicate that the U18666A treatment induces an accumulation of both Aβ42 and free cholesterol in late endosomes. Aβ40 was not always detectable in any of the three interfaces, even in the presence of U18666A; therefore, the intracellular Aβ levels were routinely assessed only with BC05. Recently, we and others have reported that a significant fraction of intracellular Aβ resides in the detergent-insoluble membrane domain (9Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15247-15253Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Caveolae are examples of such domains, but caveolin 1, a caveolae-resident protein, was located at interface 3 (Fig.2 E). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is assumed to be a site for Aβ42 generation (4Xu H. Gouras G.K. Greenfield J.P. Vincent B. Naslund J. Mazzarelli L. Fried G. Jovanovic J.N. Seeger M. Relkin N.R. Liao F. Checler F. Buxbaum J.D. Chait B.T. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. Wang R. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, ER markers, BiP (Fig.2 E) and calnexin (data not shown), were undetectable in interface 1. Thus, caveolae and ER are not the sites in which the Aβ42 accumulates following U18666A treatment. The U18666A treatment itself did not alter the locations of several marker proteins examined (data not shown). All of the observations described above that were made in 7WD10 cells were reproduced in K295 cells (data not shown). To further confirm the colocalization of Aβ42 with free cholesterol, we isolated cholesterol-rich vesicles from 7WD10 cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (33Meresse S. Andre P. Mishal Z. Barad M. Brun N. Desjardins M. Gorvel J.P. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2682-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because free cholesterol can be specifically and sensitively labeled with filipin, a fluorescent probe (34Sokol J. Blanchette-Mackie J. Kruth H.S. Dwyer N.K. Amende L.M. Butler J.D. Robinson E. Patel S. Brady R.O. Comly M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3411-3417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interface 1 prepared from U18666A-treated cells was incubated with filipin, and the suspension was immediately analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter with a UV filter setting. There were two fluorescence peaks in filipin-labeled samples (Fig.3 A). The first peak (R1) was also present in the unlabeled samples; thus, R1 should represent autofluorescence from unlabeled membranes. The second peak (R2) consisted of a population of highly fluorescent vesicles. Sorted materials from the two peaks were separately pelleted, and each pellet was extracted with 70% formic acid and subjected to Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a BC05-positive signal, most intense at the Aβ dimer, was detected only in the R2 fraction, demonstrating that at least a part of the accumulated Aβ42 indeed localizes in cholesterol-residing compartments. We next examined whether the U18666A treatment causes any detectable alterations in constitutive Aβ secretion. 7WD10 cells were cultured with or without 3 μg/ml U18666A for 24 h. After a brief wash, the cells were maintained in culture for another 6 h with or without U18666A, and the levels of Aβ in the conditioned medium were quantified by ELISA. As shown in TableI, no statistical difference in the levels of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 between the treated and untreated cells was found. The ratio of Aβ42 to the total Aβ was also not altered (Table I). These results indicate that Aβ42 in late endosomes is not the source of secreted Aβ42.Table IEffect of U18666A on Aβ secretionU18666AAβ40Aβ42Aβ42/total Aβpmpm%−2,350 ± 150262 ± 2810+2,140 ± 120305 ± 17127WD10 cells were cultured confluent with or without 3 μg/ml U18666A for 24 h.

After washing, cells were continuously cultured in fresh medium with or without U18666A for another 6 h. The amount of Aβ in the conditioned medium was measured by ELISA. Average Aβ42 ratios are shown in the right-most column. Since U18666A treatment has reversible effects on cholesterol transport (35Härmälä A.S. Pörn M.I. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether withdrawal of U18666A had an effect on Aβ accumulation and Aβ secretion. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the accumulated Aβ42 became completely undetectable 24 h after the withdrawal of U18666A. Any trace amount of Aβ was not detected in other interfaces (data not shown), indicating that accumulated Aβ42 disappeared from cellular membranous compartments. We then measured Aβ levels by ELISA in the cultured medium after withdrawal of the reagent. After being exposed to U18666A for 24 h, 7WD10 cells were briefly washed and cultured for another 3 or 6 h in the regular medium. The Aβ content in the conditioned medium was compared with that of sister cultures incubated without U18666A (TableII). We did not observe any detectable change in the Aβ secretion level after the removal of U18666A.Table IIAβ secretion after U18666A treatmentU18666AChase timeAβ40Aβ42Aβ42/total Aβhpmpm%−31,120 ± 320116 ± 199.4+31,180 ± 400101 ± 668−61,820 ± 400270 ± 6213+62,350 ± 440262 ± 2810After a 24-h treatment with U18666A (+), cells were washed and maintained in culture for the indicated chase time in the absence of the reagent.

The amount of Aβ in conditioned media was measured by ELISA. For controls, sister cultures were incubated without U18666A (−) for 24 h. Average Aβ42 ratios are shown in the right-most column. Since the presence of intracellular, highly insoluble Aβ has been reported (37Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), we examined the insolubility characteristics of the Aβ that accumulated in late endosomes. Interface 1, prepared from U18666A-treated cells, was divided into halves and separately pelleted. One pellet was extracted with the 2% SDS sample buffer, while the other was extracted with 70% formic acid. As shown in Fig.4 B, accumulated Aβ was extracted only with formic acid, but not with SDS, although similar amounts of proteins other than Aβ were extracted with SDS and formic acid, as judged by Coomassie staining (data not shown). Thus, the Aβ42 accumulated in late endosomes is most likely aggregated into an SDS-insoluble form. Production and release of Aβ by 7WD10 cells depend primarily on internalization of APP from the cell surface, and its endocytosis signal is located in the cytoplasmic domain (20Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To determine whether this APP internalization is essential for the accumulation of Aβ42 in late endosomes, CHO cells stably expressing APP751 lacking nearly the entire cytoplasmic domain (ΔC), were exposed to U18666A. The ΔC cells exhibited significant reductions in the APP internalization and in the production and secretion of Aβ (20Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, remarkably increased levels of Aβ42 were again observed in interface 1 following the U18666A treatment. These results may indicate that internalization of cell surface APP is not required for U18666A-induced Aβ accumulation in late endosomes. The above results strongly suggest a tight correlation between Aβ42 accumulation and cellular cholesterol levels. To examine this possibility, 7WD10 cells were cultured in cholesterol starvation medium for 2 days. The cells were then further cultured in the cholesterol starvation medium with or without 3 μg/ml U18666A for 24 h. Although cholesterol starvation for 3 days resulted in an average 80% decrease in the total cellular cholesterol levels, the U18666A treatment somewhat increased the cholesterol level in interface 1 compared with that of untreated cells (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5, under the cholesterol-depleted conditions, U18666A again induced Aβ42 accumulation in interface 1. When the cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml exogenous water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol and methyl-β-cyclodextrin complex) for 24 h in the presence of U18666A, apparently greater amounts of Aβ42 monomers and dimers were observed at interface 1. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin alone (180 μg/ml) together with U18666A did not increase the accumulation as much. These data indicate that the Aβ42 accumulation in late endosomes is under the influence of cellular cholesterol levels. Although it is most likely that U18666A acts directly on the NPC1 protein, we examined whether a mutant cell that lacks the NPC1 gene can also accumulate Aβ. Mutant CT43 is a cholesterol-trafficking CHO cell mutant that carries a mutation in the NPC1 gene, resulting in production of a nonfunctional NPC1 protein (19Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The parental cell 25RA has a gain-of-function mutation in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein and cleavage-activating protein. The line 25RA shows normal intracellular cholesterol trafficking and thus was used as a control. Both cell lines were transiently transfected with APP695 cDNA, and the levels of expressed APP were assessed by Western blotting followed by densitometric quantification. The Triton-insoluble fractions of the cell lysate, after normalization to the expression levels of APP, were assessed by Western blotting. We found that CT43 contained higher levels of Aβ42 within the cell lysate than did 25RA (Fig. 6 A). Thus, we concluded that both the cell lines deficient in NPC1 gene and the NPC model cells accumulated Aβ, and especially Aβ42, in a similar manner within the cells. Finally, we examined whether Aβ42 accumulates in vivo (i.e. in NPC mouse brains). We used a well characterized mutant mouse on a BALB/c strain, named BALB/c npcnih, in which the NPC1 gene is disrupted (16Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J,. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This mouse exhibits progressive neurodegeneration and dies around 10 weeks of age. Brains from three wild-type BALB/c and three homozygote BALB/c npcnih mice, at the age of 6 weeks, were homogenized in TS. After centrifugation, TS-insoluble Aβ was extracted with 6 m guanidine HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and subjected to ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels are significantly increased in NPC1-deficient mice compared with those in wild-type mice. Several lines of evidence suggest a linkage between cholesterol metabolism and susceptibility to AD. Further, many reports indicate the correlation of cholesterol metabolism with Aβ secretion levels. Here, we have demonstrated the intracellular accumulation of Aβ, especially Aβ42, along with free cholesterol in late endosomes in cholesterol-perturbed NPC cells. This cholesterol accumulation does not affect Aβ secretion levels, but the extent of Aβ accumulation in late endosomes is strongly influenced by their cholesterol levels. Importantly, this accumulated Aβ42 in late endosomes appeared to be in an SDS-insoluble aggregate form. Thus, late endosomes of NPC cells are a novel pool of intracellular aggregated Aβ. The mechanism of interaction between aggregated Aβ and cholesterol remains to be clarified. One possible explanation is that the observed Aβ42 accumulation in late endosomes results from altered membrane trafficking induced by an abnormal lipid content in NPC cells. Cellular cholesterol levels (39Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and lysobisphosphatidic acid, a late endosomal lipid, (28Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), are known to modulate endosomal membrane trafficking. In NPC cells, intracellular trafficking of lipids other than sterol is also disrupted. Thus, abnormal lipid accumulation, not only for cholesterol, may possibly affect intracellular membrane and Aβ/APP trafficking and may induce Aβ42 aggregation in late endosomes. However, we prefer a more straightforward explanation; free cholesterol (together with other molecules) directly or indirectly (via other molecules) interacts with Aβ (especially an aggregated form of Aβ42), and wherever free cholesterol accumulates within the cell, aggregated Aβ42 also accumulates. Earlier studies have shown that the rate of degradation of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein was not impaired in normal CHO cells treated with U18666A (36Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in mutant CHO cells defective in the NPC1 gene (19Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results rule out the remote possibility that the massive accumulation of Aβ in NPC cells might be due to the capacity of the endosomes for protein degradation being compromised by the massive accumulation of cholesterol and/or other lipid in this compartment. It is notable that, even under cholesterol-depleted conditions, U18666A induced mobilization of remaining free cholesterol to late endosomes, which apparently accompany Aβ42. One may argue that this assumption is contradictory to an in vivo observation; significant Aβ42 accumulation occurs in NPC mouse brains where free cholesterol is reported not to be accumulated (40Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, it is quite possible that, even if free cholesterol levels are not increased in the brain, those in late endosomes may be significantly increased and coupled with Aβ42 accumulation. The effects of U18666A on cholesterol trafficking can be completely reversed when the reagent is withdrawn (35Härmälä A.S. Pörn M.I. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free cholesterol that accumulates in late endosomes is sorted either to the plasma membrane/ER (19Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or secreted into the culture medium (41Furuichi T. Aikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27345-27348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We took advantage of this property of U18666A to examine the relocation of the Aβ accumulated in late endosomes. Within 24 h after withdrawal of U18666A, the accumulated Aβ42 disappeared completely from any of the membranous compartments. One may speculate that the accumulated Aβ is sorted to lysosomes for rapid degradation. Alternatively, the Aβ42 may migrate to the plasma membrane/ER or be secreted into the culture medium, through interaction with cholesterol and/or other lipids. Because Aβ was observed neither in interface 2 nor in interface 3, where the plasma membrane and ER are localized (data not shown), it is possible that the accumulated Aβ is released into the culture medium. However, no increased secretion of Aβ after withdrawal of U18666A was detected by ELISA. There could be two explanations for this observation, which are not mutually exclusive. First, a change in the Aβ levels in the medium is so small that ELISA fails to detect it. Second, our ELISA system may exclusively detect Aβ monomer, but not Aβ dimers or oligomers (26Enya M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Yoshimura M. Shinkai Y. Kusui K. Khan K. Games D. Schenk D. Sugihara S. Yamaguchi H. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, if the Aβ42 that accumulates in late endosomes is secreted in an aggregated form, the ELISA cannot detect it. As seen in Figs. 1 A and 5, Aβ monomer and dimer appeared even in the absence of U18666A treatment. Thus, indiscernible amounts of Aβ must accumulate and aggregate even in non-NPC cells. Because cholesterol trafficking is normal in these cells, the aggregated form of Aβ might be shed in a constitutive manner into the extracellular space, along with cholesterol. These released Aβ aggregates may act as a seed for Aβ fibrillation, thereby leading to Aβ deposition in the brain (42Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). In fact, a recent report by Walsh et al.(43Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) supports this view, showing that intracellular Aβ aggregation is essential for the extracellular Aβ oligomerization. Conversely, in the NPC brain, intracellularly accumulated Aβ42 cannot be efficiently secreted and accumulated within cells as seen in Fig. 6, B and C. This may possibly explain why no Aβ deposition is observed in the NPC brain. Most interestingly, abundant neurofibrillary tangles, the other hallmark of AD, are observed in the brains of NPC patients with a slowly progressive clinical course (44Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Those neurofibrillary tangles in the NPC brain are morphologically and biochemically indistinguishable from those in the AD brain (44Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to aberrant cholesterol trafficking, long term intracellular Aβ accumulation might accelerate neuronal degeneration, which eventually leads to neurofibrillary tangle formation in the NPC brain.

In this study, we describe the purification and partial amino acid sequencing of endosialin, leading to the cloning of a full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 2274 base pairs. The endosialin cDNA encodes a type I membrane protein of 757 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 80.9 kDa.

Bioinformatic evaluation classifies endosialin as a C-type lectin-like protein, composed of a signal leader peptide, five globular extracellular domains (including a C-type lectin domain, one domain with similarity to the Sushi/ccp/scr pattern, and three EGF repeats), followed by a mucin-like region, a transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Carbohydrate analysis shows that the endosialin core protein carries abundantly sialylated, O-linked oligosaccharides and is sensitive toO-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase, placing it in the group of sialomucin-like molecules.

Thus, in a detailed study of biopsy and surgical specimens representing diverse cancer types, FB5 immunostaining was found primarily in tumor blood vessels and not in malignant tumor cells. Significantly, the antigen was not observed in all cancer samples examined, and even in cancers showing FB5-immunoreactive endothelial cells, the antigen was frequently detected with a heterogeneous pattern in the tumor vascular bed. Such a mixed pattern might be expected for a molecule involved in the reorganization of blood vessels in tissues such as cancers, in which areas of stable blood supply and histology are juxtaposed to regions of necrosis, hypoxia, excessive growth, tissue invasion, and remodeling. The normal tissues examined were unreactive with mAb FB5, including the blood vessel endothelium present in the respective organs.The expression of the FB5 antigen by cultured normal and tumor cells was also investigated (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), revealing that the standard test cells for normal endothelial differentiation markers, cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and microvascular endothelial cells derived from bone marrow and dermis are antigen-negative. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures stimulated with a range of mediators known to induce the expression of endothelial activation antigens (2Lasky L.A. Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 3Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) maintain their FB5-negative phenotype (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Among a host of cultured epithelial, neuroectodermal, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic cell types tested, most were FB5 antigen-negative. Notable exceptions are short term cultures of normal fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cell lines, which consistently express the antigen in tissue culture (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), allowing the chromosomal assignment of an FB5 coding gene to human chromosome 11q13-qter, based on the serologic analysis of mouse-human neuroblastoma cell hybrids. The reason why cultured fibroblasts and neuroblastomas are FB5 positive in vitro, yet the corresponding cells in uncultured tissue sections are FB5 negative, is not known. Presumably, some of these findings reflect cell type-restricted, adaptive changes of the cell surface phenotype triggered by tissue culture factors (38Rettig W.J. Old L.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); the mechanism underlying such induction and its relationship to FB5 antigen induction in tumor blood vessels are not known.Methods are not generally available to examine the biochemical nature of antigens with restricted expression in tumor endothelium, because of to three properties of these cells: (i) they constitute a very minor fraction in most tumor tissues; (ii) they are not readily purified in sufficient numbers for direct protein analysis; and (iii) no cell culture model of tumor endothelium exists that faithfully reproduces its distinctive in vivo phenotype. With no source for antigen characterization in tumor endothelium, the target molecule for mAb FB5 was studied in cultured neuroblastoma and sarcoma cells and fibroblast cultures. In these cell types, the antigen is a unique 165-kDa glycoprotein, comprised of a core protein that migrates as a 95-kDa species on SDS gels and carries the mAb FB5-defined epitope, and abundant, highly sialylated O-linked carbohydrate moieties. There has been no proof that the same protein carries the FB5 epitope in tumor endothelium, but in recognition of the characteristic biochemical properties and the tumor endothelial expression pattern the molecule was designated endosialin.In the absence of more detailed information about the molecular structure of endosialin, no clues were available regarding its potential function in cancer. Therefore, considering the keen interest in angiogenesis as a determinant of cancer progression and metastasis (4Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6018) Google Scholar) and as a target for novel cancer therapies (5Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21919) Google Scholar), this study aimed to clone the endosialin gene and provide the requisite probes and structural information to explore endosialin function in suitable model systems and in human cancers.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the gene coding for the human endosialin core protein based on several lines of evidence. First, transfection of endosialin cDNA into HeLa-S3 cells leads to induction of cell surface reactivity with the cognate mAb FB5. Secondly, mAb FB5 detects the expected 165-kDa sialoglycoprotein in the transfectants, with a core protein migrating as a 95-kDa species on SDS gels. Third, the endosialin gene maps to chromosome 11q13, refining the previous assignment to 11q13-qter based on serologic analysis of somatic cell hybrids with mAb FB5. Finally, the amino acid sequence provides the requisite attachment sites for abundant O-glycosylation of endosialin.The present study is not the only evidence linking endosialin induction to vascular endothelial cells in human cancer. Rather, an independent line of investigation, aimed at dissecting comprehensive gene expression profiles in cancers with the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method, has implicated endosialin-specific ESTs in tumor angiogenesis. St. Croix et al. (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) employed SAGE to survey about 32,500 unique gene transcripts for differential expression in purified tumor endothelium versus endothelium of nonmalignant tissue. The study identified 46 transcripts elevated at least 10-fold in tumor endothelium, and the highest and most consistent up-regulation was noted for a hitherto uncharacterized gene, deposited as ESTs of unknown function in data bases and designated tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1) by St. Croix et al. (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). We show here that TEM1 is the endosialin gene.In their study, St. Croix et al. (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) confirmed the SAGE data and showed by in situ RNA hybridization that TEM1/endosialin expression in vivo is selective for tumor endothelium, with no detection in the malignant epithelial cells of colorectal and other cancer, a range of normal organs, and a panel of cultured tumor cell lines. Nevertheless, TEM1/endosialin mRNA was not unique to tumor blood vessels because endothelial cells associated with wound healing and corpus luteum formation also showed gene expression by in situ RNA hybridization.Taking together the endosialin expression data generated with mAb FB5 (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the RNA expression data derived from SAGE and in situ RNA hybridization studies (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), a consistent picture of endosialin induction in tumor endothelium emerges. Such a close agreement between epitope and protein/mRNA expression is instructive for a molecule like endosialin, which falls into the group of sialomucin-type glycoproteins. There is precedent for sialomucins and other glycoconjugates for which mAb-defined epitope expression and protein/mRNA distribution sharply diverge. Several levels of complexity have been described (26Hakomori S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillett C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Morgan S.M. Samulowitz U. Darley L. Simmons D.L. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 93: 165-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Gaudernack G. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), including (i) epitopes on core proteins that are masked by glycosylation or specific sialylation, (ii) epitopes on carbohydrate moieties shared by several unrelated glycoproteins or glycolipids, and (iii) epitopes on distinct splice variants or processing variants of the same core protein. In the case of endosialin, the observed cotyping for the FB5 epitope and TEM1/endosialin mRNA suggests that mAb FB5 binds to an invariant epitope on the 95-kDa core protein. Nevertheless, this conclusion needs to be confirmed for each cell type under investigation, because epitope masking and mimicry can show exquisite cell type selectivity.A persistent question in the exploration of tumor angiogenesis is the extent of phenotypic and functional heterogeneity that may distinguish subsets of tumor endothelial cells in a macroscopic tumor lesion with regard to their derivation from pre-existing blood vessels or new vessel sprouting, and their function and state of activation in response to varying milieus of tumor-derived, paracrine angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors. Generally, the capillary bed of a locally advanced or metastatic tumor mass will extend into areas of relatively stable blood supply and tissue architecture and closely juxtaposed or intermingled regions of hypoxia, necrosis, excessive proliferation, tissue invasion, fibroblastic remodeling, or inflammatory cell infiltration. Placed in this context of malignant tissue disruption, markers of tumor angiogenesis might be expected to display a heterogeneous pattern of expression as a rule rather than exception. Considering the marked heterogeneity in FB5 staining in tumor vessels (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it may be surprising that the report on TEM1/endosialin mRNAin situ hybridization (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) does not address this aspect. One explanation would suggest that endosialin mRNA is uniformly expressed in tumor endothelium and that only subsets of endothelial cells accumulate the endosialin protein or protein with the FB5 epitope; however, as outlined above, there is currently no evidence supporting such a mechanism. Alternatively, it may be argued that mRNA in situ hybridization is the more sensitive detection method for endosialin and that FB5 immunostaining marks tumor endothelium with the highest levels of protein/epitope density rather than a distinct tumor endothelial cell type. Finally, there may simply be differences in the design of the two available studies on endosialin expression.Our analysis shows that the N-terminal extracellular portion of endosialin is likely to consist of five domains with globular structure, and in this region homology to thrombomodulin and the complement receptor C1qRp, with 39 and 33% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, is observed. Importantly, a pattern of cysteine residues is highly conserved among the three proteins and provides a scaffold of anchoring points for disulfide bridges, presumably imposing similar three-dimensional structures on each protein. Thrombomodulin exhibits a C-type lectin domain, six EGF-like repeats, and a serine/threonine-rich region in the extracellular domain. Unlike endosialin, thrombomodulin is expressed on a variety of normal cell types and on normal vascular endothelium serves as a receptor for thrombin, modulating the coagulation cascade and triggering the thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (30Kokame K. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The thrombin interaction depends on the EGF repeats 5 and 6 of thrombomodulin (31Wood M.J. Sampoli Benitez B.A. Komives E.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,32Wang W. Nagashima M. Schneider M. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22942-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which are not present in endosialin, making it unlikely that the two molecules overlap in this particular function. The complement receptor C1qRp is also expressed on a wider variety of cell types than endosialin, including macrophages, neutrophilic granulocytes, and normal vascular endothelium. The extracellular portion of C1qRp is composed of a C-type lectin domain, a tandem of five EGF-like repeats, and a mucin-like region. The molecule binds the complement factor C1q, mannose-binding lectin, and pulmonary surfactant protein A (22Nepomuceno R.R. Henschen-Edman A.H. Burgess W.H. Tenner A.J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). On myeloid cells, C1qRp mediates phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles, but the function of C1qRp on normal endothelial cells is largely unknown (33Hess K.L. Tudor K.S. Johnson J.D. Osati-Ashtiani F. Askew D.S. Cook-Mills J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Predictions about the membrane-proximal extracellular domain focus on fewer structural features. Thus, the high content of proline, threonine, and serine residues indicates likely attachment points for more than 30 O-linked carbohydrate side chains consistent with the sialomucin-like features of endosialin (28Morgan S.M. Samulowitz U. Darley L. Simmons D.L. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 93: 165-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sassetti C. Van Zante A. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9001-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Certain sialomucins have been implicated in sequestering growth factors to the plasma membrane and presenting these factors to endothelial cell surface receptors (34Sassetti C. Van Zante A. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9001-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Goretzki L. Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16831-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); endosialin may be a candidate for such a function unique to tumor endothelium.Apart from further biochemical investigations that will benefit from the availability of mAb FB5 and recombinant endosialin protein, study of defined alterations in endosialin gene expression and structure are now possible, including genetic manipulations in mice and rats, which harbor a close homologue of endosialin. In conclusion, key experiments are now within reach to explore the endosialin system in human physiology and disease and to extend these investigations into experimentally more amenable rodent models. A better understanding of endosialin may even enable new approaches to cancer detection and treatment. The endosialin antigen was identified in a survey of normal and neoplastic human tissues conducted at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in pursuit of new targets for antibody-based cancer therapies (37Old L.J. Sci. Am. 1996; 275: 102-109Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hallmark of monoclonal antibody (mAb)1 FB5, the probe used to discover endosialin (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), is its distinctive pattern of reactivity with human tissues. Thus, in a detailed study of biopsy and surgical specimens representing diverse cancer types, FB5 immunostaining was found primarily in tumor blood vessels and not in malignant tumor cells. Significantly, the antigen was not observed in all cancer samples examined, and even in cancers showing FB5-immunoreactive endothelial cells, the antigen was frequently detected with a heterogeneous pattern in the tumor vascular bed. Such a mixed pattern might be expected for a molecule involved in the reorganization of blood vessels in tissues such as cancers, in which areas of stable blood supply and histology are juxtaposed to regions of necrosis, hypoxia, excessive growth, tissue invasion, and remodeling.

Thus, the high content of proline, threonine, and serine residues indicates likely attachment points for more than 30 O-linked carbohydrate side chains consistent with the sialomucin-like features of endosialin (28Morgan S.M.

In conclusion, key experiments are now within reach to explore the endosialin system in human physiology and disease and to extend these investigations into experimentally more amenable rodent models. A better understanding of endosialin may even enable new approaches to cancer detection and treatment. We have cloned the gene coding for the human endosialin core protein based on several lines of evidence. First, transfection of endosialin cDNA into HeLa-S3 cells leads to induction of cell surface reactivity with the cognate mAb FB5. Secondly, mAb FB5 detects the expected 165-kDa sialoglycoprotein in the transfectants, with a core protein migrating as a 95-kDa species on SDS gels. Third, the endosialin gene maps to chromosome 11q13, refining the previous assignment to 11q13-qter based on serologic analysis of somatic cell hybrids with mAb FB5. Finally, the amino acid sequence provides the requisite attachment sites for abundant O-glycosylation of endosialin. The present study is not the only evidence linking endosialin induction to vascular endothelial cells in human cancer. Rather, an independent line of investigation, aimed at dissecting comprehensive gene expression profiles in cancers with the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method, has implicated endosialin-specific ESTs in tumor angiogenesis. St. Croix et al. (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) employed SAGE to survey about 32,500 unique gene transcripts for differential expression in purified tumor endothelium versus endothelium of nonmalignant tissue. The study identified 46 transcripts elevated at least 10-fold in tumor endothelium, and the highest and most consistent up-regulation was noted for a hitherto uncharacterized gene, deposited as ESTs of unknown function in data bases and designated tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1) by St. Croix et al. (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). We show here that TEM1 is the endosialin gene. In their study, St. Croix et al. (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) confirmed the SAGE data and showed by in situ RNA hybridization that TEM1/endosialin expression in vivo is selective for tumor endothelium, with no detection in the malignant epithelial cells of colorectal and other cancer, a range of normal organs, and a panel of cultured tumor cell lines. Nevertheless, TEM1/endosialin mRNA was not unique to tumor blood vessels because endothelial cells associated with wound healing and corpus luteum formation also showed gene expression by in situ RNA hybridization. Taking together the endosialin expression data generated with mAb FB5 (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the RNA expression data derived from SAGE and in situ RNA hybridization studies (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), a consistent picture of endosialin induction in tumor endothelium emerges. Such a close agreement between epitope and protein/mRNA expression is instructive for a molecule like endosialin, which falls into the group of sialomucin-type glycoproteins. There is precedent for sialomucins and other glycoconjugates for which mAb-defined epitope expression and protein/mRNA distribution sharply diverge. Several levels of complexity have been described (26Hakomori S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillett C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Morgan S.M. Samulowitz U. Darley L. Simmons D.L. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 93: 165-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Gaudernack G. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), including (i) epitopes on core proteins that are masked by glycosylation or specific sialylation, (ii) epitopes on carbohydrate moieties shared by several unrelated glycoproteins or glycolipids, and (iii) epitopes on distinct splice variants or processing variants of the same core protein. In the case of endosialin, the observed cotyping for the FB5 epitope and TEM1/endosialin mRNA suggests that mAb FB5 binds to an invariant epitope on the 95-kDa core protein. Nevertheless, this conclusion needs to be confirmed for each cell type under investigation, because epitope masking and mimicry can show exquisite cell type selectivity. A persistent question in the exploration of tumor angiogenesis is the extent of phenotypic and functional heterogeneity that may distinguish subsets of tumor endothelial cells in a macroscopic tumor lesion with regard to their derivation from pre-existing blood vessels or new vessel sprouting, and their function and state of activation in response to varying milieus of tumor-derived, paracrine angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors. Generally, the capillary bed of a locally advanced or metastatic tumor mass will extend into areas of relatively stable blood supply and tissue architecture and closely juxtaposed or intermingled regions of hypoxia, necrosis, excessive proliferation, tissue invasion, fibroblastic remodeling, or inflammatory cell infiltration. Placed in this context of malignant tissue disruption, markers of tumor angiogenesis might be expected to display a heterogeneous pattern of expression as a rule rather than exception. Considering the marked heterogeneity in FB5 staining in tumor vessels (1Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10832-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it may be surprising that the report on TEM1/endosialin mRNAin situ hybridization (25St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) does not address this aspect. One explanation would suggest that endosialin mRNA is uniformly expressed in tumor endothelium and that only subsets of endothelial cells accumulate the endosialin protein or protein with the FB5 epitope; however, as outlined above, there is currently no evidence supporting such a mechanism. Alternatively, it may be argued that mRNA in situ hybridization is the more sensitive detection method for endosialin and that FB5 immunostaining marks tumor endothelium with the highest levels of protein/epitope density rather than a distinct tumor endothelial cell type. Finally, there may simply be differences in the design of the two available studies on endosialin expression. Our analysis shows that the N-terminal extracellular portion of endosialin is likely to consist of five domains with globular structure, and in this region homology to thrombomodulin and the complement receptor C1qRp, with 39 and 33% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, is observed. Importantly, a pattern of cysteine residues is highly conserved among the three proteins and provides a scaffold of anchoring points for disulfide bridges, presumably imposing similar three-dimensional structures on each protein. Thrombomodulin exhibits a C-type lectin domain, six EGF-like repeats, and a serine/threonine-rich region in the extracellular domain. Unlike endosialin, thrombomodulin is expressed on a variety of normal cell types and on normal vascular endothelium serves as a receptor for thrombin, modulating the coagulation cascade and triggering the thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (30Kokame K. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The thrombin interaction depends on the EGF repeats 5 and 6 of thrombomodulin (31Wood M.J. Sampoli Benitez B.A. Komives E.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,32Wang W. Nagashima M. Schneider M. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22942-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which are not present in endosialin, making it unlikely that the two molecules overlap in this particular function. The complement receptor C1qRp is also expressed on a wider variety of cell types than endosialin, including macrophages, neutrophilic granulocytes, and normal vascular endothelium. The extracellular portion of C1qRp is composed of a C-type lectin domain, a tandem of five EGF-like repeats, and a mucin-like region. The molecule binds the complement factor C1q, mannose-binding lectin, and pulmonary surfactant protein A (22Nepomuceno R.R. Henschen-Edman A.H. Burgess W.H. Tenner A.J.

On myeloid cells, C1qRp mediates phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles, but the function of C1qRp on normal endothelial cells is largely unknown (33Hess K.L. Tudor K.S. Johnson J.D.

By using in situhybridization, we show here that episialin/MUC1 mRNA expression can be increased more than 10-fold in breast carcinoma cells relative to the expression in adjacent normal breast epithelium. In search of the molecular mechanism of this overexpression, we observed that the episialin/MUC1 promoter contains a candidate binding site for transcription factors of the STAT family ∼500 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Cytokines and/or growth factors such as interleukin-6 or interferon-γ can activate STATs. In the human breast carcinoma cell line T47D, both compounds are able to stimulate transcription of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 750-base pair MUC1 promoter fragment proximal to the transcription start site. The observed increase is entirely mediated by the single STAT-binding site, since mutation of this site abolishes stimulation of the reporter by interleukin-6 and interferon-γ.

In normal cells episialin/MUC1 is exclusively present at the apical side of the cell, but in carcinoma cells normal polarization is lost and episialin/MUC1 co-localizes with adhesion molecules such as integrins and cadherins. The long and relatively rigid extracellular domain of episialin/MUC1 can shield these adhesion molecules and diminish cellular adhesion, if present at a sufficiently high density on the cell surface (1Ligtenberg M.J.

Overexpression of episialin/MUC1 in carcinoma cells has been frequently reported (4Hilkens J. Buijs F. Hilgers J. Hageman P. Calafat J. Sonnenberg A. van der Valk M. Int. J.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is expected to have a similar effect on cellular behavior as loss of E-cadherin, the major epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecule, which has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells (for review see Refs. 7Behrens J. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 61-70PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shiozaki H. Oka H. Inoue M. Tamura S. Monden M. Cancer (Phila.). 1996; 8: 133-1605Google Scholar, 9Bracke M.E. Van Roy F.M. Mareel M.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 123-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have proposed that episialin/MUC1 also plays an important role in invasion and metastasis in vivo (10Hilkens J. Vos H.L. Wesseling J. Peterse J. Storm J. Boer M. van der Valk S.W. Maas A.M. Calvo F. Crepin M. Magdelenat H. Breast Cancer: Advances in Biology and Therapeutics. John Libbey Eurotext, Montrouge, France1996: 281-288Google Scholar). Indeed, transgenic mice overexpressing episialin/MUC1 develop more aggressive lung tumors than nontransgenic mice, 2J. Wesseling and J. Hilkens, unpublished data. 2J. Wesseling and J. Hilkens, unpublished data.whereas episialin/MUC1 null mice show a slower rate of tumor progression (11Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Recent reports have shown that episialin overexpression in various types of neoplasia correlates with poor survival (12Nakamori S. Ota D.M. Cleary K.R. Shirotani K. Irimura T. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Takao S. Uchikura K. Yonezawa S. Shinchi H. Aikou T.

Bonsignore G. J. Clin. Pathol. 1998; 51: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Episialin/MUC1 is also the antigen that is measured in the CA 15-3 assay (the main blood marker to detect recurrence of breast cancer), and it is a molecule that is widely considered as one of the most promising molecules to be used for vaccination against breast cancer. Therefore, knowledge about the regulation of episialin/MUC1 overexpression in tumor cells is of utmost clinical importance. In B cell lymphomas it has been shown that episialin/MUC1 overexpression is frequently the result of a t(1;14) (q21;q32) translocation, which brings the episialin/MUC1 gene under the control of an immunoglobulin γ heavy chain enhancer (15Dyomin V.G.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is consistent with a role in tumorigenesis of these lymphomas. However, the cause(s) of episialin/MUC1 overexpression in carcinoma cells have not been established yet. Previous studies (6Zaretsky J.Z. Weiss M. Tsarfaty I. Hareuveni M. Wreschner D.H. Keydar I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Bièche I. Lidereau R. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that the episialin/MUC1 mRNA level is severalfold increased in primary breast carcinoma specimens relative to adjacent normal epithelium. However, these results, which were obtained using mRNA blots of tissue homogenates, are inherently imprecise, since both breast carcinoma and normal breast tissue specimens usually contain significant amounts of other nonepithelial cell types. Even so, these results indicate that overexpression of episialin/MUC1 coincides with increased mRNA levels. Episialin/MUC1 mRNA levels in breast carcinoma cell lines also are increased in comparison to immortalized nontransformed epithelial cells (18Ligtenberg M.J. Vos H.L. Gennissen A.M. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5573-5578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The study of Bièche and Lidereau (17Bièche I. Lidereau R. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that the higher episialin/MUC1 mRNA levels to some degree may be caused by amplification of theMUC1 gene, but additional mechanisms of overexpression clearly are operative as well, since the level of overexpression often is much higher than the level of amplification.We hypothesized that overexpression of episialin/MUC1 in carcinoma cells is the result of constitutive activation of a transcription factor or inactivation of a repressor. Constitutively activated signaling pathways are common in carcinoma cells and strongly contribute to the malignant properties of these cells. As an initial step to elucidate such a putative factor or pathway, we studied the normal transcriptional regulation of the episialin/MUC1 gene first. As a lead we considered exogenous factors that have been shown to up-regulate episialin biosynthesis.IFN-γ is known to up-regulate episialin/MUC1 expression in cell lines derived from breast carcinomas (19Clark S. McGuckin M.A. Hurst T. Ward B.G. Dis. Markers. 1994; 12: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 3C. F. M. Molthoff, personal communication. 3C. F. M. Molthoff, personal communication.Similarly, mouse episialin/MUC1 expression is positively regulated by prolactin, when cells are grown on matrigel-coated membrane filters (20Parry G. Li J. Stubbs J. Bissell M.J. Schmidhauser C. Spicer A.P. Gendler S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of expression by prolactin is in line with the increased expression of human episialin during lactation (4Hilkens J. Buijs F. Hilgers J. Hageman P. Calafat J. Sonnenberg A. van der Valk M. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 34: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), when prolactin levels are strongly increased. Notably, breast carcinoma cells may synthesize prolactin (21Clevenger C.V. Chang W.P. Ngo W. Pasha T.L. Montone K.T. Tomaszewski J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 695-705PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ginsburg E. Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2591-2595PubMed Google Scholar) that could lead to autocrine stimulation of episialin expression. Both IFN-γ and prolactin act via signaling transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Different members of this protein family function during inflammatory processes and during mammary gland development and lactation to up-regulate the transcription of a large number of genes (23Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In addition to interferons and prolactin, STATs may also be activated by cytokines of the interleukin family, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6, which signals via STAT3, is produced by a variety of cells among which are epithelial cells (for a review see Klein (24Klein B. Klein B. Cytokines in Human Multiple Myeloma. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994Google Scholar)). It is noteworthy that enhanced levels of IL-6 are found in many solid tumors (25Krueger J. Ray A. Tamm I. Sehgal P.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas in the breast carcinoma cell lines T47D and ZR-75-1 IL-6 cause an enhanced motility and decreased adhesion (26Tamm I. Cardinale I. Murphy J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4414-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Tamm I. Kikuchi T. Cardinale I. Krueger J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3329-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), properties that could involve overexpression of episialin/MUC1.From the considerations presented above, we concluded that STAT proteins might be one of the important regulators of episialin/MUC1 transcription. Further evidence that STATs might be involved in episialin/MUC1 (over)expression is as follows. (i) A putative STAT-binding element, which is conserved in human and mouse, is present around 500 bp upstream of the transcription start site (28Spicer A.P. Parry G. Patton S. Gendler S.J. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent publication (34Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar) shows that STAT3 can act as an oncogene. Our results unambiguously show for the first time that the expression of the episialin/MUC1 gene indeed is highly up-regulated in breast cancer and that STAT transcription factors contribute to this overexpression of episialin/MUC1.DISCUSSIONImmunohistological studies of tissue sections with monoclonal antibodies against peptide epitopes in the mucin domain of episialin suggested that this molecule is strongly overexpressed in breast cancer (4Hilkens J. Buijs F. Hilgers J. Hageman P. Calafat J. Sonnenberg A. van der Valk M. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 34: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Zotter S. Lossnitzer A. Hageman P.C. Delemarre J.F. Hilkens J. Hilgers J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mucin domain of episialin on normal breast epithelial cells carries numerous branched O-linked carbohydrates that will block or hamper binding of the antibodies, whereas episialin molecules derived from carcinomas mainly contain shorter nonbranched glycans, more easily allowing the access of the antibodies to their epitopes (49Girling A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33325-33334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased reactivity of most monoclonal antibodies against episialin with tumor cells as reported in the literature could well be explained by differences in post-translational modifications in normal and tumor cells and not necessarily by overexpression of the episialin/MUC1 gene. In this report, our immunohistological studies, employing monoclonal antibodies that are hardly, if at all, affected byO-glycosylation, indicate that overexpression of episialin/MUC1 protein in breast carcinoma cells indeed occurs. The reports of Zaretsky et al. (6Zaretsky J.Z. Weiss M. Tsarfaty I. Hareuveni M. Wreschner D.H. Keydar I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Bièche and Lidereau (17Bièche I. Lidereau R. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) indicate that increased episialin mRNA levels are responsible for the overexpression of episialin/MUC1 protein in breast carcinoma cells. However, their studies were performed on whole tissue homogenates and therefore are difficult to interpret. Our in situ hybridization results unequivocally show for the first time that the episialin/MUC1 gene is indeed strongly overexpressed in breast carcinomas relative to normal breast epithelium.One possible explanation for the increased episialin/MUC1 mRNA levels in carcinoma cells is stabilization of the mRNA. However, the half-life in the normal breast epithelial cell line HBL-100 (Fig.2) and in the tumor cell lines MCF-7 (41Abe M. Kufe D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and T47D (Fig. 8) is not significantly different. In fact, episialin/MUC1 mRNA is very stable, which is compatible with a role of episialin as a structural protein. Other ways to overproduce an mRNA are amplification of the gene and, more rarely, up-regulation of the promoter by mutation. The first mechanism is indeed operative in the case of episialin/MUC1, as shown by Bièche and Lidereau (17Bièche I. Lidereau R. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but it is neither able to explain all cases of overexpression nor it can explain the extent of mRNA overexpression in carcinomas and cell lines. A promoter mutation is expected to affect only one of the two alleles. Northern data provided by Ligtenberg et al. (18Ligtenberg M.J. Vos H.L. Gennissen A.M. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5573-5578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bièche and Lidereau (17Bièche I. Lidereau R. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1997; 98: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) clearly indicate that the expression of both alleles, which can be easily distinguished from one another on the basis of differences in the number of repeats, is directly proportional to the number of gene copies as determined on Southern blots. These observations exclude mutation(s) in the promoter as a mechanism of overexpression and leave changes in transcriptional regulation of theMUC1 gene as the most important mechanism of episialin/MUC1 mRNA overexpression.Our study shows that the episialin/MUC1 promoter can be stimulated by STAT transcription factors via a STAT-binding site in its promoter. The position and sequence of this site is completely conserved in the promoters of mouse (29Vos H.L. De Vries Y. Hilkens J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and gibbon (28Spicer A.P. Parry G. Patton S. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15099-15109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the 9-nucleotide core sequence is identical to that of the proven binding site for STAT1 and STAT3 in the ICAM1 promoter (44Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Caldenhoven E. Coffer P. Yuan J. Van de Stolpe A. Horn F. Kruijer W. Van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21146-21154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified the proteins that bind to the STAT site in the episialin/MUC1 promoter as STAT1 in the case of induction by IFN-γ and STAT3 in the case of IL-6. This is completely in line with the current model of IFN-γ and IL-6 signaling (42Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 53Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar).Even without the addition of any growth factor or serum the W3B construct, which contains a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by 720 bp of the episialin/MUC1 promoter (including the STAT-responsive element), already showed a significant activity in reporter assays in the mammary carcinoma cell line T47D, which decreases 3-fold upon mutation of the STAT site. This observation indicates that a constitutively activated (STAT) factor is present in this cell line, which may contribute to overexpression of episialin/MUC1. Indeed constitutively activated STATs have been reported in breast cancers (32Watson C.J. Miller W.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 33Garcia R., Yu, C.L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our bandshift experiments do show a specific, STAT response element binding complex that is unaffected by treatment of the cells with IL-6 or IFN-γ. This complex also binds to the ICAM-1 oligonucleotide but is absent in bandshift experiments using an oligonucleotide with a mutated STAT site. The identity of this constitutively activated protein (complex) has not been established yet, but it may affect the overexpression of episialin/MUC1 in carcinoma cells. The latter notion is in line with the observation that neither the non-identified protein complex is present in the low episialin expressing A549 cells nor is there a difference between the basal activity of the W3B and M3B constructs transfected into these cells.Although a strong induction of the promoter activity by IL-6 occurs in reporter assays with T47D and ZR-75-1 cells, episialin/MUC1 protein levels do not increase to the same extent when the same cells are treated with IL-6. Since we have found no evidence for post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms affecting the episialin/MUC1 levels, as for instance has been reported for the rat sialomucin complex (54Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3537-35228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this discrepancy must be attributed to either the inability of the promoter to be further stimulated, because it is already fully activated in these cells, or to the presence of the promoter in a truncated form in a plasmid instead of its normal genomic surroundings. Indeed, the level of episialin/MUC1 in the two cell lines showing the highest expression, T47D and ZR-75-1, can barely be induced any further, whereas in cell lines with an intermediate or low expression level, episialin/MUC1 can be up-regulated by either IL-6 or IFN-γ, suggesting that the promoter activity in the former cells has reached its limits. Alternatively, an additional regulatory element located outside the promoter fragment used in the W3B construct may counteract the STAT-induced expression in T47D and ZR-75-1 cells. Preliminary results show that increasing the size of the 5′ promoter fragment in the reporter construct to 2.9 kb (i.e. into the 3′-untranslated sequence of the trombospondin 3 gene) does not diminish the ratio between the noninduced and the IL-6-induced luciferase levels. 6I. C. Gaemers, H. H. Volders, and J. Hilkens, manuscript in preparation. Another explanation for the unresponsiveness of the episialin protein levels to induction by IL-6 in some of the IL-6 receptor-positive carcinoma cells may be the inability of the STAT3 protein to bind to its binding site in the episialin/MUC1 promoter, because the site is already occupied, for instance by the previously mentioned unidentified protein in the bandshifts. Preliminary experiments suggest that this band has a similar or even higher affinity for the oligonucleotide than STAT3. The fact that a STAT3-specific band can be observed in the EMSAs should then be attributed to the presence of excess target oligonucleotide. Induction of the promoter activity in the reporter construct by IL-6 can be similarly explained by the abundance of reporter plasmid in the transiently transfected cells.Finally, it can be envisaged that by transfecting multiple copies of the promoter plasmid, a repressor of the STAT site is titered out, resulting in an IL-6-induced expression of the MUC1 promoter in transfected cells only. However, a concentration series of W3B, while keeping the total amount of DNA constant, did not show any evidence for such an effect. Induction of the promoter could be observed with a broad range of W3B DNA concentrations (0.05–2.0 μg of added plasmid, results not shown).Several other regulatory elements have been identified in the episialin/MUC1 promoter. For instance, Kovarik et al. (30Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kovarik A. Lu P.J. Peat N. Morris J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18140-18147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) identified an E box, termed E-MUC1, at position −84 to −74 and a Sp1-like binding site at position −101 to −89. The latter site can bind an inhibitory factor, SpA, or in the absence of SpA the stimulatory factor Sp-1. Since SpA and E-MUC1 are expected to be expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, they may confer tissue-specific expression of episialin/MUC1. In line with these results, we found that the presence of activated STAT1, capable of binding to the STAT-binding site in the episialin/MUC1promoter, does not lead to episialin/MUC1 expression in the promyelocytic HL-60 cells.Episialin is expressed in activated T cells (56Agrawal B. Krantz M.J. Parker J. Longenecker B.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4079-4081PubMed Google Scholar) and plasma cells and not or at very low levels during earlier stages of B cell development. 7J. Hilkens, unpublished data. In addition, STATs are known to regulate various stages of lymphocyte development. Therefore, STAT-dependent regulation of episialin/MUC1 during development of hematopoietic cells can be expected. In this respect it is important to note that IL-6 is an autocrine growth factor in various leukemia cells, including myeloma cells and other plasma cell malignancies, which frequently express high levels of episialin/MUC1 (57Akira S. Kishimoto T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar, 58Hawley R.G. Berger L.C. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1998; 29: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 59Gouilleux-Gruart V.

Blood. 1996; 87: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Induction of episialin expression has important consequences for cellular adhesion in cancer cells and certain normal cells. Tight regulation of the expression levels seems therefore of utmost importance. Regulation of episialin/MUC1 via cytokines and the JAK-STAT pathway seems functional in several cell types. Constitutive activation of STATs, as has been reported in breast carcinomas and in various lymphomas and leukemias, is probably one of the factors responsible for the overexpression of episialin in these cells. Episialin/MUC11 (also known as MUC1, PEM, CA 15-3 antigen, or EMA) is a transmembrane molecule with a large extracellular mucin-like domain. In normal cells episialin/MUC1 is exclusively present at the apical side of the cell, but in carcinoma cells normal polarization is lost and episialin/MUC1 co-localizes with adhesion molecules such as integrins and cadherins. The long and relatively rigid extracellular domain of episialin/MUC1 can shield these adhesion molecules and diminish cellular adhesion, if present at a sufficiently high density on the cell surface (1Ligtenberg M.J. Buijs F. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2318-2324PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wesseling J. van der Valk S.W. Vos H.L. Sonnenberg A. Hilkens J. J.

Overexpression of episialin/MUC1 in carcinoma cells has been frequently reported (4Hilkens J. Buijs F. Hilgers J. Hageman P. Calafat J. Sonnenberg A. van der Valk M. Int. J.

By using tagged Fe65 expression vectors, we observed that a significant fraction of Fe65 is localized in the nucleus of transfected COS7 cells. Furthermore, the isolation of nuclei from untransfected PC12 cells allowed us to observe that a part of the endogenous Fe65 is present in the nuclear extract. The analysis of Fe65 mutant constructs demonstrated that the region of the protein required for its nuclear translocation includes the WW domain, and that, on the other hand, a small fragment of 100 residues, including this WW domain, contains enough structural information to target a reporter protein (green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GFP) to the nucleus. To evaluate whether the Fe65-APP interaction could affect Fe65 intracellular trafficking, COS7 cells were cotransfected with APP695 or APP751 and with GFP-Fe65 expression vectors. These experiments demonstrated that Fe65 is no longer translocated to the nucleus when the cells overexpress APP, whereas the nuclear targeting of GFP-Fe65 mutants, unable to interact with APP, is unaffected by the coexpression of APP, thus suggesting that the interaction with APP anchors Fe65 in the cytosol.

In fact, the main constituent of the Alzheimer's disease senile plaques, the β-amyloid peptide, derives from APP as a consequence of its proteolytic processing (for a recent review see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 369: A23-A31Crossref Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). The overall structure of APP resembles that of a receptor or growth factor precursor, but only a small fraction of APP resides at the plasma membrane (2Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J.

The elucidation of the normal functions of APP could be important in understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease and in approaching its prevention and/or treatment, but such elucidation has been elusive up to now. One of the characteristics of this protein currently investigated is the complex network of protein-protein interactions that is centered at the short cytoplasmic tail of APP (13Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many proteins, in fact, interact with this C-terminal domain of APP, most of them possessing multiple protein-protein interaction domains, which in turn form complexes with other proteins, suggesting that these proteins function as adaptor proteins bridging APP to specific molecular pathways. Three of these adaptor proteins belong to the Fe65 protein family; Fe65 was originally described as a protein highly expressed in neurons of specific areas of the mammalian nervous system and also possessing some characteristics of a transcription factor (15Simeone A.

The PTB2 domain, located in the C-terminal half of the molecule, is responsible for the interaction of Fe65 and of the two related proteins Fe65L1 (17Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E.

Similarly, all three members of the Fe65 family interact with two APP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2 (17Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These interactions take place at the level of the ΦXNPXY motif (where Φ indicates a hydrophobic residue, and X indicates any amino acid) present in the cytodomains of APP and of its related proteins, and, differently from that observed for other PTB domains, the interaction does not require the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue (20Borg J.P.

Lastly, APP seems to have other partners also, not possessing a PTB domain, that bind its cytodomain, such as a Go protein (32Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Matsuura Y. Takahashi S. Okamoto T. Murayama Y.

The WW domain of Fe65, in fact, interacts with several proteins, one of which is Mena, the mammalian orthologue of the product of the enabled gene ofDrosophila, which is a genetic suppressor of the phenotype induced in Drosophila by the abl gene mutation (35Ermekova K.-S.

The second PTB domain of Fe65 (PTB1) interacts with the transcription factor CP2/LSF/LBP1 (36Zambrano N. Minopoli G. De Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol.

On the other hand, particularly at the presynaptic level, X11 forms a trimeric complex in vivo with CASK and VELI, the orthologues of Caenorhabditis elegans Lin2 and Lin7 proteins, respectively (37Borg J.P.

Considering that the intracellular trafficking of APP appears to be relevant for the different proteolytic fate of the molecule and, possibly, for its function(s), it is important to analyze the intracellular localization of proteins interacting with the cytodomain of APP, to evaluate the possible association of any APP partner to specific APP trafficking and proteolytic pathways. The ligands of Fe65 identified up to now suggest multiple intracellular locations of this adaptor protein, considering that Mena is mainly connected with the actin cytoskeleton remodelling system (42Manier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W. Menzies A.S. Wehman A.M. Macklis J.D. Kwiatkowski D. Soriano P. Gertler F.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and that the known functions of CP2/LSF/LBP1 take place in the nucleus. In this paper we addressed the question of the intracellular localization of Fe65 and its relationship with that of APP. We found that transient overexpression of Fe65 in cultured cells results in its accumulation in the nucleus and that endogenous Fe65 is present in the nuclear extract from PC12 cells. The cytosol-nuclear translocation of Fe65 takes place through an unusual pathway requiring the region that includes the WW domain and is prevented by the coexpression of APP, whose cytodomain functions as a cytosolic anchoring element. The GFP-Fe65 and Fe65-HA fusion proteins encoding wild type Fe65 were obtained by amplification of the rat Fe65 cDNA previously described (43Faraonio R. Minopoli G. Porcellini A. Costanzo F. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4876-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Fe65 deletion mutants GFP-Fe65Δ666–711, GFP-Fe65Δ538–711, GFP-Fe65Δ1–287, GFP-Fe65Δ1–253, as well as the fragment corresponding to the Fe65 cDNA codons 191–290, were obtained by amplification of the Fe65 cDNA with specific oligonucleotide primers (CEINGE) as follows: for GFP-Fe65 and Fe65-GFP, forward 1, 5′-GAGCTCAAGCTTCTACTAAGCCATGTCTGTTC and reverse 1, 5′-GACCGCGGGCCCGCGGGGTCTGGGATCCTAG; for GFP-Fe65Δ666–711, forward 1 and reverse 2, 5′-GCCATCGGGCCCAAGCATCCAGACACTTCTGGTA; for GFP-Fe65Δ538–711, forward 1 and reverse 3, 5′-GCCATCGGGCCCAAGCATTGCGCCTTCAGACA; for GFP-Fe65Δ1–287, forward 2, 5′-GAGCTCAAGCTTCCCCATCACAGGGGAACAG and reverse 1; for GFP-Fe65Δ1–253, forward 3, 5′-GAGCTCAAGCTTCCGATCTACCGGCTGGATG and reverse 1; for GFP-GFP-Fe65191–290, forward 3, 5′-ATATGAATTCTGGACCCCAGGYCCTCACAGATGG and reverse 4, 5′-CTGCGAATTCTGATGGGGAGGCCCGGTCC. The recombinant constructs were generated by ligation of the polymerase reaction fragments digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and purified from agarose gels with the QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen) in the pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-N1 vectors (CLONTECH) for expression as a fusion to the C terminus and to the N terminus of EGFP, respectively. The GFP-GFP expression vector was generated by cloning in theXhoI-EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) the EGFP cDNA obtained by direct amplification from the same vector with the following oligonucleotide primers: forward 4, 5′-ATATCTCGAGAGCTGGACGGCGACGTAAACG and reverse 5, 5′-ATAAGAATTCAGGTAGTGGTTGTCGGGCAGC. The GFP-GFP-Fe65191–290 was obtained by cloning in frame the corresponding cDNA fragment downstream of the region encoding the second GFP in the GFP-GFP vector. The Fe65 point mutant C655F cDNA was obtained by using the QuickChange™ kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's procedure. For the mutagenesis, the pEGFP-C1-Fe65 expression vector was used as a template, and the following pair of oligonucleotides were used as primers: forward 5, 5′-CTGTGCAGGCTGACATTCATGCTCCGCTAC and reverse 6, 5′-GTAGCGGAGCATGAATGCAGCCTGCACAG. Bold characters indicate the mutated residue. The sequence and the reading frame of all the recombinant constructs were checked by nucleotide sequence by using the Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the expression and size of the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The CMV-Fe65-HA vector expressing wild type rat Fe65 tagged with the HA epitope was obtained by cloning in the HindIII site of pRC-CMV (Invitrogen), a polymerase chain reaction fragment obtained by using the following primers: forward 6, 5′-CCCAAGCTTACTAAGGCCATGTCTGTTCCA and reverse HA, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCATATGGGTATGGGGTCTGGGATCCTAGAC. Cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2; COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture (HyClone). PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture (HyClone). For the expression of the GFP-Fe65 fusion proteins or of Fe65-HA, 1.5 × 106 cells were transfected by electroporation at 250 microfarad and 220 V with 20 μg of each construct. For cotransfection experiments 10 μg each of the GFP-Fe65 constructs and of the CMV-APP expression vectors, carrying the wild type APP695 or the APP751 cDNAs, were used. For fluorescence microscopy, transfected COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips. After 36 h cells were washed with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS, pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed once in PBS-glycine and twice in PBS. When indicated, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. APP was stained with 6E10 or 369 antibodies, using Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fe65-HA was stained with the anti-HA polyclonal antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The coverslips were mounted in 50% glycerol solution onto a glass microscope slide and viewed using an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). For fluorescence observation of unfixed cells the coverslips were laid down on a drop of PBS and immediately examined. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed on a laser scanning LSM510 microscope (Zeiss) using dedicated image software. For the preparation of total cell extracts, monolayer cultures were harvested in cold PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of extract were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting as described (22Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation experiment, the cell extracts (2 mg) were incubated with the monoclonal antibody anti-GFP JL8 (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunocomplexes were collected with 30 μl/sample of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). PC12 cell fractionation was performed as previously described (36Zambrano N. Minopoli G. De Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and nuclei were purified on a 30% sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytosol-membrane extracts were prepared as described (36Zambrano N. Minopoli G. De Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To characterize the intracellular localization of Fe65 and to follow its possible intracellular trafficking, we generated two constructs driving the expression of full-length Fe65 fused to the GFP, one having GFP at the N terminus (GFP-Fe65) and the other one at the C terminus (Fe65-GFP) of Fe65. These constructs were transfected in COS7 cells, and the Western blot analysis of transfected cell extracts demonstrated that both fusion proteins are stable and of the expected size (Fig.1 A). The characteristic multiple band pattern of Fe65 (36Zambrano N. Minopoli G. De Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was also observed with GFP-Fe65 and Fe65-GFP; the latter migrates slightly faster than GFP-Fe65. The subcellular distribution of GFP-Fe65 fusion proteins in transfected cells showed that most of the fluorescent signal is localized in the area of the nucleus, with the exclusion of nucleoli (Fig. 1,B and C). Furthermore, Fe65-bound fluorescence is also present outside the nuclei, and in many cells a clear definition of some edges can be seen. No difference was observed between the cells transfected with GFP-Fe65 or with Fe65-GFP. Fig. 1 also shows that there is no significant difference between the localization of the fluorescent signal in fixed cells (B and C) and in living unfixed cells (D and E). The confocal microscope analysis confirmed that the fluorescence bound to Fe65 is present within the nuclei (Fig. 2).Figure 2GFP-Fe65 accumulates within COS7 cell nuclei. Confocal microscopy analysis of GFP-Fe65 fluorescent signal was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a–p show optical sections at 1-μm intervals from the base (a) to the top (p) of the cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An identical expression pattern was seen when COS7 cells were transfected with the CMV-Fe65-HA vector, which drives the expression of wild type rat Fe65 protein tagged at the C terminus with the HA epitope, and stained with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 F). In addition, in this case the Fe65-HA signal is significantly represented both in the nucleus and in the cytosol. To evaluate whether endogenous Fe65 is also present in the nucleus of nontransfected cells, we examined PC12 cells, in which the levels of the protein are significantly higher than those present in COS7 cells. Nuclei were purified from exponentially growing PC12 cells as previously described (36Zambrano N. Minopoli G. De Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the protein extract from these nuclei was examined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1 G, Fe65 is clearly present in the nuclear extract (N), whereas its amount in the cytosol-membrane (CM) fraction is severalfold higher than in the nuclear fraction. The molecular weights, deduced from the DNA sequence, of the two GFP-Fe65 fusion proteins and that of Fe65-HA render their free diffusion through the nuclear pore unlikely; thus we addressed the question of what region(s) of Fe65 are responsible for its nuclear localization. To this aim, we generated a series of GFP-Fe65 vectors expressing various deletion mutants of Fe65. These vectors, summarized in Fig.3 A, were transfected in COS7 cells, and this resulted in the expression of fusion proteins of the expected sizes (Fig. 3 H). The amino acid sequence of rat Fe65 contains only one region, from amino acids 684 to 705, with clustered basic residues (RRX5RRX9KXKR) that resembles a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and that is conserved in the human protein. On this basis a construct was generated driving the expression of a GFP-Fe65 fusion protein containing a deletion mutant of Fe65, lacking the C-terminal 23 residues from amino acids 666 to 711 (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B shows that the cellular localization of this GFP-Fe65Δ666–711 is identical to that of the GFP-Fe65 wild type protein, localized mainly in the nucleus and also in the cytoplasm. On the contrary, the truncation of the N-terminal 287 amino acids of Fe65 results in a dramatic change of the intracellular distribution of the GFP-Fe65Δ1–287 protein, which is completely excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 3 C). The same exclusion from the nucleus was also observed in living unfixed cells (Fig. 3 D). To further restrict the sequence involved in the Fe65 nuclear localization, we generated some more deletion mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 E, one of these mutants,GFP-Fe65Δ1–253 (Fig. 3 A), is still translocated to the nucleus. Therefore, the analysis of the GFP-Fe65 deletion mutants restricts the area in which the element responsible for the Fe65 nuclear localization resides from amino acid 250 to amino acid 290, a region that includes the WW domain. These results are in agreement with the results of previous experiments based on cell fractionation, which demonstrated that Fe65 is present in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions, whereas deletion mutants of Fe65, lacking the N-terminal region, are only found in the cytosolic extracts (36Zambrano N. Minopoli G. De Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). No typical NLS is present in this region; therefore, we addressed the question of the possible presence in this region of an element that, besides being necessary for Fe65 nuclear localization, is also sufficient to target a protein to the nucleus. To do this we generated constructs encoding fusion proteins composed by two consecutive GFP units fused to various fragments of the region of Fe65 from amino acids 1 to 290 that we demonstrated to be necessary for its nuclear translocation (Fig. 3, A and H). As shown in Fig.3 F, a protein consisting of two consecutive GFP units is excluded from the nucleus, as expected from its molecular size, whereas the GFP-GFP-Fe65 protein carrying the region from amino acids 191 to 290 is translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 3 G). There are several possibilities to be examined to explain the nuclear translocation in the absence of a consensus NLS. One of these is the direct interaction of Fe65 with the nuclear pore complex, as observed for other nuclear proteins lacking an NLS (44Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that Fe65 is transported to the nucleus by a cargo system including a protein containing an NLS. An example of this “piggyback” mechanism is that of cyclin B1, which, lacking an NLS, is translocated into the nucleus in a complex containing cyclin F, which possesses two functional NLSs (45Kong M. Barnes E.A. Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the WW domain of Fe65 binds several proteins, only one of which has been identified (as Mena (35Ermekova K.-S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which is not a good candidate to be responsible for the translocation of Fe65 to the nucleus because it is mainly localized in the cytosol). The attempt to use the WW domain of Fe65 as bait to find its partners by the two-hybrid screening system failed because of the high background given by the GAL4-Fe65 fusion protein. This background is expected, considering the previous observation that the region of Fe65 containing the WW domain is per se able to strongly activate the transcription when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (16Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This means that the identification of the other ligands of the WW domain of Fe65, possibly responsible for its cytosol-nuclear trafficking, will require their purification and sequencing by classical biochemical procedures. Fig. 3 G shows that, unlike the wild type GFP-Fe65 protein that is present both in the nucleus and in the cytosol (Fig. 1), GFP-GFP-Fe65191–290 is restricted to the nucleus. This suggests that a nuclear export signal present in Fe65 has been removed from the GFP-GFP-Fe65191–290 protein. One possible nuclear export signal (LX3LX2VXV) present in Fe65 from residues 180 to 189 and absent from the GFP-GFP-Fe65191–290 protein cannot be considered, because it is also absent from GFP-Fe65Δ1–253, which is located both in the nucleus and in the cytosol (Fig. 3 E). Thus, the possible sequence affecting Fe65 export from the nucleus should be located in the C-terminal half of the molecule, or, as in the case of Fe65 nuclear import, it is translocated to the cytosol through interaction with an exported protein. CP2/LSF/LBP1 interacts with the PTB1 domain of Fe65 and thus could be involved in Fe65 nuclear export. However, the nuclear-cytosol transport of this transcription factor was never addressed, and its sequence does not contain any canonical nuclear export signal. The protein-protein interaction network centered at the cytosolic domain of APP could be involved in transmembrane signaling triggered by the interaction of APP with soluble or cell-anchored signals. The demonstration that Fe65 does transit in the nucleus suggests that the Fe65-APP interaction could affect some nuclear functions. Therefore, we analyzed the possible relationship between Fe65 intracellular trafficking and APP expression. To address this point we cotransfected COS7 cells with GFP-Fe65 and APP695 expression vectors. Transfected cells were stained with 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the extracellular/intraluminal domain of APP, or with 369 antibody, which recognizes the C-terminal cytosolic domain of APP. As shown in Fig.4, in nonpermeabilized cells 6E10 antibody allowed us to stain the cells transfected with APP695 expression vector (A), and some of these cells at the same time expressed GFP-Fe65. In these cotransfected cells Fe65-bound fluorescence is excluded from the nucleus, whereas in the cells expressing only GFP-Fe65 the fluorescence is localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A′). The same experiment was done in permeabilized cells, by using the 369 antibody, which recognizes the cytosolic domain of APP. In these conditions, in addition to the already observed exclusion from the nucleus of GFP-Fe65 wild type in the cells coexpressing APP, a clear colocalization of GFP-Fe65 wild type and APP was seen at the plasma membrane, in the perinuclear cisternae, and in the area of the Golgi network (Fig. 4, Band B′). The cotransfection of the GFP-Fe65 vector with the APP751-expressing vector gave results identical to those observed with APP695 (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that Fe65 is no longer translocated to the nucleus when the cells overexpress APP, thus suggesting that the interaction with APP is sufficient to tether Fe65 in the cytosol. To support this hypothesis, we generated an expression vector that encodes a GFP protein fused to the deletion mutant of Fe65 (GFP-Fe65Δ538–711; see Fig. 3 A) that lacks the PTB2 domain that is responsible for binding to APP. Fig.5, A and A′ show that the GFP-Fe65Δ538–711 mutant is located in the nucleus and that in the cells coexpressing APP695 the nuclear translocation of the Fe65 mutant is unaffected. Furthermore, this GFP-Fe65Δ538–711 mutant does not accumulate in the perinuclear cisternae or in the Golgi area. An identical behavior was observed when the cells were transfected with a GFP-Fe65 construct bearing a point mutation changing the Cys-655 of Fe65 into a Phe (Fig. 5, B andB′). This Fe65 mutant is unable to interact with APP (20Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), as demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation experiment reported in Fig. 5 C. In fact, APP was not coimmunoprecipitated with Fe65 in extracts from COS7 cells transfected with Fe65C655F and APP695, whereas APP coimmunoprecipitates with wild type Fe65. The intracellular localization that we observed in COS7 cells cotransfected with Fe65 and APP is very similar to that previously reported in MDCK-695 cells stably expressing Fe65 (28Sabo S.L. Lanier L.M. Ikin A.F. Khorkova O. Sahasrabudhe S. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7952-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In fact, Fe65 and APP are clearly colocalized at the level of perinuclear cisternae and in the Golgi area. In these cells transfected Fe65 was not seen in the nucleus. The reason for this difference probably is, as also suggested by the authors of that study, that the amount of holo-APP in MDCK-695 cells is not limiting; therefore, the transfected Fe65 remains entrapped in the cytosol, where a large amount of APP is present. In any case, it is also possible that in MDCK-695 cells a fraction of Fe65 is translocated to the nucleus, but that the amount of this fraction is below the detection limit of the immunomicroscopy procedure used. According to this possibility, in nontransfected PC12 cells the amount of endogenous Fe65 present in the nuclear extract is much lower than that present in the cytosol-membrane fraction (Fig. 1 G). The inhibition of Fe65 nuclear import by interaction with APP could be a new example of regulated nuclear localization by cytoplasmic anchoring. The best studied example of this phenomenon is that of β-catenin. This protein plays an important role in the Wingless-signaling pathway (46Brown J.D. Moon T.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); it functions as an adaptor protein binding to cadherins, membrane proteins involved in cell adhesion, and to the actin cytoskeleton (47Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-catenin is also localized in the nucleus and binds the transcription factor LEF1/TCF (48Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar), and its nuclear translocation is regulated by cytoplasmic anchoring to cadherins (49Fagotto F. Funayama N. Gluck U. Grumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The similarity between Fe65-APP behavior and that of β-catenin-cadherins is further supported by the observation that β-catenin lacks a classical NLS and is therefore imported in the nucleus by an unusual pathway (50Fagotto F. Gluck U. Grumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another example of the extranuclear anchoring of transcription factors is given by Notch (51Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) and SREBP (52Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar), whose precursors are membrane proteins that, following the proteolytic cleavage of their transmembrane helix, release in the cytosol a mature transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus. The case of Notch is particularly related to APP because of the involvement of presenilin dimers in the proteolytic cleavage of both proteins (51Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). This point deserves particular attention, and further experiments are needed to evaluate whether the APP processing by γ-secretase could result in the targeting of Fe65 to the nucleus through the cleavage of the transmembrane domain of APP. The understanding of the functions of the complex protein-protein interaction network centered at the cytosolic domain of APP is an important step toward the discovery of APP functions and, possibly, of the molecular mechanisms regulating its amyloidogenic processing. The observations reported in this paper strengthen the hypothesis of a possible signaling mechanism linking APP to nuclear functions through Fe65 and its nuclear partner CP2/LSF/LBP1. This possibility is strongly supported by the recent finding that the CP2/LSF/LBP1 gene, located at chromosome 12, is a genetic determinant of Alzheimer's disease (53Lambert J.C. Goumidi L.

We report that this enzyme is expressed in lymphoid cells and is not induced by T cell antigen receptor like other dual specificity phosphatases. Introduction of exogenous VHR into Jurkat T cells caused a marked decrease in the transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells and an activator protein-1-driven reporter gene in response to ligation of T cell antigen receptors. The inhibition was dose-dependent and was similar at different doses of anti-receptor antibody. Catalytically inactive VHR mutants caused an increase in gene activation, suggesting a role for endogenous VHR in this response. In contrast, the activation of a nuclear factor κB-driven reporter was not affected. The inhibitory effects of VHR were also seen at the level of the mitogen-activated kinases Erk1, Erk2, Jnk1, Jnk2, and on reporter genes that directly depend on these kinases, namely Elk, c-Jun, and activator protein-1. In contrast, p38 kinase activation was not affected by VHR, and p38-assisted gene activation was less sensitive. Our results suggest that VHR is a negative regulator of the Erk and Jnk pathways in T cells and, therefore, may play a role in aspects of T lymphocyte physiology that depend on these kinases.

Several distinct MAP kinase cascades have been identified in mammalian cells including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1 and Erk2, which preferentially transmit signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases Jnk1 and Jnk2, the p38 kinases, which participate mainly in responses to stress, inflammation and apoptosis, and the 80-kDa Erk5, which may regulate cell proliferation (4Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Activation of T lymphocytes by antigens is accompanied by activation of all of these pathways (5Nel A.E. Hanekom C. Rheeder A. Williams K. Pollack S. Katz R. Landreth G. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar, 6Whitehurst C.E. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1020-1029PubMed Google Scholar, 7Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 5309-5317PubMed Google Scholar) although activation of the Jnks and p38s requires costimulation through CD28 (7Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), proinflammatory cytokines, or oxidative conditions that are often present at the site of inflammation and lymphocyte activation. At the molecular level, MAP kinases are activated by a dual threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation within the motifs Thr-Glu-Tyr (Erk), Thr-Pro-Tyr (Jnk), or Thr-Gly-Tyr (p38) in their activation loops by a number of specific MAP kinase kinases (9Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Conversely, inactivation of MAP kinases is achieved by dephosphorylation of either or both residues by protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, protein-tyrosine phosphatases, or dual specific protein phosphatases (DSPs) (reviewed in Refs.10–12). In fact, the number of identified phosphatases that inactivate MAP kinases exceeds the number of known MAP kinase kinases, providing the first example of an important process in which the regulatory emphasis is more on the phosphatases than on the kinases (11Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Many members of the DSP group have assumed a role in MAP kinase inactivation, and most are inducible nuclear proteins that play important negative feedback roles in cellular signaling processes in response to environmental signals such as mitogenesis, apoptosis, differentiation, and secretion of cytokines (10Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 11Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 1999; 14: 6-16Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The first cloned member of this group was the VH1 protein from the vaccinia virus (13Guan K.L. Bryoles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A closely related enzyme was subsequently found in mammalian cells and termed VHR (VH1-related) (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although most DSPs identified to date seem to be specific for Erk1 and Erk2, and a few prefer Jnk or p38, the cellular target(s) for VHR have remained unclear. VHR also differs from other DSPs in being much smaller, only 21 kDa. We report that VHR is expressed in all examined lymphoid and hematopoietic cell types and is constitutively expressed in T cells. We also present evidence that VHR counteracts the Erk and Jnk MAP kinases, but not p38, and all reporter genes that depend on Erk or Jnk. As a catalytically inactive VHR behaved as a “dominant-negative” in many experiments, we suggest that this may be the physiological function of VHR in T lymphocytes. The anti-VHR mAb was from Transduction Laboratories (Los Angeles, CA). The 12CA5 anti-hemagglutinin mAb was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The 9E10 hybridoma producing the mAb that recognizes the c-Myc epitope tag and the OKT3 hybridoma that produces the anti-CD3ε mAb were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Both mAbs were used as ascites. The mAb against CD28 was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. A cDNA panel from hematopoietic and lymphoid organs was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA for VHR was amplified from a Jurkat cell cDNA library using the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) primer pair 5′-A ATT GCT AGC ATG TCG GGC TCG TTC-3′ and 5′-G CGC ATC GAT CTA GGG TTT CAA CTT-3′ in a polymerase chain reaction using PWO polymerase obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The PCR product was sequenced and subcloned into the pEF/HA vector (15von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which adds a hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the N terminus of the insert. The c-Myc-tagged Erk2 was in pEF-neo, the HA-tagged Erk1 (from G. Baier, University of Innsbruck, Austria) was in pEF-neo, HA-Jnk1 and HA-Jnk2 were in the pcDNA3 vector, and p38-α cDNA (from J. D. Lee, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA) was subcloned into the pEF-HA vector. GAL4-Elk was from J. Tian and G. Hauser (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), and GAL4-c-Jun and GAL4-luc were from T. Kawakami (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA). To generate a catalytically inactive mutant of VHR, the codon for Cys-124 was changed into a codon for serine in the pEF/HA-VHR plasmid using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The substrate-trapping mutant of VHR (VHR-D92A) was generated using the Quick Change (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) site-directed mutagenesis kit as instructed by the manufacturer. Both mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Jurkat T leukemia cells were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin. These cells were transiently transfected with a total of 5–10 μg of DNA by electroporation at 950 microfarads and 240 V. Empty vector was added to control samples to make constant the amount of DNA in each sample. Cells were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. Human bone marrow was purchased from AllCells LLC (Foster City, CA). Bone marrow leukocytes were obtained by hypotonic lysis of the erythrocytes in water for 1 min followed by washing of the cells in RPMI medium. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (∼80% T cells) were obtained from venous blood from healthy donors (Red Cross Blood Bank, San Diego, CA) by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and by removal of monocytes by adherence to plastic at 37 °C for 2 h. The adherent cells were also recovered. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The clarified lysates were preabsorbed on protein G-Sepharose and then incubated with antibody for 2 h followed by protein G-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, once in lysis buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, again in lysis buffer, and either suspended in SDS sample buffer or used for in vitro kinase assays. Proteins resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters, which were immunoblotted as before (15von Willebrand M. Jascur T.

Briefly, 20 × 106 Jurkat T cells were transfected with either empty vector or 5 μg of HA-tagged Jnk1 or Jnk2 plasmid alone or plus 5 μg of VHR plasmid. Cells were harvested 2 days after electroporation, either left untreated or stimulated with anti-CD3ε mAb plus anti-CD28 (9.3) mAb followed by the cross-linking with anti-mouse Ig for 20 min at 37 °C, or UV-irradiated for 1 min at room temperature using a transilluminator (FBTI-88, λ=312 nm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After irradiation, the cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h before lysis. Cells were heat-shocked at 45 °C for 20 min. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the HA-tagged Jnk was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-HA mAb (12CA5) as above.

The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 2 min. The samples were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and the labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. These were done as before (17Saxena M.

Cells were harvested 2 days after electroporation, divided into two samples/transfection, and either stimulated with OKT3 (5 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C or left untreated. Cells were lysed as described above, and the Myc-tagged Erk2 was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of the 9E10 anti-Myc mAb followed by 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads.

The presence of equal amounts of the immunoprecipitated Erk2 was verified by immunoblotting using the anti-Erk2 antibody at 1:1000 dilution. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (16Gjörloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Williams S. Hammi D. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

Briefly, 20 × 106cells were transfected with 2 μg of NFAT/AP-1-luc (or other reporters) together with empty pEF/HA vector alone or VHR plasmids. After stimulation for 6 h, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The final assay contained 50 μl of lysate, 100 μl of ATP solution (10 mm ATP, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, and 20 mmMgCl2), plus 100 μl of luciferin reagent (0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, and 20 mmMgCl2). The activity was measured in an automatic luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The activity of a cotransfected β-galactosidase was measured and used to normalize the luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. To survey normal lymphoid cell types and organs for VHR expression, we designed an oligonucleotide primer pair complementary to the ends of the open reading frame to amplify VHR mRNA-derived sequences by the PCR from a panel of cDNA libraries (CLONTECH). A fragment of the expected size (558 base pairs) was readily obtained from bone marrow, fetal liver, lymph node, peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, thymus, tonsil, and the T leukemia cell line Jurkat (Fig. 1A). The expression was lowest in the thymus and highest in Jurkat. To verify that the amplification products were derived from VHR, we cloned and sequenced the fragment. The obtained sequence was 100% identical to the published sequence of VHR (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To confirm the presence of VHR protein in hematopoietic cells, cell lysate samples containing 70 μg of protein from isolated blood T cells, monocytes, bone marrow leukocytes, or Jurkat T cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the anti-VHR mAb. An ∼21-kDa band of very similar intensity was seen in these cells (Fig.1 A, right panels). Next we subcloned the sequenced open reading frame of VHR into the pEF/HA vector, which adds an N-terminal HA tag to the insert. When the plasmid was transfected by electroporation into Jurkat T cells, a 23-kDa protein appeared as expected (the HA tag adds ∼2 kDa). This protein was immunoprecipitated by both an anti-HA mAb and an anti-VHR mAb and was immunoblotted by both mAbs (Figs. 1 B and2). In contrast, an endogenous protein of 21 kDa was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with only the anti-VHR mAb (Fig. 1, B and C). Because most DSPs are inducible genes encoded by immediate early genes, we wanted to determine whether this was also true for VHR. Jurkat T cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of the activating anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3 plus the anti-CD28 mAb for 0–48 h and then immunoblotted with the anti-VHR mAb. The amount of VHR immunoreactivity remained completely unchanged during these experiments (Fig. 1 C). The same experiment was also performed with normal blood T cells with the same result (Fig.1 D). Thus, VHR is constitutively expressed in T cells prior to receptor stimulation and is not induced. As a rapid screening assay for a possible role of VHR in T cell activation, we coexpressed VHR with a sensitive luciferase reporter gene, in which luciferase transcription is under the control of a tandem NFAT/AP-1 element taken from the interleukin-2 gene promoter. This reporter responds to T cell antigen receptor ligation with anti-CD3ε mAbs alone or together with coligation of the CD28 costimulatory molecule. When these experiments were first performed with different amounts of VHR plasmid, we observed that VHR inhibited the response in a dose-dependent manner with a sharp drop in gene activation between 2 and 5 μg of plasmid (Fig. 2 A). The expression of VHR protein correlated with the DNA dose (inset). A titration of the amount of anti-CD3ε showed that VHR did not shift the anti-CD3ε dose-response (e.g. by desensitizing the receptor) but inhibited it to an equal degree at all doses (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the effect of catalytically active VHR, expression of the two catalytically inactive VHR mutants, C124S and D92A, had the opposite effect, namely a substantial increase in gene activation in response to anti-CD3ε or anti-CD3ε plus anti-CD28 (Fig.2 C). This dominant-negative effect may result from a displacement of endogenous, active VHR. If so, our results support the notion that endogenous VHR suppresses reporter gene activation. Catalytically active VHR also inhibited reporter gene activation induced by phorbol ester and ionomycin, whereas the inactive C124S mutant augmented it (Fig. 2 D). In support of a role of VHR in the signaling pathways that up-regulate NFAT/AP-1-driven transcription, we found that coexpression of VHR with a luciferase reporter under the control of a nuclear factor κB element had a small stimulatory effect on its activation (Fig. 2 E). Because nuclear factor κB induction, in contrast to NFAT/AP-1, was not inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, we conclude that VHR does not inhibit this pathway even when expressed at higher levels. The small stimulatory effect is of questionable significance but could be secondary to inhibition of other pathways. To further understand the effect of VHR on reporter gene activation and to address the hypothesis that VHR acts on one or several members of the MAP kinase family, we measured the activation of these kinases one by one. First, VHR was cotransfected with an epitope-tagged Jnk2 in Jurkat T cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with anti-CD3ε plus anti-CD28 on ice for 15 min, washed twice with cold RPMI, and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence of a cross-linking sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody. After cell lysis, the HA-tagged Jnk was immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 anti-HA mAb and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. These experiments revealed that expression of active VHR inhibited the activation of Jnk, whereas the catalytically inactive mutant had little effect (Fig.3, lanes 1–8). The amount of Jnk2 was found to be similar in all the samples (Fig. 3, lower panel), and the VHR proteins were equally expressed in lanes 5–8 (lower panel). This result was obtained in several independent experiments, and very similar results were obtained with Jnk1. Next we tested whether VHR would also affect stress-induced activation of Jnk2. Experiments were performed as above, but instead of stimulating the cells with antibodies, we either irradiated them with ultraviolet light or kept them at 45 °C for 20 min. Both treatments activated Jnk2, and both were inhibited by active VHR (Fig. 3,lanes 9–24). Activation of Jnk2 by heat shock was augmented ∼2-fold by the catalytically inactive VHR mutant (39,203 cpm inlane 24 versus 17,333 cpm in lane 20 incorporated into the substrate), but the very strong activation of Jnk2 by ultraviolet light was partly reduced by this mutant. This finding was consistently seen in several independent experiments and may be due to binding to Jnk2 resulting in some steric hindrance of the kinase. The amount of Jnk2 was found to be similar in all the samples (lower panels), and VHR and VHR-C124S were equally expressed inlanes 13–16 and 21–24 (lower panels). These results were obtained in two independent experiments. Having established that Jnk is sensitive to VHR, we tested Erk activation in similar experiments. A Myc-tagged Erk2 was coexpressed with VHR or inactive mutant VHR, and the cells were stimulated with the anti-CD3ε mAb for 5 min (anti-CD28 is not required). After cell lysis, Erk2 was immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 anti-Myc mAb and subjected to anin vitro kinase reaction with myelin basic protein as a substrate. These experiments revealed that Erk activation was reduced by active VHR but not by the inactive mutant (Fig.4 A). However, in most experiments, the inhibition was not as marked as the inhibition observed for Jnk. The amount of Erk was equal in all samples (Fig.4 A, middle panel), and VHR was well expressed (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel). This result was obtained in several additional experiments. p38 kinase is also activated in T cells in response to receptor signaling and ultraviolet irradiation. However, coexpression of active or inactive VHR had no effect on these responses despite being well expressed (Fig. 4 B). These results have been obtained in several independent experiments and suggest that VHR has specificity toward Jnk and Erk but not p38. To further investigate the negative regulation of Jnk and Erk by VHR, we decided to utilize a number of downstream targets of these kinases. In intact cells, many of these targets are also affected by p38, but the relative importance of the three principal MAP kinases varies considerably from target to target. First we utilized a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the Elk protein, which is phosphorylated and activated mostly by Erk. To increase or decrease its dependence on Erk, we coexpressed Erk, Jnk, or p38 with the reporter. These experiments showed that the reporter was sensitive to VHR and even more sensitive when the level of Erk was increased (Fig.5 A). Coexpression of p38 caused a smaller augmentation of reporter gene activation, and the inhibition was less striking, as would be expected if p38 were more involved relative to Erk in these cells. The effects of Jnk were intermediate. The activation of the c-Jun protein is principally mediated by Jnk and can be measured using a c-Jun-GAL4 fusion protein, which controls the expression of a cotransfected GAL4-sensitive luciferase (20Hata D. Kitaura J. Hartman S.E. Kawakami Y. Yokota T. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10979-10987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This reporter was activated ∼2-fold by stimulation of the T cells with anti-CD3ε plus anti-CD28 but was much augmented by coexpression of Jnk1 or Jnk2 (Fig. 5 B). In both cases, a coexpressed VHR caused a strong inhibition of the reporter. Finally we used a luciferase reporter gene driven by a single AP-1 site (without an adjacent NFAT element) that binds the dimeric Jun/Fos complex referred to as AP-1. This reporter was strongly induced when either Jnk or Erk was coexpressed, and in both cases VHR caused a marked inhibition of the response. In contrast to the Elk reporter, the AP-1 reporter was somewhat better responsive to Jnk and more inhibited by VHR in the presence of Jnk. Nevertheless, all these results show that both Erk and Jnk are similarly sensitive to inhibition by VHR, whereas p38 is much less so, if at all. The 185-amino acid VHR was the first human DSP to be cloned (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); the enzyme has been crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure has been solved (21Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The structure revealed that the catalytic center of VHR is composed of the same structural elements as in the classical protein-tyrosine phosphatases like PTP1B (22Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) including the cysteine (Cys-124) in the bottom of the catalytic cleft. Mutagenesis experiments and kinetic analyses have confirmed that Cys-124 is essential for catalysis (23Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that Asp-92 participates in substrate dephosphorylation by acting as proton donor for the reaction (25Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The dual specificity of VHR toward both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine in protein substrates is explained by its catalytic pocket being less deep than in other protein-tyrosine phosphatases. This allows all three phosphoamino acid residues to reach the catalytic machinery (21Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine is much preferred over phosphothreonine and occurs much more rapidly (26Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite the detailed insights into its atomic structure and catalytic mechanism, the physiological function of VHR has remained obscure. It differs from the group of MAP kinase-specific DSPs in that it lacks noncatalytic regulatory or targeting regions. For this reason, the enzyme is also considerably smaller that other DSPs, only 21 kDa. Nevertheless, a recent paper (27Todd J. Tanner K. Dent J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 19: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported that VHR can dephosphorylate Erk1 and Erk2 and suggested that these two kinases are physiological targets for VHR. Our findings agree with this report, but we also find that Jnk is an equally preferred target for VHR in intact T cells. Like Todd et al. (27Todd J. Tanner K. Dent J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 19: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we find that p38 kinase is not affected. It remains to be determined what gives VHR this specificity and how the enzyme is targeted and regulated. In T cells, the Erk kinases are activated very rapidly with peak activities observed within minutes followed by a gradual decline beginning within 5 min and a return to basal or near basal levels at 10–30 min. The inducible DSPs, primarily the Pac-1 protein in lymphocytes (28Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siewbenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), are not present at these time points but appear in the nucleus some 30–60 min after cell stimulation. In this location, they can dephosphorylate any remaining activated MAP kinases and terminate the response. In fibroblasts lacking MKP-1 (29Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar), also encoded by an immediate early gene (30Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the activation of MAP kinase also proceeds normally. In contrast, when MKP-1 is expressed in cells under a noninducible promoter, it strongly blocks MAP kinase activation by active Ras (31Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) or by extracellular stimuli (30Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1994; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 33Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). At the early time points, however, MAP kinase activation must be counteracted by phosphatases that are present in resting cells such as hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatases (17Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11693-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Saxena M. Williams S. Taskén K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and VHR. At present, no other MAP kinase-specific phosphatases are known to be constitutively expressed in lymphocytes. In its role as a negative regulator of Erk, VHR may be competing with a number of other phosphatases (reviewed in Ref. 11Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, as a Jnk regulator VHR is accompanied only by VH5 (M3/6 in the mouse (34Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar)) and perhaps by MKP-2, which dephosphorylates both Erk and Jnk with comparable efficiency at least in vitro (35King A.G. Ozanne B.W. Smythe C. Ashworth A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2553-2563PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these enzymes are inducible nuclear enzymes that may not be present in T cells at least during the first 30–60 min after receptor stimulation. Thus, VHR may be of particular importance in this cell type as a negative regulator of Jnk1 and Jnk2, which are important signal transducers in lymphocytes as well as other cell types (36Sabapathy K.

Generally, organisms use proteins and polysaccharides to regulate mineralization by affecting the nucleation, growth regulation, and growth cessation of the attendant mineral crystals (4Belcher A.M.

Typically, mineralization takes place from a fluid medium, which is biologically regulated in its content, supersaturated with the ions being deposited, and spatially separated from its surroundings (10Mann S. Nature. 1988; 332: 119-124Crossref Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 11Wilbur K.M. Am. Zool. 1984; 24: 839-845Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the mollusc Mytilus edulis, biomineralization manifests itself in exoskeletal shell formation. As a whole, mollusc shells are 95–99.9% by weight CaCO3 with the residual mass being composed of biological macromolecules (11Wilbur K.M. Am. Zool. 1984; 24: 839-845Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Hare P.E. Science. 1963; 139: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The shell of M. edulis is not homogeneous in its spatial distribution of CaCO3. Instead, the shell has an outer prismatic and an inner pearl-like nacreous layer, which contain CaCO3deposited as crystals of calcite and aragonite, respectively. These two mineralized layers are continuous, ultrastructurally unique, and reside one on top of the other along the long axis of the shell (1Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 7-24Google Scholar). Anatomically, the extrapallial (EP)1 fluid fills the cavity between the most outer visceral organ (the mantle) and the external shell. The EP fluid resides inside of the pallial line (site of mantle attachment near the shell perimeter) and is the medium from which prismatic layer thickening and nacre layer nucleation and growth occur (13Wilbur K.M. Bernhardt A.M. Biol. Bull. 1984; 166: 251-259Crossref Google Scholar, 14Eyster L.S. Morse M.P. Am. Zool. 1984; 24: 871-882Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Young S.D. Crenshaw M.A. King D.B. Marine Biol. 1977; 41: 253-257Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The location and contents of the EP fluid implies that it plays an essential role in mineralization/demineralization processesin vivo. Despite this belief, the EP fluid has received little study, because most investigations of shell formation have focused on the shell itself (1Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 7-24Google Scholar). Molluscan shell elongation and thickening occur throughout the life of the animal and is thought to be an organic matrix-mediated process controlled by a network of macromolecules composed of protein, carbohydrate, and glycoprotein (1Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 7-24Google Scholar, 16Gunthrope M.E. Sikes C.S. Wheeler A.P. Biol.

Exterior to the pallial line, the mantle is in intimate contact with the shell margin and as such is thought to secrete matrix material directly onto the growing shell edge. Interior to the pallial line, the mantle and shell are spatially separated by the EP cavity and constituent EP fluid. At this location, organic material is secreted from the mantle into the EP fluid where it is thought to self-assemble into a matrix prior to mineral deposition (15Young S.D. Crenshaw M.A. King D.B. Marine Biol. 1977; 41: 253-257Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17Krampitz G. Nancollas G.H. Biological Mineralization and Demineralization.

Qualitative analysis of EP fluid has shown it to contain the biomacromolecular materials found in the mature shell (protein, glycoprotein, carbohydrate, amino acids) (21Weiner S. Lowenstam H.A. Hood L. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 1977; 30: 45-51Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Misogaines M. Chasteen N.D. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein component of the EP fluid is heterogeneous, and certain fluid extracts have demonstrated the ability to bind calcium (21Weiner S. Lowenstam H.A. Hood L. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 1977; 30: 45-51Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Misogaines M. Chasteen N.D. Anal.

Bernhardt A.M. Biol. Bull. 1984; 166: 251-259Crossref Google Scholar). Studies of the ion content of the EP fluid show that its composition differs from that of the animal blood and the surrounding sea water (23Wada K. Fujijuki T. Wataba N. Wlibur K.M. Mechanisms of Mineralization in the Invertebrates and Plants. University of South Carolina Press, Columbia, SC1980: 175-190Google Scholar, 24Crenshaw M.A. Biol.

Examination of the pH, [CO2], and [Ca2+] as a function of shell opening and closure reveal the EP fluid to be a dynamic physiological medium, which may play a role in pH regulation within the animal (26Crenshaw M.A. Neff J.M. Am. Zool. 1969; 9: 881-885Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Given the implied significance of the EP fluid in shell mineralization, the present study was undertaken to purify and characterize its major protein component. We show here for the first time that the major protein component of the EP fluid is a 56,000 molecular weight glycoprotein that is a homodimer composed of 14.3% carbohydrate. This primary EP fluid protein reversibly binds calcium in a manner that leads to significant changes in its secondary structure and to the formation of distinct multimeric species composed of the constituent monomers. The major EP fluid protein appears to be a building block of the soluble organic matrix of the shell. A hypothesis for the mode of matrix self-association is presented. Mussels were obtained from coastal New Hampshire waters or from Great Eastern Mussel aquaculture (Tenants Harbor, ME). Live animals were kept on ice for <1 h during extrapallial fluid extraction. The shell cavity was accessed by slicing the adductor muscle with a scalpel. With the shell cavity open, excess water was removed by tilting the animal upright and letting it drain onto a paper towel. The needle of a 500-μl gas-tight syringe was placed bevel down on the shell margin and slid beneath the mantle at the pallial line into the extrapallial space for EP fluid extraction. Care was taken not to disturb the mantle/shell attachment. Once extracted, the EP fluid was placed on ice in a polypropylene vial. To ensure that the EP fluid was not contaminated by blood from the animal, fluid was also extracted directly from the extrapallial space by the careful drilling of a hole through the shell. Identical protein banding patterns on PAGE were observed for fluid obtained by either extraction method. Individual animals yielded an average of 300 μl of fluid; however, variation from practically nothing to in excess of 500 μl was observed. Unless otherwise mentioned, the protein buffer solution used throughout was 20 mm (3-(N-morpholine)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.5, in 0.1 m KCl, and all steps were performed at 4 °C. The buffer was passed through a 1.5- × 25-cm column of Chelex 100 metal ion chelation resin (Sigma) and then filtered/degassed by suction filtration through a 0.45-μm pore Whatman filter. Immediately after extraction, the EP fluid was centrifuged (3500 × g) and the supernatant was retained and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer 85% saturated with ammonium sulfate (Sigma) for at least 4 h using Spectra/Por 6000–8000 molecular weight cut off cellulose dialysis tubing. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 10 min and dissolved in a minimum volume of buffer followed by dialysis against buffer to remove residual (NH4)2SO4. Cation exchange chromatography was performed on a 2- × 50-cm column of Sephadex CM-50 resin (Sigma) using a protein buffer mobile phase and a gravity flow rate of 0.5 ml/min without a salt gradient. Anion exchange chromatography was then performed on three 0.7- × 2.5-cm Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HiTrap Q columns connected in series using a buffer mobile phase with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and a 200-ml, 0.1–0.5 m KCl linear salt gradient for protein elution. Finally, size exclusion chromatography was performed on 1.5- × 57-cm Sepharose 6B-CL resin (Sigma) with a buffer mobile phase and gravity flow rate of 15 ml/h. All chromatography was performed at room temperature with column effluent monitored at 280 nm. Fractions of 5 ml were collected. Electrophoresis was carried out on a Hoefer Mighty Small II electrophoresis unit using electrophoresis grade reagents from Sigma, reagent grade ammonium persulfate from J. T. Baker Chemical, low molecular weight SDS-PAGE markers from Bio-Rad, and ampholines from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Electrophoretic protocols (native PAGE, SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing) using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 protein staining were taken from the Hoefer Scientific Instruments Manual 1992–1993. Glycoprotein-specific gel staining was done by the method of Rauchsen (27Gerard C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 536-537Google Scholar). Gels were 1.5 mm thick, and experiments were conducted using a limiting current of 20 mA/gel. Gel scanning was performed on a Hoefer Scientific GS 300 transmittance/reflectance scanning densitometer interfaced to a MINC-23 computer (Digital Equipment Corp.). Photographs of gels were scanned using a UMAX UC300 color scanner interfaced to a MacIntosh Quadra 700 computer. Adobe Photoshop 3.0 was used for image processing. Protein concentration was estimated by a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard following the method of Bradford (28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Determination/quantitation of carbohydrate moieties was done by the method of Dubois et al. (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39438) Google Scholar) usingd-galactose in buffer to construct 5- to 30-μg standard calibration curves and SDS-PAGE analysis of EP protein before and after digestion with peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F. A value of 14.3% carbohydrate was determined (30Hattan S.J. Trimble R.B. Glycobiol. 1996; 6 (abstr.): 755Google Scholar) and confirmed by mass spectrometry (31Naggar E. Ye S. Chasteen N.D. Reinhold V. Reinhold B. Glycobiology. 2000; 10, (Abstr. 157): 1119Google Scholar). The N-linked glycan has a mass of ∼4000 Da and is composed of hexoses (30Hattan S.J. Trimble R.B.

The protein molecular weight was determined by matrix-assisted, laser desorption ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Perceptive Biosystems, Voyager-Elite biospectrometry workstation. Instrument calibration was achieved using an insulin mass standard. Analysis of the NH4HCO3 lyophilized EP fluid protein sample was performed using an accelerating voltage of 30,000 V, a pressure of 9.50 × 10−8 torr, and a low mass cutoff of 500.0. Amino acid analysis samples were dialyzed against 5.0 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl and then hydrolyzed for 20 h in 6 n HCl, 0.05% mercaptoethanol, 0.02% phenol, at 115 °C. At AAA Laboratory (Mercer Island, WA), amino acid separation and quantitation were performed on a Beckman 7300 analyzer using System Gold software and Beckman buffers following the ion-exchange method of Moore and Stein (32Ozols J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At the University of Michigan laboratory, the analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 420H amino acid analyzer. The sample for N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was prepared by dialysis of purified protein against a 10% (v/v) solution of acetic acid. The analysis was done on an Applied Biosystems Inc., 475A protein sequencer, by the method of automated Edman degradation (33Matsudaira P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman XLA analytical centrifuge equipped with Rayleigh interference optics (34Laue T.M. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 63-89Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted at 20 °C using a four-hole titanium rotor spinning at 40,000 rpm. The sample cells were two-channel, charcoal-filled, and equipped with Epon centerpieces and sapphire windows. The buffer used in all sedimentation velocity analyses was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl; where mentioned, samples were analyzed with the addition of CaCl2 to the buffer solution. Protein concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 mg/ml were employed to investigate possible mass action effects in the centrifugation data. The method of Stafford (35Stafford III, W.F. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 359-393Google Scholar) was used to obtain sedimentation coefficient distributions (g(s*)) from the time derivative of the concentration distributions (dc/dt), and sedimentation and diffusion coefficients were calculated from the line widths and positions of Gaussian fits to the g(s*)versus s data (35Stafford III, W.F.

The partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid (vide infra) composition of the protein using the software program Sednterp (36Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L.

Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were done on a JASCO J700 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter calibrated using a 0.06% (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid solution (Aldrich). CD spectra of EP fluid protein (0.65 mg/ml) in buffer with and without 10 mm Ca2+, along with matching buffers, were obtained using a 0.05-mm sample cell. Instrument optics and sample chamber were continually flushed with 30 liters/min of dry N2 gas. The instrument settings were; scan range, 180–260 nm; scan rate, 1 nm/min; wavelength step, 0.5 nm; sensitivity, 5 millidegrees; response time, 16 s. Protein secondary structural analysis of the CD spectra (182–260 nm) was done using the Self-Consistent Method (SELCON) program of Sreerama and Woody (37Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) using the fitting constraints recommended by the authors. Protein and carbohydrate concentrations in untreated EP fluid samples were determined for nine batches of fluid yielding an average of 4.3 ± 1.8 mg/ml for protein and 3.8 ± 1.2 mg/ml for carbohydrate. The distribution of fluid proteins in samples taken from both batch extracts and individual animals was studied by native and SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 A shows the consistent distribution of at least six protein bands with the persistent appearance of a major protein band (marked by anarrow in lanes 1–6, Fig. 1 A), corresponding to 56 ± 15% (n = 3) of the total fluid protein based on the integrated band intensity. This major protein fraction, hereafter designated the EP protein, was the component targeted for purification. Chromatographically separated protein fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”) were analyzed by electrophoresis as a means of tracking the protein of interest during purification. Fig. 1 B shows a 15% native PAGE gel loaded with duplicate samples of protein, at the various stages of purification, and a duplicate loading of protein standards. (A 15% acrylamide gel is shown in Fig. 1 B, where diffusion of the EP glycoprotein is minimized; however, similar band patterns are seen in 7 and 10% gels.) Upon completion of electrophoresis, the gel was sliced in half and one half (lanes 6–10) was stained for protein, while the other half (lanes 1–5) was stained specifically for glycoprotein. The right half of the gel in Fig. 1 B demonstrates the effective purification of the major EP protein to a single band (lane 7), and the left half (lanes 1–4) shows that the major EP protein stains positive for glycoprotein. Of the standard proteins used (lanes 5 and6), only transferrin, which is ∼5% by weight carbohydrate, stained in both gel halves. The purified EP protein was determined to be 14.3% carbohydrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 20-amino acid sequence of the N terminus of the EP protein reveals an interesting repeat pattern of histidine and aspartate residues,viz.: NPVDDHHDDHHDAPIVEHHD∼. The sequence was entered into several protein data bases, 2Data bases of NCBI, Rutgers Protein Data Bank, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, Genpept, GenBank™, and Kabat Sequences. none of which produced a protein match containing a compatible sequence. Mass fragments of 943.8, 1056.9, 1093.8, 1112.2, 1150.1, 1241.3, 1299.6, 1337.7, 1429.8, 1584.0, 1700.0, 1731.4, 1805.8, 1984.6, 2131.2, 2164.7, 2201.9, 2260.2, 2685.2, and 3047.3 were produced by trypsin digestion. The averaged results from the amino acid analyses of three separate EP protein purifications are shown in TableI. The data are presented as percent molar composition for each residue, as well as in residues/protein based on a protein molecular weight of 28,340 (vide infra) containing 14.3% carbohydrate. Table I shows that EP protein contains a significant amount of acidic (Asx, Glx) residues. This finding is consistent with of those of shell-soluble organic matrix protein fractions (18Weiner S.

Open table in a new tab Results from isoelectric focusing showed the EP protein to be acidic with at least six distinguishable isoforms, which are focused as a tight stack of bands with isoelectric point (pI) values ranging from 4.08 to 4.67 with a median pI value of 4.43. Although the source of this charge heterogeneity is not known, such occurrences are common for glycoproteins (41Beeley J.G. Glycoprotein and Proteoglycan Techniques (Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Vol. 16). Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1985: 24-25Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the time-of-flight mass spectrum of an EP protein sample. The peak centered at 28,340 mass units is the ionized EP protein (M/1+). The peak centered at 14,200 mass units is the doubly ionized protein species (M/2+). The peak breadth indicates microheterogeneity with minor peaks at 27,000, 27,840, and 28,960 Da, in addition to the major 28,340-Da peak. The observation of heterogeneity in the extent of glycosylation is common for glycoproteins (41Beeley J.G. Glycoprotein and Proteoglycan Techniques (Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Vol. 16). Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1985: 24-25Google Scholar), and the addition or deletion of monosaccharide moieties may account for the observed mass heterogeneity of the EP protein. The same protein electrophoretic migration was observed on 15% SDS-PAGE under either reducing or nonreducing conditions (data not shown), indicating a single type of subunit and lack of intersubunit disulfide bonds. 3An apparent molecular weight of 37,300 ± 1,800 was obtained from SDS-PAGE using the protein standards: lysozyme (14,400), trypsin inhibitor (21,500), carbonic anhydrase (31,000), ovalbumin (45,000), and serum albumin (66,200). Because glycans do not bind SDS, erroneously high glycoprotein molecular weights are commonly observed by SDS-PAGE (41Beeley J.G. Glycoprotein and Proteoglycan Techniques (Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Vol. 16). Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1985: 24-25Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows an overlay of a size exclusion chromatogram of purified EP protein with that of a set of protein standards. A plot of the log molecular weight versus the size exclusion elution coefficient K av is shown in the Fig. 3 (inset) from which a molecular weight of 52,600 ± 1100 (n = 8) is estimated for the native protein. The resultant molecular weight is approximately double the value from mass spectrometry, a result suggesting that the EP protein in its native state is a homodimer of the 28,350-Da subunits. To confirm this finding, sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements were also carried out on the native protein. Fig.4 shows the sedimentation distribution coefficient, g(s), versus the apparent sedimentation coefficient, s, for the protein in Tris buffer. Two components are present, a major species ats ≈ 4.7 and a minor one near s ≈ 10.5 that we ascribe to an assembly of the s ≈ 4.7 species (vide infra). The minor species typically represented only 7–20% of the total, depending on the protein preparation. Lack of mass action effects over a 16-fold concentration range of protein indicated that equilibration between the major and minor species is slow during the 24-h time period between dilution of the sample and acquisition of the centrifugation data. That both species are derived from a single type of subunit is evidenced by the presence of a single band in SDS-PAGE over a wide range of sample loadings on the gel. A sedimentation coefficient of 4.7 is incompatible with a protein ofM r ≈ 28,000. Accordingly, the apparent molecular weight of the 4.7-s component was determined. Gaussian curve fitting of the data (e.g. Fig. 4) for protein concentrations ranging from 0.055 to 0.9 mg/ml produced a diffusion coefficients for the s = 4.7 species of D = 7.3 × 10−11 to 8.1 × 10−11m2/s. Apparent molecular weights were calculated from the Svedberg equation using the apparent diffusion coefficients,D, at each protein concentration and the partial specific volume v = 0.7089 cm3/g for the protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 4, inset), the molecular weights determined from the 4.7-s peak were ∼52,000. Although there appears to be a very slight decrease in the apparent molecular weight with decreasing concentration, the uncertainties in the fitting of the lower concentration data preclude interpretation of this observation. Thus, the molecular weights determined in this manner agree with the value from size exclusion chromatography and are in accord with the protein being a dimer in its native state. (A similar determination of the molecular weight of the s ≈ 10.5 component by sedimentation velocity was not possible due to variability in the experimental value of D obtained from curve fitting of the small peak of this minor species.) Sedimentation equilibrium experiments produced Z average apparent molecular weights that were observed to decrease with increasing rotor speed due to the presence of the two nonequilibrating species."

To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation by Dlx5, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and isolated a novel protein, Dlxin-1, that binds Dlx5 and regulates its transcriptional function. Dlxin-1 cDNA encodes a 775-amino acid protein that has a partial homology with necdin at the C terminus and 25 repeats of hexapeptides (WQX PXX) in the middle region. Dlxin-1 mRNA is expressed in various adult tissues, but not the spleen, and also in osteoblastic and chondrogenic cell lines. During embryogenesis, a strong signal for Dlxin-1 mRNA was found in cell layers surrounding cartilaginous elements in bone rudiment during digit formation. Dlxin-1 binds not only Dlx5 but also Dlx7 and Msx2 and forms homomultimers in vivo. Transfection and reporter gene assays indicate that Dlxin-1 activates the transcriptional function of Dlx5. Therefore, Dlxin-1 may act as a regulator of the function of Dlx family members in bone formation.

Umezawa (Keio University, Japan) and A. Fukamizu (University of Tsukuba, Japan), respectively. A yeast strain, Y153, was a gift from Dr. S. Kato (University of Tokyo). The pBIND vector was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). Mouse Dlx5 and Msx2 cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the N-terminal domains (amino acids 2–132 for Dlx5 and 2–136 for Msx2) were inserted into pBIND, generating pBIND-Dlx5ΔC and pBIND-Msx2ΔC, respectively. For construction of the bait plasmid (pGBT- Dlx5ΔC), the Dlx5ΔC cDNA fragment was inserted into pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). pcDNA-FLAG was constructed in pcDNA3 (Hin dIII/Xho I), with a DNA fragment encoding the single FLAG epitope (5′-AAG CTT GCC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAT GAT GAC GAC AAA CTC GAG-3′) after the initiation codon (ATG) with the Kozak leader sequence, giving rise to the N-terminal FLAG tag attachment vector. Mouse Dlx3, Dlx7, Dlx5, and Msx2 cDNAs were inserted into pcDNA-FLAG, generating pFDlx3, pFDlx7, pFDlx5, and pFMsx2, respectively. Nucleotide sequences of all polymerase chain reaction products reported here were verified by sequencing. pGL3-basic, pGL3-control, and pGL3-promoter were purchased from Promega.

Briefly, oligonucleotides corresponding to the Dlx-responsive element (DlxRE) and a sequence mutated in the core binding region (TAAT to TACG; Dlxm) were designed, and the complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated. The concatemerized DNA of five repeats was purified and introduced into theBgl II site on the pGL3-promoter vector, generating pDlxRE-luc and pDlxm-luc.

Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Matchmaker, CLONTECH). Briefly, a yeast strain, Y153, was cotransformed with pGBT-Dlx5ΔC and the mouse embryo (embryonic day 11) cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). The transformants were first selected for HIS3 gene transactivation on the basis of growth in the absence of Trp, Leu, and His and in the presence of 60 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Colonies grown on the selection media were then selected for lacZ gene transactivation on the basis of β-galactosidase activity in the filter assay. pLAM5′ encoding GAL4 DNA-binding domain/human lamin C fusion protein was used as a negative control. Prey plasmids were recovered from β-galactosidase-positive colonies, and sequence analysis was performed with ABI PRISMTM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) or FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). pFDlx5 or pcDNA3 was introduced into P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, and stable transfectants were selected by the addition of Geneticin (400 μg/ml; Life Technologies). Colonies were taken and expanded to examine the expression of FLAG-tagged Dlx5 protein. A Dlx5-expressing P19 cell line (P19Dlx5) and a mock-transfected line (P19neo) were used in this study. There was no difference in proliferative activity and morphology between P19Dlx5 and P19neo. The plasmids, pBIND and pG5luc, and the dual luciferase assay system were purchased from Promega. Transfected cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities (Lumat LB 9507, EG & G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Each assay was carried out at least in triplicate. Northern blotting was carried out using a 0.7-kilobase pair fragment of mouse Dlxin-1 cDNA on mouse MTN and Embryo set blot (CLONTECH). Total RNA isolated from mouse long bones, bone marrow cells in long bones, and calvaria was denatured by glyoxal/Me2SO and electrophoresed in agarose gels. The digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized using T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega) with a nucleotide mix containing digoxigenin-labeled CTP (Roche Diagnostics). Hybrid-ready tissue slides were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI), and in situ hybridization was performed as reported previously (21Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α, induced by 0.25 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [35S]Methionine-labeled Dlx5 and Msx2 proteins were generated using an in vitro transcription/translation system (TNT; Promega). Aliquots were incubated with GST- or GST-Dlxin1-conjugated glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 138 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 5% bovine serum albumin). 35S-Labeled Dlx5 or Msx2 was synthesized as above and incubated with GST or GST-Dlxin1 deletion mutant proteins in the same binding buffer, followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The HA epitope-tagged Dlxin-1 expression vector (pHA-Dlxin1) and the FLAG epitope-tagged expression vectors (pFDlx3, pFDlx5, pFDlx7, pFMsx2, pF-Dlxin1) were cotransfected transiently into COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies). At 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Diagnostics). Precleared cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) following adsorption to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody was used, with FLAG peptide as a competitor (Sigma). Bound proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA 3F10 antibody and visibilized by ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To evaluate the transcriptional activity of Dlx5, we constructed a reporter gene assay system. The reporter construct, DlxRE, which consists of Dlx5-responsive elements and basal promoter with the luciferase gene (Fig.1 A), was introduced into Dlx5-expressing (P19Dlx5) or mock-transfected P19 cells (P19neo). As shown in Fig. 1 B, a high activity of DlxRE-driven reporter was observed in P19Dlx5 cells, but not in P19neo cells. When a core sequence of DlxRE was mutated (Dlxm), reporter activity was not detected in either P19neo or P19Dlx5 cells. These results suggest that Dlx5 has a transcriptional activation function in P19 cells. The N-terminal domain of Dlx5 has similarities to those of Dlx2, Msx1, and Msx2 (4Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To characterize the function of this shared domain, the N-terminal domain of Dlx5 (Dlx5ΔC) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and the transcriptional function was evaluated by reporter gene assay in 293 cells. Although GAL4 DNA-binding domain itself did not activate the transcription, the fusion construct (pBIND-Dlx5ΔC) stimulated the transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the Msx2 fusion construct (pBIND-Msx2ΔC) did not activate, but rather suppressed, transcription (data not shown). These results suggest that the N-terminal domain of Dlx5 contains a transcriptional activation domain. In an attempt to search for a protein(s) that associates with the N-terminal domain of Dlx5 and regulates its function, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed. From screening of the mouse embryo (embryonic day 11) cDNA library, seven independent and overlapping clones were obtained on the basis of selection for histidine requirement for growth and lacZ expression (Fig.2 A). We found, by BLAST search (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar), that several expressed sequence tag sequences were identical with the isolated clones, and the 5′-nucleotide sequence was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. As shown in Fig.2 B, the amino acid sequence predicted from the full-length cDNA reveals a novel protein of 775 amino acids, and the predicted molecular mass of the protein is 85.7 kDa. We propose that the novel protein be called Dlxin-1, for Dlxinteraction. Dlxin-1 has a partial similarity to necdin (23Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and MAGEs at the C-terminal region, as shown in Fig.3 A. A putative human counterpart of mouse Dlxin-1 has been reported as MAGE-D1 (18Pold M. Zhou J. Chen G.L. Hall J.M. Vescio R.A. Berenson J.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the data base, SNERG-1 (GenBankTM accession numberAF274043) from rat testis showed a high homology (96%) to mouse Dlxin-1, suggesting that SNERG-1 is a rat orthologue of mouse Dlxin-1 (Fig. 3 B). There is no significant hydrophobic stretch corresponding to a signal sequence or transmembrane domain, suggesting that Dlxin-1 is an intracellular protein. Notably, 25 hexapeptide repeats in tandem were found in the middle part of the protein, with a consensus sequence of WQX PXX (Fig.3 C). The shortest clone (clone 16) isolated in the two-hybrid screening encodes 18 out of the 25 repeats, and the sequence was included in all of the overlapping clones, suggesting that the WQX PXX repeat region represents the binding site of the N-terminal domain of Dlx5 (Fig. 2 A). No significant homology to any protein sequences was found in the N-terminal part of Dlxin-1 by searching data bases.Figure 3Alignment of Dlxin-1 related proteins and the WQX PXX repeat.

Most adult mouse tissues were found to express a 3.0-kilobase pair transcript of Dlxin-1, except for the spleen (Fig.4 A). As Dlx5 has been reported to be expressed predominantly in skeletal elements (1Simeone A. Acampora D. Pannese M. D'Esposito M. Stornaiuolo A. Gulisanp M. Mallamaci A. Kastury K. Druck T. Huebner K.

Development. 1999; 126: 3831-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Dlxin-1 mRNA was detected in bone, but not in bone marrow, suggesting that Dlxin-1 is expressed in adherent cells rather than hematopoietic cells in bone. The Dlxin-1 mRNA was expressed at embryonic stages (embryonic days 7–17 (ED 7–17)) in mouse development (Fig.4 A). Dlxin-1 was also widely expressed in various human and mouse cell lines, including osteoblastic (KUSA/A1 and MC3T3-E1) and chondrogenic (ATDC5) cells (data not shown). Next, we performed in situ hybridization to localize the expression of the Dlxin-1 gene in embryonic and adult tissues. The expression detected by the antisense probe for Dlxin-1 mRNA was ubiquitous in tissues on mouse embryo days 13 and 15 (not shown). Notably, the strongest signal was detected in the cell layers surrounding cartilaginous elements in bone rudiment during embryonic digit formation (Fig. 4 B). Although the clones for Dlxin-1 were isolated by interaction trap with Dlx5, the protein interaction remained to be confirmed in vitro and in mammalian cells. In the GST pull-down assay, in vitro translated Dlx5 coprecipitated with GST-Dlxin-1, indicating that Dlxin-1 associates with Dlx5 in vitro, probably via direct binding (data not shown). Interestingly, Msx2, another member of the Dlx/Msx homeodomain protein family, also bound to Dlxin-1 (data not shown). Next, the association of Dlx5 with Dlxin-1 was determined in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, FLAG-tagged Dlx5 protein coprecipitated with HA-tagged Dlxin-1. Dlx7, Msx2, and FLAG-tagged Dlxin-1 also coprecipitated with HA-tagged Dlxin-1. These results indicate that Dlxin-1 associates not only with Dlx5 but also with Dlx7 and Msx2 and forms multimers in vivo. To determine whether and how the binding of Dlxin-1 to Dlx5 modulates the transcriptional activity of Dlx5, we employed a GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation assay in HT1080 cells, which express a low level of Dlxin-1 mRNA. As shown in Fig.6, Dlxin-1 stimulated the reporter activity through GAL4-Dlx5ΔC, but not GAL4, dose-dependently, suggesting that Dlxin-1 augments the transcription function of the N-terminal domain of Dlx5. At higher a dose of Dlxin-1, the stimulation was attenuated, but the basal activity by Dlx5ΔC remained, raising the possibility that the ratio between the amounts of the Dlxin-1 and Dlx5 complexes is important in transcriptional regulation. Finally, to test the hypothesis that Dlxin-1 stimulates Dlx5-dependent transcription, a reporter gene assay was carried out using a Dlx5/Dlx5-responsive element reporter system. The Dlx5-binding domain of Dlxin-1 (Dlxin-DlxBD, clone 16, in Fig. 7 A) was transfected into P19Dlx5 cells, which express a relatively high level of Dlxin-1 mRNA, and reporter activity was then measured. The reporter activity was reduced to the basal level by the addition of Dlxin-DlxBD, whereas cotransfection of full-length Dlxin-1 (Dlxin-FL) showed little effect (Fig. 7 B). It is suggested that Dlxin-1 is required for maximal Dlx5-dependent transcriptional activation in P19 cells. In this paper, we describe the identification of a novel Dlx5-binding protein, named Dlxin-1. When compared with MAGE-D1, a human orthologue of Dlxin-1, the N-terminal section, flanking the WQX PXX repeats, is longer in mouse Dlxin-1, raising the possibility that the initiation codon of mouse Dlxin-1 is located downstream of the predicted most 5′ ATG codon in the reading frame. However, a purified polyclonal antibody raised against GST-Dlxin1-C reacted with endogenous 90-kDa proteins (data not shown) corresponding to the molecular mass of the transfected, epitope-tagged Dlxin-1. Although there remains the possibility that Dlxin-1 is subjected to some post-translational modification, we predict the open reading frame to code for 775 amino acids. Dlxin-1 shows similarities to MAGE/necdin family proteins. Necdin, one of the most characterized proteins in the family, is a postmitotic neuron-specific nuclear protein (23Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Necdin associates with E2F1 and mimics the function of Rb protein, thereby regulating cell cycle progression (24Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We could not detect any Rb-like activity or binding to E2F1 of Dlxin-1 (data not shown). We isolated a RING finger protein that binds to the necdin homology domain of Dlxin-1. 2A. Sasaki and K. Watanabe, unpublished data. It is therefore suggested that this domain, structurally similar to necdin, is involved in protein-protein interaction. Translated regions of MAGE/necdin family proteins are encoded by a single exon (17De Plaen E. Arden K. Traversari C. Gaforio J.J. Szikora J.P. De Smet C. Brasseur F. van der Bruggen P. Lethe B. Lurquin C. Brasseur R. Chomez P. De Backer O. Cavenee W. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), whereas the coding sequence of the MAGE/necdin homologous domain is split into at least three exons in the mouse Dlxin-1 gene,2 which are unique to the Dlxin-1 gene among known MAGE/necdin family members. Thus, Dlxin-1 gene may be evolutionarily distant from other MAGE/necdin family proteins. The WQX PXX repeats in the middle of Dlxin-1 molecule are unique to this molecule and show no homology with any sequence in the data base, other than MAGE-D1 and SNERG-1, human and rat orthologues of Dlxin-1, respectively. Although some variations were observed, the repeats are highly conserved between species. Interestingly, the domain for binding to the Dlx/Msx proteins is mapped in the tandem repeats. It has been shown that the Dlx and Msx homeodomain proteins form homo- or heterodimers through their homeodomain, thereby regulating each other's functions. The N-terminal domain of Dlx5, which shares a weak homology with other Dlx/Msx family proteins, is a primary binding site for Dlxin-1, because the domain, but not the homeodomain, was used for the bait in isolating Dlxin-1 by the two-hybrid screening. Tryptophan is included in many protein motifs for molecular recognition, like the WW domain and WD40 repeat proteins (26Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 27Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 28Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that Dlxin-1 binds to multiple proteins via the WQX PXX repeats, due to the presence of multiple tryptophan residues in tandem. In light of the recent identification of Miz1 (29Wu L. Wu H. Ma L. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and MINT (30Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that bind to Msx2 via proline-rich domains, it is also possible that proline residues are involved in the interaction between Dlxin-1 and Msx2 and/or Dlx homeodomain proteins. Dlxin-1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and also during embryonic development, with some variation in the expression level depending on cell or tissue types. In hematopoietic tissues, such as spleen and bone marrow, little expression was detected, suggesting that Dlxin-1 expression is more pronounced in adherent cells. Dlx5 is predominantly expressed in skeletal elements and osteoblasts (1Simeone A. Acampora D. Pannese M. D'Esposito M. Stornaiuolo A. Gulisanp M. Mallamaci A. Kastury K. Druck T. Huebner K. Boncinelli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2250-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 14Acampora D. Merlo G.R. Paleari L. Zerega B. Postiglione M.P. Mantero S. Bober E.

Development. 1999; 126: 3831-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which Dlxin-1 is also expressed. It is suggested that Dlxin-1 may play a role in Dlx5-mediated osteoblastic function and that Dlxin-1 associates not only with Dlx5 but also other proteins, to regulate the function in tissues and cells other than bones. Notably, it has been reported that a deletion in the dlx5/dlx6 locus causes the split hand/split foot malformation in humans (31Crackower M.A. Scherer S.W. Rommens J.M. Hui C.C. Poorkaj P. Soder S. Cobben J.M. Hudgins L. Evans J.P. Tsui L.-C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has also been described that digit abnormality is observed in mice that are deficient in bothmsx1 and msx2 genes. Considering the strong expression of Dlxin-1 in the digit (Fig. 4 B), tissues surrounding chondrocytes and the chondrocytes, it is suggested that Dlxin-1 may be involved in digit formation activity in collaboration with Dlx/Msx homeodomain proteins. It has been reported that the expression of Dlx5 mRNA, as well as Msx2, is up-regulated by bone morphogenetic protein. However, the expression level of the Dlxin-1 gene did not significantly change following treatment with bone morphogenetic protein 4 or transforming growth factor β in MC3T3-E1 and ST2 cells, while treatment of P19 cells with forskolin slightly decreased the expression of Dlxin-1 mRNA (data not shown). It is speculated that the expression of Dlxin-1 may be regulated during cell differentiation rather than being constitutive. It has been reported that Dlx5 is a positive regulator of mouse osteocalcin gene and osteoblastic functions (4Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 5Miyama K. Yamada G. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Miyado K. Sakai M. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Dev.

Lichtler A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16422-16429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Dlx5 bears an intrinsic transcription activation domain. It has recently been reported, however, that expression of the osteocalcin gene was greatly increased in the osteoblasts of dlx5 knockout mice, suggesting that Dlx5 is a negative regulator of osteocalcin gene expression in vivo. There are some possibilities that may explain this apparent inconsistency. First, the dose of Dlx5 may be critical for transcriptional regulation. The homeodomain proteins form dimers to act on DNA (4Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Liu et al. (32Liu Y.H. Tang Z. Kundu R.K. Wu L. Luo W. Zhu D. Sangiorgi F. Snead M.L. Maxon Jr., R.E. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the dosage of Msx2 affects the number of proliferative osteoblasts. In this study, we showed that Dlxin-1 activates Dlx5-dependent transcription in a dose-related manner. Thus, not only the ratio between Msx and Dlx family proteins, but also the ratio between the homeodomain proteins and Dlxin-1 may be important in transcriptional regulation. Second, Dlx5 has two modes of transcriptional function, one through direct binding to DNA and the other by protein-protein interaction without binding to DNA. Newberry et al. (33Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggested that Dlx5 antagonizes the transcriptional repression by Msx2 to maintain the basal promoter activity (33Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, Dlx5 may be involved in the basal activity of the osteocalcin promoter and function as a potential inhibitor for a transcription factor(s) that stimulates the expression of the osteocalcin gene in a later phase of osteoblastic differentiation. Third, the function may be regulated by alternative form(s). It has been reported that multiple Dlx5 transcripts generated by alternative splicing exist in mouse brain (34Yang L. Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8322-8330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found a splice variant form of Dlx5, δDlx5, in mouse osteoblast cell lines. 3Y. Masuda, A. Sasaki, and K. Watanabe, unpublished data. This variant form codes for only the N-terminal domain of Dlx5 and lacks both the homeodomain and the C-terminal region. Although the physiological function of δDlx5 is not known at the present time, there is the possibility that the splice variant interferes with binding between Dlx5 and Dlxin-1. Our results show that Dlxin-1 binds to Msx2 more strongly than to Dlx5 and other Dlx family proteins. It could be partially explained by the lower expression of Dlx5, in comparison with that of Msx2. Although a weak similarity has been suggested to exist between the N-terminal regions of Msx and Dlx family proteins (4Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), it is surprising that most Dlx/Msx family proteins show binding to Dlxin-1. Thus, Dlxin-1 may be a common regulator for transcriptional function, mediated by the Dlx/Msx homeodomain proteins. We failed to detect any transactivation of Dlxin-1 itself using GAL4-mediated transcriptional assays (data not shown). The overexpression of Dlxin-1 reduced the maximal transcriptional activation without affecting the basal level of activation in Dlx5ΔC- or Dlx5-dependent transcription (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that Dlxin-1 may bridge or stabilize the complex of Dlx5 and coactivators rather than being directly involved in transcriptional activation of Dlx5. However, it remains to be determined whether Dlxin-1 has any histone acetylase or chromatin-remodeling activities. We thank Drs. A. Umezawa (Keio University), A.

Ectopic expression of BIK induces apoptosis in variety of mammalian cells. BIK complexes with various anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins such as adenovirus E1B-19K and BCL-2 via the BH3 domain. However, the heterodimerization activity of BIK alone is insufficient for its apoptotic activity. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation regulates the functional activity of both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family. Here, we have examined phosphorylation of BIK and its effect on the apoptotic activity of BIK. We show that BIK exists as a phosphoprotein and is phosphorylated at residues 33 (threonine) and 35 (serine). Mutation of the phosphorylation sites, in which the Thr and Ser residues were changed to alanine residues, reduced the apoptotic activity of BIK without significantly affecting its ability to heterodimerize with BCL-2. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of BIK is required for eliciting efficient apoptotic activity. Partial purification of the protein kinase from HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts suggest that BIK may be phosphorylated by a casein kinase II-related enzyme.

This process is essential for the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis. Cell death or survival is dependent on the receipt of continuous signals from the extracellular environment. These signals are then transduced through the cell surface to intracellular molecules that regulate apoptotic cell death. A number of such regulators have been identified. Among them, the BCL-2 family proteins play an important role in both induction and suppression of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic members include the cellular proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, BFL1, and BCL-w and viral proteins such as Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B-19K proteins. These cellular and viral proteins suppress apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli. Certain pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, despite sharing extensive homology with BCL-2, induce apoptosis when overexpressed. Most other pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD, BID, BIK, BIM, BNIP3, BNIP1, HRK, and NOXA share only a single domain (BH3)1 with BCL-2 and are hence designated “BH3-alone” proteins; the human BIK protein is the founding member of this family. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a BH3-alone protein Egl-1 has been shown to be essential for developmentally programmed death of somatic cells (2Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the BCL-2 family of proteins is the ability of the pro-apoptotic members to heterodimerize with the anti-apoptotic members (reviewed in Ref. 1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). This suggests that one of the mechanisms by which anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family suppress apoptosis may be through heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic members. However, at least in the case of BIK, heterodimerization with anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL is insufficient for induction of apoptosis (3Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24494-24498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors may also influence the apoptotic activity of BIK. Certain apoptotic stimuli appear to modulate the expression and activity of the BCL-2 family proteins at the level of transcription as well as by post-translational modifications. For example, expression of the BH3-alone pro-apoptotic gene Noxa is activated during p53-mediated apoptosis (4Odo E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T.

Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) has been shown to be essential for cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptosis in hemopoietic cells (7Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). BIM is normally sequestered to the microtubules in an inactive form and is released during apoptosis (8Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). During apoptosis mediated by the death receptors such as CD95, the BH3-alone protein BID is proteolytically cleaved by caspase-8 to a pro-apoptotic form (tBID) from an inactive form (9Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 10Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation also play important roles in regulating the activity of both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. BCL-2 contains several potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites within the “variable region,” which is located between the BH3 and BH4 domains. Phosphorylation of a serine residue (Ser-70) within this region of BCL-2 has been shown to be required for its full anti-apoptotic activity (11Ito T. Deng X. Boyd C. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Deletion of the variable region of BCL-2 has been shown to relieve a novel proliferation restraining activity of BCL-2 (12Uhlman E.J. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2506-2509PubMed Google Scholar). Both BCL-2 and BCL-xL have been shown to be phosphorylated in cells following treatment with microtubule disrupting agents (13Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, it can be concluded that the activities of BCL-2 and BCL-xL can be influenced by phosphorylation. Similarly, phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD on Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155, following interleukin-3 treatment, has been shown to prevent its heterodimerization with BCL-2 and BCL-xL, thus rendering it inactive (14Zha J.

Several protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the BCL-2 family members. The pro-apoptotic protein BAD is a target for phosphorylation by the survival promoting protein kinase Akt (19Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial protein kinase A (15Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of non-BCL-2 members also modulates apoptosis. Phosphorylation of pro-caspase 9 by Akt appears to inhibit activation of this caspase by proteolysis (20Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salveson G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar). Exposure to DNA damaging agents that leads to p53-mediated apoptosis also induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-392 by casein kinase II (CKII) (21Blaydes J.P. Hupp T.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this article, we report that the pro-apoptotic protein BIK is a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation is required for the full apoptotic activity of BIK. The HA-tagged BIK expression plasmid (pcDNA3HA-BIK) has been described (22Boyd J.M. Gallo G. Elangovan B. Houghton B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden C. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pET21b-BIK and mutant BIK were constructed by cloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified BIK cDNA encoding aa 1–134 in expression vector pET21b (Novagen) in frame with the His6 tag at the C terminus. All BIK mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction according to a method described by Taylor et al. (23Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). His-tagged wt and mutant BIK proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified over Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen). One liter of bacterial culture was centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40). The cell suspension was sonicated four times for 1 min each. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with sonication buffer without Nonidet P-40 to adjust the Nonidet P-40 concentration to 0.5%. The extracts were loaded onto the Ni2+-NTA columns equilibrated with sonication buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m imidazole. The wt and mutant (T33A/S35A) BIK proteins were expressed in BSC40 cells using vaccinia/T7 RNA polymerase vector system (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-based plasmids expressing either HA-tagged wt or mutant (T33A/S35A) BIK and infected with 10 pfu/cell vaccinia virus vTF7–3. The cells were labeled either in phosphate-free DMEM with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or in methionine-free DMEM with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. Eighteen to 20 h after infection, cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40 with the protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Purified wt BIK (1–134 amino acids) or mutant BIK (T33A/S35A) proteins were phosphorylated in vitro in 40 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP by 5 μl of crude HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract or partially purified HeLa cell extract. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min following removal of unincorporated 32P by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the BIK protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography. Recombinant BIK (aa 1–134) was phosphorylated in vitro using HeLa cell extract (pooled SP-Sepharose fractions). The phosphorylated protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel slice containing phosphorylated BIK was excised and washed sequentially with 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% methanol, and 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.8). The protein was digested with 100 μg of tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin in 50 mmNH4HCO3 for 24 h at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 3 h under vacuum. Nonradioactive phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were added to the sample, which were together applied onto a TLC plate and separated by electrophoresis at 1000 V for 3 h with pH 1.9 buffer (25Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The locations of phosphoamino acids were determined by ninhydrin staining and autoradiography. HeLa cells in 12-well (105 cells/well) plates were transfected with 0.5–3.0 μg of HA epitope-tagged wt BIK or mutant BIK (T33A/S35A) expressed from the pcDNA3 vector, along with 0.1–0.6 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMV-lacZ by the calcium phosphate method. The cells were fixed at 8–10 h after transfection and stained with X-gal. Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. After washing the cells twice with PBS for 5 min, they were stained with 2 ml of staining solution (2 mm MgCl2 + 5 mm potassium ferricyanate + 5 mm potassium ferrocyanate + 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS) at 37 °C overnight. The stained cells were microscopically examined and counted. Blue color cells () were scored as round (apoptotic) and flat (viable) cells. E1A/T24 ras oncogene cooperative transformation assays were carried out using primary baby rat kidney (BRK) cells prepared from 4-day-old Fisher rats as described earlier (26Subramanian T. Kuppuswamy M. Nasr R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 105-112PubMed Google Scholar). The use of this transformation assay to assess the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins has been described (27Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Wold W.S. M Methods in Molecular Medicine: Adenovirus Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 151-156Google Scholar). HeLa cells (4 × 107) were scraped from tissue culture flasks, washed with PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmDTT, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysed at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded on to a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A and eluted with a continuous salt gradient (0.1–0.5 mNaCl). Two-ml fractions were collected on ice. A 12% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gel containing 500 μg/ml purified BIK (aa 1–134) was prepared. 25 μg of partially purified HeLa cell extract (pooled fractions 5–11) was fractionated (along with prestained Rainbow SDS-PAGE molecular weight markers) by electrophoresis. The proteins were denatured and renaturedin situ to restore functional activity. The gel was immersed in 100 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 20% isopropanol for 1 h to remove SDS. The gels were washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm DTT for 1 h. The proteins were then denatured in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h. The concentration of guanidine hydrochloride was then gradually reduced from 6 m to 0.75m, thus facilitating slow renaturation of proteins. In gel phosphorylation was carried out by incubating the gels in 10 ml of kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 μm ATP) and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. The gels were washed five times with 250 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, dried, and subjected to phosphorimager analysis. When the human BIK protein expressed in mammalian cells was examined by Western blot analysis, it generally migrated as a doublet of 24–25 kDa (Fig.1 A). To determine whether one of the bands may represent the phosphorylated form of BIK, we metabolically labeled BIK either with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture or with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. For this purpose, HA-tagged BIK was expressed in BSC40 cells using the vaccinia virus expression system (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). The proteins were immunoprecipitated with the HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). The BIK protein that was metabolically labeled with 35S migrated as a doublet, as in the case of Western blot analysis. Comparison of BIK labeled with 32P revealed that the slower moving band may be the phosphorylated form of BIK (Fig. 1 B). To determine if endogenous BIK is also phosphorylated, we metabolically labeled SW480 cells either with 35S or 32P, immunoprecipitated BIK with a BIK antibody (N-19) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C). This analysis also revealed that endogenous BIK is phosphorylated. These results indicate that BIK is a phosphoprotein. To characterize the phosphorylation of BIK further, we determined whether BIK could be phosphorylated in vitro. For this purpose, a His-tagged version of BIK that lacks the C-terminal hydrophophic tail (aa 1–134) was expressed in bacteria, purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity matrix, and used as the substrate for phosphorylation. The BIK protein that was incubated with a cytoplasmic extract from HeLa cells was efficiently phosphorylated while BIK incubated without the extract was not phosphorylated (Fig.2 A). The cytoplasmic extract was also further fractionated through a cation exchange (SP-Sepharose) column and the various fractions were assayed to determine their ability to phosphorylate the recombinant BIK-(1–134) protein. These results indicated that fractions 5–11 contained the kinase activity that phosphorylated BIK (Fig. 2 B). To identify the phosphorylated amino acids of BIK, we carried out phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated BIK. For this purpose SP-Sepharose fractions 5–11 were pooled and used to phosphorylate BIK. The phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that Ser and Thr residues were phosphorylated and no detectable phosphorylation of Tyr was observed (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were also observed using in vivo phosphorylated BIK (not shown). To identify the phosphorylation site(s), we performed site-directed mutagenesis by converting all serine, threonine, and tyrosines residues contained within the N-terminal 134-amino acid region of BIK to alanine residues (Table I). The various mutants were tagged with the HA epitope and transiently expressed in 293T cells. The protein extracts were analyzed by Western blot and probed with the HA antibody. All the mutant proteins except mutant S2A/S8A/T15A/Y18A were expressed as stable proteins. The various mutant proteins, except mutant T33A/S35A were expressed as doublets, suggesting that they are not defective in phosphorylation (summarized in Table I). On the other hand, mutant T33A/S35A had only the fast migrating band, suggesting that this mutant may be defective in phosphorylation. To confirm that mutant T33A/S35A is defective in phosphorylation, we performed metabolic labeling of 293T cells transiently transfected with wt BIK or mutant with 32P and35S. Analysis of the proteins labeled with 35S indicated that both wt and mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels, while there was no significant incorporation of 32P in the mutant protein (Fig.3 A, rightmost lane). These results suggest that mutant T33A/S35A is strongly defective in phosphorylation under conditions where the wt BIK protein is phosphorylated efficiently. The T33A/S35A mutation was also found to abolish phosphorylation of purified BIK (aa 1–134) proteinin vitro (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that residues Thr-33 or/and Ser-35 of BIK are required for phosphorylation. To determine which of the two residues constitute the phosphorylation site of BIK, we constructed two different single amino acid substitution mutants of BIK in which either Thr-33 or Ser-35 was mutated to an Ala residue (mutants T33A and S35A). The mutant proteins were metabolically labeled with 32P and 35S and analyzed (Fig. 3 C). Both mutants (T33A and S35A) were found to be defective in phosphorylation, suggesting that both residues are required for phosphorylation of BIK. However, these results do not distinguish between the possibility that both residues may be phosphorylated perhaps in a cooperative manner or only one is phosphorylated and the other residue plays a structural role. Since the phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that both Thr and Ser residues are phosphorylated, it is possible that both Thr-33 and Ser-35 may be target for phosphorylation.Table IBIK mutants and phosphorylationMutantPhosphorylationT26A+T33A/S35A−S2A/S8A/T15A/Y18AUnstableS47A/S54A+S71A+S81A+S87A+S106A/T112A/T113A+S124A/S129A/S132A+Y94A/T97A+Various BIK mutants were analyzed by Western blot. A number of different analyses are summarized in Table I. Mutants that expressed both the slow and fast migrating forms of BIK were considered positive for phosphorylation, and the mutant that expressed only the fast migrating form was considered negative for phosphorylation. Open table in a new tab Various BIK mutants were analyzed by Western blot. A number of different analyses are summarized in Table I. Mutants that expressed both the slow and fast migrating forms of BIK were considered positive for phosphorylation, and the mutant that expressed only the fast migrating form was considered negative for phosphorylation. To investigate the role of phosphorylation on BIK activities, we first determined the apoptotic activities of wt BIK and mutant T33A/S35A in a transient apoptosis assay. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wt BIK or mutant T33A/S35A along with a plasmid that expresses theE. coli lacZ reporter gene. In cells transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA3HA) less than 10% of the cells (that expressed the lacZ gene) exhibited apoptotic features at all DNA concentrations examined (0.5–3.0 μg), whereas, in cells transfected with wt BIK or mutant BIK, apoptosis increased as a function of DNA concentration (Fig. 4 A). In cells transfected with wt BIK, about 30–50% of the transfected cells exhibited apoptosis, depending on the DNA concentration. In cells transfected with the mutant BIK, there was significantly lower cell death at all DNA concentrations, suggesting that the mutation reduces the apoptotic activity of BIK. In addition to the transient apoptosis assay, the effects of wt BIK and the mutant BIK were also examined in a cell survival assay (27Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Wold W.S. M Methods in Molecular Medicine: Adenovirus Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 151-156Google Scholar). This survival assay is based on the principle that coexpression of a pro-apoptotic gene along with the transforming oncogenes (E1A and T24ras) in primary BRK cells reduces the formation of transformed foci. In BRK cells transfected with the transforming oncogenes and wt BIK, formation of transformed colony formation was severely reduced as compared with cells transfected with the oncogenes and the empty vector (Fig. 4 B). In cells transfected with the oncogenes and the mutant, there was consistent increase in the number of foci formation compared with cells expressing wt BIK, suggesting that the mutant induced less efficient cell death. Both the transient apoptosis assay (Fig. 4 A) and the cell survival assay (Fig. 4 B) suggest that phosphorylation of BIK is required for the manifestation of efficient cell death activity. We also examined the effect of phosphorylation of BIK on its ability to heterodimerize with the cellular anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2. For this purpose, 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged wt BIK or mutant (T33A/S35A) BIK or empty vector (pcDNA3-HA) and BCL-2. Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated either with the HA antibody or with the BCL-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using the BCL-2 antibody (Fig.5). This analysis revealed that the phosphorylation-deficient mutant T33A/S35A complexed with BCL-2 at ratios similar to that of wt BIK, suggesting that phosphorylation of BIK at residues Thr-33 and Ser-35 apparently does not significantly influence its affinity for BCL-2. In addition, we have also observed that the T33A/S35A mutant had neither an altered half-life nor an abnormal subcellular localization pattern compared with wt BIK (data not shown). To determine the identity of the protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation of BIK, we analyzed the primary amino acid sequences of BIK for the putative consensus phosphorylation sites for known Ser/Thr protein kinases. Computer-assisted analysis revealed that BIK contains four putative CKII sites and two PKC sites (Fig.6 A). Interestingly, two of the predicted CKII sites (Thr-33 and Ser-35) correspond to the phosphorylation sites determined by mutational analysis of BIK, raising the possibility that CKII may be a candidate kinase for phosphorylation of BIK. It should be noted that mutations of other potential CKII and PKC phosphorylation sites did not affect phosphorylation of BIK (TableI). To gain further insight into the nature of the protein kinase, we determined the size of the kinase(s) present in the HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract (pooled SP-Sepharose fractions 5–11) by the in gel kinase assay using recombinant BIK (aa 1–134) protein as the substrate. This analysis revealed that BIK-(1–134) was phosphorylated by three proteins of about 36, 40, and 44 kDa (Fig. 6 B). It is interesting to note that molecular sizes of two of these proteins (40 and 44 kDa) are similar to the size of the CKII subunits. Western blot analysis indicate that the pooled HeLa cell cytoplasmic fractions contain the 40- and 44-kDa subunits (α and α′) of protein kinase CKII (Fig. 6 C, lane 2). We also determined the effect of purified CKII on phosphorylation of BIK. As shown in Fig. 6 D, wt BIK (aa 1–134) was efficiently phosphorylated by CKII while the T33A/S35A mutant was defective in phosphorylation. These results raise the possibility that CKII may be the candidate kinase for phosphorylation of BIK. We then tested the effect of a CKII inhibitor, DRB, on phosphorylation of BIK-(1–134) by purified CKII and HeLa cell extract. DRB inhibited BIK phosphorylation by CKII in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 E). However, phosphorylation of BIK by HeLa cell extracts (SP-Sepharose fractions 5–11) was not significantly affected by DRB, although the extracts contain CKII (see Fig. 6 C). Taken together, the above result implicate that a kinase related to CKII, but insensitive to DRB, may be the candidate kinase for phosphorylation of BIK. We have demonstrated that the human pro-apoptotic protein BIK is a phosphoprotein and that it is phosphorylated on consensus CKII phosphorylation sites (Thr-33 and/or Ser-35). We have observed that phosphorylation is required for efficient BIK-mediated cell death. This is opposite of the role of phosphorylation on another BH3-alone pro-apoptotic protein BAD. In the case of BAD, survival factors induce phosphorylation via survival-promoting kinases Akt and protein kinase A (19Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar) and negatively influence its apoptotic activity. The precise mechanism by which phosphorylation plays a role in the apoptotic activity of BIK is not known. It has been proposed that BH3 proteins mediate apoptosis primarily by interaction with BCL-2 family anti-apoptosis proteins (see Ref. 28Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In the case of BAD, phosphorylation of a Ser residue within the BH3 domain affects its ability to interact with BCL-2 (17Zhou X.M. Liu Y. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Chittenden T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), which may contribute at least partially toward inactivation of BAD activity. Here, we have observed that the phosphorylation defective mutant of BIK interacts with BCL-2 at levels similar to that of wt BIK, despite its lower apoptotic activity. We have also observed similar results in interaction studies between the phosphorylation-defective mutant (T33A/S35A) and BCL-xL (data not shown). These observations lend support to our earlier observation (3Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24494-24498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that heterodimerization of BIK with cellular anti-apoptosis proteins is alone insufficient for its pro-apoptotic activity. It is possible that phosphorylation of BIK may play role in interaction with other potential cellular targets. In case of pro-apoptotic proteins BAK and BID, the BH3 domain becomes exposed in response to apoptotic stimuli (9Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 10Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). In the case of BID, N-terminal protein processing appears to exposes the BH3 domain. It is possible that phosphorylation of BIK confers certain conformational changes that expose the BH3 domain. Our results suggest that BIK may be a target for phosphorylation by a kinase related to CKII. Although CKII-related kinases have shown to phosphorylate apoptosis modulators such as p53 and c-Myc (33Schuster N. Prowald A. Schneider E. Scheidtmann K.H. Montenarh M.

Luscher B. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 501-511PubMed Google Scholar), BIK would be the first BCL-2 family protein target for CKII. Previously, BIK-induced apoptosis has been shown to be suppressed by expression of the survival-promoting kinase, Akt (37Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (*): 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It appears that the effect of Akt on BIK activity may be indirect as Akt suppresses the activity of a number of other pro-apoptotic stimuli. Recently, it has been reported that Akt may inhibit BAD and BIK-induced apoptosis indirectly by inducing expression of BCL-xL (31Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). BIK is constitutively expressed in several different human tissues and appears to be expressed at elevated levels in skeletal and cardiac muscles (32Verma S. Budarf M.L. Emanuel B.S. Chinnadurai G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible that the activity of BIK may be activated by phosphorylation in response to different apoptotic stimuli in various human tissues. The effect of various apoptotic stimuli on phosphorylation of BIK remains to be investigated."

Globin side chains at the Leu89(F4), His97(FG3), Ile99(FG5), and Leu104(G5) positions on the proximal side of the heme pocket strongly influence heme affinity. The roles of these amino acids in preventing heme loss have been examined by determining high resolution structures of 14 different mutants at these positions using x-ray crystallography. Leu89 and His97 are important surface amino acids that interact either sterically or electrostatically with the edges of the porphyrin ring. Ile99 and Leu104 are located in the interior region of the proximal pocket beneath ring C of the heme prosthetic group. The apolar amino acids Leu89, Ile99, and Leu104 “waterproof” the heme pocket by forming a barrier to solvent penetration, minimizing the size of the proximal cavity, and maintaining a hydrophobic environment. Substitutions with smaller or polar side chains at these positions result in exposure of the heme to solvent, the appearance of crystallographically defined water molecules in or near the proximal pocket, and large increases in the rate of hemin loss.

In myoglobin, the heme pocket is surrounded by four of the eight globin helices. The B, C, and E helices form the top and sides of the porphyrin binding site, and the F helix forms the bottom (as oriented in Fig.1). Heme binding causes the globin to form a more compact structure with an approximately 20% increase in helicity (1Griko Y.V. Privalov P.L. Venyaminov S.Y. Kutyshenko V.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Three edges of the porphyrin are buried in the protein interior and stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with apolar side chains that line the heme pocket (2Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11310-11318Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 3Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S.

The fourth edge contains the solvent-exposed heme propionates, which interact electrostatically with polar amino acid side chains located on the surface of the protein. The affinity of free heme for binding a single imidazole is very weak, whereas the affinity for binding a second base is very high. Thus, hexacoordinate bis-imidazole complexes are much more stable than the pentacoordinate intermediate (5Cole S.J. Curthoys G.C. Cole Magnusson E.A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Cole S.J. Curthoys G.C. Cole Magnusson E.A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 2153-2158Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Brault D. Rougee M. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4591-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although a much weaker ligand, water competes effectively against the binding of the first imidazole base in aqueous solution, causing the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant to be ≥10−2-10−4m (7Brault D. Rougee M. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4591-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hemoglobins and myoglobins have evolved to stabilize the mono-imidazole heme complex to facilitate reversible O2 binding to the sixth coordination position. This stabilization appears to be accomplished by removing water molecules from the vicinity of the proximal coordination site. The side chains of the proximal amino acids, Leu89(F4), His97(FG3), Ile99(FG5), and Leu104(G5), are within 4 Å of the porphyrin ring. Leu89 is located at the entrance of a hydrophobic cavity underneath pyrrole B. Xenon gas binds readily in this proximal pocket, which has been designated the Xe1 site (8Tilton Jr., R.F. Kuntz Jr., I.D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Photodissociated O2 and CO access both the distal Xe4 site and this Xe1 proximal site on nanosecond to microsecond time scales, suggesting that these spaces may be functionally significant (9Scott E.E.

His97 forms a hydrogen bond with the heme-7-propionate and is a hydrophobic barrier to solvation of the proximal heme pocket on the other side of the heme group. Ile99 and Leu104 are located just beneath the pyrrole rings B and C, respectively. Leu104forms one of the internal sides of the Xe1 cavity. Hargrove et al. (3Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11300-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggested that both these amino acids may be important for keeping the internal region of the proximal pocket anhydrous and preventing disruption of the His93(F8)-Fe bond. To test these ideas, we have examined the effects of mutations at these four key positions on the crystal structure of recombinant sperm whale myoglobin. Recombinant wild-type and mutant sperm whale myoglobins were constructed, expressed, and purified as described by Springer and Sligar (15Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and Carver et al.(16Carver T.E. Brantley Jr., R.E. Singleton E.W. Arduini R.M. Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14443-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type myoglobin differs from native myoglobin by the initiator methionine required for bacterial expression and an Asp122 to Asn mutation that was a result of an error in the original sequence determination. These changes do not affect the function of the recombinant protein (17Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar) but do cause differences in crystallization conditions (18Phillips Jr., G.N. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The protein samples were concentrated to about 1 mm in heme, frozen, and stored under liquid nitrogen until ready for use. Hemin dissociation rates were measured by monitoring the absorbance changes associated with the transfer of hemin from holoprotein to excess H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin at pH 5.0 and 7.0, as described by Hargroveet al. (19Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfer of hemin from 6 μm metmyoglobin to 30 μm H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin was measured by following the absorbance decrease at 409 nm as “green” H64Y/V68F holo-metmyoglobin was formed. The experiments were carried out with 0.15 m buffer and 0.45m sucrose at 37 °C in either sodium acetate at pH 5.0 or potassium phosphate at pH 7. The values for the rate of hemin loss for most of the mutants were originally reported in Hargrove et al. (3Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11300-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); the remainder were measured for this report (20Liong C.E. Structural and Functional Analysis of Proximal Pocket Mutants of Sperm Whale Myoglobin. Ph.D. Thesis. Rice University, Houston, TX1999Google Scholar). Prior to crystallization, recombinant proteins were purified further by HPLC 1E. E. Scott, Q. H. Gibson, and J. S. Olson, submitted for publication. (LDC/Milton Roy). Samples were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, at 4 °C. The dialyzed samples were loaded onto a preparative weak cation exchange column (Custom LC) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The samples were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.0–1.0 m sodium chloride in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 9.0, at 4 °C. A few of the myoglobins, particularly the Leu89mutants, were unstable because of increased rates of heme loss and subsequent precipitation, which made protein purification and crystallization difficult. To overcome this problem, the unstable samples were reduced with sodium dithionite prior to purification to strengthen the covalent bond anchoring the heme group to the globin. Excess reducing agent was removed by passing the sample through a Sepharose column equilibrated with “no salt” HPLC buffer. Crystals of the HPLC-purified recombinant proteins were produced using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method employing a pH and ammonium sulfate gradient, as described by Phillips et al. (18Phillips Jr., G.N. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of 20 mg/ml HPLC-purified protein was mixed with an equal volume of 2.4–3.0 m ammonium sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0–9.0, with well solutions having concentrations of 2.4–3.0 m ammonium sulfate. During sample preparation those mutants which were reduced for HPLC purification reoxidized to the met form. Crystals grew in several weeks to sizes from 0.1 to 0.5 mm. The Ile99 to Ser mutation failed to crystallize with these conditions. The other mutations for which heme loss rates were given and no structure is presented were not screened for crystallization (Leu89 to Ala and Ser and His97 to Ala). X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC imaging plate area detector with a Siemens rotating-anode source. Typically, 60–90 frames were collected at a detector distance of 70 mm with a 30-min/frame exposure time and a ϕ oscillation range of 1°/frame. The data were processed using the XDS and XSCALE software packages (21Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). In all cases, 10% of the reflections were set aside for a test set and the calculation of Rfree. The X-PLOR package (22Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) was used for the initial refinement of the model structures and for the generation of difference maps, using the Engh and Huber (23Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) parameter set for stereochemical restraints. The coordinates of wild-type metmyoglobin (18Phillips Jr., G.N. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were used as a starting model in the refinement of the mutant structures. An iterative procedure of manually fitting the model using the molecular graphics program CHAIN (24Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 244-245Crossref Google Scholar) followed by Powell minimization, solvent B factor, and occupancy refinement, and individual B factor refinement for all atoms was repeated until Rfree was unchanged, and no significant differences were observed in electron density maps. The mutated side chains were changed only after ‖2Fo − Fc‖ and ‖Fo − Fc‖ difference Fourier maps indicated clear positions for these altered side chains. Peaks in the difference Fourier maps were modeled as water molecules using the program PEAK 2M. L. Quillin, unpublished data. or OH2. 3M. B. Berry, unpublished data. After the refinement converged in X-PLOR, the model was refined further using the conjugate gradient and full matrix least squares method in SHELXL (25Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 319-343Crossref Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Estimated standard deviations of the atomic positions of the heme iron and the 24 atoms of the pyrrole rings and methionine bridges were calculated from refinement without the imposition of standard distances and planarity restraints, as described in Ref.25Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 319-343Crossref Scopus (1892) Google Scholar. All myoglobin sequences were downloaded from the National Center of Biotechnology Information. About 460 sequences were obtained through the Entrez Protein search engine, which included all myoglobin related data from SwissProt, Protein Information Resource, Protein Data Bank, and Protein Research Foundation entries, etc. Incomplete myoglobin sequence fragments were immediately discarded. Most of the myoglobin sequences from the Protein Data Bank are from known myoglobins, and their mutants were also omitted in the sequence alignment. The first sequence alignment containing 203 sequences was performed using Clustal W (version 1.8) (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Duplicate sequences with different entry names were recognized and sorted in a log file, and extra copies of duplicate entries were discarded. The final multiple alignment contains 99 myoglobin sequences, and the nomenclature for helical position was taken from Dickerson and Geis (e.g. F4 is the fourth amino acid along the F-helix in sperm whale myoglobin) (27Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology..Benjamin/Cummings Series in the Life Sciences. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Menlo Park1983Google Scholar). Similar alignments were used for the α and β subunit sequences of vertebrate hemoglobins. Although the focus of this work is a structural interpretation of the effects of proximal pocket mutations on hemin loss (TableI), it is important to note that some of these amino acid replacements do have significant effects on ligand binding. Table II presents a list of the O2 binding properties of all 14 mutants whose structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography. There is a progressive 4-fold decrease in O2 affinity as the size of the amino acid at position 89 increases from Gly to Trp, whereas the mutations at His97 cause less than 2-fold changes in the O2 binding parameters. The Ile99 to Ala and Val replacements cause 2-fold increases in O2 affinity and similar, and sometimes large increases are seen for the Leu104 substitutions (Table II). In all four cases, there is no obvious correlation with hemin loss rate constants. A detailed interpretation of the O2 binding parameters for a more complete set of proximal mutants will be presented elsewhere and has been discussed by Liong (20Liong C.E. Structural and Functional Analysis of Proximal Pocket Mutants of Sperm Whale Myoglobin. Ph.D. Thesis. Rice University, Houston, TX1999Google Scholar), Dou (28Dou Y. Protein Engineering Reveals Specific Roles of Amino Acid Residues in Function and Stability of Myoglobin. Ph.D. Thesis. Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH1997Google Scholar), and Scott et al.(34Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). None of these ligand binding effects are large in comparison with the dramatic decreases (>10-fold) observed for the resistance of these mutants to hemin dissociation.Table IRates of hemin loss from myoglobin proximal pocket mutantsMyoglobink−H, pH 5k−H, pH 7h−1h−1Wild type1.0 ± 0.20.05 ± 0.04L89G∼700140L89A565.7L89S∼50015L89F2.50.1L89W170.4H97A392.0H97V230.8H97F1.50.1H97Q150.70H97D385I99A8.00.2I99V2.00.7I99S41.00.9L104A19.20.7L104V5.40.1L104F0.60.2L104W4.90.1L104N1.70.08H93G660140The rates of hemin dissociation for the position 89, 93, 97, and 99 mutants were measured by Hargrove et al.

In these later measurements, more variable rates of hemin loss from the wild-type controls were observed, and the average value for wild type was higher than the value of 0.01 h−1 reported in Hargrove et al. (3Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11300-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The variability in the wild typek−H values at pH 7 is due to the slowness of the reaction that requires collecting time courses for over 24 h. Much less variability is observed for those mutants with higher rates of hemin loss.

Native and wild-type recombinant sperm whale myoglobin lose hemin at rates of 1.0 and 0.01–0.05 h−1 at pH 5 and 7, respectively. Table I lists rates of hemin loss from 20 different proximal pocket mutants of myoglobin. The pH dependence of hemin loss from myoglobin is due to protonation of both His93, which facilitates disruption of the proximal imidazole-Fe bond, and His64, which then rotates out into solvent causing loss of distal water coordination (29Yang F. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As a result, hemin loss at pH 5 is rapid; data collection can be completed within 5 h; and the rate constants are well defined. At pH ≥ 7, protonation of His93 is greatly inhibited; coordinated water is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the neutral form of the side chain of His64; hemin dissociation is much slower; and the time courses must be recorded for over 24 h. During these long incubation times, apoprotein denaturation often occurs, making data analysis difficult. As a result, the small rate constants observed at pH 7 (k−H ≤ ∼0.1 h−1) have much greater uncertainty (almost a factor of 2) than those for the more unstable mutants and those obtained from measurements at lower pH values. Most of the proximal pocket mutations cause ≥10-fold increases in the rate of hemin loss (3Hargrove M.S. Wilkinson A.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11300-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Removal of the proximal histidine base, as in the H93G mutant (30Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), results in an extremely high rate of hemin dissociation, k−H = 660 and 140 h−1 at pH 5 and 7, respectively (Table I). This result is clearly due to the lack of a covalent link anchoring the heme group to the globin. Many of the Leu89 mutants also show dramatic increases in the rate of hemin loss, with the order being: L89G > L89S ≫ L89A > L89W > L89F ≈ native/wild type. The rates of hemin loss from the His97 mutants show both a size and a charge dependence with the order ofk−H being: H97D ≈ H97E ≈ H97A > H97Q > H97V ≫ H97F ≈ native/wild type. Interestingly, replacing either Leu89 or His97with a phenylalanine side chain is relatively conservative with respect of the rate of hemin loss, particularly at pH 5 (Table I). Replacement of Ile99 with serine results in a large 40-fold increase in the rate of hemin loss, whereas mutation to alanine and valine results in only moderate increases. Leu104 mutations also exhibit increases in the rate of hemin loss. The correlation with size is weak; however, the L104A mutation does cause almost a 20-fold increase in k−H at both pH values (Table I). The lack of effect of the polar L104N replacement on hemin loss at pH 5 is even more difficult to interpret without a structure of the mutant. Placement of an amide side chain in the proximal pocket would be expected cause an influx of water molecules, which should enhance disruption of the His93-Fe bond. Crystals of all but one of the 14 metmyoglobin mutants grew in the hexagonal P6 space group with one molecule/asymmetric unit. The His97(FG3) to Asp mutant crystallized in the orthorhombic P212121 space group, also with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Statistics for data collection and refinement are listed in TableIII. The limit of diffraction (dmin) was 2.2 Å or better for all of the crystals, and the quality of the diffraction data, as assessed by the internal agreement of symmetry-related reflections (Rmerge), was acceptable.

However, there appears to be no correlation between Fe3+displacement and the rate of hemin dissociation from the met forms of these mutants. Table V also lists the bond length between the proximal imidazole ring and the heme iron (His93Nε2-Fe), showing that this parameter is virtually the same for all 14 mutants. Furthermore, the deviations in heme planarity observed in most of these proximal pocket mutants are of the same magnitude as those observed in wild-type and distal pocket mutants of sperm whale myoglobin (31Quillin M.L.

The monumental sequencing work of Labeit and Kolmerer (1Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) has revealed the complete domain organization of the giant elastic protein titin. The bulk of cardiac titin consists of predominately two types of sequence motifs: immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin arranged in three levels of motifs (repeats, superrepeats, and segments). In addition to these well characterized domains, a novel motif consisting of mainly four amino acid residues, Pro, Glu, Val, and Lys, is discovered in the elastic I band region of titin. The length of this PEVK segment varies among muscles, ranging from 183 residues in the human cardiac titin to 2174 residues in human soleus skeletal muscle. Differential splicing of the titin transcripts in the PEVK region as well as in an adjacent tandem Ig segment near the A band produce these size isoforms of titin (1Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 2Freiburg A. Trombitas K. Hell W. Cazorla O. Fougerousse F. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Witt C. Beckmann J.S. Gregorio C.C. Granzier H. Labeit S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Since the selective expression of titin size isoforms imparts distinct elasticity to skeletal and cardiac muscles, with the muscle expressing longer titin being more compliant (3Wang K. McCarter R. Wright J. Beverly J. Ramirez-Mitchell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7101-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the observed length variation of PEVK and tandem Igs in titin isoforms immediately suggests the possibility that either or both segments may be the elastic elements. Labeit and Kolmerer (1Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) speculated that the PEVK region, with a predicted nonfolded polypeptide, is the key elastic element of titin. The concept of reversible unfolding and folding of Ig domains was considered unlikely, on the ground of the thermodynamic stability of Ig domains (4Pastore A. Politou A.S. Thomas D.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 114-115Google Scholar, 5MuhleGoll C. Nilges M. Pastore A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent works on the elasticity of single titin molecules (6Kellermayer M.S.Z. Smith S.B. Granzier H.L. Bustamante C. Science. 1997; 276: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), single myofibrils (7Linke W.A. Ivemeyer M. Olivieri N. Kolmerer B. Ruegg J.C. Labeit S. J. Mol.

J. 1993; 65: 2141-2159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) revealed that, stretched modestly, sarcomere elasticity can be explained by the straightening of tandem Ig segment (without unfolding), followed by the extension of a permanently unfolded PEVK segment (10Linke W.A. Granzier H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2613-2614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further evaluate molecular theories of titin elasticity, studies of the conformation and stability of different classes of titin domains are essential. The systematic NMR studies of expressed single Ig and fibronectin domains by Pastore and coworkers (11Politou A.S. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. Labeit S. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4730-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have provided insightful structural details and a possible model of force generation. In contrast, no molecular characteristics of the PEVK region have yet been described. We report the initial sequence and molecular analysis of a proline-rich region that we identified independently by screening expression libraries of human fetal skeletal muscle with anti-titin antibodies. One 2.5-kb1 clone was found to consist of tandem repeats of a fundamental module that averages 28 residues, mostly of PEVK residues. This sequence is classified as a PEVK segment by its high homology with human soleus PEVK. Conformational studies of a PEVK fragment (designated as TP1, containing 16 PEVK modules, 468 amino acid residues) indicate that PEVK is an open and flexible chain with stable structural folds, perhaps of left-handed polyproline II helices, but contains little, if any, α-helix and β-sheet types of secondary structure. Protein interaction studies with solid phase assays reveal modest micromolar range interactions between TP1 and nebulin and actin. Our data suggest that the PEVK region may serve multiple functions. It may serve as an entropic spring of a chain of structural folds. The PEVK region also may be a site of interaction with other myofilament proteins to form interfilament connectivity in the sarcomere. A λ gt11 human fetal skeletal muscle library was screened by Western blot with a goat anti-rabbit skeletal muscle titin (goat 812) that has been absorbed with E. coli blots and supplemented with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (RT10, -11, -13, and -15) (8Wang K. McCarter R. Wright J. Beverly J. Ramirez-Mitchell R. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1161-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One clone, 5-1-2, containing a 2.5-kb open reading frame (designated as hfT11; GenBankTM accession number AF 321609) was subcloned into Bluescript by ECoR1 digestion and ligation. Nested set deletions were produced by exoIII digestion, and each clone was sequenced by Sequence/T7 polymerase/universal and reverse primer with the dideoxy method. The 7-deaza reaction was run to clear up compression. The DNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed by MacVector and MACAW for homology and repeats (12Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.Q. VanHeerden A. Gutierrez G. Quian X. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4114-4304Google Scholar). A 1.4-kb open reading frame derived from hfT11 was subcloned into a pET3d plasmid by digesting Bluescript clone with HinfI and ligated to pET 3d, essentially as described in (12Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.Q. VanHeerden A. Gutierrez G. Quian X. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4114-4304Google Scholar). The expressed protein, TP1 (51,467,469 residues), was purified from a 4-liter culture of BL21(DE3)pLysS host cells transformed with pET3d HinfI plasmid that was incubated at 37 °C for 3.5 h upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when A 550 = 0.6–0.8). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3800 × g for 10 min and lysed in a French press cell (3 × 1500 p.s.i.) in 45 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm NaPi, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml casein, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against (10 mm NaPi, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0) at 4 °C, clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min, and loaded to a Whatman phosphocellulose P-11 column (5.2 × 4.0 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. TP1 was eluted between 0.4 and 0.5m NaCl by a linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl). Pooled fractions containing TP1 were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm NaPi, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, at 4 °C and applied to a Source 15S PE column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. Elution with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.3 m) yielded ∼95% pure TP1 between 0.10 and 0.12 m NaCl (15 mg/4-liter culture). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done in 12% Laemmli gel. Western blot was done with electrophoretic transfer on nitrocellulose membrane (S&S BA85) in a Bio-Rad semidry electroblotter at 1.5 mA/cm2 for 60 min using a buffer system modified from Khyse-Andersen (13Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar) Briefly, the blotting assembly was set on the anode electrode plate of a semidry transfer unit (Bio-Rad) in the following order: two sheets of filter paper (GB002; Schleicher & Schüll) presoaked in anode buffer 1 (300 mm Tris-Cl, 0.05% SDS, 10% methanol, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 10.4); nitrocellulose membrane presoaked in anode buffer 2 (25 mm Tris-Cl, 0.05% SDS, 10% methanol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 10.4); SDS gels presoaked in the cathode buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, 0.05% SDS, 10% methanol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 40 mmamino-N-hexanoic acid, pH 10.4) for 15 s; and four sheets of filter paper presoaked in the cathode buffer. Transfer of proteins was performed at 1.5 mA/cm2 of gel for 60 min. Blots were stained with anti-titin monoclonal antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse IgG, IgM, and IgA (H + L)). Monoclonal antibodies against rabbit skeletal titin were prepared previously in this laboratory by standard procedures. Monoclonal antibody RT11, an IgM, was found to react with the PEVK segment and was used to monitor the expression and purification of TP1 by Western blots. The concentration of TP1 was determined spectroscopically with a calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.025 for 1 mg/ml. Stoke's radius of TP1 was estimated by the method of Laurent and Killander (14Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). A 10 × 300-mm Superose 6 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer I (10 mm imidazole, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) was calibrated by determining the elution volume (V e) of a set of standard proteins of known Stoke's radii: human fibrinogen (107 Å), bovine thyroglobulin (85 Å), horse spleen ferritin (61 Å), bovine liver catalase (52.2 Å), rabbit muscle aldolase (48.1Å), bovine serum albumin (35.5 Å), ovalbumin (30.5 Å), bovine pancreas chymotrypsinogen A (20.9 Å), and bovine pancreas ribonuclease A (16.4 Å). The void volume (V o) was determined using blue dextran. The Stoke's radius of TP1 was determined from the calibration curve obtained by the linear fitting of Stoke's radius versus(-logKav)1/2 CD spectra of TP1 and poly-l-proline (M r 5000; Sigma P-2254) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were recorded on a JASCO-J-600 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) at seven temperatures (2, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 70 °C) under a constant nitrogen flow at 9 liters/min to flush away oxygen that absorbs below 200 nm. The instrument was calibrated with a 0.06% aqueous solution of ammonium d-10-camphosulfonate in the near UV region and with a 0.015% aqueous solution of d-(−)-pantolactone (Aldrich, WI) in the far UV region. A quartz cuvette (Hellma, Plainview, NY) with a 0.01-cm light path was used. For urea titration at 20 °C, TP1 (22 mg/ml) or polyproline (2 mg/ml) was dialyzed against various concentrations of urea (2, 4, 6, and 8 m) in the same buffer. Concentrated urea solutions were prepared in water by weight using the density data of Kanahara (15Kawahara K. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3228-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then adjusted to desired concentration with water and 10× concentrated buffer. Thermal denaturation of TP1 (2.2 mg/ml) and polyproline (0.25 mg/ml) was monitored by following the change in CD at 205 nm (TP1) or 201 nm (polyproline) from 20 to 90 °C at a rate of 50 °C/h using a JASCO model PTC-348W Peltier type thermoelectric control system and a demountable 0.01-cm path length rectangular cuvette. Purified TP1 (220 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) was absorbed onto microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C, washed once with TBS-T (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), and blocked with 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with actin and nebulin fragments (NA3, NA4, NC17, ND8, ND66) in buffer I (10 mm imidazole, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) at a concentration ranging from 0.7 to 50 μg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing plates three times with TBS-T, mouse monoclonal antibodies against actin (JL20), NA3 (N109), NA4 (N103), NC17 (N107), ND8 (N113), and ND66 (N113) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.2% bovine serum albumin-TBS-T. Plates were washed three times with TBS-T and then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody for 1 h. at 37 °C in bovine serum albumin-TBS-T, followed by five washes with TBS-T. Color was developed for 20 min at 25 °C by adding ABTS-H2O2 substrate, 10 μl of H2O2, 10 ml of 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.2. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using an ELISA microtiter plate reader (12Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.Q. VanHeerden A. Gutierrez G. Quian X. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4114-4304Google Scholar, 16Jin J.P. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21215-21223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance assays were done using a real time biosensor, IAsys Manual System (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). TP1 was attached to caboxymethylated dextran on the cuvette surface via EDC/NHS. The cuvette was activated with 0.4 m EDC, 0.1 mNHS in water for 8 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, followed by a wash with 10 mmacetate buffer pH 5.0 for 3 min, and incubated with PT1 (0.22 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0) for 10 min. The cuvette was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, followed by 1 m ethylenediamine for 3 min to block excess activated carboxyl groups. The cuvette was then washed with acetate buffer (3×), 10 mm HCl, acetate buffer (3×), and finally PBST (3×). A blank cuvette from the same lot was processed in parallel, without TP1. The use of ethylenediamine to block excess carboxyls is essential for the study of the interaction of TP1 with the highly basic nebulin fragments. The use of hydroxylamine, as recommended by the manufacturer, led to unacceptably high binding of basic proteins to the control blank cuvette even at high ionic strength (200 mm KCl). The introduction of basic groups to the dextran led to a gel layer that showed no significant electrostatic binding of NA4 (pI = 9.24) at and above 100 mm KCl (with response <50 arc seconds). The binding of nebulin fragments (NA3, NA4, NA29, NC17, and ND66), actin, troponin, tropomyosin, calmodulin (bovine brain), and S100αα (Sigma) to immobilized TP1 was done at 1 μm in 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. For some solutions, EGTA (1 mm) was present to lower pCa to 8.0. Protein binding to the gel layer alters the refractive index profile occurring within the evanescent field and changes the measured resonance angle of the intensity peak (in arc seconds). The change in arc seconds is assumed to be proportional to the amount of bound substance (17Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The association kinetics was followed for 10–15 min prior to washing with the interaction buffer to follow the time course of dissociation. At the end of each experiment, the cuvette was washed with 10 mm HCl for 1 min and buffer I (3×) to regenerate the cuvette. All of the data reported here were obtained on the same cuvette within a 2-day period to facilitate comparison. Resonance angles of the treated control cuvette were measured in parallel and subtracted from the corresponding values obtained with the TP1 cuvette. Localization of epitopes of monoclonal antibodies RT11, RT13, and RT15 in mechanically split rabbit psoas muscle fibers was done as described previously (18Wright J. Huang Q.Q. Wang K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, the split muscle fibers from rabbit psoas muscle in relaxing buffer were hand-stretched to various degrees and attached to gold single-slot grid, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, labeled with anti-titin supernatants, and followed by rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin and then protein A gold bead (5 nm) conjugates. The labeled fibers were fixed in glutaraldehyde before embedded in Epon-Araldite, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate for observation in an electron microscope (JEOL 100CX). Epitope translocation was determined by plotting the center to center distance from each epitope to the Z line or to the M line as a function of sarcomere length. Sequence analysis of a 2.5-kb cDNA clone (5-1-2) obtained by screening a human fetal muscle cDNA library with anti-titin antibodies revealed an open reading frame (designated as hfT11) of 786 residues that is enriched in prolines, glutamates, valines, and lysines (25% Pro, 16% Glu, 15% Val, 16% Lys) (GenBankTM accession number AF 321609). A search for internal sequence homology by matrix plots with MacVector indicates substantial internal repeats (Fig. 2 A). Further analysis with MACAW to search for sequence homology alignment revealed that the majority of the sequence near the C-terminal side consists of 18 tandem repeats of sequence modules of an average of 28 residues (ranging from 25 to 30). The alignment of these modules and nonrepeat sequences in Fig. 1 showed the consensus of PE(V/A)PKEVVPEKK(A/V) PVAPPKKPE(V/A)PPVKV. The variability in length among these modules occurs between the first and second prolines, between the EKK and PP and between PP and VKV (in length). Closer examination of these repeats further revealed the presence of adjoining superrepeats from HRT14–20 (designated as SRA) and HRT 21–27 (designated as SRB). Within each superrepeat, seven modules are arranged in the same order of abcdefg types of module. The N-terminal side of this open reading frame is more variable. Four modules (HRT1–4) with low similarity are found. The next four modules, HRT10–13, show little homology with the modules from HRT14–27, but each module has ∼25–35 residues, and three show a PE at the beginning of the module. These four modules are classified as nonrepeats. This nonrepeat region is characterized by clusters of acidic residues (e.g. HRT4) and basic residues (KRRRK in HRT8). The matrix plot of hfT11 against human soleus PEVK indicates that hfT11 open reading frame sequence shares significant homology with the C-terminal side of the PEVK region of human soleus titin (Fig.2 A).Figure 1Partial sequence of PEVK segment of human fetal skeletal muscle titin. A 2.5-kb cDNA clone (hfT11) was obtained by screening a human fetal muscle library with a mixture of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to titin. The deduced amino acid sequence of hfT11 indicates that it corresponds to the C-terminal region of the PEVK segment of titin. The modular motifs of the open reading frame were revealed by protein analysis tools in MacVector and MACAW for homology and repeats. The sequence was divided to 28 sections, HRT1–28. The alignment of repeats (R, HRT1–4, HRT10–13, and HRT14–27) and two superrepeats (SRA, HRT14–20; SRB, HRT15–27) and nonrepeat (NR, HRT5–9) is indicated to the right. The consensus sequence for the PEVK modules is shown below. Prolines are ingreen, valines are in black, basic residues (Lys, Arg) are in blue, and acidic residues (Asp, Glu) are inred. The enclosed region, TP1 (468 residues,M r 51,491) was expressed in E. coli for the current study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PEVK region of human fetal skeletal muscle titin sequenced so far clearly indicates three levels of motifs: repeats of ∼28 residues, superrepeats of seven modules, and nonrepeat. The same research for internal repeats of human soleus PEVK (residues 0–2174, corresponding to 5618–7792 of EMBL X90569) revealed the same types of sequence motifs. The matrix plot in Fig. 2 B indicates significant repeats between residues 300 and 1840 of the PEVK segment of human soleus titin. Indeed, similar 28-residue repeats are abundant, and seven-module superrepeats are also present. The balance of the sequence is nonrepeat and contains clusters of acidic residues (see Refs. 2Freiburg A. Trombitas K. Hell W. Cazorla O. Fougerousse F. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Witt C. Beckmann J.S. Gregorio C.C. Granzier H. Labeit S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar and19Greaser M.L. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 18AGoogle Scholar). In summary, PEVK of titin appears to be modular and consists mainly of tandem repeats of a fundamental 28-residue module interspersed in highly charged nonrepeat regions. The presence of the modular structure of PEVK, previously unrecognized, raised the question of whether PEVK may have stable structural folds. To explore this possibility, we expressed in Escherichia coli a 469-residue fragment (from 128–597, HRT5 to HRT21, designated as TP1) that includes both the nonrepeat and part of the superrepeat of PEVK. To avoid possible interference by expression tags in protein interaction studies, a nonfusion protein was produced. As shown in Fig. 3, TP1 was expressed as a soluble protein in reasonable yield. Due to its low UV absorption (a single tyrosine residue at position 155), purification and expression of TP1 were monitored by SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-titin, RT11. TP1 displayed unusually low SDS gel mobility and migrated with an apparent mass of 86 kDa. Moreover, TP1 was also difficult to transfer electrophoretically, and most TP1 stayed behind in the gel (Fig. 3 A, post-transfer gel pattern). The preferential transfer of smaller degradation products of TP1 gave a smear in Western blots that significantly underestimated the purity of TP1 (Fig. 3 A, RT11 Western blot). The low mobility may reflect either the lower than normal SDS binding or an extended conformation or stiffer SDS peptide complex for proline-rich peptides. For example, a proline-rich protein, calphotin (20Martin J.H. Benzer S. Rudnicka M. Miller C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1531-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), displays a similar low motility. Purified TP1 is very soluble in a wide range of aqueous buffers and ionic strengths. The possible presence of secondary structure in TP1 was investigated by circular dichroism. CD spectra of TP1 display negative ellipticity with a minimum at 201 nm and a shoulder near 220 nm (Fig. 4 D). At first impression, these are characteristic spectra of polypeptides generally classified as random coils. Indeed, calculations for secondary structure content with several software programs indicate negligible α-helix and β-sheet structure (data not shown). However, further CD studies of TP1 subjected to urea and thermal titration raised doubts about this interpretation and led us to search for evidence for the presence of other stable structural features. Given the proline-rich content of TP1, we considered the possible presence of PPII. Such a left-handed helix, containing three trans-proline residues per turn, is found in polyproline in aqueous solution (21Bhatnagar R.S. Gough C.A. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 183-200Google Scholar, 25Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and is also present as short stretches in many globular proteins (22Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A detailed comparison of CD spectra of polyproline and TP1 strongly supports this notion. As shown in Fig. 4, A andB, CD spectra of polyproline show the characteristic strong negative band at 205 nm and a weak positive band at 229 nm of PPII helices (21Bhatnagar R.S. Gough C.A. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 183-200Google Scholar). Upon heating from 2 to 70 °C, both bands undergo incremental decrease in magnitude (Fig. 4 A,inset), indicating a loss of PPII helical content at higher temperature. This series of CD spectra (Fig. 4 A) displays an isodichroic point at 215 nm, indicating an equilibrium of two major populations of conformations. Another unique characteristic of PII is its response to urea and guanidinium chloride treatment (23Tiffany M.L. Krimm S. Biopolymers. 1973; 12: 575-587Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These chaotropic agents that commonly cause unfolding and loss of most secondary and tertiary structures in fact increase the helical content of PPII (23Tiffany M.L. Krimm S. Biopolymers. 1973; 12: 575-587Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, urea treatment up to 8m causes an increase in magnitude of bands at 205 and 229 nm, confirming an earlier report of the enhancement effect of urea on PPII content (23Tiffany M.L. Krimm S. Biopolymers. 1973; 12: 575-587Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of an isodichroic point at 218 nm suggests again two populations of equilibrating conformations. High concentrations of urea progressively obscure the spectra below 205 nm and somewhat affect the accuracy of the isodichroic point (Fig.4 B, inset). The third characteristic behavior of PPII is the nearly linear response to thermal titration, without the sharp, sigmodial transition commonly observed for α-helices, β-sheets, and other stable folds that display cooperative melting. As shown in Fig. 4 C, thermal titration of polyproline from 2 to 90 °C, as monitored continuously at 201 nm, shows a liner response, with slight change in slopes at 28 and 80 °C. Such a titration curve suggests the gradual loss of PPII with raised temperature without cooperativity. The CD of TP1 and its responses to thermal and urea titration bear striking resemblance to those of polyproline under identical conditions (Figs. 4, D–F). The strong negative band at 200 nm is slightly blue-shifted from the 205-nm band of polyproline. The negative shoulder at 220 nm may be derived from the same transition as the 229-nm (positive) band of polyproline (Fig. 4, D andE). Upon heating from 2 to 70 °C, a significant decrease of the magnitude of both bands of TP1 occurs (Fig. 4 E,inset), showing the loss of stable folds. The presence of an isodichroic point near 210 nm between 2 and 50 °C suggests that at least two conformations are in equilibrium between below 50 °C (Fig.4 D). The addition of urea up to 8 m causes progressive decrease in the 200-nm band and an increase in the shoulder at 220 nm, with an isodichroic point at 210 nm (Fig. 4 E), consistent with the increase of PPII at higher concentration of urea. Thermal titration of TP1 at 201 nm reveals a linear response from 20 t"

S-d-lactoylglutathione polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid inductively coupled plasma The glyoxalase system consists of two enzymes that convert cytotoxic 2-oxoaldehydes into hydroxy acids utilizing the cofactor glutathione. Under physiological conditions, glyoxalase I (lactoylglutathione lyase) catalyzes the formation ofS-d-lactoylglutathione (SLG)1 in the presence of methylglyoxal and glutathione (1Thornalley P. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic compound that can inactivate proteins, modify guanylate residues in DNA, and create interstrand cross-links (2Rahman A. Shahabuddin A. Hadi S. J. Biochem.

Shahabuddin A. Hadi S. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1990; 5: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glyoxalase II (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase) hydrolyzes SLG to form d-lactic acid and regenerate glutathione (1Thornalley P. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). SLG is also known to exhibit cytotoxic effects through the inhibition of DNA synthesis (5Thornalley P. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Therefore, the glyoxalase system is thought to play a major role in chemical detoxification (5Thornalley P. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar,6Thornalley P.J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar).The glyoxalase system has been the subject of intense study because of its potential implications in anti-protozoal and anti-tumor drug design (6Thornalley P.J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 7Allen R. Lo T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc.

Increased cellular levels of methylglyoxal and glyoxalase activity are associated with tumor cells, the malaria parasite, and several complications associated with diabetes (6Thornalley P.J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II have been designed as potential anti-tumor agents; however, all inhibitors tested to date exhibited problems that limited their therapeutic usefulness (6Thornalley P.J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 7Allen R. Lo T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc.

It should be noted that these inhibition studies were all conducted with little or no information on the active site structure or the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme. Therefore, it is clear that a more detailed understanding of the active site of glyoxalase II and its reaction mechanism is essential to the rational design and implementation of clinically useful inhibitors.Glyoxalase II has been purified and cloned from a number of sources (10Allen R.

Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Five glyoxalase II isozymes have been identified in Arabidopsis including three, GLX2-1, 2-4, and 2-5, which appear to be mitochondrial forms; GLX2-2, a cytoplasmic form; and GLX2-3, which has not yet been localized (16Maiti M.K. Krishnasamy S. Owen H.A. Makaroff C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The GLX2-2 gene has been successfully cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli yielding protein concentrations as high as 100 μm (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Early biochemical studies suggested that glyoxalase II, unlike glyoxalase I, does not require bound metal ions for activity (13Vander Jagt D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol.

However, through the analysis of recombinant GLX2-2, we demonstrated that glyoxalase II is a Zn(II)-requiring enzyme (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All species of glyoxalase II, including human, yeast, and Arabidopsis, contain a highly conserved metal binding domain (THX HX DH) that is also present in the family of metallo-β-lactamases, which are known to require Zn(II) (16Maiti M.K. Krishnasamy S. Owen H.A. Makaroff C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A.

Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Based on its similarity to the metallo-β-lactamases, we predicted that glyoxalase II binds two Zn(II) ions, utilizing five histidines, two aspartic acids, and a bridging water molecule (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These predictions have been restated by Melino et al. (22Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and supported through the recent determination of the human glyoxalase II crystal structure (23Cameron A.D. Ridderstrom M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Structure. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data indicates that the metal binding and active sites of glyoxalase II resemble those in the metallo-β-lactamase L1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia(24Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).Early chemical modification, inhibition, and pH dependence studies on glyoxalase II suggested that an arginine, an amine, and a critical histidine are involved in the active site (13Vander Jagt D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Ball J. Vander Jagt D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given that Zn(II) is critical for activity (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the critical histidine is most likely one of the metal ligands. In addition to the highly conserved metal-binding ligands, several other highly conserved residues, including arginine and lysine residues, have been identified (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To probe the functionality of some of these residues, we have generated and analyzed a series of site-directed mutants of glyoxalase II. Conserved residues predicted to participate in substrate and metal binding were mutated, and the altered forms of the enzyme were analyzed for conformation, metal content, and kinetic properties. Most of the mutations did not lead to a significant drop in substrate affinity; however, one mutation, R248W, did cause a 10-fold increase inK m. All of the mutations affecting metal ligands resulted in a large drop in activity, suggesting that the metals must be bound in an optimal geometry for catalysis. Evidence was also obtained that the binuclear metal site of glyoxalase II is able to bind both zinc and iron. These results provide significant new insight into the metal binding and active sites of glyoxalase II and its mechanism of catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDeep Vent polymerase and other overlap PCR reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); the oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (Coralville, IA). All of the chromatographic reagents, columns, and fast protein liquid chromatography system were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The SLG was purchased from Sigma. All other molecular biology reagents were purchased commercially and were of highest quality.MethodsSite-directed MutagenesisSite-specific mutations were introduced into the glyoxalase II gene (GLX2–2) through overlap extension PCR (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). The wild type template, pT7-7/GLX2-2, was previously described by Maiti et al. (16Maiti M.K. Krishnasamy S. Owen H.A. Makaroff C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Numbering of amino acids corresponds to the Arabidopsis GLX2-2 sequence (GenBankTM accession number O24496). One mutation, R248W, found in the wild type cDNA template, was corrected through overlap PCR (TGG to CGC). The forward and reverse primers were between 26 and 32 bases long with the mutation in the center. The mutations generated were as follows: H54N, CAT to AAC; D58C, GAT to TGT; H59S, CAT to AGT; H59C, CAT to TGC; K74A, AAA to GCA; C140A, TGT to GCG; K142A, AAG to GCA; H172R, CAT to CGC; N178A, AAC to GCA; and R225A, CGT to GCA. All mutated PCR products were cloned into pT7-7 (27Tabor S. Richardson S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar) and sequenced.Protein Production and PurificationThe expression plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells and overexpressed as described previously (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The induction time was extended to 30 h, and the induction temperature was lowered to 15 °C to increase the yield of soluble protein. The wild type and mutant proteins, except for H59C and H172R, were purified using a Q-Sepharose column as described previously (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The H59C and H172R enzymes could not be purified; therefore, these proteins were assessed in crude soluble extracts. Kinetic data and metal content were obtained and averaged from three preparations of each enzyme.Steady State Kinetics and Crude AssaysThe steady state kinetic parameters of purified wild type and mutant enzymes were determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of SLG at 240 nm using a Cary IE UV-visible spectrophotometer as previously described (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).To prepare crude soluble protein extracts of the wild type, H59C, and H172R enzymes, 50-ml cultures of each strain were grown at 30 °C in ZY media (2% (w/v) tryptone, 1.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with 500 μmZnSO4 and 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA 600 of 0.7 and transferred to a shaker at 15 °C. After 24 h, the cultures were harvested and washed three times with Nanopure water. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and lysed by two passes through a French press at 16,000 pounds/square inch. A soluble extract was obtained after centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 45 min. The amount of crude protein in the soluble extract was quantitated through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the BCA protein assay. The total activity of crude soluble protein was determined from the rate of hydrolysis of 100 nmol of SLG in a 1-ml reaction volume over a 2-min period at 25 °C and standardized relative to the amount of glyoxalase II in the extract.End Product Inhibition Studies of SLG HydrolysisInhibition studies were performed on glyoxalase II using glutathione andd-lactic acid, the products of SLG hydrolysis. Steady state kinetic studies of purified wild type glyoxalase II in the presence of varying concentrations of glutathione (0.8, 1.7, 5, and 6.7 mm) or lithium d-lactate (103, 205, and 410 mm) were conducted by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of SLG. Glutathione and lithium d- lactate were prepared in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2; the pH of the lithiumd-lactate solution was adjusted to 7.2 after dissolution of the salt. The enzyme and inhibitor were added first to allow the inhibitor time to interact with the enzyme. The substrate was added at time 0. For all reactions Lineweaver-Burk plots were generated to determine the mode of inhibition (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 544-555Google Scholar). Greater experimental error is associated with the results obtained from assays conducted at high inhibitor concentrations (low activity) than those at lower inhibitor concentrations, resulting in some lines that do not cross at a common point. Slope replots were generated to confirm the mode of inhibition and the K I for each product (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 544-555Google Scholar).Solvent Isotope EffectsSolvent isotope effect studies were performed on the wild type and D58C mutant enzymes to assess the presence of a rate-limiting proton transfer. Steady state kinetic studies of purified wild type or D58C mutant enzymes were conducted by measuring the rate of SLG hydrolysis at 240 nm in 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% D2O. The k H/k Dand (k/K m)H/(k/K m)Dratios were then calculated from the steady state kinetic constants obtained in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, made with 0 and 100% D2O.Metal AnalysisThe metal content of purified wild type and mutant proteins was measured with a Varian inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP) with atomic emission spectroscopy detection as previously described (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified protein was diluted in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, to a concentration of 10 μmand analyzed for zinc, cobalt, and iron.Whole Cell Metal AnalysisWhole cell metal analysis was performed on soluble extracts from wild type and mutant cultures through a modification of the method of D'souza and Holz (29D'souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fifty-milliliter cultures of BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli cells containing pT7-7, GLX2-2/pT7-7, and theGLX2-2/ pT7-7 plasmids containing the H59C and H172R mutations were grown at 30 °C in ZY media minus ZnSO4with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA 600 of 0.7 and transferred to a shaker at 15 °C. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, washed three times with Nanopure water and three times with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and a crude protein extract was obtained as described above. The extracts were diluted with Nanopure water to a concentration of 2 mg/ml and analyzed for zinc, cobalt, and iron content using ICP.Fluorescence EmissionThe intrinsic fluorescence of the wild type and mutant proteins was measured as described by Draganiet al. (30Dragani B. Cocco R. Ridderstrom M. Stenberg G. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 481-490Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein solutions of 0.2 mg/ml were prepared in 10 mm MOPS buffer and analyzed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Luminescence Spectrometer. The blank-corrected emission spectra were measured at 2 nm/s with excitation wavelengths of 280 and 295 nm from three enzyme preparations and were averaged.DISCUSSIONIn this report we present results of mutational and kinetic studies that were conducted on glyoxalase II to gain insight into the role of highly conserved amino acids in metal ion and substrate binding. Early studies suggested that glyoxalase II is not a metalloenzyme (13Vander Jagt D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Ridderstrom M. Saccucci F. Hellman U. Bergman T. Principato G. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Uotila L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3944-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in 1997 we showed that glyoxalase II in fact requires 2 mol of Zn(II) per mol of enzyme for catalytic function (18Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein used in this study was subsequently found to contain a mutation, R248W. Evidence presented here demonstrates that wild type Arabidopsis glyoxalase II contains a binuclear metal-binding site that is able to bind both zinc and iron. As shown in Table II, enzyme preparations containing the R248W mutation bind 2 mol of zinc and 0.4 mol of iron, whereas wild type Arabidopsis glyoxalase II binds an average of 0.8 mol of zinc and 1.5 mol of iron. Furthermore, data on several of the mutations presented here indicate that the relative stoichiometry of the metals bound by glyoxalase II is influenced by the environment around the metal ligands. The R248W and C140A mutant enzymes bind more zinc than iron, whereas the wild type enzyme has a preference for iron. The observation that Arabidopsis glyoxalase II can bind both zinc and iron is consistent with recent results on human glyoxalase II, which was found to contain ∼1.5 mol of zinc and 0.7 mol of iron (23Cameron A.D. Ridderstrom M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Structure. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study the authors concluded that the enzyme is a binuclear zinc protein. However, the resolution of the crystal structure was not sufficient to distinguish between zinc and iron in the protein.Binuclear iron-zinc proteins have been found throughout nature, including the kidney bean purple acid phosphatases and protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B (35Mondragon A. Griffith E.C. Sun L. Xiong F. Armstrong C. Liu J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4934-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Twitchett M.B. Sykes A.G. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 12: 2105-2115Crossref Google Scholar). Purple acid phosphatases can have Fe(III)-Fe(II), Fe(III)-Mn(II), or Fe(III)-Zn(II) binuclear metal centers. In the mammalian dinuclear iron purple acid phosphatases zinc can readily replace iron to form functional Fe-Zn enzymes (37Wang X. Randall C.R. True A.E. Que J., L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13946-13954Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas iron can replace zinc in the Zn-Fe purple acid phosphatases from plants (36Twitchett M.B. Sykes A.G. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 12: 2105-2115Crossref Google Scholar). Our current results indicate that glyoxalase II can utilize both zinc and iron. Further experiments are required to determine the exact nature of the binuclear metal center in the enzyme and to determine whether it is able to utilize other metals, such as manganese. The ability to utilize both zinc and iron is not seen in the metallo-β-lactamases, which only bind zinc (38Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Pandalai S.G. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Vol. 3, Part 1. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, India1999: 105-132Google Scholar), even though the metal-binding ligands of glyoxalase II most closely resemble those of the metallo-β-lactamase L1 from S. maltophilia (24Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It is interesting that two enzymes with essentially the same metal-binding ligands can exhibit such different metal-binding preferences.Early chemical modification, inhibition, and pH dependence studies suggested that an arginine, an amine, and a critical histidine are involved in the active site of glyoxalase II (13Vander Jagt D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Ball J. Vander Jagt D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The critical arginine may be Arg-240, which is essential for substrate binding, as shown by the 10-fold reduction in SLG affinity when Arg-248 is substituted by tryptophan. The critical amine is not Lys-142; changing this residue to an alanine did not result in a large loss of activity. There are no other conserved amines in the active site with the exception of the imidazole rings of the metal ligand histidines (16Maiti M.K. Krishnasamy S. Owen H.A. Makaroff C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The essential histidine residue previously identified is most likely one or more of the metal ligands. Our finding that any alteration in the metal-binding ligands of glyoxalase II results in a significant reduction in activity clearly demonstrates the essential role of the binuclear metal site in the catalysis of this enzyme. Substitutions of metal-binding ligands that are expected to alter the geometry of the metal ions but still allow metal binding (H54N, D58C, and H59C) all resulted in a dramatic decrease in enzyme activity. In addition, the structure of glyoxalase II cannot accommodate the loss of one metal, as knocking out one metal ligand through the H172R mutation yielded a near inactive enzyme with virtually no bound metal.It has been proposed that the active site of human glyoxalase II is also dependent on a GCG hairpin; the cysteine of this hairpin was proposed to be involved with substrate binding and stabilizing several highly conserved active site residues (23Cameron A.D. Ridderstrom M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Structure. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Replacing this cysteine (140) with alanine in GLX2-2 results in dramatic structural changes, as shown by the significant increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme. Interestingly, this alteration does not reduce enzymatic activity. Instead the activity increases almost 2-fold. It was also noted that the metal content of the C140A enzyme is twice that of wild type glyoxalase II. Quantification of the C140A protein using several methods indicated that the 2-fold increases in activity and metal content are not due to errors in enzyme concentration. The increased fluorescence of the C140A mutant enzyme indicates that the environment around the active site tryptophan residues (57 and 198) has been changed by this mutation. It has been suggested previously that substrate binding is the rate-limiting step for glyoxalase II (39Creighton D.J. Migliorni M. Pourmotabbed T. Guha M.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7376-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is possible that the C140A mutation alters the structure of the enzyme to facilitate access of substrate to the active site. Further experiments, including crystallographic studies, are necessary to confirm this proposal.Many binuclear metalloenzymes, such as the metallo-β-lactamases and leucine aminopeptidase, appear to utilize a hydroxide, arising from a bridging water molecule in the nucleophilic attack of substrate (33Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10013-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,40Strater N. Sun L. Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11151-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Residues that hydrogen-bond to the nucleophilic hydroxide usually play a critical role in orienting the hydroxide and holding it in a fixed position that reduces the entropic barrier for nucleophilic attack on the substrate (41Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 33-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We predict that Asp-58 is the critical residue for hydroxide positioning in Arabidopsis glyoxalase II. The aspartic acid at position 58, in human glyoxalase II, has also been predicted to hydrogen-bond to the bridging hydroxide through its carbonyl oxygen (23Cameron A.D. Ridderstrom M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Structure. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). There are several other metalloenzymes, including the metallo-β-lactamases, that have a homologous aspartic acid in their binuclear metal-binding sites (33Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10013-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to removing the possibility of a proton transfer, changing an aspartic acid to cysteine removes the hydrogen bond partner of the nucleophilic hydroxide. The D58C substitution caused a reduction in activity greater than 99%, while still maintaining wild type levels of metal. This suggests an important role for Asp-58 in ori"

The signal transduction pathway activated by this cytokine is known to be regulated by several intracellular messengers. In particular, in many systems nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to protect cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. However, whether NO can be generated by the cytokine to down-regulate its own apoptotic program has never been studied. We have addressed this question in HeLa Tet-off cell clones stably transfected with the endothelial NO synthase under a tetracycline-responsive promoter. Endothelial NO synthase, induced about 100-fold in these cells by removal of the antibiotic, retained the characteristics of the native enzyme of endothelial cells, both in terms of intracellular localization and functional activity. Expression of the endothelial NO synthase was sufficient to protect from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. This protection was mediated by the generation of NO. TNF-α itself stimulated endothelial NO synthase activity to generate NO through a pathway involving its lipid messenger, ceramide. Our results identify a novel mechanism of regulation of a signal transduction pathway activated by death receptors and suggest that NO may constitute a built-in mechanism by which TNF-α controls its own apoptotic program.

Most of these actions are exerted by TNF-α via its ability to induce cell death via apoptosis. This process is activated by the cytokine through the stimulation of its 55-kDa, type I receptor (TNF-RI), whose signal transduction pathway has been characterized in quite some detail. Binding of TNF-α results in receptor trimerization with clustering of the cytosolic death domains, interaction with the complementary domains present in specific cytosolic proteins, including TRADD and FADD, and formation of the transduction complex, referred to as the DISC (5Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). This leads to the recruitment and proteolytic activation of a specific pro-protease, procaspase-8 (and possibly also -10) (5Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar), which initiates a cascade of signaling events, including generation of the lipid metabolite ceramide, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, apoptosome formation as well as activation of downstream caspases, all of them integrated in an operational network leading to cell death (6Hannun Y.A.

The gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the modulation of TNF-α signaling. When generated after cytokine-stimulated expression of the inducible isoform of its synthesizing enzymes, NO synthase (NOS), NO may contribute to later stages of apoptosis (see,e.g., Refs. 9Maciejewski J.P.

Two lines of evidence suggest that this early protective effect of NO might be of physiological relevance. First, NO acts by inhibiting key apoptogenic signal transduction events triggered by TNF-α, including ceramide accumulation and TRADD recruitment to the DISC complex, cytochromec release, as well as the activity of initiator and effector caspases, both before and after their enzymatic cleavage (13Kim Y.-M.

Second, inhibition of endogenous NOS activity during stimulation with TNF-α increases apoptosis induction by the cytokine (18Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.-M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 20Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Ferrari R. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A direct link between NOS activity and protection from TNF-α-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by infection experiments with the inducible isoform of NOS, an enzyme that generates NO continuously (16Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Williams D.L. Li J. Lizonova A. Kovesdi I. Kim Y.M. Surgery. 1998; 124: 278-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These experiments, however, left open the question of whether endothelial and neuronal NOS, whose activity is instead regulated by intracellular messengers (22Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), would be stimulated to counteract the apoptogenic effect of TNF-α, and whether this would be sufficient to protect cells from death. To address this question, we have investigated cell death in response to TNF-α of a HeLa Tet-off cell line expressing bovine endothelial NOS (eNOS) in an inducible fashion. By comparing the degree of TNF-α-induced apoptosis in cells expressing or not expressing the enzyme, we were able to show that expression of eNOS is sufficient to induce a partially resistant phenotype, and that this effect is due to generation of NO. We have also investigated the mechanism of this resistance, and found that eNOS activity is stimulated by TNF-α itself through a pathway involving ceramide accumulation. Our study shows that eNOS activity is regulated by, and itself regulates, the apoptotic process triggered by TNF-α in a complex regulatory circuit. Bovine eNOS cDNA, subcloned in pBluescript SK, was a kind gift of Dr. William C. Sessa (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The cDNA was excised with EcoRI and ligated in the EcoRI site of plasmid pTRE (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The orientation of the insert was checked by restriction mapping. HeLa Tet-off cells (CLONTECH) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom (UK)), supplemented with 10% Tet system approved fetal bovine serum (CLONTECH), 50 UI/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml G418 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2atmosphere. Cells grown on 35-mm Petri dishes to ∼40% confluence were cotransfected by the calcium phosphate method (23Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) using 0.5 μg of pTRE/eNOS plasmid and 25 ng of pTK-Hygr plasmid (CLONTECH) per cm2 of culture dish. 3 days after transfection, the cells were detached with trypsin and plated in the presence of doxycycline hydrochloride (0.01–1 μg/ml) (Sigma) and hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) (Roche Diagnostics). After 3 weeks, hygromycin-resistant colonies were expanded in 24-well Petri dishes. Stable transfectants were maintained in medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and 10 ng/ml doxycycline. To induce expression of eNOS, cells were plated in the absence of doxycycline. Unless otherwise specified, experiments were carried out on cells cultured for 72 h with or without the antibiotic. A mouse endothelial cell line immortalized with the middle T antigen (E2 cells), a kind gift of Elisabetta Dejana (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy) was maintained in culture as described (24Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed free of medium, solubilized by direct addition of a pre-heated (to 80 °C) denaturing buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics), and immediately boiled for 2 min. After addition of 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol, samples were boiled again and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Monoclonal anti-eNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies were used to reveal the respective antigens. After incubation with secondary reagent (polyclonal anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate; Transduction Laboratories), blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (ECL-Plus; Amersham Pharmacia, Little Chalfont, UK). Cells plated on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka) in 120 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C, were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (25De Silvestris M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were doubly immunostained with monoclonal anti-eNOS and anti-giantin polyclonal antibodies, the latter a kind gift of Dr. M. Renz (Institute of Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Karlsuhe, Germany; see Ref. 26Seeling H.P. Scheanz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Renz M. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bound monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were revealed by fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Preparations were observed under a Nikon Optiphot 2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence or with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser confocal microscope. For the diaphorase reaction, cells, fixed as above, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-NADPH (Sigma), and 0.2 mm nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma), and observed by bright field light microscopy (27Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Fotuhi M. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7797-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). NOS activity was assayed in both homogenized and intact cells by measuring the conversion ofl-[3H]arginine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into l-[3H]citrulline. In the first approach, HeLa or E2 cells were detached by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended (2 × 107 cells/ml) in an homogenization buffer containing 320 mm sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostic). After sonication (30 s at 4 °C), 50 μl of cell extract were assayed in a total volume of 150 μl as described (28Lièvremont J.-P. Sciorati C. Morandi E. Paolucci C. Bunone G. Della Valle G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15466-15472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In some samples 500 μm N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) or 1 mm EGTA were included. NOS activity in intact cells was measured on monolayers washed and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing: 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 1 mmCaCl2 and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with or withoutN ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 500 μm) (Sigma). In the experiments with fumonisin B1 (Fum) (10 μm; Sigma) ordl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) (50 μm; Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) cell were pre-incubated for 3 h in culture medium containing the compounds, which were also added during the subsequent incubation in the reaction buffer. At the end of the pre-incubation, 2.5 μCi/mll-[3H]arginine was added 5 min before cell stimulation with ATP (100 μm) or TNF-α (100 ng/ml; Alexis Italia, Florence, Italy). Nonstimulated cells were run in parallel. 15 min later the monolayers were washed with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, supplemented withl-arginine (5 mm) and EDTA (4 mm). 0.5 ml of 100% cold ethanol was added to the dishes and left to evaporate before a final addition of 2 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.0. Separation of l-[3H]citrulline froml-[3H]arginine was obtained by Dowex 50X8-400 chromatography (Sigma) as described (29Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). In the assay carried out with homogenized cells, values obtained from samples incubated without cell extracts were subtracted. Data in the intact cells are presented without background correction.l-[3H]Citrulline formed was normalized to protein content (bicinchoninic acid assay; Pierce). NO-dependent guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) generation by the transfected HeLa clone Aδ was measured in both the cells themselves and in a coincubation system using PC12 cells as a reporter system. PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% Fetal Clone III, then detached by trypsinization for the experiment. Samples of suspended 2 × 106 HeLa and 0.5 × 106 PC12 cells, either separate or together, were treated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of either ATP (100 μm), TNF-α (100 ng/ml), orS-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine (100 μm; Calbiochem) in 1 ml of a solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 6 mm glucose, 1 mml-arginine, 0.6 mm isobuthylmethylxanthine, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with or without l-NAME (500 μm). In the experiments with Fum (10 μm) and PDMP (50 μm), pre-incubations were for 3 h as described above. The reaction was terminated by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 6%). After ether extraction, cGMP levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) and normalized to cellular proteins as described above. HeLa cells seeded in six-well plates (105 cells/cm2) were incubated in the presence or absence of TNF-α (100 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (CHX; 1 μg/ml). In some samples l-NAME (500 μm) was also present. Cell death was measured using the colorimetric assay with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) (30Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). At the end of the treatments, cell plates were washed with RPMI 1640 (without phenol red) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 2.4 mm MTT in the same medium, the untransformed MTT carefully removed and the dye crystals solubilized in 1 ml of 2-propanol. Absorbance was read immediately in a Uvikon 941 spectrophotometer (test wavelength of 570 nm; reference wavelength of 690 nm). Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using two different protocols as described (31Sciorati C. Rovere P. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Manfredi A.A. Clementi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23211-23215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the first approach, phosphatidylserine exposure was monitored by staining for 15 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (0.5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). In the second approach, the hypodiploid DNA peak in single parameter DNA histograms typical of apoptotic cells was identified. To this end, DNA was stained in unfixed cells incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.1% sodium citrate, 50 mg/ml propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Cells were analyzed for either DNA content or annexin V staining using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACStar Plus, Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA). Samples containing 2 × 106 HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C with or without PDMP (50 μm) and Fum (10 μm) for 3 h, then treated with TNF-α (100 ng/ml) for another 15 min. Conversion of ceramide to the 32P-labeled ceramide phosphate was carried out by diacylglycerol kinase treatment of the extracted lipids in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (19De Nadai C. Sestili P. Cantoni O. Lièvremont J.-P. Sciorati C. Barsacchi R. Moncada S. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5480-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The ceramide phosphates produced were separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5; v/v/v) as solvent. The relevant spots were identified by autoradiography and their radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting. The concentration of ceramide per sample was determined versus a standard curve encompassing the range of ceramide expected in the samples. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.); n represents the number of individual experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test for unpaired variables (two-tailed). *, **, and *** or +, ++, and +++ in the figure panels and tables refer to statistical probabilities (P) of <0.05, <0.01, and <0.001, respectively, as detailed in the legends to figures and tables. For our experiments we chose the Tet-off system (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), which allows repression of a single gene by tetracycline or a tetracycline derivative, such as doxycycline. After transfection of HeLa Tet-off cells with eNOS cDNA together with a plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin, we expanded 30 resistant clones of which 6 expressed eNOS when doxycycline was removed from the medium as established by Western blotting and by immunofluorescence. Since the Tet-off system, by allowing comparison between the “on” and “off” states of the transfected cDNA, permits direct assessment of the consequences of the expression of a single gene in an internally controlled system, we carried out a detailed analysis on only one of the selected clones, clone Aδ. We first analyzed the time course of eNOS induction by removal of doxycycline from the medium (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig.1 A, the removal of doxycycline led to a rapid induction of the expression of eNOS, detectable as a 140,000Mr band (arrowhead in Fig.1 A), which was visible already at 4 h and continued to increase in intensity during the following 3 days. At the later time points, lower Mr bands appeared (see 24-, 48-, and 72-h time points of Fig. 1 A); these were presumably products of eNOS proteolysis, since they were not present in noninduced cells (0- and 2-h time points). Next, we investigated the dependence of eNOS levels on doxycycline concentration. As can be seen from Fig. 1 B, induction was detectable at doxycyline concentrations ≤ 0.1 ng/ml (lanes 3–7). With decreasing doxycyline concentrations, the expression of the enzyme gradually increased, to reach a maximum at an antibiotic concentration of 0.001 ng/ml. To obtain a semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of induction of eNOS expression by doxycyline removal, we compared by Western blotting 30 μg of total protein extract from cells grown in the presence of doxycycline with different quantities of extract from cells grown in the absence of the antibiotic (Fig. 1 C). By loading a large amount of protein and by increasing exposure time of the blot, it was possible to detect a faint eNOS band in noninduced cells, due to basal expression of the cloned cDNA (lane 1). This band was much less prominent than that obtained with 1/10 the amount of lysate from induced cells, whereas it was of intensity comparable to that of the band from 1/100 this amount of lysate (0.3 μg of protein,lane 3). This result indicates that, in response to doxycycline removal from the medium, this clone exhibits an ∼100-fold induction of eNOS expression. We also compared the level of eNOS expression in induced cells with that of endogenous eNOS in a murine endothelial cell line (E2 cells). As shown in Fig. 1 D, the level of eNOS in induced clone Aδ cells (lane 1) was only slightly higher compared with the endothelial cell line (lanes 2 and3). To investigate whether eNOS localization in induced cells corresponds to that of the endogenous enzyme in endothelial cells (33Sessa W.C. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we carried out immunofluorescence analysis. As shown in Fig.2 A, eNOS appeared most concentrated on the surface and in a perinuclear structure in the Golgi region of the cells, as shown by staining for the Golgi marker giantin in the same field of cells (Fig. 2 B). Confocal analysis (panels D–F) confirmed the Golgi localization of eNOS, as is apparent by the yellow color in the merged image of the double-stained cells (F). We then analyzed the Ca2+-dependent activity of eNOS in homogenized and intact cells, by measuring the conversion of its substrate, l-arginine, into l-citrulline. As shown in Fig. 3 A, citrulline formation in eNOS-expressing (dox−) cells was stimulated by Ca2+ (363 ± 4.1%, n = 4 over the activity in the presence of EGTA). The Ca2+-dependent activity was ∼2.5 pmol/mg min−1, a value approximately 3-fold higher than those reported in the literature for endothelial cells (see,e.g., Ref. 34Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We also obtained similar activity values in the E2 cell extracts (data not shown). The Ca2+-dependent NOS activity was nearly completely abolished by the NOS inhibitor l-NMMA. In cells grown in the presence of doxycycline, instead, neither EGTA norl-NMMA induced significant changes in citrulline formation. In intact cells (Fig. 3 B), NOS activity was stimulated using ATP, an agonist of P2y receptors known to increase [Ca2+]i in HeLa cells. ATP increased l-citrulline formation with respect to untreated controls only in eNOS-expressing (dox−) cells, and this effect was prevented by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME. In contrast, no changes were observed in cells cultured in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 3 B). The amplitude of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by ATP (measured with fura-2; see Ref. 35Clementi E Vecchio I. Corasaniti M.T. Nisticò G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was similar in dox− and dox+ cells (data not shown). We also carried out a morphological analysis of the diaphorase activity of eNOS. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the NADPH-dependent reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium generated a dark precipitate in eNOS-expressing cells grown in the absence of doxycyline (panel b), whereas cells cultured in the presence of the antibiotic remained colorless (panel a). The localization of the precipitate in induced cells was reminiscent of that of the enzyme itself detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). To investigate whether eNOS-expressing cells are able to generate bioactive NO, we measured formation of cGMP, a good proxy for NO since soluble guanylate cyclase is activated by nanomolar concentrations of the gas (36Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Exposure to ATP (15 min) of cells grown in the presence of doxycycline did not result in any increase in cGMP over non stimulated controls (0.36 ± 0.02 and 0.35 ± 0.03 pmol/mg min−1, respectively; n = 4). In eNOS-expressing cells, administration of ATP resulted in a slight increase in cGMP formation over controls (0.44 ± 0.03 and 0.33 ± 0.01 pmol/mg min−1, respectively;n = 3), which was not observed in the presence ofl-NAME (0.28 ± 0.02 pmol/mg min−1), suggesting that these cells express low levels of guanylate cyclase. Therefore, to detect generation of cGMP, we used another cell type, the pheochromocytoma PC12, as a reporter system. These cells were chosen because they respond to NO with generation of cGMP (0.33 ± 0.04 and 9.45 ± 0.1 pmol/mg min−1 in controls and cells incubated with 100 μm of the NO donorS-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine, n = 3,p < 0.001), whereas they do not generate cGMP when treated with ATP (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 D, coincubation of eNOS-expressing (dox−) HeLa cells together with PC12 cells resulted in an increased generation of cGMP after administration of ATP, which was inhibited by the presence of l-NAME. No changes in cGMP formation were observed with cells grown in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 3 D). To inves"

Here we explored the influence of temperature on the structure of the individual components and the functional properties of the chaperone system. GrpE undergoes extensive but fully reversible conformational changes in the physiologically relevant temperature range (transition midpoint at ∼48 °C), as observed with both circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry, whereas no thermal transitions occur in DnaK and DnaJ between 15 °C and 48 °C. The conformational changes in GrpE appear to be important in controlling the interconversion of T-state DnaK (ATP-liganded, low affinity for polypeptide substrates) and R-state DnaK (ADP-liganded, high affinity for polypeptide substrates). The rate of the T → R conversion of DnaK due to DnaJ-triggered ATP hydrolysis follows an Arrhenius temperature dependence. In contrast, the rate of the R → T conversion due to GrpE-catalyzed ADP/ATP exchange increases progressively less with increasing temperature and even decreases at temperatures above ∼40 °C, indicating a temperature-dependent reversible inactivation of GrpE. At heat-shock temperatures, the reversible structural changes of GrpE thus shift DnaK toward its high-affinity R state.

The DnaK chaperone system has been studied extensively in vitro at ambient temperatures. The model cycle of the system may be summarized as follows (Fig.1 A; Refs. 5Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L.

The conversion of DnaK from its T state to the R state is mediated by DnaJ, which accelerates the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP. The conversion from the R state back to the T state is triggered by GrpE, which facilitates the exchange of DnaK-bound ADP for ATP. The affinity of T-state DnaK for peptide and protein substrates is low, and both binding and release of substrates are fast. In contrast, the substrate affinity of R-state DnaK is high, and the rates of binding and release of substrates are too slow to be of physiological significance. Thus, a substrate is first bound by T-state DnaK, which is then converted to the high-affinity R state in a DnaJ-triggered reaction. With the assistance of GrpE, DnaK is re-converted into the low-affinity T state, releasing the substrate. The expression of DnaK and the co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE is controlled by the transcription factor ς32 (for a review, see Ref. 12Connolly L. Takashi Y. Gross C.A. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 13-33Google Scholar). The expression levels of chaperones and co-chaperones are enhanced by heat shock, resulting in an approximately 2-fold increase in the cellular concentrations of DnaK (13Mogk A. Tomoyasu T.

Sandmeier, manuscript in preparation. Here we report a study of the effect of heat-shock conditions on the DnaK chaperone system itself. We found the co-chaperone GrpE to undergo a reversible conformational transition within the physiologically relevant temperature range that appears to be of functional significance. DnaK was purified as described previously (6Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. To prepare stock solutions for experimentation, samples containing ∼12 mg of DnaK were thawed, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon-30; Amicon) to 500 μl, and transferred to assay buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, or 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for circular dichroism experiments) by size exclusion chromatography (NAP-10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein concentration was determined photometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of ε280 = 14,500m−1 cm−1(14Hellebust H. Uhlen M. Enfors S.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of DnaK stock solutions were ∼100 μm. The nucleotide content was <0.1 mol nucleotide/mol DnaK (15Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DnaJ (110 μm; in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7) and GrpE (200 μm; in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7) were prepared as described elsewhere (16Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol.

For circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry, GrpE was dialyzed against 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The amino acid sequence of peptide ala-p5 (ALLLSAPRR) is derived from the 23-residue prepiece of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase of chicken, which has previously proven to be a high-affinity ligand for DnaK (6Schmid D.

Synthesis and labeling of the peptide (purity > 95%) are described elsewhere (10Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol.

The concentrations of the stock solutions of ala-p5 and a-ala-p5 were 1.9 mm in water and 240 μm in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, respectively. N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5′-diphosphate (MABA-ADP)2was a gift from Dr. J. Reinstein (Max Planck Institut für molekulare Physiologie, Dortmund, Germany) and had been synthesized as described elsewhere (9Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A fresh ATP stock solution (50 mm disodium salt, pH 7.0; Fluka) in assay buffer was prepared before every experimental series. The ADP/Pi stock solution was 38 mm ADP (disodium salt; Fluka), 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Circular dichroism was measured with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a thermostated cuvette of 1 or 0.2 mm path length. The temperature was controlled with a programmable water bath. At fixed temperatures, four spectra (2 nm bandwidth) between 250 and 185 nm were recorded at a scan rate of 5 nm min−1 and averaged. The time course of temperature-induced conformational changes was followed by continuously monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm at a scan rate of 1 degree min−1. A VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) equipped with twin coin-shaped cells of 0.52 ml volume was used. Technical details and performance of the instrument have been described elsewhere (19Plotnikov V.V. Brandts J.M. Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed for 18 h against the same batch of buffer that was used to establish the baseline (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). Instead of degassing the sample, two successive pre-scan cycles of heating and rapid cooling were performed between 5 °C and 35 °C. The scanning rate was 1 degree min−1. The data were corrected for the buffer-buffer baseline and normalized for the concentration. An Applied Photophysics SX18 MV stopped-flow apparatus served to record the changes in intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK (excitation at 290 nm; emission high-pass filter 305 nm), acrylodan fluorescence of peptide a-ala-p5 (excitation at 370 nm; emission high-pass filter 455 nm), or MABA fluorescence of MABA-ADP (excitation at 360 nm; emission high-pass filter 455 nm). The temperature was controlled with a water bath. The instrument was equilibrated at the respective temperature (± 0.5 °C) for at least 3 min before performing the experiments. ADP/Pi, MABA-ADP, and peptide were preincubated with DnaK for ∼1 h at ambient temperature. All experiments were performed in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.0) and were started by mixing equal volumes of the two reaction solutions (∼70 μl each). The data were evaluated with the software provided by the manufacturer of the instrument. The standard error of the rate determinations was between 0.5% and 6%, except when the reaction (T → R conversion) was not monophasic due to accelerated spontaneous ATP hydrolysis at high temperature (Fig. 8,B and C; standard error 13% and 10%, respectively, at 48 °C). Arrhenius curves were fitted to the rate constants with the Origin program from MicroCal Software (Northampton, MA). The thermal transitions in the secondary structure of DnaK and its co-chaperones were monitored with circular dichroism spectroscopy. GrpE was further examined by differential scanning calorimetry. In ADP-liganded DnaK, no structural changes were observed between 15 °C and 48 °C. At temperatures above the physiologically relevant range, two thermal transitions take place (Fig. 2); the midpoint of the low-temperature transition is at 58 °C, and the midpoint of the high-temperature transition is at 75 °C. In the first thermal transition, ∼40% of the total ellipticity at 222 nm is lost; the residual secondary structure is abolished in the high-temperature transition. The structural transitions become partially irreversible when DnaK is heated to 95 °C. The stability of nucleotide-free DnaK is, as observed previously (20Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5279-5285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), significantly lower than that of the nucleotide-liganded form; in the absence of nucleotide the first transition midpoint is shifted toward lower temperature by 9 °C (data not shown). Similar to nucleotide-liganded DnaK, DnaJ undergoes no structural changes between 15 °C and 48 °C (Fig.3). A single thermal transition with a midpoint at ∼58 °C is observed. The denaturation is irreversible when DnaJ is heated to 95 °C.Figure 3Thermal unfolding of DnaJ. A, changes in circular dichroism were monitored at 222 nm. DnaJ (6 μm) in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was heated to 48 °C in a cuvette with a path length of 1 mm, cooled to 15 °C, heated to 95 °C, and then cooled again to 15 °C, as indicated by arrows (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). B, circular dichroism spectra of 6 μm DnaJ in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, were recorded at 15 °C, 48 °C, after cooling from 48 °C to 15 °C, 95 °C, and after cooling from 95 °C to 15 °C (as indicated in the figure) in a cuvette with a path length of 1 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GrpE undergoes two well-separated temperature-induced conformational transitions, with midpoints at ∼48 °C and 75–80 °C, as evident from both circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (Figs.4 and 5). Experiments at varying concentrations (5–75 μm) of GrpE, which exists as a dimer (Fig. 1 B; Refs. 16Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar and 22Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), indicated the low-temperature transition midpoint to be concentration-independent, consistent with a monomolecular unfolding process (data not shown). The unfolding, as monitored by both loss of ellipticity and change in molar heat capacity, was completely reversible after heating up to 60 °C (Fig. 5). The low-temperature heat capacity peak was broad and asymmetric, indicating that either part of the protein unfolds in a noncooperative manner or several tightly coupled cooperative transitions occur. In the low-temperature transition, ∼25% of the total heat is absorbed. Unlike DnaK and DnaJ, GrpE loses a significant fraction of ellipticity below 48 °C (∼40% of total). A rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the complete unfolding mechanism of GrpE is beyond the scope of the present study and will be the subject of further investigation.Figure 5Differential scanning calorimetry of GrpE. A, GrpE (25 μm) in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was first scanned from 15 °C to 60 °C (bold line) and then from 15 °C to 95 °C after cooling the sample (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). B, the circular dichroism of GrpE as a function of temperature is reproduced here for comparison (from Fig.4 A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the effects of temperature within the physiologically relevant range on the co-chaperone-induced interconversion of DnaK between its low-affinity T state and its high-affinity R state. The rates of these conversions were determined at fixed temperatures during a stepwise increase in temperature from 15 °C to 48 °C and then at fixed temperatures during stepwise cooling of the same solution. Three different types of measurements were performed: (i) DnaK possesses a single tryptophan residue at position 102 that allows spectroscopic monitoring of conformational changes (5Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5279-5285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) the increase in fluorescence intensity of acrylodan-labeled peptide a-ala-p5 upon binding of the peptide to DnaK (6Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) affords another possibility for monitoring the T/R interconversion of DnaK, which is accompanied by changes in the affinity for target peptides (Fig. 1 A; Ref.23Pierpaoli E.V. Gisler S.M. Christen P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16741-16748Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); and (iii) the release of fluorescence-labeled ADP allows the monitoring of the rate-determining step of the nucleotide exchange, which takes place during the R → T conversion (9Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). When the DnaJ-triggered T → R conversion was followed by the increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK, the rates of the conversion as a function of temperature complied with the Arrhenius equation (Fig.6 A). The conversion reactions were performed at 0.5 and 1 μm DnaJ; at all temperatures, their rates proved to be a linear function of the concentration of DnaJ. If we followed the increase in acrylodan fluorescence of peptide a-ala-p5 during the T → R conversion (Fig. 6 B), we observed the same pattern of temperature dependence seen when the intrinsic fluorescence was monitored, although the observed rate constants were somewhat slower. In contrast, if the temperature dependence of the rate of the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion was examined, a reversible temperature-dependent inactivation of GrpE became apparent that above ∼40 °C resulted in decreasing reaction rates (Fig.7 A). The reactions, followed by the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK, were performed at different concentrations of GrpE; at all temperatures, their rates were a linear function of the concentration of GrpE. At all concentrations of GrpE, the fastest rates were measured at ∼40 °C. Similar reaction rates and the same non-Arrhenius temperature dependence were observed when the decrease in acrylodan fluorescence of peptide a-ala-p5 was followed during the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion (Fig. 7 B). The non-Arrhenius temperature dependence was also observed when the release of fluorescent MABA-ADP was followed (Fig. 7 C). The conformation and peptide binding properties of nucleotide-free DnaK are comparable with those of ADP-liganded, i.e.R-state, DnaK (9Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The R → T conversion of DnaK can thus be triggered by the addition of ATP to nucleotide-free DnaK rather than by the addition of GrpE. This experimental setup allows the examination of whether the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence observed in the R → T conversion (Fig. 7) is inherent to the R → T conversion or has to be attributed to the participation of GrpE in this process. The rates of the R → T transition triggered by the addition of ATP to nucleotide-free DnaK in the absence of GrpE and monitored by the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK exhibited an Arrhenius temperature dependence (Fig.8 A). The rates were more than 1 order of magnitude faster than those of the R → T conversion induced by the GrpE-catalyzed exchange of nucleotide (Fig.7 A), in which, under the chosen conditions, the GrpE-catalyzed release of nucleotide is rate-limiting. When the R → T conversion occurred without the need for release of bound ADP (Fig.8 A), the concentration of added ATP (5 and 2.5 mm) did not influence the observed rates. Apparently, the change in conformation of DnaK rather than the binding of ATP is rate-limiting for the observed change in the fluorescence signal. When ADP-liganded DnaK was used (Fig. 8 B), and the R → T conversion occurred through spontaneous exchange of DnaK-bound ADP with ATP in the absence of GrpE, we still observed the Arrhenius temperature dependence of the rates of the R → T conversion, although in this case the rates were several orders of magnitude slower than that seen in the case of nucleotide-free DnaK (Fig. 8 A). Again, the reaction rates did not depend on the ATP concentration, which in this case indicates that the spontaneous release of ADP from DnaK is rate-limiting. When the R → T conversion induced by spontaneous ADP/ATP exchange was followed through the decrease in acrylodan fluorescence of the substrate peptide (Fig. 8 C), an Arrhenius temperature dependence was again found, with the observed rates being about the same as those observed when the intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK was followed (Fig. 8 B). When the spontaneous release of MABA-ADP was followed (Fig. 8 D), the rates also exhibited an Arrhenius temperature dependence. However, the reaction rates were clearly slower than those observed when either the intrinsic fluorescence or the acrylodan fluorescence was followed (Figs. 8, B and C). Because all experiments in Fig. 8 were performed in the absence of GrpE, and in all experiments the R → T conversion showed an Arrhenius temperature dependence, we conclude that the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion (Fig. 7) is due to the participation of GrpE. Our experiments addressed the question of how temperature influences the structure of the components of the DnaK chaperone system (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) and the kinetics of the co-chaperone-controlled T/R interconversion of DnaK. The experiments were performed over a temperature range from 15 °C up to the extreme heat-shock temperature of 48 °C, which approximately corresponds to the upper temperature boundary for growth of E. coli (24Herendeen S.L. Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 185-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide-liganded DnaK proved to be stable against thermal denaturation within this temperature range. In accordance with the stability of nucleotide-liganded DnaK, the steady-state ATPase activity of DnaK in the absence of co-chaperones shows Arrhenius behavior within the physiologically relevant temperature range (25Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At higher temperatures, ADP-liganded DnaK shows two structural transitions (Fig.2). The first transition has been assigned to the NH2-terminal ATPase domain because the isolated ATPase domain undergoes at a similar temperature a thermal transition that is absent in the isolated peptide-binding domain (20Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a notion that has not remained undisputed (26Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The co-chaperone DnaJ was also found to be stable up to 48 °C (Fig. 3), a finding that is consistent with previous studies (27Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The very minor loss in ellipticity that was observed during heating and cooling of DnaK and DnaJ between 15 °C and 48 °C might be due to the fact that the midpoint of the first thermal transition, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry, is at 54.4 °C and 53 °C for DnaK (20Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and DnaJ (27Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), respectively, i.e. close to 48 °C. These midpoint temperatures are lower than those indicated by the circular dichroism measurements (Figs. 2 A and 3 A) and infrared spectroscopy (27Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We also cannot exclude that the observed decrease in circular dichroism is due in part to interactions of the proteins with the surface of the cuvette. GrpE is the only constituent of the DnaK chaperone system that undergoes extensive structural alterations within the physiologically relevant temperature range. In both circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry, the first of the two thermal transitions becomes evident at ∼35 °C and reaches its midpoint at 48 °C (Figs. 4 and 5). This low-temperature transition is fully reversible. Because we did not observe a concentration-dependent shift of the first transition in GrpE, we assume that this transition is not accompanied by a change in the state of oligomerization. This notion is confirmed by the observation that the maximum rates of the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion are always reached at ∼40 °C, irrespective of the concentration of GrpE (see below). A single unfolding transition in GrpE has been reported previously (28Reid K.L. Fink A.L. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism measurements in that study were performed up to a temperature of ∼80 °C, whereby the second thermal transition may not have become apparent. In accord with the thermal stability of DnaK (Fig. 2) and DnaJ (Fig.3), the DnaJ-catalyzed T → R conversion of DnaK shows an Arrhenius temperature dependence within the physiologically relevant temperature range (Fig. 6 A). The rates of increase in fluorescence of peptide a-ala-p5, which accompanies the conversion of DnaK from its low-affinity state to its high-affinity state, showed a similar temperature dependence (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the GrpE-induced R → T conversion substantially deviated from the Arrhenius temperature dependence (Fig. 7 A). The same deviation from normal temperature dependence applied for the GrpE-triggered release of peptide (Fig. 7 B) and the release of fluorescence-labeled nucleotide (Fig. 7 C). However, the R → T conversion, unless triggered by GrpE, complied with the Arrhenius equation. The non-Arrhenius rate-temperature curve was only and always observed if the R → T conversion was catalyzed by GrpE; the deviant temperature dependence must thus be due to GrpE. The obvious sensitivity of the functionality of GrpE toward temperature correlates with the reversible structural transition of GrpE in the same temperature range. Experiments are underway to assign the thermal transitions to specific structural features of GrpE. The decrease in efficacy of GrpE in catalyzing the ADP/ATP exchange at higher temperatures may be due to either a decreased affinity for DnaK or a decreased specific activity. Dimeric GrpE forms a tight complex with DnaK; at ambient temperature, the dissociation equilibrium constant of the GrpE/DnaK complex is estimated to be 1 nmin the absence of nucleotide and 0.22 μm in the presence of MABA-ADP (29Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Varying the concentration of GrpE (0.1–1 μm) does not shift the temperature at which the rate of nucleotide exchange is at its maximum, indicating that the stability of GrpE/DnaK complexes is not significantly impaired at higher temperatures. The crystal structure of GrpE complexed with the ATPase domain of DnaK (22Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) shows several noncontiguous contact areas between DnaK and GrpE, with the two largest being in the β-sheet domain of GrpE. Contact areas are also located at the COOH-terminal end of the long helix of GrpE (Fig. 1 B). Temperature-dependent changes in these contact areas of GrpE might underlie its temperature-sensitive functional behavior. However, limited temperature-dependent structural changes in DnaK itself that might modulate its interaction with GrpE cannot be excluded. An exposed, conserved loop in the ATPase domain of DnaK is needed for stable interaction with GrpE, as has been shown by deletion of this loop (30Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Besides, there might be an additional interaction of the extended helix of GrpE with the peptide-binding domain (22Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for a significant thermal transition in DnaK in the physiologically important temperature range. In view of the thermal transition of GrpE, which is extensive, occurs in the relevant temperature range, and is reversible, GrpE seems to be the prime candidate to control the kinetics of the R → T conversion of DnaK in a temperature-dependent manner. The differential temperature dependence of the DnaJ-dependent T → R conversion and the GrpE-dependent R → T conversion leads, with increasing temperature, to a progressive shift of DnaK toward its high-affinity R state. This shift becomes particularly prominent at heat-shock temperatures due to the decrease in the rate of the R → T conversion. In our experimental setup, i.e. equimolar concentrations of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, the changes in interconversion rates between 15 °C and 48 °C indicate a 10-fold shift in favor of the R state of DnaK at heat-shock temperatures (from 0.7% to 7%; TableI). The fraction of R-state DnaK (7% of the total) seems modest. However, together with the increase by more than 2 orders of magnitude in the rate of ATP hydrolysis,i.e. of the T → R conversion, observed in the presence of a protein substrate (11Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), the shift might result in the sequestering of protein substrates at heat-shock temperatures. During heat shock, DnaK and DnaJ have indeed been reported to cooperatively retain thermally unfolded substrate protein in a folding competent state both in vivo (31Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 32Manukhov I.V. Eroshnikov G.E. Vyssokikh M.Y. Zavilgelsky G.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in vitro (31Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 33Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas GrpE is required for the reactivation of the substrate protein after the heat shock (31Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 33Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The occurrence of a sequestering mechanism at heat-shock temperatures does not preclude the possibility of an additional mechanism of action in which DnaK uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to exert conformational work upon polypeptide substrates that have undergone off-pathway folding (10Pierpaoli E.V.

GrpE homologs exist in bacteria, eukaryotic mitochondria, and chloroplasts, but not in the eukaryotic cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum. Whereas apparently not all Hsp70 systems depend on a separate nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE is essential for bacterial viability at all temperatures (35Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2748-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant of DnaK, which exhibits impaired interaction with GrpE (30Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), has only marginal chaperone activity (36Buchberger A. Gässler C.S. Büttner M. McMacken R. Bukau B. J. Biol.

In vitro, efficient refolding of firefly luciferase requires GrpE in addition to DnaK and DnaJ (7Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The yield of chaperone-assisted refolding of firefly luciferase attains a maximum at a specific molar ratio of GrpE to DnaJ and DnaK (29Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Obviously, the balance of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, accelerated by DnaJ and GrpE, respectively, and thus the ratio of T-state to R-state DnaK, are important for effective refolding of denatured proteins. The amount of the components of the DnaK heat-shock system is known to be controlled through the regulation of transcription, stability, and activity of ς32 (for a review, see Ref. 12Connolly L. Takashi Y. Gross C.A. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 13-33Google Scholar). The differential temperature dependence of the T → R and R → T conversions described in this report might be the basis of a mechanism for adapting the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system to heat-shock conditions by a modulation of functionalityrather than by a regulation of quantity.

https://openalex.org/W2142549451,"Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is frequently associated with mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene. Almost all PS1-associated FAD mutations reported so far are exchanges of single conserved amino acids and cause the increased production of the highly amyloidogenic 42-residue amyloid β-peptide Aβ42. Here we report the identification and pathological function of an unusual FAD-associated PS1 deletion (PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84). This FAD mutation is associated with spastic paraparesis clinically and causes accumulation of noncongophilic Aβ-positive “cotton wool” plaques in brain parenchyma. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to Aβ deposition was widespread as were neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, although tau-positive neurites were sparse. Although significant deposition of Aβ42 was observed, no neuritic pathology was associated with these unusual lesions. Overexpressing PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 in cultured cells results in a significantly elevated level of the highly amyloidogenic 42-amino acid amyloid β-peptide Aβ42. Moreover, functional analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals reduced activity of PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 in Notch signaling. Our data therefore demonstrate that a small deletion of PS proteins can pathologically affect PS function in endoproteolysis of β-amyloid precursor protein and in Notch signaling. Therefore, the PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 deletion shows a very similar biochemical/functional phenotype like all other FAD-associated PS1 or PS2 point mutations. Since increased Aβ42 production is not associated with classical senile plaque formation, these data demonstrate that amyloid plaque formation is not a prerequisite for dementia and neurodegeneration. Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is frequently associated with mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene. Almost all PS1-associated FAD mutations reported so far are exchanges of single conserved amino acids and cause the increased production of the highly amyloidogenic 42-residue amyloid β-peptide Aβ42. Here we report the identification and pathological function of an unusual FAD-associated PS1 deletion (PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84). This FAD mutation is associated with spastic paraparesis clinically and causes accumulation of noncongophilic Aβ-positive “cotton wool” plaques in brain parenchyma. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to Aβ deposition was widespread as were neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, although tau-positive neurites were sparse. Although significant deposition of Aβ42 was observed, no neuritic pathology was associated with these unusual lesions. Overexpressing PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 in cultured cells results in a significantly elevated level of the highly amyloidogenic 42-amino acid amyloid β-peptide Aβ42. Moreover, functional analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals reduced activity of PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 in Notch signaling. Our data therefore demonstrate that a small deletion of PS proteins can pathologically affect PS function in endoproteolysis of β-amyloid precursor protein and in Notch signaling. Therefore, the PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 deletion shows a very similar biochemical/functional phenotype like all other FAD-associated PS1 or PS2 point mutations. Since increased Aβ42 production is not associated with classical senile plaque formation, these data demonstrate that amyloid plaque formation is not a prerequisite for dementia and neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's disease familial AD β-amyloid precursor protein transmembrane domain wild type Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is an age-dependent neurogenerative disorder. Although most AD cases occur sporadically, autosomal dominant inheritance has been recorded in numerous families (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Mutations in four genes have been mapped to familial AD (FAD). These include the genes encoding the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), presenilin 1 (PS1), PS2 (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), and α2-macroglobulin (2Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horvath S.M. Go R.C. Perry R. Watson Jr., B. Bassett S.S. McInnis M.G. Albert M.S. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Functional analysis revealed that βAPP and PS mutations affect endoproteolytic processing of βAPP in a very similar manner. In the amyloidogenic pathway, βAPP is first cleaved at the N terminus of the Aβ domain by the recently identified β-secretase (3Vassar R. Citron M. Neuron. 2000; 27: 419-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This generates a membrane-retained C-terminal fragment, which is the substrate for the γ-secretase. γ-Secretase cleaves its substrate within the membrane, which results in the physiological secretion of Aβ (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). About 90% of secreted Aβ terminates at amino acid 40 (Aβ40), while most of the remaining Aβ peptides are elongated by two amino acids (Aβ42). The rare Aβ42 appears to aggregate much faster than Aβ40 (4Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and is therefore the major constituent of senile plaques (6Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. Cairns N.J. Lantos P.L. Nochlin D. Sumi S.M.

Med. 1996; 2: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). FAD-associated mutations found within βAPP, PS1, and PS2 all cause the increased production of this highly amyloidogenic Aβ variant and therefore increase the kinetics of Aβ aggregation and of its deposition in congophilic senile plaques (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). PS proteins not only affect the γ-secretase cleavage in FAD cases but are also required for physiological Aβ generation, since a PS1 ablation results in a dramatically reduced Aβ production (8De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutagenesis of two critical aspartate residues located within transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (TM6 and -7) also results in an inhibition of Aβ generation (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Similar mutations in human PS2 also reduce Aβ generation (10Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S. Hardy J., Yu, X. Picciano M. Fechteler K. Citron M. Kopan R. Pesold B. Keck S. Baader M. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol.

Romig H. Walter J. Grunberg J. Brand M. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13602-13609Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In all cases, inhibition of PS function not only reduced Aβ generation but also concomitantly increased the corresponding membrane-retained βAPP C-terminal fragments, which are the immediate precursors for Aβ generation. Since two critical aspartate residues are required within the catalytic center of aspartyl proteases and since γ-secretase function can be blocked by aspartyl protease inhibitors (13Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), it was recently claimed that PS proteins may be identical with the γ-secretase (14Wolfe M.S. De Los Angeles J. Miller D.D. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PS proteins not only support the intramembraneous endoproteolysis of βAPP but are also required for the similar cleavage of Notch (10Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S.

The endoproteolytic cleavage of Notch appears to be required for the generation of the Notch intracellular cytoplasmic domain (18Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), which translocates to the nucleus, where it is involved in transcriptional regulation (19Haass C. De Strooper B. Science. 1999; 286: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A function of PS in Notch signaling is also supported by the phenotypes observed in various PS1/PS2 deletions in mice (20Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S.

Moreover, several mutant alleles of theCaenorhabditis elegans PS homolog sel-12 cause an egg-laying phenotype, which is due to a functional deficit in Notch signaling (24Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The failure in Notch signaling in worms can be functionally rescued by transgenic expression of human PS1 or PS2 (10Steiner H.

FAD-associated PS mutations occur frequently within the PS1 gene and are associated with the most aggressive AD phenotype (27Wisniewski T. Dowjat W.K. Buxbaum J.D. Khorkova O. Efthimiopoulos S.

However, none of the deletions are directly associated with a pathological function. We have shown previously that the pathological activity of the PS1 Δexon9 splicing mutation (28Perez-Tur J. Froelich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F. Roques P. Fuldner R.A. Johnston J. Cowburn R. Forsell C. Axelman K. Lilius L. Houlden H. Karran E. Roberts G.W. Rossor M. Adams M.D. Hardy J. Goate A. Lannfelt L. Hutton M. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) is independent of the large deletion and rather due to a single amino acid exchange at the aberrant splice junction at codon 290 (32Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7615-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A genomic deletion of the exon 9-encoded domain (Δexon9 Finn; see below) was reported as well (30Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, due to the aberrant splicing of exon 8 with exon 10, the same amino acid exchange is introduced at codon 290 as observed in the original PS1 Δexon9 splicing mutation. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of PS1 Δexon9 Finn is identical to the PS1 Δexon9 splicing mutation. In analogy to the PS1 Δexon9 splicing mutation (32Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7615-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it would therefore be expected that this mutation (PS1 Δexon9 Finn) produces Aβ42 independent of the exon 9 deletion. The unusual genomic exon 9 deletion of PS1 in the Finnish pedigree is associated with Alzheimer's disease and spastic paraparesis. In contrast to all other AD cases, these patients as well as the patients with the PS1 Δexon9 splicing mutation develop “cotton wool” plaques, which lack a congophilic dense core and plaque-related neuritic pathology (30Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). 2H. Houlden and J. Hardy, unpublished data. 2H. Houlden and J. Hardy, unpublished data.Finally, the deletion produced by the intron 4 mutation of PS1 could not be associated with an increased Aβ42 production (29De Jonghe C. Cruts M. Rogaeva E.A. Tysoe C. Singleton A. Vanderstichele H. Meschino W. Dermaut B. Vanderhoeven I. Backhovens H. Vanmechelen E. Morris C.M. Hardy J. Rubinsztein D.C. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1529-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It rather turned out that a single amino acid insertion, which is generated by aberrant splicing, is responsible for the pathological activity of this mutation (29De Jonghe C. Cruts M. Rogaeva E.A. Tysoe C. Singleton A. Vanderstichele H. Meschino W. Dermaut B. Vanderhoeven I. Backhovens H. Vanmechelen E. Morris C.M. Hardy J. Rubinsztein D.C. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1529-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, no PS1 deletion has so far been associated with increased Aβ42 generation. We have now analyzed the function of a novel PS1 deletion (PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84; Fig. 1), which is also associated with early onset AD and spastic paraparesis. A potentially pathological function in Aβ generation and Notch signaling was specifically investigated. We found that PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 causes increased Aβ42 production like all other FAD-associated PS1/PS2 mutations. The PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 mutation is associated with Aβ deposition in noncongophilic cotton wool plaques, widespread cerebral amyloid angiopathy, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads, although tau-positive abnormal neurites are rare. Antibody 3926 to synthetic Aβ was described before (33Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against amino acids 263–407 of PS1 (3027; BI.3D7) and against amino acids 297–356 of PS2 (3711; BI.HF5c) were described previously (32Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7615-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For tau immunohistochemistry, the AT8 antibody (Innogenetics, Belgium) and mouse monoclonal antibody PHF1 (a gift from Peter Davies) were used. An anti-GFAP antibody (Dako, UK) was used for the detection of astrocytosis. The presence of microglia was detected with an antibody against major histocompatibility complex class II proteins (clone CR3/43), which was obtained from Dako, UK. For Aβ immunohistochemistry, N-terminal antibody 6F/3D to Aβ8–17 (Dako, UK) or 6E10 to Aβ1–17 (Senetek) as well as C-terminal specific antisera recognizing Aβ ending at Ala42 (antibody 44-344; Immunogenetics, Belgium) or Val40 (antibody 44-348; Immunogenetics, Belgium) were used. Brains from the patient with the PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 mutation and from a patient with a PS1 T115C mutation were collected at postmortem and fixed in 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline. Blocks from the major anatomical areas, including the hippocampal formation, were processed in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Bielschowsky's silver impregnation methods. Congo red and thioflavine S methods were used to detect Aβ deposits in β-sheet conformation. For immunohistochemistry, 4-, 7-, or 20-μm sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated using graded alcohols. For PHF1, AT8, and CR3/43 immunohistochemistry, sections were pretreated in a microwave oven in sodium citrate buffer for 20 min, for GFAP immunohistochemistry in trypsin for 10 min, and for Aβ, Aβ40, and Aβ42 immunohistochemistry in formic acid for 10 min followed by treatment in a pressure cooker in citrate buffer for 10 min. After washes in phosphate-buffered saline and 10% milk, sections were incubated with the PHF1 antibody at 4 °C or with the GFAP, AT8, CR3/43, Aβ, Aβ40, and Aβ42 antibodies at room temperature. Detection of antibody binding was either performed with the ABC or the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase system (DAKO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Either diaminobenzidine/H2O2 or neufuchsin was used as chromogen. Genomic DNA and mRNA were extracted from blood and frozen brain, respectively. All exons of the PS1 gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and Big Dye sequencing. Sequence analyses of PS1 exon 4 revealed a heterozygous deletion of ATCATG at codons 83 and 84 (isoleucine-methionine) of the gene. The corresponding cDNA encoding PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 was cloned into pcDNA3.1-zeo(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (K293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418 (to select for βAPP expression), and 200 μg/ml zeocin (to select for presenilin expression). K293 cells stably expressing PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 were generated by transfection of K293 cells stably expressing βAPP containing the Swedish mutation (34Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L.

Following gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitated PS proteins were identified by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody BI.3D7 (PS1) or BI.HF5c (PS2) (32Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U.

Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Conditioned media (2 ml) were collected from confluent K293 cells in six-well dishes for 24 h. The media were assayed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 according to a previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (36Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.M. Selkoe D.J. Romig H. Mendla K.

To construct a new sel-12 expression vector, a 3.0-kilobase pair fragment of cosmid C08A12 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers CCC GGC TGC AGC TCA ATT ATT CTA GTA AGC and GTC TCC ATG GAT CCG AAT TCT GAA ACG TTC AAA TAA C and cloned into pPD49.26 (37Fire A. Harrison S.W. Dixon D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 93: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid contains only nontranscribed sequences from the 5′ region of the C. elegans sel-12 gene. PS1 derivatives were cloned into this vector as aBamHI/SalI fragment. Transgenic lines were established by microinjection of plasmid DNA mixtures into the C. elegans germ line to create extrachromosomal arrays (26Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grunberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Four independent lines from the progeny of F2 generation animals were established. Since the sel-12(ar171) animals never lay eggs (26Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grunberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), rescue of the sel-12 defect can be quantified by scoring egg-laying behavior in transgenic animals (26Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grunberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 50 transgenic animals of each line were analyzed for their ability to lay eggs. The numbers of eggs laid by individual transgenic animals were counted and placed into four categories: Egl+++, robust egg laying, more than 30 eggs laid; Egl++, 15–30 eggs laid; Egl+, 5–15 eggs laid; Egl−, 0–5 eggs laid. Several families were identified by Houlden et al. (38Houlden H. Baker M. McGowan E. Lewis P. Hutton M. Crook R. Wood N.W. Kumar-Singh S. Geddes J. Swash M. Scaravilli F. Holton J.L. Lashley T.

Here we present the detailed pathological, biochemical, and functional analysis of one of these families. Neuropathological examination of a large Scottish family (Fig.1 A) revealed the presence of large cotton wool plaques (see below) similar to those seen in the Finnish family (30Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat.

Neurology. 2000; 54: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed the presence of an exon 4 deletion (ATC-ATG; isoleucine-methionine) of codons 83 and 84 of the PS1 gene. The mutation was not present in 100 controls. The PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 deletion occurs within TM1 of PS1 (Fig. 1 B). TM1 may be functionally important, since other mutations were previously located in that region. Interestingly, the PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 deletion is located immediately C-terminal to the V82L mutation (40Campion D. Flaman J.M. Brice A. Hannequin D. Dubois B. Martin C. Moreau V. Charbonnier F.

Neuropathological investigation of the PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 case by hematoxylin/eosin staining, Bielschowsky's silver staining, and Aβ immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of widespread cotton wool plaques (Figs. 2 and3). These plaques were most frequently found in the neocortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Cotton wool plaques appeared in the neuropil as round, eosinophilic, and strongly Aβ-positive structures often larger than 100 μm in diameter. These frequently seemed to displace other elements such as neurons, a finding readily noticeable in the hippocampus (Fig. 2, A andB). Cotton wool plaques did not generally contain amyloid, since they were negative or occasionally very weakly stained by Congo red and weakly positive with thioflavine S (Fig. 2,C–E). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was widespread, capillaries having thickened walls, which, together with the affected arterioles, showed apple green birefringence following Congo red staining and strong fluorescence with thioflavine S (Fig. 2,C–E). Bielschowsky silver staining (Fig.2 B) and tau immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2, F andH) revealed that neurofibrillary tangle pathology was widespread in the neocortex and hippocampal formation, although the dentate fascia was spared. Fine neuropil threads were a prominent feature within the cortices, and AT8 as well as PHF1 immunohistochemistry also revealed that the cotton wool plaques contained many thread-like processes but were only rarely associated with abnormal neurites (Fig. 2, F and H). In contrast, numerous tau (Fig. 2 G) and silver-positive abnormal neurites (data not shown) were seen in association with the classical plaques found in the control case with a PS1 T115C mutation (42Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 G). GFAP immunostaining demonstrated a relatively sparse astrocytic response to the cotton wool plaques (Fig.2 I). Furthermore, no significant microglial activation (CR3/43 immunostaining) was observed in association with cotton wool plaques (Fig. 2 J), in contrast to widespread activated microglia that were clustered mostly around the amyloid plaques in the PS1 T115C case (Fig. 2 K).Figure 3Cotton wool plaques associated with the PS1 ΔI83/ΔM84 mutation contain Aβ42.

https://openalex.org/W1971451190,"Sorting nexins are a family of phox homology domain containing proteins that are homologous to yeast proteins involved in protein trafficking. We have identified a novel 342-amino acid residue sorting nexin, SNX15, and a 252-amino acid splice variant, SNX15A. Unlike many sorting nexins, a SNX15 ortholog has not been identified in yeast or Caenorhabditis elegans. By Northern blot analysis, SNX15 mRNA is widely expressed. Although predicted to be a soluble protein, both endogenous and overexpressed SNX15 are found on membranes and in the cytosol. The phox homology domain of SNX15 is required for its membrane association and for association with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. We did not detect association of SNX15 with receptors for epidermal growth factor or insulin. However, overexpression of SNX15 led to a decrease in the processing of insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors to their mature subunits. Immunofluorescence studies showed that SNX15 overexpression resulted in mislocalization of furin, the endoprotease responsible for cleavage of insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors. Based on our data and the existing findings with yeast orthologs of other sorting nexins, we propose that overexpression of SNX15 disrupts the normal trafficking of proteins from the plasma membrane to recycling endosomes or the trans-Golgi network.

Sorting nexins (SNXs)1 are a family of widely expressed proteins believed to be part of the complex molecular machinery required for protein trafficking (4Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Mammalian SNXs are homologous to several yeast proteins (e.g. Vps5p, Mvp1p, and Grd19p) for which there is strong genetic evidence demonstrating a role in protein trafficking (5Horazdovsky B.F.

SNX1 was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system by virtue of its ability to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (8Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SNX1 was shown to also interact with receptors for insulin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transferrin, and leptin (4Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SNX1 is the mammalian ortholog of Vps5p, a yeast protein that is a component of a multimeric complex (termed the “retromer complex”) involved in retrograde transport of proteins from prevacuolar endosomes to the TGN (9Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). We have previously described three additional sorting nexins: SNX2, SNX3, and SNX4 (4Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); and 10 additional sorting nexins (SNX5–14) have been deposited in GenBankTM. Like SNX1, both SNX2 and SNX4 associate with various receptors. In addition, SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 assemble into oligomeric structures (4Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All 14 SNX molecules contain a phox homology (PX) domain, a conserved sequence of unknown function first identified in the p40phox and p47phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex (10Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PX domains consist of ∼100 amino acid residues, and most contain a proline-rich sequence that may represent an SH3 domain-binding motif (10Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PX domains have been identified in >20 proteins, some of which are involved in protein trafficking in yeast (6Ekena K. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Using a PX domain consensus sequence obtained from SNX1–4 to search the NCBI data base, we identified a cDNA encoding a novel SNX protein, SNX15. We determined a consensus sequence for the phox homology domain of SNX1, 2, 3, and 4 (GenBankTM accession numbers U53225, NP0030901, NP003786, and NP003785, respectively), using clustal W (11Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). We searched the NCBI data base with this consensus sequence using the BLAST algorithm and identified seven human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to a novel sorting nexin, now designated SNX15. Five ESTs (accession numbers T65368, AA351071, F11999, R17390, and AA351142) were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), and plasmid DNA was isolated using reagents provided by CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Using appropriate vector- and sequence-specific primers we determined the nucleotide sequences of the ESTs. The sequence data revealed two groups of SNX15 EST clones. The first group of ESTs encoded a long form of the molecule, designated SNX15. The second group of ESTs encoded a presumed splice-variant of SNX15, designated SNX15A that lacks 270 bp at the 3′ end of the cDNA. Neither group contained a 5′ start site. To obtain additional 5′ sequence including the protein start site, we carried out PCR with a λgt10 universal cDNA library (CLONTECH) as template. Standard molecular biology techniques were used to construct full-length cDNAs. The existence of each full-length SNX15 isoform was confirmed by sequencing an additional full-length EST (accession numberAF001435) and by PCR using tissue-specific cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) and isoform specific primers. All sequencing was performed using the ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI automated sequencer, model 373A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Multiple tissue Northern blots containing ∼2 μg of purified human poly(A)+ RNA and normalized for equal actin loading were obtained from CLONTECH. To obtain a probe for Northern blot analysis, SNX15 cDNA was excised from the epitope-tagged pcDNA3.1+ plasmid construct with Xba I andNot I. The resulting fragment was gel purified using reagents supplied by Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA), and labeled with 32P using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and diluted in Express Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH). Blots were hybridized at 60 °C for 16–18 h and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using PCR catalyzed by Klen-taq (CLONTECH), we introduced c-Myc and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags at the 5′ end of SNX15 and a c-Myc tag at the 3′ end of SNX15A. In addition, using similar methods, we constructed several mutants of SNX15. ΔPX, lacks the N terminus and PX domains of SNX15 (amino acids 1–135). ΔC lacks the entire C terminus of SNX15 (amino acids 136–342), whereas the ΔESP domain lacks the entire ESP domain (amino acids 222–308) plus the remaining 34 C-terminal amino acids of SNX15. Epitope-tagged PCR products were ligated into pcDNA3.1 (+) expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

The pEYFP-Golgi vector encoding the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fused to the N-terminal 81 amino acids of the precursor to human β-1,4 galactosyltransferase was obtained from CLONTECH. Antibodies to the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (C19), the EGF receptor (# 1005), the PDGF receptor (β-isoform; # 958), the human HGF receptor (# 161), and c-Myc (A-14 and 9E-10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HA antibody (HA.11) was from Covance (Richmond, CA). ECL Western blot detection reagents, peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-SNX15 antibodies were made by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and the coding region of SNX15. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed using the pGEX-5x vector from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified fromEscherichia coli using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbits were immunized at Covance Laboratories Inc. (Denver, PA). Anti-tac antibody, clone 7G7/B6 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used to detect the tac-furin chimera. The secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were donkey IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or conjugated to Rhodamine Red (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, West Grove, PA) or goat IgG conjugated to Alexa 350 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). COS7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 2–3 × 105cells were plated into individual wells of a 6-well plate 18–20 h prior to the start of each transfection. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). DNA for transfection was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA (0.8–1.0 μg total/well) in OPTI-MEM (100 μl/well) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was precomplexed with PLUS Reagent (6 μl/well) with later addition of LipofectAMINE (4 μl/well). Cells were transfected for 3–5 h with the DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes in serum free DMEM and then incubated overnight in 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested 24–26 h after the start of transfection. For immunofluorescence studies, COS7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/side of a two-chambered slide (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) 18 h before transfection. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions, using a total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA/6.25 μl of LF2000 reagent/well, with an incubation time of 4 h. Transfected cells were fixed in 2% formalin (v/v) in PBS, incubated with the primary antibody in PBS, 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), and 0.075% saponin (w/v) for 1.5 h, washed, and then incubated with labeled secondary antibody in the same buffer for 45 min (20Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then viewed in a Zeiss Axiophot inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Images were captured with a PentaMAX camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) and IP Labs software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA) was used to process the images. Transfected COS7 cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and scraped into 250 μl of cold lysis buffer/well (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, Plus protease inhibitor tablet) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were solubilized on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble debris. Proteins were detected by standard immunoblotting procedures or by immunoprecipation of extracts (400 μl) with specific antibodies (1:100 dilution; see “Antibodies”). Immune complexes were sedimented with 30 μl of Ultralink immobilized protein A or protein G (Pierce). The beads were washed and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 12.5%). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and epitope-tagged proteins were detected by Western blot followed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS7 cells (2–3 × 105 cells/well), transiently expressing Myc-tagged SNX15 or mutant forms of SNX15 (see above), were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped and lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm ethylenediaminotetraacetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor tablet) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle. To obtain total membrane and cytosolic fractions, the lysates were centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA120.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Following centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of homogenization buffer using eight strokes with a Teflon pestle and a Potter homogenizer. Aliquots of the total lysates, as well as cytosolic and membrane fractions, were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and separated on 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Epitope-tagged molecules were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody and ECL reagents obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Labeling of COS7 cells (2–3 × 105 cells/well) was preformed after 2 h of preincubation in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were labeled for 20 min with 100 μCi/ml of EasyTag Express Protein Labeling Mix (1175 Ci of 35S/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (2 ml). Labeling was terminated by washing the cells twice with ice-cold PBS and replacing with prewarmed (37 °C) DMEM containing 2 mm cysteine and methionine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After chasing for the times indicated in figure legends, media were removed, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and frozen on liquid nitrogen. Cells were scraped, and lysates were prepared by solubilization in ice-cold Kahane buffer + octylglucoside (20 mm octylglucoside, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.025 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.02% NaN3) plus Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatants were then precleared by incubating with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Pierce) for 3 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 1 min), and then the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibody (see figure legends). Antibody complexes were sedimented using 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Protein A pellets were washed twice with Kahane buffer + octylglucoside, once with Kahane buffer, and once with Tris-buffered saline. Gel samples were prepared (see above), and the proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were directly exposed to film and quantified by scanning densitometry using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding the PDGF β-receptor with or without Myc-SNX15 expression vector. 24 h later, the cells were washed twice and then incubated in binding buffer (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin) containing 125I-PDGF-2 (86.9 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h at 4 °C. The media were removed; the cells were washed again and then incubated in fresh binding buffer at 37 °C. After various times at 37 °C, the media were removed, incubated with 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4 °C, and then spun at (16,000 × g for 15 min) to separate the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble counts (intact125I-PDGF) from the trichloroacetic acid soluble counts (degraded 125I-PDGF) present in the medium.125I-PDGF present at the cell surface at each time was determined by treating the cells twice with DMEM plus 25 mmHEPES (pH 3.0) for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the cell surface counts. Preliminary experiments showed that this acid wash procedure removes >95% of the surface bound counts. Lastly, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to collect the remaining cell associated counts (22Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5161-5171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were then treated with trichloroacetic acid (see above). Each fraction was collected and counted (Autogamma Cobra II, Packard Inc., Downers Grove, IL). PX domain sequences were identified by an eight-round PSI-BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.

The PX-containing regions of most available human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins were aligned initially by clustal W (11Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), followed by manual editing, removal of fragmentary and poorly alignable sequences, and trimming of the poorly conserved ends of the alignment. The resulting curated alignment of the ∼100-amino acid residue core of the PX domain sequences contained about 80 potentially informative positions for phylogenetic analysis. This manually curated multiple alignment of PX domain core region sequences was used for phylogenetic analysis, using a variety of methods, including maximum parsimony (24Bhattacharya D. Mol.

Clustering based on sequence similarity rather than phylogenetics was performed by the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages algorithm. 2E. Sonnhammer, unpublished data. In an effort to identify additional members of the sorting nexin family, we compared the predicted amino acid sequences of SNX1–4 (4Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The PX domain was the only region of homology shared by all four molecules. A consensus sequence for the PX domain was created using the clustal W algorithm (11Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and then used to search the dbEST data base of the NCBI. We identified multiple ESTs encoding portions of a new sorting nexin, SNX15. We determined the complete sequence of two ESTs, both of which lacked the 5′-start site. Clone 1 (accession number T65368) was 1779 bp, and clone 2 (accession number AA351071) was 1543 bp. Where the two clones overlapped, their sequences were identical except that clone 2 had an in-frame deletion of 258 bp. To obtain the 5′ start site, we performed nested PCR on brain, lung, and liver cDNA libraries. The longest amplified cDNA fragment contained 358 bp of additional 5′ sequence. We then searched the nonredundant data base of NCBI with full-length SNX15 and identified an independent clone (AF001435) with identical sequence at the 5′ end. This clone (AF001435) had been identified previously as an expressed gene on chromosome 11q13 during the course of positional cloning of the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (29Guru S.C.

The coding sequence for the long form of SNX15 is 2061 bp, and the mRNA appears to contain at least 250 bp upstream from the putative start site and 780 bp of 3′-untranslated region including a poly(A) tail. The protein is predicted to contain 342 amino acid residues and to have a pI of 4.95 (Fig.1 A). SNX15 has 12 amino acid residues at its N terminus followed by a 124-amino acid PX domain. The remaining 206 amino acids comprise the C terminus, which contains a novel 73-amino acid region with homology to several protein families. The first family encodes S. cerevisiae End13/Vps4 (30Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1820-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and its murine ortholog Skd1 (31Scheuring S. Bodor O. Rohricht R.A. Muller S. Beyer A. Kohrer K. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that have ∼30% identity to this region. The second family encodes Emericella nidulans PalB (32Denison S.H. Orejas M. Arst Jr., H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28519-28522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and its yeast and human orthologs (Rim1p and PalBH, respectively) that have ∼25% amino acid identity to this region (33Li W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1997; 145: 63-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Su S.S. Mitchell A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3789-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have designated this region of homology as the ESP domain (for End13, SNX15, PalB). The splice variant of SNX15, SNX15A, is predicted to contain 256 amino acid residues and have a pI of 6.21. It is identical to SNX15 except for the lack of 86 amino acid residues within the C terminus of the molecule. Interestingly, SNX15A lacks a large portion of the ESP domain (amino acids 222–308; Fig. 1 B). Both isoforms of SNX15 lack predicted transmembrane domains or leader sequences and are expected to be soluble proteins. However, when we examined the subcellular distribution of recombinant Myc-SNX15 and Myc-SNX15A in COS7 cells, we found both isoforms in particulate, as well as cytosolic fractions (Fig.2 A). Likewise, fractions prepared from nontransfected COS7 cells and probed with a polyclonal antibody to SNX15, detected SNX15 (∼51 kDa) in both particulate and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2 B), whereas the short isoform, SNX15A (∼37 kDa), was not detected in either fraction. Northern blots of numerous human tissues probed with a SNX15 cDNA probe detected a broad band of ∼2 kilobases. The highest levels of SNX15 mRNA expression were detected in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, kidney, spleen, thymus, and small intestine (Fig.3). Because the conditions used for northern analyses did not allow us to discriminate messages that differed by only a few hundred nucleotides, we screened eight cDNA tissue libraries by PCR using sequence-specific primers to determine the expression pattern of SNX15 and SNX15A. Amplicons representing the long isoform of SNX15 were observed in lung, liver, skeletal muscle, prostate, pancreas, and adult and fetal brain. The short isoform, SNX15A, was present in adult brain, liver, and placenta (data not shown). Previously, we showed that SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 form homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes (4Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To determine whether SNX15 could associate with itself or other SNX molecules, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged SNX15 alone or in combination with Myc-tagged SNX1, SNX2, SNX3, SNX4, or SNX15. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody to show the expression level of the various recombinant Myc-tagged SNXs (Fig.4 C). Cell extracts were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. Similar amounts of HA-SNX15 were expressed and immunoprecipitated in each sample (Fig. 4 B). Reprobing the same precipitates with an anti-Myc antibody showed that HA-SNX15 associates with itself (Fig. 4 A, lane 5), and with Myc-SNX1 (lane 1), Myc-SNX2 (lane 2), and small amounts of Myc-SNX4 (lane 4). In contrast, HA-SNX15 did not associate detectably with Myc-SNX3 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), although Myc-SNX3 was readily expressed (Fig. 4 C,lane 3). Because only small amoun"

Its elevated concentration, up to 10 mm, and the fact that its reduced state is efficiently maintained by NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase (reviewed in Refs.1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

As a redox buffer, GSH is thought to be a major determinant in maintaining a reducing cellular thiol-disulfide balance. GSH is also important as an electron donor for several enzymes that have a reducing step in their catalytic cycle, such as ribonucleotide reductase (4Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In these situations, electrons from GSH are generally transduced to their substrates through glutaredoxins. GSH may protect protein sulfhydryls from irreversible oxidation by glutathionylation (5Thomas D. Barbey R. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol.

It also participates in the detoxification of peroxides, either directly or indirectly as a cofactor of glutathione peroxidase (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in probably all other GSH-containing organisms, GSH is synthesized in two steps beginning with the action of γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (GSH1) (11Kistler M. Maier K. Eckardt-Schupp F. Mutagenesis. 1990; 5: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the condensation of glutamic acid to cysteine, in the rate-limiting step of this biosynthetic pathway. The product of this reaction is γ-glutamylcysteine, which is combined with glycine through the action of glutathione synthase (GSH2) (13Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) to form GSH. Null mutations in GSH1result in GSH auxotrophy (14Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that GSH is essential in yeast. In mammals, GSH is also essential, as demonstrated by the embryonic lethality resulting from disruption of γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase and by the inability of blastocysts isolated from such knock-out strains to grow, except in the presence of GSH or the GSH substitute N-acetyl cysteine (17Shi Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Leiberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The reason for the essential requirement of GSH in eukaryotes is not known. In contrast, GSH is not essential in prokaryotes since strains of Escherichia coli lacking gshA, the homologue of GSH1, can grow in minimal media without GSH supplementation (18Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Apontoweil P. Berends W. Biochim. Biophys.

We wished to understand the basis for the differential requirement of GSH between eukaryotes and prokaryotes by attempting to identify which of the functions of GSH might determine its essential role in yeast. To this end, we investigated whether mutations capable of suppressing the Δgsh1 auxotrophy exist in yeast. We found that mutations of the proline pathway are the only suppressors of the lethal phenotype of the Δgsh1 strain under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, this suppression involves the biosynthesis of a small amount of GSH through a modified proline biosynthesis pathway, demonstrating that there is no single gene mutation able to bypass the yeast GSH requirement. Our data indicate that this requirement is not related to ribonucleotide reduction or to preventing toxic accumulation of non-native protein disulfide, leaving open this question. We used this strain as a model to study the contribution of GSH to oxidative stress tolerance. Y252 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801 amber ade2–101 ochre trp1-Δ1 leu2-Δ1) and Y253 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 amber ade2–101 ochre his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ1) are derived from YPH98 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were used throughout this study. The Δyap1, Δahp1, and Δtsa1 strains were described (22Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YPD1 (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or in minimal media (SD) (0.67% yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) with casamino acid, tryptophan, uracil, adenine, and GSH supplements as appropriate. For anaerobic growth, plates containing SD supplemented with ergosterol (30 mg/liter) and Tween 80 (0.2%), were incubated in an anaerobic chamber in which the oxygen had been removed with a Merck Anaerocult A cassette, as confirmed by an indicator strip color change. With the exception of Δgsh1PRO2–2/Δglr1, the strains used in these assays were all respiration-competent, as shown by their ability to grow on YPG media that contains glycerol as the sole carbon source (not shown). Approximately 2 × 108 cells from an overnight culture were exposed to 3% ethylmethanesulfonate (Sigma) for 25–30 min at 30 °C, followed by a 4 h recovery in SD. Ethylmethanesulfonate-treated cells were spread on SD plates lacking GSH at a density of 5 × 106 cell/plate to select for mutants suppressing the GSH auxotrophy. Genomic DNA was isolated from the ySOG1–2 strain with the Qiagen blood and cell culture DNA kit and partially digested with Sau3AI. 8–15-kilobase-size fragments of the digested DNA were purified with the Qiagen QiaexII Gel extraction kit after separation on an agarose gel and ligated into the BamHI site of centromeric vector Ycp50. 40% of the E. coli transformants contained an insert, resulting in a library consisting of ∼10,000 independent clones. ThePRO2 allele isolated from the library was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers, (5′-CCCGGATCCATTTCTTTTGATGGGCGGC-3′, 5′-CCCGGATCCTCGAGTCAGCTCAAATCGCAT-3′) and ligated into theBamHI site of Ycp50 to create pPRO2–1. The wild type PRO2 expression vector, PRO2, andPRO1 disruption cassettes were gifts from Dr. Brandriss (23Tomenchok D.M. Brandriss M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5364-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Δgsh1 null mutant was created by replacing 180 base pairs upstream and 500 base pairs downstream of theGSH1 ATG with the LEU2 gene. Disruption was confirmed by Southern blot. Oligonucleotide-mediated gene replacement was used to replace the entire coding sequence of GLR1 with the Kluyveromyces lactis URA3 gene and of GPX3with the TRP1 gene. For the patch assay, cells were grown overnight to saturation in YPD, diluted in distilled H2O, and patched (2000 cells/10 μl) on plates containing various concentrations of H2O2 or t-butyl hydroperoxide. Plates were incubated for about 72 h at 30 °C. For the challenge assay, exponentially growing cells (A 600 = 0.3–0.5) in SD were exposed to various concentrations of H2O2 for 1 h and then plated on YPD to determine the number of colony-forming units. Cells (50 ml) grown in SD to an A 600 = 2 were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in distilled H2O (2 ml), and lysed by alternately placing in boiling water 10 min and freezing in dry ice/ethanol for three cycles. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant, which contained the total free cellular GSH (which included the cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum and vacuolar pools) was analyzed for its ability to complement the growth of the Δgsh1 strain previously depleted of its GSH content by overnight growth in GSH free media. For the measurement of GSH in Δgsh1PRO2–1, cells were grown in SD to an A 600 = 0.4 and pulse-labeled with [35S]Met (150 μCi) for 1 h or for 3 h with a second [35S]Met pulse at t = 1 h 30 min, centrifuged, resuspended in 30 μl of distilled H2O, and heated for 10 min at 99 °C. Cell debris was centrifuged, and the supernatant, which contained the metabolic pool, was mixed with an equal volume of performic acid (90% formic acid, 10% H2O2) to resolve GSH into a single oxidized spot. 0.2 μl of each sample was dropped on a thin layer chromatography plate and allowed to migrate twice 6–7 h in the presence of 60% butanol, 10% acetic acid. The dried plate was exposed to autoradiography. Measurement of the GSH pool and GSH biosynthesis rate was performed similarly except that cells were grown in synthetic medium (SM) with glucose (5 g/liter), tryptophan, uracil, lysine, leucine, histidine, and adenine instead of casamino acids (A 600 = 0.4) and labeled with [14C]glucose (150 μCi/ml) or [14C]glutamate for the indicated time. For the measurement of GSH export, 1 mCi of [35S]Met was added to cells and grown in SM (1.2 ml, A 600 = 0.4) for 60 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in SM/distilled H2O (1:9, vol/vol) supplemented with 2% glucose and amino acids, and the supernatant was analyzed for GSH content at the indicated times after evaporation in a SPEEDVAC to 130original volume and then treatment with an equal volume of performic acid. To examine growth-arrested cells, Δgsh1 was depleted of GSH by overnight growth in GSH-free SD medium. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4, treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScalibur. Exponentially growing wild type and Δgsh1 supplemented with GSH were used as controls. The Δgsh1strain is a glutathione auxotroph on minimal (SD) but not on rich media (YPD) (14Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Duncan W.S.S. Jamieson D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains GSH. After GSH withdrawal, the auxotrophic strain underwent growth arrest after about seven generations, forming large unbudded cells followed by a loss of viability after 3–4 days (not shown). GSH, whether in the reduced (14Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) or oxidized form, supported growth of the auxotrophic strain at a concentration as low as 0.5 μm, as did the reduced thiol dithiothreitol (15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) at the mm range concentration (Fig.1 A). However, anaerobic conditions did not rescue the GSH auxotrophy but only delayed growth arrest by several generations (not shown). Similarly, cysteine only delayed growth arrest of a Δgsh1 strain that had not been depleted of GSH and had no effect upon cells that had been previously depleted of GSH by overnight growth in SD media lacking GSH (Fig.1 A). GS-CH3, a GSH derivative with a methyl group replacing the sulfhydryl, did not support growth either (not shown). Microscopic analysis showing a predominance of unbudded cells after GSH withdrawal (not shown) and the analysis of the cellular DNA content by fluorocytometry (Fig. 1 B) suggested that cells arrested predominantly at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This observation and the inability of anaerobic conditions to rescue the GSH auxotrophy strongly suggest that the essential requirement of GSH is not related to ribonucleotide reduction or to preventing a toxic accumulation of non-native protein disulfides (see “Discussion”). Given the apparently essential nature of GSH, we wished to determine whether it was possible to isolate mutations that suppressed the GSH requirement of the Δgsh1 strain. Using ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis, about 40 mutants able to grow on SD without GSH were isolated in each mating type of the Δgsh1strain and labeled SOG (suppressor ofGSH auxotrophy). Complementation analysis showed that nine of the mutants were dominant and that all of the recessive mutations were in the same locus. Two dominant (ySOG1–1,ySOG1–2) and 1 recessive mutant (ysog1–3) were further analyzed. After failing to clone the recessive mutant by library complementation, a genomic library was constructed from the dominant mutant ySOG1–1. Several plasmids able to suppress the GSH auxotrophy of the Δgsh1 strain were isolated from the ySOG1–1-derived genomic library, each containing a related genomic insert. Sequencing one of these inserts showed that it contained an allele of the PRO2 gene, which encodes γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase. The suppression phenotype was further mapped to the PRO2 locus by the ability of thePRO2 allele polymerase chain reaction amplified from the isolated genomic library clone and referred to as PRO2–1 to confer the suppression phenotype to the Δgsh1 strain and by the loss of the ySOG1–1-suppressed phenotype after null disruption of PRO2. The sog recessive suppressor mutations were also mapped to the PRO2 locus by the loss of the suppression phenotype of ysog1–3 upon either expression of wild type PRO2 or deletion of the corresponding locus. Sequencing of PRO2–1 and of the PRO2 alleles ofySOG1–2 and ysog1–3 showed that each contained a single base substitution corresponding to S124P, G148S, and A226V, respectively. The suppressor mutation was established in a fresh background by integrating the PRO2–1 allele at thePRO2 locus in Δgsh1, resulting in strain Δgsh1PRO2–1. PRO2 encodes γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase, which catalyzes the second step of the proline biosynthetic pathway. The first step of this pathway is catalyzed by γ-glutamyl kinase (PRO1), which converts glutamate to γ-glutamyl phosphate (23Tomenchok D.M. Brandriss M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5364-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PRO2 gene product then converts γ-glutamyl phosphate to l-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde, the precursor of l-Δ1-pyrroline-5 carboxylic acid, which is converted to proline by the PRO3 gene product. To further examine the role of this pathway in the suppression phenotype, we disrupted PRO1 in both Δgsh1PRO2–2 and ysog1–3. This restored GSH auxotrophy in both strains, demonstrating that the mechanism of suppression requires γ-glutamyl phosphate as an obligate substrate of the suppressor alleles of PRO2. Note that none of thePRO2 suppressor alleles analyzed had the proline auxotrophy of the null mutations of this gene (23Tomenchok D.M. Brandriss M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5364-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that their proline biosynthetic pathway remained functional (not shown). We wished to determine whether any suppressors of GSH auxotrophy existed independently of the proline pathway. To this end, we performed a mutagenesis in the Δgsh1Δpro1PRO2–1 background. This mutagenesis failed to isolate any new suppressor under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, leading to the conclusion that this pathway is probably the only mechanism that can suppress the GSH auxotrophy of the Δgsh1 strain. Since the suppression of the GSH auxotrophy by alleles of PRO2 could involve the synthesis of GSH, the Δgsh1PRO2–1 strain was analyzed for its GSH content. This strain grew slightly slower than the wild type strain in SD, but the slow growth rate was corrected by the addition of GSH (Fig.2 A). Unlike the wild type strain, which can support the growth of the Δgsh1 strain when grown in its vicinity, presumably by releasing GSH into the medium, Δgsh1PRO2–1 failed to cross-feed Δgsh1 (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that if Δgsh1PRO2–1 contains GSH, it is present in very limiting quantity. We more directly analyzed the presence of GSH by thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the yeast metabolic pool after [35S]methionine metabolic labeling (Fig. 2 C). GSH was visible as a discrete spot in wild type but not in Δgsh1 cell extracts. In Δgsh1PRO2–1 cells, glutathione was not visible after a 1-h labeling but could be detected after a 3-h labeling. To further quantify the presence of GSH in Δgsh1PRO2–1, we used an assay based upon the ability of cell extracts to support the growth of Δgsh1 (Fig.2 D). Δgsh1PRO2–1 cell extracts could support the growth of Δgsh1 with an efficiency similar to that of wild type extracts diluted 150-fold. This confirmed the presence of GSH in Δgsh1PRO2–1 at levels about 0.5–1% that of wild type levels. The growth support provided by this extract could not be due to cysteine, because cysteine is not a GSH substitute (see Fig.1 A). This demonstrates that the mechanism of suppression by alleles of PRO2 involves the synthesis of small amounts of GSH. Since the Δgsh1PRO2–1 strain contains very low levels of GSH, we considered that its ability to reduce GSSG might become essential for cell viability. Therefore, we disrupted the GLR1 gene in wild type, Δgsh1, and Δgsh1PRO2–1. Despite the absence of glutathione reductase, the Δgsh1PRO2–1Δglr1 strain retained the ability to grow on minimal media without GSH supplement. Interestingly, we also observed that the growth of Δgsh1Δglr1 could be supported by GSSG (data not shown), suggesting that either an alternate mechanism for GSSG reduction exists in yeast or, less likely, that GSSG can somehow perform the essential role of GSH in yeast. Previous examinations of the contribution of GSH to the tolerance to oxidative stress could have been limited by the GSH requirement of the Δgsh1 strain. The Δgsh1PRO2–1 strain seemed in this regard an appropriate model. On YPD plates (Fig. 3,A and B), the Δgsh1PRO2–1 strain had a wild type H2O2 (A) tolerance but was slightly sensitive to t-butyl hydroperoxide (B, t-BOOH). On SD plates (C andD), the H2O2 (C) but not the t-BOOH (D) tolerance was slightly decreased (Fig. 3,C and D). Δglr1 is hypersensitive to peroxide (24Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and its deletion in Δgsh1PRO2–1(Δgsh1PRO2–1Δglr1) further decreased the peroxide-sensitive phenotype of both mutations (A–D). To further evaluate the contribution of the GSH pathway to the defense against peroxide, we compared the H2O2tolerance of Δgsh1PRO2–1 to that of strains lacking either the oxidative stress response regulator Yap1 (25Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 26Schnell N. Krems B. Entian K.-D. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In all conditions tested, Δgsh1/PRO2–1 was the least sensitive to peroxide among these strains, clearly demonstrating that normal levels of GSH are not critical in this response as measured by the plate assay. We also examined the tolerance to H2O2 by a challenge assay in liquid medium. In contrast to the plate assay, Δgsh1PRO2–1 was considerably more sensitive than wild type (Fig. 4). Since the challenge assay measures the cell tolerance to an acute exposure to high levels of H2O2, whereas the plate assay examines the growth adaptation to a moderate concentration of this oxidant, these results might indicate that GSH is more important for acute stress rather than for the adaptation to H2O2. As another means of evaluating the importance of GSH during the H2O2-adaptive response, we measured its biosynthesis rate by pulse-labeling cells for 5 min after exposure to 0.6 mm H2O2(Fig. 5 A). Surprisingly, compared with untreated cells, the amount of labeled GSH was significantly lower both 20 and 50 min after H2O2 exposure, suggesting either a decrease in the GSH biosynthesis rate or a release of GSH in the extracellular milieu. However, the GSH pool, estimated by labeling cells for 2 h before exposure to H2O2, was similar in untreated cells and in cells that had been exposed for 20 min to H2O2 (Fig. 5 B). As another control, exposure to 0.6 mm H2O2 during either 20 or 50 min did not increase the GSH levels in the extracellular milieu (Fig. 5 C), demonstrating that the decrease of 5-min pulse-labeled GSH after exposure to low H2O2 concentrations is most likely due to a decreased synthesis rate. Since GSH1 is induced by H2O2 (30Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Micro. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), the decreased synthesis rate of GSH after exposure to H2O2 could be related to a decreased availability of cysteine, as this amino acid can be limiting for GSH synthesis (32Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The addition of cysteine to the medium indeed significantly increased to the same extent the GSH synthesis rate of untreated and H2O2-treated cells (Fig.5 D), suggesting that this amino acid is limiting for GSH biosynthesis, especially under oxidative stress conditions. The essential nature of GSH in yeast (14Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Duncan W.S.S. Jamieson D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in mammals (17Shi Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Leiberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) but not in prokaryotes provides an interesting puzzle. To address this difference, we designed a genetic selection for mutations that could bypass the requirement for GSH in yeast. We found that mutations in the proline biosynthetic pathway could suppress this requirement but actually did so by restoring the synthesis of GSH. These mutations were unique, since a second screen after ablation of the proline pathway did not yield any other suppressor under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Therefore, no single gene mutation can suppress the GSH growth requirement, suggesting that more than one mutation might be needed or, alternatively, that GSH is absolutely essential in yeast, and there is no genetic condition that can suppress this requirement. The suppression by alleles of PRO2 involves the biosynthesis of small quantities of GSH. Although not very efficient, the modified proline pathway provides about 0.5–1% wild type GSH content, which is therefore a quantity compatible with the viability of the strain. What could then be the GSH biosynthetic mechanism by the modified proline pathway? Deletion of either PRO1 or PRO2abolishes the suppression phenotype, demonstrating that formation of γ-glutamyl phosphate is required for the suppression as an obligate substrate for the modified PRO2 allele. It is thus probable that the PRO2 suppressor alleles allow condensation of cysteine to the enzyme-bound γ-glutamyl phosphate to produce γ-glutamylcysteine. However, it is not clear how the addition of cysteine to γ-glutamyl phosphate occurs, whether spontaneous, catalyzed by mutant Pro2p, or perhaps by a transpeptidase. The suppression of the GSH auxotrophy by alleles of PRO2illustrates how a biosynthetic pathway can be genetically diverted from its natural role to fulfill another function. In bacteria, only the simultaneous inactivation of both the GSH or the thioredoxin pathways results in aerobic inviability due to defects in protein thiol maintenance and/or ribonucleotide reduction (33Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 34Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, anaerobic conditions restore growth because of the presence of an E. colialternative ribonucleotide reductase that is independent of disulfide reduction (35Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8759-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and also by the likely decrease in non-native disulfide bond formation. In contrast, GSH is essential in yeast (Refs. 14Wu A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Duncan W.S.S. Jamieson D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand this work). This essential function is not related to ribonucleotide reduction since Δgsh1 arrests in G1 with predominantly unbudded cells after GSH withdrawal, whereas a strain with a defect in ribonucleotide reduction and, therefore, DNA synthesis would be expected to arrest with large buds in S phase (36Wang P.J. Chabes A. Casagrande R. Tian X.C. Thelander L. Huffaker T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6114-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, the failure of anaerobic conditions to rescue the viability of Δgsh1 indicates that its lethal phenotype is probably not related to oxidative stress or to toxic accumulation of non-native protein disulfides. Furthermore, in the latter case, it is expected that thioredoxin would compensate for the lack of GSH. The GSH auxotrophy is also not due to a defect in sulfate assimilation since methionine and cysteine cannot rescue the growth defect of Δgsh1. What could then be the essential function of GSH in yeast? This essential function is clearly dependent on the redox properties of GSH, since it can be replaced by a thiol such as dithiothreitol (15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) but not by a GSH analog with a methyl group instead of a thiol. Since GSH is the reductant for glutaredoxin and glutaredoxin is also essential (37Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), their essential function(s) might be the same. One or more essential enzymes requiring the reduction of a disulfide bond to complete their catalytic cycle might be exclusively dependent on the GSH reductive pathway in yeast. A search for the cellular targets of glutaredoxin might help us understand the essential requirement for GSH in yeast. Yeast cells depleted of GSH were shown to be hypersensitive to peroxides and to superoxide-generating drugs (13Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,16Duncan W.S.S. Jamieson D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This together with the inducibility of GSH1expression by oxidants suggested that GSH provides an important defense mechanism against oxidative stress (3Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Redox Report. 1996; 2: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We reevaluated this question with Δgsh1PRO2–1 and observed that it was indeed sensitive to H2O2 by the 1-h challenge assay in liquid medium. However, when measured by the plate assay, Δgsh1PRO2–2 had a near wild type H2O2 tolerance on YPD (Fig. 3 A) and was just slightly sensitive to this oxidant on SD (Fig. 3 C). Still, Δgsh1PRO2–1 was moderately sensitive tot-butyl hydroperoxide but not as sensitive as strains lacking the Yap1 regulator or the peroxidases encoded byGPX3 or AHP1. The difference regarding the peroxide tolerance of strains with low GSH intracellular levels between the reported literature and this study might be accounted for by the fact that the Δgsh1 strain used in those studies was respiratory-deficient, which by itself lowers the tolerance to oxidative stress (38Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas Δgsh1PRO2–1 was respiration-proficient. We conclude that high levels of GSH are important for surviving acute peroxide stress, as measured by the challenge assay, but not for growth adaptation under moderate peroxide concentrations, as measured by the patch assay. An inverse situation was observed with a strain lacking the regulator of the H2O2-adaptive response Yap1, which was hypersensitive to H2O2 in the patch assay but had a wild type resistance to this oxidant in the challenge assay (16Duncan W.S.S. Jamieson D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that, although GSH1 transcription is induced by H2O2 (30Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Micro. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), the GSH synthesis rate decreases upon exposure to H2O2 when cysteine is limiting, suggesting that an increase in GSH might not be essential during adaptation to H2O2. The importance of GSH during an acute exposure to H2O2 might be related to its redox buffering properties. However, during adaptation to H2O2, the GSH levels might not be limiting for its function as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, allowing nearly normal detoxification of H2O2 provided that it is kept reduced by glutathione reductase. Indeed, deletion of GLR1 in Δgsh1PRO2–2 resulted in a drop in H2O2 tolerance which demonstrated that, despite very low levels, GSH could still function in the scavenging of H2O2 in this strain.

Gas6, expressed ubiquitously in bone cells, did not affect the differentiation or the survival of osteoclasts, but stimulated osteoclast function to form resorbed pits on a dentine slice. The expression of its receptor, Tyro 3, was seen only in mature osteoclasts among bone cells. Gas6 up-regulated the phosphorylation of cellular proteins including p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAPK, and increased the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Tyro 3 in isolated osteoclasts. The ability of Gas6 to stimulate pit formation resorbed by osteoclasts was abrogated by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of p42/p44 MAPK. In addition, the Gas6 mRNA level in bone marrow was up-regulated by ovariectomy and was reduced by estrogen replacement.

(Beverly, MA). 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole (SB203580) was purchased from Calbiochem-Novobiochem Co. (La Jolla, CA). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain (25Zimmermann M. Pain. 1983; 16: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6870) Google Scholar). In addition, the experimental work was reviewed by the committee of Tokyo University charged with confirming ethics. Calvariae dissected from 1–4-day-old mice were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and digested with 1 ml of trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 mg of collagenase (Sigma, type 7) for 10 min five times, and cells from fractions 3–5 were pooled. Cells were plated in six-multiwell dishes at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 and grown to confluence in αMEM containing 10% FBS. Mouse osteoblasts (1 × 106 cells/dish) prepared as described above and bone marrow cells (2 × 107 cells/dish) from tibiae of 8-week-old ddY mice were cocultured on 10-cm culture dishes coated with 0.24% collagen gel matrix (Nitta Gelatin, Tokyo, Japan) containing αMEM with 10% FBS, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3(10−8m), and PGE2(10−6m) for 6 days with a medium change every 3 days, and for 1 additional day in αMEM with 10% FBS. After culture for 7 days, non adherent cells were washed with PBS and adherent cells were stripped by 0.2% bacterial collagenase. An aliquot of crude osteoclast preparation (0.1 ml) was further cultured on a dentine slice placed in each well of 96-well dishes containing αMEM and 10% FBS in the presence or absence of Gas6 (10−14 to 10−8m) and/or PD98059 (1–30 μm) and SB203580 (30 μm). After 48 h of culture, cells were removed with 1 n NH4OH solution, and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue. Total area was estimated under a light microscope with a micrometer to assess osteoclastic bone resorption using an image analyzer (System Supply Co., Nagano, Japan). At the same time, cells on a dentine slice in the independent culture were fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS and ethanol-acetone (50:50, v/v), and stained at pH 5.0 in the presence of l(+)-tartaric acid using naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) in N,N-dimethyl formamide as the substrate. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts. Mouse osteoblasts (3 × 104cells/well) and bone marrow cells (1 × 106cells/well) were cocultured in 24-multiwell dishes containing αMEM and 10% FBS in the presence and/or absence of Gas6 (10−14 to 10−8m) for 6 days with a medium change at 3 days. After 6 days of culture, the cells were fixed and stained for TRAP as described above. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts. Coculture of mouse osteoblasts and marrow cells was performed on 10-cm culture dishes coated with 0.24% collagen gel matrix to obtain osteoclasts as described above. After 7 days of culture, dishes were treated with 4 ml of 0.2% bacterial collagenase in αMEM for 20 min at 37 °C, and collected cells were suspended in 170 ml of αMEM and 10% FBS. An aliquot of crude osteoclast preparation (2 ml) was replaced in 12-well dishes, and further cultured. After incubation for 2 h, the plates were treated with PBS containing 0.001% Pronase E and 0.02% EDTA to remove stromal cells. After purification, osteoclasts were cultured in the presence or absence of Gas6 (10−8m) or M-CSF (100 ng/ml) for various periods up to 72 h, stained with trypan blue and TRAP. Trypan blue-negative and TRAP-positive cells were counted as living osteoclasts. Mouse osteoblasts and marrow cells were cocultured in 10-cm dishes as described above. After 6 days of culture, osteoclasts were formed and isolated by 0.001% Pronase E and 0.02% EDTA in PBS. In addition, to obtain osteoclastic cells in various differentiation stages, spleen cells (2 × 108 cells/dish) from 8-week-old mice were cultured on 10-cm culture dishes containing αMEM and 10% FBS with soluble RANKL/ODF (100 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 6 days. Total RNA was extracted from mouse brain, bone marrow cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and cultured spleen cells harvested every day using ISOGEN following the manufacturer's instructions, and 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR using Ampli-Taq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers for Gas6 were sense (5′-CCATCAACCACGGCATGTGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TCGCACACCTTGATTTCCAT-3′) and for Tyro 3 were sense (5′-GGAAGAGACGCAAGGAGAC-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGGGAATGGGGAGACGAC-3′). The cycling parameters were 1 min at 96 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, 1 min 30 s at 72 °C for 25 cycles. The PCR products for Gas6 and Tyro 3 were 589 and 445 base pairs, respectively. Mouse osteoclasts and osteoblasts were lysed with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured using a Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts (60 μg) of cell lysates were electrophoresed by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking nonspecific binding with 5% skim milk, Tyro 3-containing proteins were stained using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacture's instructions. After this visualization, the antibodies on the membrane were stripped in a buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 40 min. To ascertain the specificity of these blottings, the stripping membrane was further immunoreacted with polyclonal anti-Tyro 3 and respective blocking peptide, and the immunoreactive bands were again visualized under the above conditions. The immunoreactivity to anti-Tyro 3 was not lost by this stripping procedure. Isolated mouse osteoclasts were incubated in αMEM, 0.1% FBS for 2 h and treated with Gas6 (5 × 10−9m) for various periods (0–10 min). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were analyzed by Western blot as described above. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was incubated with monoclonal mouse antibody against phosphotyrosine and with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction following the manufacturer's instructions. After the antibody was stripped from the membrane, membranes were incubated with 5% skim milk to block nonspecific binding, and then with monoclonal mouse antibody against p60v-src, monoclonal mouse antibodies against phospho-p44/42 MAPK, -JNK MAPK, polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized as described above. Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) from osteoclasts stimulated with Gas6 for various periods were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of polyclonal goat antibody against mouse Tyro 3 for 4 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.). The immune complex was washed three times with TNE buffer and three times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 10 mm MgCl2); the samples were then resuspended in 60 μl of kinase buffer with 1 μCi (37 kBq) of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 4× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8 mm EDTA, 12% SDS, 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. Eight-week-old female ddY mice were subjected to either dorsal ovariectomy or sham operation under general anesthesia. The OVX mice were implanted with either a placebo pellet (n = 6) or a slow release (21 days) pellet containing 10 μg of 17β-estradiol (Innovative Research of America, Toledo, OH) (n = 6). The sham-operated mice were also implanted with a placebo pellet (n = 6). Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after surgery, and the whole tibiae and femora were excised. To extract RNA from cells of bone marrow cells and residual bone from which bone marrow was removed, epiphyses at both ends were cut off, bone marrow was flushed with PBS, collected cells were suspended in ISOGEN extraction buffer, and total RNA was extracted. The residual bones were washed with PBS and immediately put into ISOGEN extraction buffer. Twenty μg and 5 μg of total RNA from bone marrow cells and residual bones, respectively, were run on a 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by positive pressure, and fixed to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. After 1 h of prehybridization in GMC buffer (0.5m Na2HPO4, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS, pH 7.2) at 60 °C, filters were hybridized overnight in GMC buffer at 65 °C with a random primer [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe for Gas6, Tyro 3, FGF-2, FGFR1, M-CSF, and c-Fms. cDNA probes were generated by RT-PCR using the template of total RNA from mouse brain. The primers for probes were as follows: Gas6, sense (5′-CCATCAACCACGGCATGTGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TCGCACACCTTGATTTCCAT-3′); Tyro 3, sense (5′-GGAAGAGACGCAAGGAGAC-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGGGAATGGGGAGACGAC-3′); FGF-2, sense (5′-CAAGCAGAAGAGAGAGGAGTTGTGTC-3′) and antisense (5′-CAGTTCGTTTCAGTGCCACATACC-3′); FGFR1, sense (5′-TGGAGTTCATGTGCAAGGTG-3′) and antisense (5′-ATAGAGAGGACCATCCTGTG-3′); M-CSF, sense (5′-ACAACACCCCCAATGCTAAC-3′) and antisense (5′-ACTGCCTGCGTCCTCTATGC-3′); c-Fms, sense (5′-TGCTAAAGTCCACGGCTCAT-3′) and antisense (5′-CAGTCCAAAGTCCCCAATCT-3′). Filters were washed in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm Na3 citrate, pH 7.0) plus 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min at 65 °C, then once for 15 min in 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Signals were quantitated by densitometry (Bio-Rad). Filters were stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS + 0.1× SSC between hybridizations. Means of groups were compared by analysis of variance and significance of differences was determined bypost hoc testing using Bonferroni's method. To examine the effect of Gas6 on the function of mouse osteoclasts, the pit area on a dentine slice resorbed by crude osteoclastic cells formed in the coculture of mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells in the presence of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and PGE2 was measured. Gas6 (≥10−11m) dose-dependently stimulated the resorbed pit area up to 2.1-fold of the control culture (Fig. 1,top panel). This stimulation was not due to the increase in the number of osteoclasts but due to the activation of each osteoclast function because the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts on a dentine slice was not affected by Gas6 (Fig. 1,middle panel). In fact, the effect of Gas6 on the pit area per osteoclast (resorbed pit area/osteoclast number in a dentine slice) showed a similar pattern to that on the resorbed pit area (Fig. 1, bottom panel). To confirm the action of Gas6 on osteoclast differentiation, dose response of effects of Gas6 (10−14 to 10−8m) on TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast formation in the coculture for 6 days on a plastic dish was examined. Gas6 did not increase osteoclast formation at any concentration, whereas FGF-2 and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, positive controls, stimulated it potently (Fig.2 A). Gas6 also did not affect TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast formation in the culture of mouse bone marrow cells alone, although FGF-2 and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3 did (data not shown). We further investigated the effect of Gas6 (10−8m) on the survival of osteoclasts. Mouse osteoclasts isolated from the coculture were cultured on a plastic dish for up to 72 h with or without Gas6 and M-CSF (100 ng/ml) as a positive control (Fig. 2 B). The survival rates decreased similarly with time in the control and Gas6-treated cultures. At 24 h only 32.5% and 22.5% of initially surviving cells still adhered to the dish in control and Gas6-treated cultures, respectively, and by 72 h all cells had died in both cultures. On the contrary, M-CSF increased the survival rate of osteoclasts as reported previously (6Chikazu D. Hakeda Y. Ogata N. Nemoto K. Itabashi A. Takato T. Kumegawa M. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Biol.

Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar); the survival rates were 83.3% at 24 h and 17.8% of cells were still alive after 72 h. Hence, these studies using mouse culture systems revealed that Gas6 did not affect the differentiation or survival of osteoclasts, but did stimulate their bone resorptive function. To study the expression of Gas6 and Tyro 3 in cells of osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineages, mRNA levels in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, spleen cells, bone marrow cells, and brain were examined by RT-PCR. Gas6 was expressed in all cells examined; however, the expression of Tyro 3 was detected only in osteoclasts and brain (Fig.3 A). Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein level of Tyro 3 was detected in osteoclasts, but not in osteoblasts (Fig. 3 B). To investigate the expression of Tyro 3 during the differentiation of osteoclastic cells, Tyro 3 mRNA levels were examined in spleen cells cultured in the presence of soluble RANKL/ODF and M-CSF without support of osteoblastic/stromal cells (Fig. 3 C). Because we extracted mRNA from cultured spleen cells every day, various differentiation stages of osteoclastic cells were assumed to be included. TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts became detectable at 5 days of culture and increased at 6 days, and Tyro 3 expression was detected slightly at 5 days and abundantly at 6 days of culture. These findings confirm that Tyro 3 is expressed predominantly in mature osteoclasts, but not in osteoclast precursors. We therefore propose that this localization of Tyro 3 may explain the selective action of Gas6 on the function of mature osteoclasts. To learn the mechanism of Gas6/Tyro 3 signaling in mature osteoclasts, we examined the time course of effects of Gas6 (5 × 10−9m) on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in isolated mouse osteoclasts (Fig. 4 A). Several proteins were phosphorylated by Gas6 as early as 1 min, and this activation was maintained for 10 min. The c-Src signal was used as an internal control. Western blot analyses using antibodies against specific proteins related to MAPKs revealed that phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was seen at 1 min and maintained for 10 min, while neither p38 nor JNK MAPK phosphorylation was seen (Fig. 4 A). To investigate the autophosphorylation of Tyro 3 by Gas6, the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Tyro 3 was examined by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4 B). Gas6 induced the kinase activity of Tyro 3 at 1 min, reached maximum at 2 min, and decreased considerably after 5 min. To examine the functional relevance of the activation of p42/p44 MAPK by Gas6 in osteoclasts, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of upstream kinase of p42/p44 MAPK (26Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P.

PD98059 (1–30 μm) dose-dependently inhibited the stimulation of Gas6 on pit formation resorbed by mouse osteoclasts to the levels of the control culture, while SB203580 (30 μm), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (28Lee J.C.

Although PD98059 at the highest concentration (30 μm) did not decrease the resorbed pit formation in the control culture, inhibitors of Src kinase, herbimycin (1 μm) and PP1 (10 μm), abrogated pit formation not only in the Gas6-stimulated culture but also in the control culture (data not shown), suggesting the essential role of Src kinase signaling in the basal function of osteoclasts. The physiological relevance of this Gas6/Tyro 3 signaling to the pathophysiology of bone loss by estrogen deficiency was investigated by examination of mRNA levels of Gas6 and Tyro 3 in cells of bone marrow and residual long bones of sham-operated, OVX, and estrogen-replaced OVX mice (Fig. 5). Since we assume it possible that signaling through RTKs on osteoclasts may contribute to the pathophysiology of osteopenic"

Their life cycle includes flagellated promastigote stages that reside in the midgut lumen of the sandfly vector and a nonmotile amastigote stage that lives within the mammalian macrophage, where it colonizes the phagolysosomal compartment (1Alexander J. Russell D.G. Adv. Parasitol. 1992; 31: 175-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Leishmania species synthesize large amounts of glycoconjugates that include the unusual glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs),1 the conserved protein-linked glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchors, glycoproteins with uncommon N-linked glycans, and a unique family of phosphoglycan-modified molecules that encompasses lipid-linked (lipophosphoglycan, LPG), protein-linked (proteophosphoglycans, PPGs), and unlinked forms (PG). It is believed that these are key molecules for the remarkable resistance ofLeishmania parasites against the hostile habitats within their host organisms. The structure of these parasite glycoconjugates has been analyzed in extensive detail (2Descoteaux A. Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 4Ilg T. Parasitol.

The glycan backbones of these glycosylated Leishmania molecules consist predominantly of the monosaccharides Man and Gal, with smaller amounts of GlcNAc, GlcNH2, Glc, d-Ara, andmyo-inositol present. It has been demonstrated that GDP-Man, Dol-P-Man, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, and GDP-d-Ara are used as monosaccharide donors for parasite glycoconjugate assembly (6Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol.

In particular the acquisition or biosynthesis as well as the activation of Man is predicted to be of prime importance to the parasites, as all classes ofLeishmania glycoconjugates contain this hexose. In yeast and in mammalian cells the activated Man donors GDP-Man and Dol-P-Man are synthesized from Man-6-PO4 by the enzymes phosphomannomutase, GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase, and Dol-P-Man synthase (Fig. 1). Man-6-PO4 is a central metabolite in this pathway and may be synthesized in two different ways: exogenous Man, if available, is taken up by the cells into the cytosol by glucose transporters (11Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) or a more specific mannose transporter and then phosphorylated by hexokinase (Fig. 1) (12Panneerselvam K. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9417-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Frc-6-PO4 is converted to Man-6-PO4 in a reaction catalyzed by phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) (Fig.1) (13Gracy R.W. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 243: 3161-3168Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Lack of the latter enzyme leads to a conditional lethal phenotype in yeast (14Smith D.J. Proudfoot A. Friedli L. Klig L.S. Paravic G.

By contrast, the mannose pathway inLeishmania is largely unexplored despite the fact that it is likely to be of central importance for the synthesis of mostLeishmania glycoconjugates and that it may, therefore, be a promising target for the design of new anti-parasitic drugs. In this study, we report the cloning of the L. mexicana PMI gene (lmexpmi) and the generation of gene deletion mutants (Δlmexpmi) that possess no PMI enzymatic activity. Lack of PMI leads to slowed growth in standard media, but in contrast to yeast,L. mexicana Δlmexpmi mutants do not require the addition of Man to the growth medium for viability. L. mexicana Δlmexpmi mutants are sensitive to high mannose concentrations, they show profound down-regulation of LPG, GIPL, and leishmanolysin (gp63) biosynthesis, and secrete underglycosylated acid phosphatase (SAP). Furthermore, L. mexicana Δlmexpmi promastigotes are attenuated in their infectivity to macrophages and mice. All these effects can be partially or fully reversed by addition of low concentrations of Man to the growth medium and by lmexpmi gene addback. The results of this study suggest that PMI activity is not essential for L. mexicana, but these parasites require this enzyme to maintain their high rate of glycoconjugate synthesis and full virulence. Promastigotes of the L. mexicana wild type (WT) strain MNYC/BZ/62/M379 and derived mutants were grown at 27 °C in semi-defined medium 79 (SDM) supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (iFCS) as described previously (18Ilg T. Harbecke D. Wiese M. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Infection of mice with 107 stationary phase promastigotes and infection of mouse peritoneal macrophages were performed as outlined earlier (19Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Growth curves of L. mexicana WT and mutants were obtained by seeding SDM/4% iFCS supplemented with or without various concentrations of Man (2 μm to 10 mm) with 2 × 106promastigotes and counting the parasite numbers at 8- to 24-h intervals. In some experiments, growth curves were determined in the presence or absence of 10 μm swainsonine in the standard growth medium. DNA techniques were performed as described previously (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D. Handman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31410-31420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A 300-bp fragment of the L. major pmi gene was obtained from L. major LRC-L137/V121 genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the degenerate primers TT(A/G)TGGATGGG(A/G/C/T)AC(A/G/C/T)CA(C/T)CC and GCCAT(C/T)TC(A/G/C/T)GG(C/T)TT(A/G)TT that were derived from the conserved Candida albicans and Homo sapiens PMI peptide sequences LWMGTHP and NHKPEMA. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The digoxygenin-labeled PCR product was used to screen a λ-DashII library (21Wiese M. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) derived from genomic L. mexicana DNA. Positive clones were subcloned into pBSK+ (Stratagene) or pGEM-5z (Promega) and sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ALFexpress automated sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described earlier (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D. Handman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31410-31420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The open reading frame corresponding tolmexpmi was identified by homology to known PMI genes in the data base and by determination of the spliced leader site (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D. Handman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31410-31420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Double-targeted gene replacement was performed by PCR amplification of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of lmexpmi using the primers KO1 (AATGCGGCCGCATGCATCTTCTGTGCGTGTC) and KO2 (AGTACTAGTACAGACGTAGCGGAGTTGCTTG) and by amplification of the 3′-UTR of lmexpmi using the primers KO3 (AGTACTAGTGGATCCCCGAGTTTCCTTCAACATTG) and KO4 (CTTAAGCTTATGCATGCTCTCATCACGAGTG). The underlined sequences indicate introduced restriction sites. TheNotI/SpeI-cut lmexpmi 5′-UTR PCR DNA fragment, the BamHI/HindIII-cutlmexpmi 3′-UTR PCR DNA fragment, and aSpeI/BamHI DNA fragment containing a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hyg) (21Wiese M. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were ligated consecutively into pBSK+. For the second lmexpmigene replacement cassette, a SpeI/BamHI fragment encoding the phleomycin binding protein gene (phleo) was used (19Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The hyg- and phleo-containing gene replacement cassettes were excised from the plasmids by NsiI digestion and transfected into L. mexicanapromastigotes as previously described (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D. Handman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31410-31420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Selection in 96-well microtiter plates and analysis of positive clones were performed as outlined earlier (19Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). lmexpmi 5′-UTR and open reading frame DNA probes were generated by PCR using a PCR-DIG labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the primer pairs GAGGGGAAGATGGTGGTGAG/GCTCCACCTTCTCCCTGCTA and TTCACCTTGGCAGACCCCTC/GAAGTTTGCCGAGGAGCTGC, respectively. For gene addback and heterologous expression studies, the open reading frame oflmexpmi was amplified from a lmexpmigene-containing plasmid using the primers CCATGGATCCATGTCTGAGCTCGTCAAGC and AATAGATCTAGATTACTTGTCGCTCAAGTC. Episomal gene addback was achieved by cloning the BamHI/XbaI-cut PCR fragment into pX (22Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 7170-7174Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and transfection of L. mexicanaΔlmexpmi promastigotes with this construct as described earlier (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D.

U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected by growth in SDM/4% iFCS containing 10–50 μg/ml G418 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Alternatively, the lmexpmi gene was expressed under the control of the rRNA promoter, which is known to lead to high level expression not only in promastigotes but also in amastigotes (24Misslitz A. Mottram J.C. Overath P. Aebischer T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the construction of an integration vector, pFW31 (25Benzel I. Wiese F. Wiese M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was first linearized by digestion with AgeI. The purified DNA fragment (9347 bp) was then subjected to partial digestion withAflII generating digestion products with lengths of 7769, 6720, 2627, 1578, and 1049 bp. The largest fragment lacking thelmxmbap open reading frame, but preserving the following spliced leader addition and polyadenylation sites, was then ligated with the annealed primers CCGGTCTAGATCTGCGGCCGCGGCGCGCC and TTAAGGCGCGCCGCGGCCGCAGATCTAGA yielding pRIB. The gene-containing PCR product (see above) was digested with BglII andBamHI and ligated into BglII/BamHI-cut pRIB yielding pRIBlmexpmi. Correct orientation was checked by restriction enzyme digests. For chromosomal integration into the ribosomal locus of L. mexicana, the integration cassette was excised by digestion with PacI and PmeI (24Misslitz A. Mottram J.C. Overath P. Aebischer T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Benzel I. Wiese F. Wiese M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), gel-purified, and transfected into L. mexicana. Recombinant clones were isolated by limiting dilution on 96-well plates in SDM medium containing 20 μg/ml hygromycin, 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and 20 μm puromycin. The sequence data for thelmexpmi-containing DNA fragment has been submitted to the EMBL data base under accession number AJ300464. High level expression of L. mexicana PMI inEscherichia coli M15 as inclusion bodies was achieved by cloning the BamHI/BglII-cut lmexpmiPCR fragment into pQE30 followed by transformation of the bacteria. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 m urea, and denatured PMI was then purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of purified recombinant protein, which was dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 4.8, and emulsified with 50% (v/v) complete Freund's adjuvant for primary immunizations and with 50% incomplete Freund's adjuvant (v/v) for all subsequent booster immunizations. Serum was obtained 10–14 days after each booster immunization. The antiserum was affinity-purified on recombinant protein that had been electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) as described earlier (20Ilg T.

Production of SDS-cell lysates, discontinuous SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) LT6 and L7.25 (directed against [PO4-6Galβ1–4Manα1-]x (x = unknown) and [Manα1–2]0–2Manα1-PO4, respectively) (18Ilg T.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Total lipids from washed L. mexicana promastigotes were obtained by two extractions with chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3, v/v). High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC, Silica Gel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) of total lipids was performed as described by McConville et al. (28McConville M.J. Collidge T.A. Ferguson M.A.J. Schneider P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15595-15604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the solvent chlorofom/methanol/1 m NH4OH (10:10:3, v/v). Glycolipids on HPTLC plates were selectively stained by orcinol/H2SO4 spraying. L. mexicanapromastigotes were metabolically labeled by incubating 5 × 107 cells/ml overnight at 27 °C with 10 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol, 20 μCi/ml [3H]GlcNH2, or 50 μCi/ml [2-3H]Man (Hartmann Analytics) inmyo-inositol- or Glc/GlcNH2- or Glc/Man-free SDM medium, respectively. In labelings withmyo-[3H]inositol and [3H]GlcNH2, the lipid extracts were further purified by 1-butanol/H2O phase separation (28McConville M.J. Collidge T.A. Ferguson M.A.J. Schneider P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15595-15604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled lipids of the 1-butanol phase were separated by HPTLC and detected by spraying with 3H-ENHANCE (Dupont) followed by fluorography. Delipidated cells labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol or [2-3H]Man were incubated with benzonuclease to cleave nucleic acids (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D. Handman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31410-31420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled compounds in acrylamide gels were detected by immersion of the polyacrylamide gel in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by drying and fluorography. To generate L. mexicana total cell lysates, 5 × 109 promastigotes were resuspended in cold homogenization buffer (50 mm triethylamine/HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2 containing 20 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same volume homogenization buffer. Enzyme assays were performed in 50 mmtriethylamine/HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2 at 25 °C with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For PMI assays, this buffer was supplemented with 0.5 mmNADP+ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2.5 mmMan-6-PO4 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 2 units/ml phosphoglucose isomerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hexokinase was measured in assay buffer with addition of 5 mm glucose, 1 mm ATP, and 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, whereas the phosphoglucomutase assay required the addition of 2 mm glucose 1-phosphate and 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Enzyme assays were started by the addition of 5–10 μl of cell lysate, ultracentrifugation supernatants, or resuspended pellets, and the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded over 2.5–10 min. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme converting 1 μmol of substrate/min into the respective product. Total protein of cell lysates was estimated according to Peterson (29Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) studies onLeishmania promastigotes and infected macrophages were performed as described previously (19Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the mAbs (18Ilg T. Harbecke D. Wiese M. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) LT6, L7.25, LT17 (most likely directed against [PO4-6(Glcβ1–3)Galβ1–4Manα1-]x,x = unknown), mAb L3.8 (directed against a polypeptide epitope of L. mexicana leishmanolysin/gp63), and the biotinylated lectin concanavalin A (Sigma). The mAbs were diluted 1:2 to 1:10 (hybridoma supernatant) or 1:500 to 1:2000 (ascites fluid), and the lectin was used at 10 μg/ml. Bound mAbs and the biotinylated lectin were detected by incubation with Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG/IgM (Dianova, 1:500) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin (Sigma, 1:250), respectively. For the cloning of the Leishmania PMI gene, a degenerate PCR primer pair was constructed from the peptide sequences LWMGTHP and NHKPEMA, which are conserved in C. albicans and H. sapiens PMI (Fig.2). PCR was performed using L. mexicana, L. donovani, and L. major genomic DNA as templates. Only L. major DNA yielded a PCR product of the expected size (270–300 bp), and sequencing of this DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame with high homology to known PMIs (data not shown). The DIG-labeled PCR fragment was used to screen a λ-DashII library of genomic L. mexicana DNA. Sequencing of a lmexpmi gene-containing DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame of 1266 bp encoding a protein of 46.5 kDa, which showed 40–42% identity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. albicans, and H. sapiens PMI polypeptide sequences. Complete conservation was observed for the amino acids that have been shown to serve as a ligand for a Zn2+ cation in the active site and for amino acids lining the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 2) (30Cleasby A. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Hubbard R.E. Davies G.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Bernard A.R. Payton M.A. Wells T.N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The predicted involvement of Zn2+ in the catalytic activity of L. mexicana PMI was corroborated by its complete inhibition by 5 mm o-phenanthroline (data not shown). Southern blots of L. mexicana genomic DNA indicated the presence of a single gene copy (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Gene replacement cassettes containing the resistance markersphleo and hyg were constructed, and two rounds of targeted gene replacement were performed (Fig. 3 A). Plating of transfected cells on SDM medium with or without additional Man (0.5 mm) yielded about the same number of clones that lacked thelmexpmi open reading frame (Fig. 3 B). This result was remarkable, because deletion of the PMI gene in yeast led to a Man-dependent phenotype (14Smith D.J. Proudfoot A. Friedli L. Klig L.S. Paravic G. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Figure 3Targeted gene replacement of thelmexpmi alleles. A, restriction map of the lmexpmi locus.

B, Southern blot analysis of PstI restriction enzyme-digested chromosomal DNA (5 μg) from L. mexicana wild type (lanes 1) and a Δlmexpmi mutant (lanes 2). DNA was separated on an ethidium bromide-containing 0.7% agarose gel (right panel), blotted onto a nylon membrane, and incubated with either a DIG-labeledlmexpmi open reading frame (ORF) probe (middle panel) or a DIG-labeled lmexpmi5′-untranslated region (UTR) probe (left panel). The sizes of DNA standards are indicated in kilobases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoblots of L. mexicanapromastigote and amastigote total cell lysates probed with affinity-purified antibodies raised against Escherichia coli-expressed L. mexicana PMI revealed that PMI was expressed at very similar levels in both parasite life stages (Fig.4 A). Ultracentrifugation experiments on sonicated cell lysates demonstrated that >95% ofL. mexicana PMI activity is soluble (data not shown). The PMI protein band was completely absent in overexposed immunoblots ofL. mexicana Δlmexpmi mutants (Fig.4 B), and PMI enzyme assays revealed that these mutants were completely deficient in PMI activity, whereas the activities of other metabolic enzymes like phosphoglucomutase or hexokinase showed little change or were even elevated (Fig. 4 C). L. mexicana Δlmexpmi mutant promastigotes exhibited slowed growth in standard SDM medium (Fig.5 B) compared with wild type parasites (Fig. 5 A). This growth defect could be overcome partially by the addition of 20 μm (not shown) or fully by the addition of 200 μm Man to the medium (Fig.5 B), but 2 mm Man led again to slow growth and a bloated shape of the cells, whereas 10 mm Man inhibited growth and ultimately killed most of the parasites (Fig.5 B). In contrast, neither growth nor cell shape of L. mexicana wild type cells and of Δlmexpmimutant promastigotes carrying episomal copies of the lmexpmigene were affected by high Man concentrations (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Influence of Man on the growth curves ofL. mexicana WT (A), L. mexicana Δlmexpmi(B), and L. mexicanaΔlmexpmi + pXlmexpmi(C).

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), showed only the signal for mPPG (Fig.6 A, lane 6). In contrast, none of the fourL. mexicana Δlmexpmi null mutants investigated showed any reaction with mAb LT6 on immunoblots. This result was confirmed by FACS analysis of live promastigotes, where the Δlmexpmi mutant clones examined showed only negligible surface fluorescence, in contrast to Δlmexlpg1promastigotes, which displayed at least some LT6 epitopes on their surface, most likely due to mPPG expression (Fig.7 A). Likewise, surface binding sites for LT17, an mAb most likely recognizing glucosylated disaccharide phosphate repeats (20Ilg T. Montgomory J. Stierhof Y.-D. Handman E. J. Biol.

Our result showed that removing the C terminus of δ opioid receptor (DOR) containing six Ser/Thr residues abolished both DPDPE- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced DOR phosphorylation. The phosphorylation levels of DOR mutants T352A, T353A, and T358A/T361A/S363S were comparable to that of the wild-type DOR, whereas S344G substitution blocked PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation, indicating that PKC-mediated phosphorylation occurs at Ser-344. PKC-mediated Ser-344 phosphorylation was also induced by activation of Gq-coupled α1A-adrenergic receptor or increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Activation of PKC by PMA, α1A-adrenergic receptor agonist, and ionomycin resulted in DOR internalization that required phosphorylation of Ser-344. Expression of dominant negative β-arrestin and hypertonic sucrose treatment blocked PMA-induced DOR internalization, suggesting that PKC mediates DOR internalization via a β-arrestin- and clathrin-dependent mechanism. Further study demonstrated that agonist-dependent G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation sites in DOR are not targets of PKC. Agonist-dependent, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation and agonist-independent, PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation were additive, but agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation could inhibit PKC-catalyzed heterologous DOR phosphorylation and subsequent internalization. These data demonstrate that the responsiveness of opioid receptor is regulated by both PKC and GRK through agonist-dependent and agonist-independent mechanisms and PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation is an important molecular mechanism of heterologous regulation of opioid receptor functions.

Opioid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 and include δ, κ, and μ subtypes. Interaction of opioid receptors on the surface of neurons in the central nervous system with endogenous opioid peptides and synthetic alkaloids produces strong analgesic effect, but chronic use of opioid drug results in drug tolerance and dependence. The molecular mechanisms of regulation of the receptor responsiveness and opioid tolerance and dependence are not well understood, although desensitization of opioid receptor has been implicated as one of the major mechanisms.The responsiveness of opioid receptor reduces upon exposure to opioid agonist, and this agonist-dependent desensitization is defined as homologous desensitization of the opioid receptor. Several mechanisms contribute to desensitization of opioid receptors. It has been demonstrated that, following stimulation of opioid agonist, the opioid receptor becomes phosphorylated rapidly (1Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol.

Experimental results indicate that GPCR kinase (GRK), not PKC and PKA, is the primary protein kinase involved in homologous phosphorylation of opioid receptors stimulated by opioid agonist and plays an important role in agonist-induced homologous desensitization of opioid receptors (1Pei G.

Second messenger-dependent protein kinases such as PKA and PKC mediate receptor phosphorylation, and this has been implicated in heterologous regulation of activities of a number of GPCRs recently (11Vázquez-Prado J.

Accumulating evidence suggest that the sensitivity of opioid receptor in response to neural signals is also regulated by nonopioid pathways. Animal experiments and clinical studies showed that NMDA antagonist potentiates morphine-induced analgesia and prevents opioid tolerance (13Fan G.H. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Lou L.G. Zhang Z. Jing Q. Ma L. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that activation of NMDA receptor attenuates opioid receptor-mediated cellular signaling, and this is mediated by PKC (14Cai Y.C. Ma L. Fan G.H. Zhao J. Jiang L.Z. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ohsawa and colleagues (15Ohsawa M. Tanaka S. Kamei J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 373: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that preadministration of insulin inhibits the antinociceptive effect of (d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol)enkephalin, a specific agonist of μ-opioid receptor in mice, and their results suggest that the effect is mediated by activation of PKC and tyrosine kinase. Increasing Ca2+ concentration in neurons and synaptosomes antagonizes opioid-induced antinociception (16Vocci F.J. Welch S.P. Dewey W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Suppression of μ, δ, and κ opioid receptor agonist-induced analgesia by PKC activators in animals has also been shown by many laboratories (18Zhang L.J. Wang X.J. Han J.S.

Neurosci. 1997; 76: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that chronic opiate treatment strongly increases PKC activity in specific brain regions, and inhibition of PKC activity attenuates the development of opioid tolerance and dependence (22Narita M. Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 280: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Aley K.O. Levine J.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that opioid signaling is regulated heterologously by agonist-independent pathways in vivo and PKC is likely an important mediator.Research indicates that phorbol esters, activators of PKC, reduce opioid-induced inhibition on cAMP production (24Louie A.K.

Furthermore, research from other laboratories and our groups demonstrated that phorbol ester PMA treatment could induce phosphorylation of δ and μ opioid receptors in the absence of agonist stimulation (1Pei G.

These data indicate that PKC-mediated heterologous phosphorylation of opioid receptor may contribute to desensitization of opioid receptor in neurons. However, there is so far no report on the effect of physiological activation of PKC on opioid receptor phosphorylation and signal transduction, and the mechanism and functional impact of PKC activation on opioid receptor-mediated signaling are not known. In the current study, we identified a PKC-mediated phosphorylation site in the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and demonstrated that activation of PKC by stimulation of other types of GPCR or increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration in HEK 293 cells induces heterologous phosphorylation of DOR. Our results further established that DOR phosphorylation at Ser-344 by PKC results in internalization of DOR in HEK 293 cells through a β-arrestin- and clathrin-mediated mechanism.RESULTSAs shown in Fig. 1, incubation of PMA with the HEK 293 cells transiently expressing DOR induced DOR phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of DOR in these cells was detected in 3 min and reached a peak level (400% of the basal level) in 5 min of PMA exposure (Fig. 1 A). PMA-induced DOR phosphorylation was concentration-dependent. DOR phosphorylation was detectable at 100 nm PMA and approached the plateau at 1 μm PMA (Fig. 1 B).The role of PKC in PMA-stimulated DOR phosphorylation was explored next. Fig. 2 shows that PKC inhibitors staurosporine and GF109203X (28Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhame L.

In addition, the PKA activator forskolin did not stimulate DOR phosphorylation (Fig. 2). These data indicate that PMA-stimulated DOR phosphorylation is mediated by PKC, whereas other protein kinases such as PKA and MAPK are not critically involved.Figure 2PMA-stimulated DOR phosphorylation was mediated by PKC. HEK 293 cells transiently expressing DOR were labeled with 32Pi and challenged with or without 0.2 μm staurosporine (Stau), 2 μm GF109203X (GF), or 20 μmPD98059 (PD) for 20 min prior to incubation with 1 μm PMA, 10 μm forskolin, or PBS (Ctrl) for 10 min. DORs were then immunoprecipitated and receptor phosphorylation was analyzed.

Ma L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of DOR plays a critical role in PMA-induced DOR phosphorylation, implicating that PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation occurs at the C-terminal domain of the receptor. To identify the PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation site, DOR mutants S344G (m1), T352A (m2), T353A (m3), and T358A/T361A/S363G (m4/5/6), with one or more potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in the C terminus of DOR substituted and the truncation mutant lacking the 31 residues containing six Ser/Thr potential phosphorylation sites (designated as Δ31), were constructed. Results showed that surface expression, ligand binding, and G protein coupling of the above mutant receptors were comparable to the wild-type DOR (WT) (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3, removing the C-terminal domain containing all six potential phosphorylation sites blocked PMA-induced DOR phosphorylation completely, whereas eliminating Thr-358, Thr-361, and Ser-363, the three potential phosphorylation residues proximal to the C terminus, by substitution of the three Ser/Thr residues with neutral amino acid had no detectable effect on the phosphorylation level of DOR, indicating that the PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation site is likely located among Ser-344, Thr-352, and Thr-353 in the receptor cytoplasmic tail.Figure 3PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of DOR at Ser-344. The HEK 293 cells transiently expressing WT, Δ31, m4/5/6, m1, m2, or m3 were labeled with 32Piand stimulated with or without 1 μm PMA for 10 min. DORs were immunoprecipitated, and receptor phosphorylation was analyzed. The figures are representative of three independent experiments performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of amino acid sequences flanking the three Ser/Thr residues predicates Ser-344 and Thr-352 as putative PKC phosphorylation sites (29Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of Ser-344, Thr-352, and Thr-353 in PMA-induced DOR phosphorylation, phosphorylation levels of DOR mutants m1, m2, and m3 stimulated by PMA were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, following stimulation with PMA, the extents of phosphorylation of m2 and m3 mutants were comparable to that of the wild type DOR (WT), but in contrast, phosphorylation of m1 DOR was not detectable under the same conditions. These data indicate that Ser-344 in the cytoplasmic tail of DOR is the phosphorylation site in PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation. We have demonstrated that PKA and MAPK are not involved in PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation. Furthermore, the Ser-344 flanking sequence does not resemble phosphorylation consensus sequences for PKA, MAPK, or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but Ser-344 is located in a typical PKC phosphorylation motif. Therefore, Ser-344 is very likely the in vivo phosphorylation site of PKC in PMA-stimulated DOR phosphorylation.PKC is one of the most important signal molecules in cells and its activity is regulated through a number of different pathways. Phosphorylation status of opioid receptors could be therefore regulated, via PKC, by activation of one or more signal molecules or signal transduction cascades other than opioid pathway. To explore the potential physiological significance of PKC-stimulated opioid receptor phosphorylation, we examined the effect of activation of Gqprotein-coupled receptor, α1A-adrenergic receptor (α1A-AR), on the phosphorylation of DOR. As shown in Fig.4 A, stimulation of HEK 293 cells transiently coexpressing DOR and α1A-AR with A61603, a selective agonist of α1A-AR, resulted in strong phosphorylation of DOR at a level comparable to that of stimulated by PMA. A61603-stimulated DOR phosphorylation was abolished by preincubation with either the selective α1A-AR antagonist WB4101 or the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and GF109203X (Fig.4 A). The mutant DOR lacking PKC phosphorylation site Ser-344 failed to become phosphorylated following stimulation with A61603 under the same conditions (Fig. 4 A). These data indicate that heterologous activation of PKC through activation of α1A-AR, a receptor coupled to Gq protein, results in DOR phosphorylation at PKC site Ser-344. Furthermore, ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, elevated Ca2+concentration in HEK 293 cells (data not shown) and stimulated DOR phosphorylation at Ser-344, and the effect of ionomycin could be blocked by inhibitors of PKC but not by an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, KN-62 (Fig.4 B). In addition to ionomycin, A23187, another Ca2+ ionophore, and ATP, a natural ligand of purinoceptor, increased intracellular Ca2+concentration and stimulated DOR phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells (data not shown). BAPTA/AM, a Ca2+ chelator, abolished PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation stimulated by PMA, A61603, and ionomycin (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4PKC-mediated phosphorylation of DOR was Ca2+-dependent. The transfected HEK 293 cells were labeled with 32Pi and treated as indicated. DORs were immunoprecipitated, and receptor phosphorylation was analyzed. The figures are representative of three independent experiments performed. A, the cells coexpressing α1A-AR and WT or m1 were incubated with or without 2 μm WB4101 (WB) for 30 min, 0.2 μm staurosporine for 20 min, or 2 μmGF109203X for 20 min prior to stimulation with 1 μmA61603 (A6), 1 μm PMA, or PBS for 10 min.B, the cells expressing WT or m1 were incubated with or without 0.2 μm staurosporine for 20 min, 2 μm GF109203X for 20 min, 10 μm KN-62 (KN) for 20 min prior to stimulation of 1 μmionomycin (Iono), 1 μm PMA, or PBS for 10 min.C, the cells expressing DOR or coexpressing DOR and α1A-AR (for A61603 treatment) were incubated with or without 50 μm BAPTA/AM (BAP) for 20 min prior to stimulation of 1 μm PMA, 1 μm ionomycin, 1 μm A61603, or PBS for 10 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the functional consequence of PKC-mediated DOR phosphorylation, DOR internalization in response to PKC activation induced by PMA, ionomycin, and A61603 was measured using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5, a 30-min PMA treatment resulted in a significant reduction in cell surface fluorescence in the cells expressing the wild type DOR, indicating a considerable loss of the DOR from the cell surface (40–50%), which was similar to the extent of DOR internalization induced by the DOR agonist DPDPE (Fig. 6). In contrast, the same PMA treatment caused no significant change in the surface immunofluorescence in the cells expressing DOR mutant m1 lacking PKC site Ser-344 in the receptor C-tail (Fig. 5). However, m1 mutant DOR internalized rapidly in response to DOR-selective agonist DPDPE (data not shown). Similarly, activation of PKC by stimulation of α1A-AR or mobilization of Ca2+ induced internalization of the wild type DOR but had no significant effect on the surface density of DOR mutant m1 (Fig. 5 C). Similar to agonist pretreatment, incubation of PMA with the HEK 293 cells transiently expressing DOR strongly attenuated DPDPE-induced inhibition on cAMP accumulation; However, substituting Ser-344 to alanine did not block the PMA-induced desensitization of DOR-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation (Fig. 5 D). These results are consistent with the previous studies that PKC is capable of phosphorylating Gαi (13Fan G.H. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Lou L.G. Zhang Z. Jing Q. Ma L. Pei G. Mol.

Our results indicate that induction of DOR internalization is one of the functional consequences of agonist-independent phosphorylation of DOR following activation of PKC via a heterologous signaling pathway (stimulation of another GPCR or mobilizing Ca2+), whereas PKC-mediated reaction targeting molecules downstream from the receptor may also play important roles in desensitization of opioid-induced cellular responses.Figure 5Activation of PKC by PMA , A61603, and ionomycin induced DOR desensitization.

As shown in Fig. 6 A, flow cytometric analysis of surface receptor indicates that PMA-induced DOR internalization is reversible: The surface DOR fluorescence gradually recovered 1 h after PMA was removed. Studies showed that opioid-induced receptor internalization involves β-arrestins and clathrin-coated pits (33Whistler J.L. Von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hence, the effects of coexpression of the wild-type β-arrestin 1 or β1V53D, a dominant negative mutant of β-arrestin 1, on PKC-mediated DOR internalization were assessed. Overexpression of β-arrestin 1 enhanced PMA-stimulated DOR internalization and overexpression of β1V53D blocked this effect (Fig. 6 B). It has been shown that β-arrestins function in agonist-induced GPCR internalization as an adapter of clathrin in formation of clathrin-coated pits (35Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). To examine the role of clathrin in PKC-stimulated DOR internalization, HEK 293 cells transiently expressing DOR were incubated with PMA following 0.4 m sucrose pretreatment, which blocks formation of clathrin-coated pits (36Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Analysis of cell surface DOR fluorescence indicates that exposure of the cells to hypertonic sucrose completely blocked PMA-induced DOR internalization (Fig. 6 C). These data clearly indicate that, like agonist-dependent homologous DOR internalization, the PKC-mediated heterologous internalization of DOR requires β-arrestin and occurs via clathrin-coated pits.As shown in Fig. 7 A, PKC inhibitors staurosporine and GF109203X did not block DPDPE-stimulated DOR phosphorylation, indicating that PKC is not required for agonist-dependent DOR phosphorylation (also called homologous phosphorylation). Our previous studies indicated that agonist-dependent DOR phosphorylation o"

Peptide aldehydes, which inhibit cysteine proteases and proteasomes, reportedly block Aβ peptide secretion by interfering with γ-secretase cleavage. Using a novel, specific, and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the β-secretase-cleaved fragment of the Swedish mutant of APP (APPSw), we determined that the peptide aldehyde, MG132, prevented β-secretase cleavage. This block in β-secretase cleavage was not observed withclasto-lactacystin β-lactone and thus, cannot be attributed to proteasomal inhibition. MG132 inhibition of β-secretase cleavage was compared with the serine protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF). AEBSF inhibition of β-secretase cleavage was immediate and did not affect α-secretase cleavage. With MG132, inhibition was delayed and it decreased secretion of α-cleaved APPSw as well. Furthermore, MG132 treatment impaired maturation of full-length APPSw. Both inhibited intracellular formation of the β-cleaved product. These results suggest that peptide aldehydes such as MG132 have multiple effects on the maturation and processing of APP. We conclude that the MG132-induced decrease in β-secretase cleavage of APPSw is due to a block in maturation.

Amyloid plaques largely consist of peptides of 40 (Aβ40)1 and 42 (Aβ42) amino acids in length that are derived by the enzymatic processing of a type I transmembrane protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP). Two enzymatic cleavages of APP are necessary to produce amyloid peptides. First, β-secretase cleaves APP to create the amino-terminal end of the peptide. A double mutation (K651N/M652L; 751 isoform numbering) just amino-terminal to this β-secretase cleavage site has been identified in a Swedish pedigree of familial Alzheimer's disease (3Mullan M.

This double mutation of APP, known as the “Swedish” mutation (APPSw), elevates intracellular and secreted levels of Aβ peptide from 6- to 8-fold (4Forman M.S. Cook D.G. Leight S. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32247-32253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This appears to be a consequence of increased cleavage of APPSw by β-secretase compared with wild type APP. Following β-secretase cleavage, γ-secretase subsequently cleaves the COOH-terminal membrane-bound fragment (CTF) of APP within the transmembrane sequence to release the Aβ peptide. Thus, inhibitors that specifically block the cleavage of APP by these secretases have enormous therapeutic potential. Several laboratories have now cloned an enzyme that cleaves APP and APPSw at the β-secretase site (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P.

Referred to as BACE (β-site APP cleavingenzyme), this enzyme is a member of a unique family of transmembrane aspartic proteases.

However, the expression pattern of BACE2 in the brain appears to exclude it from playing a major role in Alzheimer's disease (9Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Loeloff R. Louis J.C. Curran E. Citron M.

The mature, fully glycosylated form of BACE has a half-life in the cell of greater than 9 h (10Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T.

Despite about 40% amino acid similarity between BACE and pepsin proteases (9Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Loeloff R. Louis J.C. Curran E. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (20511): 20647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the cysteine residues in BACE involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds are not conserved with other pepsin family members (10Haniu M.

Such fundamental structural differences may explain why β-secretase is insensitive to pepstatin, a specific inhibitor of pepsin proteases (7Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suomensaari S.M. Wang S. Walker D. John V. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The search for such a specific inhibitor of β-secretase cleavage of APP as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease has intensified with the discovery of BACE. Before the cloning of the aspartic protease, BACE, cellular studies using a serine protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), suggested that it blocked Aβ peptide generation by directly inhibiting β-secretase activity (11Citron M. Diehl T.S. Capell A. Haass C. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 171-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is little information published about other potential specific inhibitors of β-secretase. Several studies have shown that peptide aldehyde protease inhibitors affect the secretion of Aβ peptides (12Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Klafki H.W. Paganetti P.A. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Neurosci.

Of these peptide aldehydes, MG132 was one of the most potent inhibitors of Aβ peptide secretion (15Klafki H. Abramowski D. Swoboda R. Paganetti P.A. Staufenbiel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28655-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Studies focusing specifically on the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 revealed peptide aldehydes to have a complex effect on APP processing. Curiously, at low concentrations, these peptide aldehydes produced an increase in Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptide secretion, whereas, at higher concentrations, a decrease in Aβ peptide secretion was observed (14Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Klafki H. Abramowski D. Swoboda R. Paganetti P.A. Staufenbiel M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8966-8972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The increase in Aβ peptide secretion at low concentrations of peptide aldehydes has been postulated to result from inhibition of degradation of the CTFs generated by BACE cleavage, making more of them available for γ-secretase cleavage (17Zhang L. Song L. Parker E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8966-8972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Aβ peptide secretion with higher concentrations of peptide aldehydes is attributed to an impairment of γ-secretase cleavage of the CTFs (12Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Klafki H.W. Paganetti P.A. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Neurosci.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By developing an ELISA specific for the soluble β-secretase-cleaved amino-terminal fragment of APPSw (APPSwβ; see Fig. 1 A), we now report that the peptide aldehyde, MG132, prevents β-secretase cleavage of APPSw in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, MG132 is not inhibiting secretion of APPSwβ into the medium since it blocked intracellular production of APPSwβ as well. MG132 is compared with AEBSF and the specific proteasomal inhibitor,clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, on β-secretase cleavage. MG132 impairs maturation, blocking β-secretase cleavage of APPSw in the late Golgi apparatus. This offers an alternative explanation as to how higher concentrations of a peptide aldehyde can decrease Aβ peptide secretion. The mouse monoclonal antibodies referred to in Fig. 1 A as 22C11 andBIOSOURCE were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and BIOSOURCE International (monoclonal antibody P2-1), respectively. The mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10, which recognizes an epitope in the first 17 amino acids of the Aβ peptide, was obtained from Senetek, Inc. The anti-APP COOH-terminal rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc., and the mouse monoclonal antibody to the amino terminus of APP, LN27, was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The mouse monoclonal antibody, 8E5, was a generous gift from Dr. Dale Schenk (Elan Pharmaceuticals). The rabbit polyclonal antibody, 945, was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 19 amino acid residues of the carboxyl terminus of APP (CMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQN) that was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an amino-terminal cysteine. The polyclonal antibodies, 931 and 932, were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 19 amino acid residues (CRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL) just amino-terminal to the β-secretase cleavage site of APPSw that was similarly cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an amino-terminal cysteine. The peptide aldehyde, MG132, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a concentration of 10 mm (Peptides International). The proteasomal inhibitor,clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem), was also dissolved in Me2SO at 2 mm. Me2SO was used in all experiments as a vehicle control. The serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (Sigma) was dissolved in sterile water at 0.2m. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHOK1, and the HEK293 cell line used for transient transfections were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines stably expressing the 695 isoforms of either APPSw (CHOAPPSw) or APP wild type were a generous gift from Taraneh Haske (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Ann Arbor, MI). All CHO cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone as described (19Yang Y. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Experiments involving transient expression of APPSw or APP were conducted using cDNAs encoding for the 751 isoforms that were cloned into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Inc.). Transfections of HEK293 cells grown on 60-mm plates were conducted using LipofectAMINE as described by the Life Technologies, Inc. Forty hours following transfection, cells were metabolically labeled or lysed for immunoblot analysis as described below. Cells stably or transiently expressing APP or APPSw were preincubated in methionine/cysteine-free medium for 15 min prior to labeling. Cells were metabolically labeled by incubating in 2 ml of medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-label; ICN Pharmaceuticals) at 50 μCi/ml for 1 h. In pulse-chase studies, cells were preincubated in methionine/cysteine-free medium for 15 min and then pulsed for 12 min with Tran35S-label (100 μCi/ml). Cells were then washed and incubated in complete medium containing excess methionine and cysteine for the chase times shown. After labeling and chase were complete, the conditioned medium was collected and cells washed in PBS. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and insoluble cell debris removed by centrifugation as described (19Yang Y. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The resulting cleared supernatant of the cell lysate was then subjected to further analysis. Full-length APP and APPSw were isolated from the cell lysate supernatants by immunoprecipitation using the 945 rabbit antisera to the carboxyl terminus of APP. Except where noted, lysates were incubated with 4 μl of 945 antisera for 90 min at 4 °C and protein-antibody complexes were isolated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. Intracellular APPSwβ was similarly isolated from cell lysates using 4 μl of 931 rabbit antisera. The 931 antisera was also used to isolate secreted APPSwβ from 0.5 ml of conditioned medium that had Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate added to a final concentration of 0.5%. Immunoprecipitations using the mouse monoclonal antibodies, 8E5 or 6E10, were conducted as described above except that protein-antibody complexes were isolated using protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Isolated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using an 8% separating gel. Radiolabeled proteins in SDS gels were detected by fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblot analysis of isolated proteins was conducted essentially as described (19Yang Y. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PROTRAN (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were subsequently blocked in gelatin wash buffer (0.1% gelatin, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Membranes were subsequently incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody 22C11 to detect the amino-terminal end of APP molecules from cell lysates or conditioned medium. Membranes were alternatively incubated with 6E10 to detect APPSwα in conditioned medium. Membranes were subsequently washed and incubated with a sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were again washed and signals detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 945 and 931 antisera were used as capture antibodies for the full-length APP and APPSwβ sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Each was first affinity-purified against the appropriate peptide that had been cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-APP COOH-terminal antibody, 945, was affinity-purified with the same 20-amino acid synthetic peptide used above to inoculate rabbits. The 931 antibody was affinity-purified using a synthetic peptide identical to the last seven amino acids of the neoepitope of the β-secretase-cleaved APPSw soluble fragment (CEIESVNL). The 945 and 931 antibodies that bound to the immobilized peptide were eluted using ActiSep Elution Medium (Sterogene). The eluted antibodies were desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as directed by the manufacturers. The affinity-purified capture antibodies (945 and 931) were diluted to 1.2 μg/ml in PBS and 100 μl added per well to a 96-well Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp plate (Nalge Nunc International). After incubation to allow binding of antibody, SuperBlock (Pierce) was added to each well to block nonspecific binding sites. The wells were repeatedly rinsed and then stored at 4 °C in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/T) until ready for use. For the full-length APP ELISA, the protein concentration of the cell lysate supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Ten micrograms of protein from the cell lysates were aliquoted into each well. The total volume in the well was adjusted to 100 μl with PBS, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, the samples were incubated an additional 1 h with constant shaking. The wells were then washed four times with PBS/T and then incubated with 100 μl of diluted detector antibody (the mouse monoclonal antibody, 8E5, at 0.25 μg/ml except where noted). All antibodies used in the ELISA were diluted using a solution of 10% SuperBlock and 90% PBS/T. The detector antibody was incubated with each sample for 4 h with constant shaking. The wells were again washed four times with PBS/T and subsequently incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:4000; Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Following three washes with PBS/T and two washes with PBS alone, 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Pierce) solution was added to each well. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2m sulfuric acid. The relative amount of full-length APP in the sample was then quantified colorimetrically at 450 nm. The levels of secreted APPSwβ were assayed in the exact same way except that plates coated with affinity-purified 931 antibody were used to capture the β-secretase-cleaved protein and just 25 μl of conditioned medium was loaded per well. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the indicated values are averages of triplicate measurements ± S.D. As shown in Fig. 1, β-secretase cleavage of APPSw generates a large soluble amino-terminal fragment (APPSwβ) that is secreted into the medium and a CTF that is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to derive the Aβ peptide. Two novel rabbit polyclonal antisera were generated to perform the experiments described below. The binding sites of these and other antibodies are also shown in Fig. 1. The first polyclonal antisera (945) was raised to the last 20 amino acids of the APP carboxyl terminus. The specificity of the anti-COOH-terminal antibody, 945, is shown in Fig. 2 A. CHO cells stably expressing APPSw (CHOAPPSw) were metabolically labeled for 1 h with Tran35S-label. Following cell lysis, equal amounts of supernatant were incubated with 1, 2, or 4 μl of 945 antiserum or with 4 μl of preimmune serum followed by protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated APPSw was compared with that obtained using the Chemicon anti-COOH-terminal antibody by SDS-PAGE. The resulting autoradiograph shows that 945 specifically immunoprecipitates the N-glycosylated immature (I) and completely glycosylated mature (M) forms of APPSw. The second antisera specifically recognizes only the carboxyl terminus of the soluble amino-terminal fragment (APPSwβ) created when β-secretase cleaves APPSw just COOH-terminal to Leu652 (751 numbering). Results shown in Fig. 2 B demonstrate that antisera raised in two rabbits (931 and 932) against the 20-amino acid sequence just amino-terminal to the β-secretase cleavage site are capable of immunoprecipitating a soluble APPSw fragment from the conditioned medium of CHOAPPSw cells. Culture medium conditioned for 24 h by CHOAPPSw cells was divided into equal aliquots and incubated with preimmune sera from rabbit 931, 931 antisera, or 932 antisera. The mouse monoclonal antibody, 8E5, which recognizes an epitope in the lumenal region of APP (Fig. 1), served as a positive control. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the APPSw amino-terminal fragments were identified by Western blot analysis using the mouse monoclonal antibody 22C11. Both 931 and 932 antisera, but not preimmune sera, immunoprecipitated a specific APP soluble fragment from the conditioned media. The 931 antisera appeared to have a higher titer than 932. Thus, all subsequent experiments utilized only 931. As others have demonstrated, the α- and β-cleaved soluble fragments are difficult to electrophoretically resolve from one another (20Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L Selkoe D.J. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 21Chyung A.S.C. Greenberg B.D. Cook D.G. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was unclear from this Western blot analysis of conditioned medium whether the soluble APPSw fragment immunoprecipitated by 931 was limited to secreted APPSwβ or also included α-secretase-cleaved APPSw (APPSwα). Furthermore, it was not known if 931 could immunoprecipitate wild type APPβ and APPα. Consequently, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either pCDAPP or pCDAPPSw. Medium that had been conditioned for 36 h by these transiently transfected cells was collected and soluble APP fragments were immunoprecipitated with 931 or the mouse monoclonal antibody 8E5. Since the epitope recognized by 8E5 is amino-terminal to the β-secretase cleavage site, it is capable of immunoprecipitating APPα, APPβ, APPSwα, and APPSwβ. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the mouse monoclonal antibody, 22C11 to detect all forms of soluble APP and APPSw (see Fig.1). As expected, 8E5 was able to immunoprecipitate both secreted APP and APPSw from the conditioned media (Fig. 2 C,panel 1). However, 931 only immunoprecipitated soluble APPSw amino-terminal fragments from the conditioned medium of cells transiently transfected with pCDAPPSw and did not recognize wild type secreted APP fragments. A set of immunoprecipitations from conditioned medium identical to that conducted in Fig. 2 C(panel 1) was immunoblotted with the mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10, which detects only secreted APP and APPSw soluble fragments that have been cleaved by α-secretase. Although both APPα and APPSwα were detected in the 8E5 immunoprecipitates, neither form was immunoprecipitated using the 931 antibody (Fig.2 C, panel 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the 931 antibody specifically recognizes only the neoepitope derived with β-secretase cleavage of APPSw. It does not cross-react with full-length APPSw (compare Fig. 4, A and C, chase at 0 min), soluble APPα, APPβ, or APPSwα. Since 931 specifically recognized the neoepitope of β-secretase-cleaved APPSw in conditioned medium, it was used to create an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantitatively measure the amount of secreted APPSwβ. A similar ELISA was also developed to measure the amount of full-length APP or APPSw present in cell lysates using 945. To identify the best detector antibody to use in the ELISA, the affinity-purified 945 was coated on 96-well plates to capture full-length APP from cell lysates of either CHO cells or CHO cells stably expressing APPSw. After rinsing, triplicate wells were incubated with no detector, 8E5 (0.25 μg/ml), BIOSOURCE(0.25 μg/ml), or LN27 (0.5 μg/ml) mouse monoclonal antibodies and developed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The signal level observed using CHO cell lysates with these detector antibodies did not significantly differ from background, demonstrating the specificity of the ELISA for the stably expressed, human APPSw (Fig.2 D). Full-length APPSw was specifically detected in CHOAPPSw lysates with 8E5 and the BIOSOURCE mouse monoclonal antibodies showing the greatest sensitivity. A total protein concentration of 10 μg of cell lysate was found to be optimal to detect full-length APPSw (data not shown). The 8E5 and BIOSOURCE mouse monoclonal antibodies were also evaluated as detector antibodies in the 931 ELISA to measure secreted APPSwβ. Both 8E5 and BIOSOURCEantibodies were sensitive detectors of APPSwβ captured in wells coated with affinity-purified 931 (Fig. 2 E). The addition of the eight-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of APPSwβ to the conditioned medium from CHOAPPSw cells blocked detection of the β-cleaved product. When using 6E10 as the detector antibody, no signal above background was observed (data not shown). This indicated that no APPSwα was captured in the ELISA by the affinity-purified 931. Together, these results demonstrate the high specificity of this novel ELISA for APPSwβ. Experiments were next conducted to determine whether 931 recognized intracellular APPSwβ. Intracellular APPSwβ was detectable in the cell lysate as a slightly diffuse band migrating just above a nonspecific band (Fig.3 A, panel 2). This nonspecific 35S-labeled band was detected in both CHOAPP and CHOAPPSw cell lysates (data not shown). Therefore, an additional experiment was conducted to verify that this protein was not recognized by antibodies specific for the APPSwβ neoepitope. CHOAPPSw cells were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label for 12 min and chased for 45 min as described under “Experimental Procedure"
https://openalex.org/W2054164838,"We have analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation associated with retraction of the fibrin clot by washed platelets in purified fibrinogen. Retraction was dependent on integrin αIIbβ3, based on absence of retraction of αIIbβ3-deficient thrombasthenic platelets. However, only a subset of αIIbβ3-blocking antibodies or peptides were able to inhibit retraction, suggesting a differential engagement of αIIbβ3 in fibrin clot retractionversus aggregation. Immunoblotting demonstrated a phosphorylated protein pattern comparable with aggregation at early time points. However, as opposed to aggregation, tyrosine phosphorylation decreased rapidly in parallel to retraction (up to 60 min). Dephosphorylation was αIIbβ3-dependent, since it was blocked by αIIbβ3-specific inhibitors and was absent in thrombasthenic platelets. Inhibition of platelet clot retraction by phenyl-arsine oxide and peroxovanadate, suggested a role for tyrosine phosphatases. Cytochalasin D and E (5 μm) blocked fibrin clot retraction and tyrosine dephosphorylation, suggesting regulation by actin cytoskeleton assembly. Tyrosine phosphatase activities were found associated with clot retraction using the “in-gel” tyrosine phosphatase assay; however, none were αIIbβ3-dependent. An 85-kDa protein and to a lesser degree “Src” showed the closest dose-dependent correlation between inhibition of tyrosine dephosphorylation and inhibition of retraction. We thus postulate that αIIbβ3 engagement in fibrin clot retraction drives, in an actin cytoskeleton-dependent manner, the interaction of tyrosine phosphatases and of the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates 85-kDa protein and Src, the dephosphorylation of which regulates the force generation and/or transmission required for full contraction of the fibrin matrix.

We thus postulate that αIIbβ3 engagement in fibrin clot retraction drives, in an actin cytoskeleton-dependent manner, the interaction of tyrosine phosphatases and of the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates 85-kDa protein and Src, the dephosphorylation of which regulates the force generation and/or transmission required for full contraction of the fibrin matrix. phenyl-arsine oxide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sodium orthovanadate Matrix retraction (or contraction) is a cellular event subsequent to cell matrix adhesion that is biologically significant, since it is involved in such relevant phenomena as morphogenesis during embryogenesis, wound healing, or the final steps of hemostasis (1Grinnell F. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1999; 93: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 107-116Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cellular matrix retraction corresponds macroscopically to the reduction of the matrix volume, due to the activity of cells that actively reorganize the extracellular matrix by shortening and thickening matrix fibers (3Cohen I. Gerrard J.M. White J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Matrix contraction is exhibited by numerous cell types, including smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, endothelial cells, or platelets. Although the underlying mechanisms involve integrin engagement, cytoskeletal reorganization, and force generation by molecular motors (1Grinnell F. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1999; 93: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 107-116Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the exact molecular requirements for each of these steps as well as their coordination are still poorly understood. Platelets provide a particularly attractive model with which to address the issue of matrix retraction, since 1) platelets are easy to isolate and to analyze, 2) they develop a contractile activity in fibrin clot that is easy to assess, and 3) retraction activity is linked to engagement of a well characterized integrin, αIIbβ3 (also termed glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, or gpIIb-IIIa). αIIbβ3 is the most abundant integrin at the platelet surface (4Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and acts as a fibrinogen receptor in platelet aggregation. Both structure-function relationships and the signaling pathways triggered by αIIbβ3engagement have been defined in detail for aggregation and adhesion (5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, engagement of αIIbβ3 in fibrin clot retraction has been the subject of only a limited number of studies and remains poorly understood. The first evidence for a role of αIIbβ3 in retraction has been deduced from studies of a human hereditary hemorrhagic condition termed Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which is characterized by a quantitative or a qualitative defect in αIIbβ3 (6Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this recessive disorder, bleeding tendency is associated with the inability of the patient's platelets to aggregate and to retract a fibrin clot. More direct evidence for a role of αIIbβ3in fibrin clot retraction was gained from studies using αIIbβ3-specific monoclonal antibodies and αIIbβ3 antagonist peptides (7Cohen I. Burk D.L. White J.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Carr Jr., M.E. Carr S.L. Hantgan R.R. Braaten J. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Jennings L.L.K. White M.M. Mandrell T.D. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, a differential engagement of αIIbβ3 in fibrin clot retractionversus aggregation has been suggested (10Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Hantgan R.R. Mousa S.A. Thromb. Res. 1998; 89: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies have demonstrated that αIIbβ3is an important component of fibrin clot retraction, but the presence of plasma in most studies has precluded more refined biochemical characterization as well as the study of retraction-associated platelet signaling. Signaling associated with platelet aggregation, with adhesion to immobilized adhesive proteins (fibrinogen, fibrin, von Willebrand factor), or with spreading has been extensively studied (for a review, see Ref. 5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experimental settings, signaling as mediated by αIIbβ3 was shown to involve tyrosine kinases, including Syk, Fak, and Src, as well as tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTP1B (5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Cooray P. Thromb.

Haemost. 1997; 78: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, signaling associated with clot retraction by platelets has been the subject of only a few reports. These include the observation that tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibit fibrin clot retraction (14Schoenwaelder S.M. Jackson S.P. Yuan Y. Teasdale M.S. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32479-32487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a study of calpain engagement in clot relaxation, in which partial inhibition of retraction was restored by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (15Schoenwaelder S.M. Kulkani S. Salem H.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Yamao-Harigaya W. Saido T.C. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24876-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and a study on Rho-A, an actin cytoskeleton regulator of the Rho family of small G-proteins, for which no involvement in clot retraction could be demonstrated (16Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a report demonstrated that knock-in mice expressing the conservative mutations Tyr → Phe747 and Phe759 of the β3 cytoplasmic tail exhibited platelets with altered clot retraction ability (17Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for β3 cytoplasmic tail tyrosine phosphorylation in clot retraction. However signaling events associated with clot retraction were not examined. To date, no thorough analysis of signaling and particularly protein tyrosine phosphorylation during clot retraction has been reported. In the present paper, we analyze retraction of a fibrin clot by washed platelets in a plasma-free system. We confirm that like in platelet-rich plasma, αIIbβ3 is central to retraction, based on experiments using αIIbβ3-specific antagonists or αIIbβ3-deficient thrombasthenic platelets. Next, we demonstrate that clot retraction is associated with a strong and short initial wave of tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by a sustained αIIbβ3-dependent tyrosine dephosphorylation of several polypeptides. Dephosphorylation parallels retraction, is specifically blocked by αIIbβ3 blockers, and is absent in thrombasthenic platelets. Dephosphorylation is specific for retraction, since it is not observed with thrombin alone. In turn, tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors block clot retraction, thus suggesting a functional role for tyrosine phosphatases in retraction. Tyrosine dephosphorylation was inhibited by actin polymerization inhibitors. Tyrosine phosphatase activities were found associated with clot retraction using the “in-gel” tyrosine phosphatase assay, but none were αIIbβ3-dependent. Thus, αIIbβ3 engagement in retraction does not induce specific sets of tyrosine phosphatases but rather may drive the specific interaction of preexisiting tyrosine phosphatases with tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates. Among the latter, an 85-kDa protein exhibited the highest sensitivity to phenyl-arsine oxide (PAO).1 We conclude that αIIbβ3 engagement in fibrin clot retraction drives, in an actin cytoskeleton-dependent manner, the interaction of tyrosine phosphatases and of specific substrates and particularly an 85-kDa protein, the dephosphorylation of which may be involved in force generation and/or force transmission required for full contraction of the fibrin matrix. Human fibrinogen was purchased from Stago (Courbevoie, France) or Kordia (Leiden, The Netherlands). Sodium orthovanadate (NaVO4), H2O2, PAO, genistein, erbstatin A, RGDS, RGES, the γ-400–411 dodecapeptide, cytochalasin D and E, and the monoclonal anti-actin IgG were from Sigma-Aldrich (Meylan, France). αIIbβ3-specific monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr B.

Horseradish peroxidase-labeled polyclonal anti-mouse or -rabbit IgGs were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody 4G10 was from UBI (EuroMedex; Illkirch, France). The αIIbβ3antagonist cyclic heptapeptide Integrilin® (23Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. D. R. Phillips (COR Therapeutics, Palo Alto, CA), and the peptidomimetics Ro44–9883 (24Carteaux J.P. Steiner B. Roux S. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Ro43–5054 (25Kouns W.C. Kirchhofer D. Hadvary P. Edenhofer A. Weller T. Pfenninger G. Baumgartner H.R. Jennings L.K. Steiner B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. B. Steiner (Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland). The ECL chemiluminescent kit for Western blotting detection was from Pierce. Whole blood was collected with informed consent from healthy volunteers, or from a thrombasthenic patient (C. B.) by venipuncture and anticoagulated in 1:9 (v/v) ACD-C (130 mm citric acid, 124 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm glucose, pH 4.0; Ref. 26Rosa J.-P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Levy-Toledano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were then isolated as previously described (25Kouns W.C. Kirchhofer D. Hadvary P. Edenhofer A. Weller T. Pfenninger G. Baumgartner H.R. Jennings L.K. Steiner B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in resuspension buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose). CaCl2 was added extemporaneously, at a final concentration of 1 mm. Fibrinogen was purchased purified from contaminating fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen and dialyzed in platelet resuspension buffer (see above) to eliminate sodium citrate. Purity and absence of degradation was checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Glass tubes designed for aggregation were used for retraction assays. First, a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide cushion was polymerized at the bottom of the tubes to avoid clot adherence. Tubes were then rinsed extensively in distilled water. Washed platelets resuspended at 600,000/μl in resuspension buffer containing fibrinogen (4 mg/ml) were dispensed in 0.25-ml aliquots, and clot retraction was initiated by quickly pipetting down 0.25 ml of bovine thrombin (usually 2.0 units/ml) in resuspension buffer. The reaction was developed at 37 °C. Pictures were taken at time intervals using a digital camera. Quantification of retraction was performed by assessment of clot area by use of the NIH Image 1.67e software, and data were processed using Excel 4.0. Data were expressed as follows: percentage of retraction = ((areat0 − area t)/areat0) × 100. Preliminary experiments have shown that optimal calcium concentrations in our in vitro system were between 1 and 10 mm. All experiments were therefore conducted at 1 mmCa2+. Similarly, no significant differences in speed and final extent of retraction were obtained from 0.1 unit/ml to 1.0 unit/ml thrombin, indicating that at all concentrations tested, thrombin was not limiting, and a concentration of 1 unit/ml thrombin was chosen for all subsequent experiments. A fibrinogen concentration of 2 mg/ml was chosen to reproduce physiological conditions. Whenever inhibitors were to be tested in the retraction assay, they were included in the platelet suspension buffer and usually preincubated at room temperature prior to retraction induction by thrombin.CaCl2 was added to Integrilin® to compensate for sodium citrate present in the stock solution. When clots were to be analyzed by Western blotting, they were solubilized by adding 125 μl of a 5× stock solubilization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and heated at 90 °C for 20 min. 20–50 μg of platelet proteins were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a Hoeffer electroblotter appliance at 200 mA for 90 min. Processing of blotted membranes was carried out as described previously (26Rosa J.-P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Levy-Toledano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bound IgGs were detected by chemiluminescence using the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation was achieved by digitizing Western blot autoluminograms and assessing band area and gray scale pixel values using the SigmaGel 1.0 computer program. Variation in band intensities due to the Western blotting procedure was corrected using actin as an internal standard for each sample, and then intensity values were normalized using the corresponding band as reference in the 5-min retraction control run in each gel. Determination of tyrosine phosphatase activity was achieved by the in-gel method of K. Burridge and Nelson (27Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A poly(Glu-Tyr) peptide was 32P-labeled as described except that c-Src (Sigma) was used for labeling. Labeled poly(Glu-Tyr) (∼1 × 108 cpm/mg) was included in a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (0.1% bisacrylamide (w/v)) at 100,000 cpm/ml before polymerization. After electrophoresis, the SDS-PAGE gel was processed exactly as described to renature tyrosine phosphatase activity. After Coomassie staining and drying, the gel was subjected to autoradiography. Bands corresponding to tyrosine phosphatase proteins appeared clear on a dark background of phosphorylated peptide. Negative pictures of autoradiographs were generated after scanning and image processing. We have developed a plasma-free retraction assay using purified fibrinogen and washed platelets. Photographs of a typical control clot retraction are shown in Fig. 1 A(upper panel) from 0 to 60 min. The extent of retraction was assessed from quantitation of clot surface area (see “Experimental Procedures”) and was expressed as percentage of total clot surface versus time, as illustrated in Fig.1 A, lower panel, control curve. In preliminary experiments (not shown), we have tested varying conditions including thrombin concentrations from 0.1 to 4 units/ml and Ca2+ concentrations from 1 to 10 mm, at the physiological fibrinogen concentration of 2 mg/ml. No difference was found in retraction kinetics (nor in protein tyrosine phosphorylation patterns). We therefore considered our conditions nonlimiting and chose arbitrarily to perform experiments at concentrations of 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 unit/ml thrombin. Previous studies have demonstrated αIIbβ3 integrin involvement in retraction of fibrin clot in plasma (7Cohen I. Burk D.L. White J.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Carr Jr., M.E. Carr S.L. Hantgan R.R. Braaten J. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Jennings L.L.K. White M.M. Mandrell T.D. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To verify the engagement of αIIbβ3 in our plasma-free conditions, we used various αIIbβ3-specific inhibitors (Fig. 1). Among several αIIbβ3-blocking monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lower panel), the β3-specific monoclonal antibody 7E3 inhibited retraction efficiently (80%), confirming previous observations (7Cohen I. Burk D.L. White J.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, combinations of monoclonals, ineffective when used alone, such as AP3 (β3-specific) and Tab (αIIb-specific), or either one in combination with 10E5 (αIIbβ3-specific) also blocked retraction efficiently. Surprisingly, the aggregation-blocking 10E5 (as well as AP2, not shown) was unable to block retraction when used alone. This suggests a differential engagement of αIIbβ3 with fibrin compared with fibrinogen and/or in retraction compared with aggregation. In Fig. 1 B, a comparative analysis was conducted with the αIIbβ3 antagonists RGDS and γ-400–411 dodecapeptide and the highly specific peptide Integrilin®. Integrilin® inhibited retraction efficiently (82 ± 11% inhibition at 25 μm), confirming the specific engagement of αIIbβ3 in fibrin clot retraction. Of note, neither RGDS nor the γ-400–411 dodecapeptide had any effect; this result together with the higher concentration of Integrilin® required for full inhibition of retraction (25 μm)versus aggregation (2 μm; Ref. 23Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown) suggests higher affinity/avidity of fibrin for αIIbβ3 compared with fibrinogen, possibly due to the polymeric state of the former. In Fig. 1 C, αIIbβ3 engagement in fibrin clot in our assay conditions was confirmed by the low extent of retraction of platelets from a type I thrombasthenic patient exhibiting no detectable αIIbβ3 by Western blotting (see Refs. 26Rosa J.-P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Levy-Toledano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 28Djaffar I. Caen J.P. Rosa J.-P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 2183-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; data not shown). This result is comparable with that obtained with the monoclonal antibody mix Tab + AP3. Altogether, our data 1) confirm the involvement of αIIbβ3 integrin in fibrin clot retraction in plasma-free conditions, and thereby validate our assay and 2) suggest differential engagement of αIIbβ3in retraction versus aggregation. We then asked whether differential engagement of αIIbβ3 corresponded to differential αIIbβ3 signaling; we thus assessed tyrosine phosphorylation associated with clot retraction, since it is a prominent signaling pathway triggered by αIIbβ3 (5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows phosphotyrosine protein patterns during retraction, as assessed by Western blotting and the corresponding band intensity quantitation. In Fig. 2 A, a time course of phosphotyrosine protein phosphorylation during fibrin retraction with normal platelets showed an initial pattern comparable with platelet aggregation (26Rosa J.-P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Levy-Toledano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including a 125/130- and a 100/105-kDa doublet (the latter slightly altered in migration by a 100-kDa nonphosphorylated protein identified as the cross-linked γ-γ fibrinogen/fibrin chain dimer; data not shown), a faint 85-kDa band, cortactin as a 77–80-kDa doublet, a 64-kDa band, Src as a 60-kDa band, and a 48-kDa band. Cortactin and Src have been identified previously by immunoprecipitation (26Rosa J.-P. Artçanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Levy-Toledano S. Blood. 1997; 89: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern evolved with time, exhibiting a short initial wave of phosphorylation culminating at 5 min, followed by a slower wave of dephosphorylation, which paralleled most of the retraction extent (Fig. 2 B). This phenomenon was not due to protein degradation, as ascertained by even Ponceau S patterns (not shown) and reprobing of the blot with anti-actin (bottom panel, actin). Dephosphorylation was not due to thrombin stimulation per se, since platelets stimulated with thrombin in the absence of added fibrinogen yielded a tyrosine phosphorylation pattern that remained steady with time, as opposed to platelets in conditions of retraction (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation, characterized by a short initial wave of tyrosine phosphorylation followed by a slower dephosphorylation pattern, is specific to fibrin clot retraction. Fig.3 shows that when retraction was inhibited by the retraction-blocking association of anti-αIIbβ3 (Tab, AP-3) monoclonal antibodies (middle panel), initial tyrosine phosphorylation occurred in all conditions but was not followed by dephosphorylation, as opposed to control platelets (left panel). The same absence of dephosphorylation was noted when retraction was blocked by the synthetic inhibitor Integrilin® (not shown) or when thrombasthenic platelets lacking αIIbβ3 were used (right panel). The correlation in kinetics between retraction and protein tyrosine dephosphorylation and the absence of dephosphorylation in retraction-blocking conditions both argue strongly in favor of a protein tyrosine dephosphorylation activity specifically triggered by αIIbβ3 engagement in retraction. Interestingly, the initial wave of tyrosine phosphorylation appears αIIbβ3-independent, since it is preserved in αIIbβ3-blocking conditions or in thrombasthenic platelets. To test whether tyrosine phosphatases played any role in retraction, we performed clot retraction in the presence of various concentrations of PAO or of peroxovanadate (H2O2 + NaVO4), two distinct inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases (29Garcia-Morales P. Minami Y. Luong E. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9255-9259Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30Pumiglia K.M. Lau L.F. Huang C.K. Burroughs S. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 4, A andB, demonstrates that both inhibitors totally inhibited clot retraction, with IC50 of 0.4 μm for PAO and 4–800 μm for peroxovanadate, while enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrated by Western blotting for the major phosphorylated substrates p48, Src, p64, cortactin, p85, 100/105, and 125/130 (not shown). Altogether, our results suggest that tyrosine phosphatase activity is directly or indirectly involved in clot retraction. Cytochalasins are known to inhibit clot retraction (3Cohen I. Gerrard J.M. White J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To check if inhibition of actin cytoskeleton affected αIIbβ3-dependent tyrosinedephosphorylation, we preincubated platelets with cytochalasin D, a well studied inhibitor of actin polymerization. We obtained a dose-dependent inhibition of clot retraction (Fig. 5 A), with full inhibition at 2–5 μm. The dose-dependent inhibition of retraction was comparable between cytochalasin D and E (not shown). Analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting showed that inhibition of actin polymerization completely inhibited protein tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). These results thus suggest that αIIbβ3regulates protein tyrosine dephosphorylation via actin cytoskeleton assembly. One interpretation of our results is that dephosphorylation during retraction is due to induction by αIIbβ3 of a de novo tyrosine phosphatase activity. Alternatively, αIIbβ3may regulate tyrosine phosphatase/tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate interaction. To distinguish between these possibilities, we looked for correlations between retraction blockade by Integrilin® or cytochalasin D and variations in the SDS-PAGE pattern of tyrosine phosphatase activities of platelets, obtained by the in-gel method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 6shows a negative autoradiograph after in-gel phosphatase activity analysis of platelets after retraction for 5 and 60 min, compared with retraction inhibited by the αIIbβ3-blocker Integrilin® or by cytochalasin D. Resting platelets (lane 1) exhibit two major bands at 130 and 32 kDa, as well as several minor bands at 100, 85, 49, and 22 kDa. After 5-min retraction, the 130-kDa and the 32-kDa bands were strongly diminished, while a new 26-kDa band appeared, the other bands remaining unchanged (lanes 2 and 3). After 60-min retraction, all bands diminished except for the unchanged 26-kDa band. Thus, retraction correlated with a specific pattern of tyrosine phosphatases, which evolved with time. However, the same pattern was obtained when clot retraction was inhibited by the αIIbβ3 blocker Integrilin® (lanes 4 and 5) or by cytochalasin D (lanes 6 and 7). This result thus suggests that tyrosine phosphatases induced in conditions of fibrin clot retraction are independent from αIIbβ3engagement or from actin polymerization. Although we cannot rule out a possible “technical” artifact, this result suggests that dephosphorylation during retraction is not due to the de novo induction of a new tyrosine phosphatase by αIIbβ3. It thus follows that αIIbβ3-dependent dephosphorylation is due to the regulation by αIIbβ3 engagement of a specific interaction of tyrosine phosphatases and of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, possibly thro"
https://openalex.org/W1980892269,"To facilitate studies of the molecular determinants of host-meningococcal lipooligosaccharide (endotoxin) interactions at patho-physiologically relevant endotoxin concentrations (i.e. ≤10 ng/ml), we have generated acetate auxotrophs NMBACE1 from encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (serogroup B, strain NMB) and NMBACE2 from an isogenic bacterial mutant lacking the polysialic acid capsule. Growth of the auxotrophs in medium containing [14C]acetate yielded14C-lipooligosaccharides containing ∼600 cpm/ng. Gel sieving resolved 14C-lipooligosaccharide-containing aggregates with an estimated molecular mass of ≥20 × 106 Da (peak A) and ∼1 × 106 Da (peak B) from both strains. Lipooligosaccharides in peaks A and B had the same fatty acid composition and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile. 14C-Labeled capsule copurified with 14C-lipooligosaccharides in peak B from NMBACE1, whereas the other aggregates contained only14C-lipooligosaccharide. For all aggregates, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14-induced delivery of lipooligosaccharides to endothelial cells and cell activation correlated with disaggregation of lipooligosaccharides. These processes were inhibited by the presence of capsule but unaffected by the size of the aggregates. In contrast, endotoxin activation of cells containing membrane CD14 was unaffected by capsule but diminished when endotoxin was presented in larger aggregates. These findings demonstrate that the physical presentation of lipooligosaccharide, including possible interactions with capsule, affect the ability of meningococcal endotoxin to interact with and activate specific host targets. To facilitate studies of the molecular determinants of host-meningococcal lipooligosaccharide (endotoxin) interactions at patho-physiologically relevant endotoxin concentrations (i.e. ≤10 ng/ml), we have generated acetate auxotrophs NMBACE1 from encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (serogroup B, strain NMB) and NMBACE2 from an isogenic bacterial mutant lacking the polysialic acid capsule. Growth of the auxotrophs in medium containing [14C]acetate yielded14C-lipooligosaccharides containing ∼600 cpm/ng. Gel sieving resolved 14C-lipooligosaccharide-containing aggregates with an estimated molecular mass of ≥20 × 106 Da (peak A) and ∼1 × 106 Da (peak B) from both strains. Lipooligosaccharides in peaks A and B had the same fatty acid composition and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile. 14C-Labeled capsule copurified with 14C-lipooligosaccharides in peak B from NMBACE1, whereas the other aggregates contained only14C-lipooligosaccharide. For all aggregates, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14-induced delivery of lipooligosaccharides to endothelial cells and cell activation correlated with disaggregation of lipooligosaccharides. These processes were inhibited by the presence of capsule but unaffected by the size of the aggregates. In contrast, endotoxin activation of cells containing membrane CD14 was unaffected by capsule but diminished when endotoxin was presented in larger aggregates. These findings demonstrate that the physical presentation of lipooligosaccharide, including possible interactions with capsule, affect the ability of meningococcal endotoxin to interact with and activate specific host targets. lipooligosaccharide 3-hydroxy-fatty acid fatty acid(s) Hanks' balanced salts solution human umbilical vein endothelial cells lipopolysaccharide-binding protein lipopolysaccharide membrane-bound CD14 Morse's defined medium pyruvate dehydrogenase peripheral blood mononuclear cells polymorphonuclear leukocytes soluble CD14 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis interleukin gas chromatography mass spectrometry monoclonal antibody ampicillin kanamycin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Lipooligosaccharide (LOS; endotoxin)1 is a specialized bacterial glycolipid that is structurally related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is expressed on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of certain Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R.

LPS and LOS activation of eukaryotic cells is facilitated by their interaction with specific host proteins that bind the conserved endotoxin lipid A moiety (3Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin.

Meningococcal lipid A consists of anO-phosphorylethanolamine-substituted β(1′→6)-linkedd-glucosamine backbone containing symmetrically arranged ester- and amide-linked 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH FA) (5Kulshin V.A.

Among its reported effects, LOS promotes the release of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α from mammalian cells and induces the activation of host cells such as macrophages and neutrophils and endothelial cells (6Boudjellab N.

These responses are important for mobilization of host defenses against invading Gram-negative bacteria but can also lead to many of the most severe pathologic consequences of uncontrolled invasive Gram-negative bacterial infections. Thus, the severity of outcome in meningococcemia appears closely correlated to plasma levels of LOS (10Brandtzaeg P. Oktedalen O. Kierulf P. Opstad P.K. Regul.

The unusually acute progression of invasive meningococcal disease may be linked to both the high levels of LOS in host tissues and the intrinsically potent effects of LOS toward host leukocytes and endothelium. 2L.

Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar)) may be critical for the clearance and detoxification and, hence, regulation of the host response to endotoxin. Better understanding of the factors regulating meningococcal mobilization of LOS and the interactions of LOS with defined host proteins and cells would be greatly facilitated by an efficient method of labeling LOS. In this report we describe a method for high specific radiolabeling of the FA moieties of meningococcal lipid A, similar to a previously published method for radiolabeling Escherichia coli LPS to high specific activity (37Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This method involves the generation of an acetate auxotroph by mutagenesis of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) coding region. The E1 component of the PDH complex is encoded by the aceE gene in E. coli(pdhA in Neisseria spp.; Ref. 38Neveling U. Bringer-Meyer S. Sahm H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and takes part in the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. The chief obstacle to efficient radiolabeling of LOS lipid moieties is the production of nonradiolabeled acetyl-CoA from pyruvate and the incorporation of this pyruvate-derived acetate into nascent lipid chains. Here we describe the generation of meningococcal acetate auxotrophs. These mutant strains have been used to produce radiolabeled LOS of high specific radioactivity for the purpose of studying the physical characteristics of purified LOS and the relationship of the physical properties of LOS to its biological activity toward mammalian cells.

Bovine type 1 collagen was obtained from Collaborative Research Products. 96-well Optiplates were from Anthos Labtec Instruments (New Castle, DE), and lucigenin was from Sigma. Encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain NMB and an acapsular mutant of NMB (PBCC7232-NMB ΔsiaA-D) were routinely cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% atmosphere on GC agar supplemented with 1× isovitalex. The latter strain was a gift from Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics (West Henrietta, NY). Meningococcal transformants were selected and maintained on brain-heart infusion medium agar supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, 1× isovitalex, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 45 μg/ml kanamycin (Km). Radiolabeling and acetate titration experiments were carried out in Morse's defined broth medium (MDM) (40Morse S.A. Miller R.D. Roberts R.B. The Gonococcus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1977: 213-253Google Scholar) supplemented with 1- isovitalex, 10 mm sodium bicarbonate, and, as indicated, various concentrations of sodium acetate. E. coli strains GM2163(dam-), DH5α and INVαF′ were routinely cultured on LB agar at 37 °C or in LB broth with 200 rpm agitation at 37 °C. E. coli transformants were selected and maintained with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Ap) and/or 40 μg/ml Km where indicated. E. coli PL-2 was grown in nutrient broth supplemented with [14C]oleic acid (1 μCi/ml) to label bacterial phospholipids as previously described (41Katz S.S. Weinrauch Y. Munford R.S. Elsbach P.

The University of Oklahoma gonococcal FA1090 genome data base was searched using the BLASTp algorithm (42Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71280) Google Scholar). The putative gonococcal gene encoding the PDH E1 component (pdhA) was identified by sequence homology with E. coli AceE (GenBankTM accession 2506964) and Hemeophilus influenzae Rd putative AceE (GenBankTM accession 1574164). Oligonucleotide primers (primer 1: 5′-GAA GGA CGG GCA AGA CCA GAT; primer 2: 5′-GCA TTC CGG GCG ACC AAA ACA) were used to generate a 2,080-base pair polymerase chain reaction product from gonococcal FA1090 genomic DNA, which contained the putative pdhA open reading frame. The amplification product was ligated to the cloning vector, pCR2.1, and the resulting product (pACE1) was used to transform E. coli strain INVαF′ by the manufacturer's protocol. Transformants were selected on LB agar with Ap, and pACE1 was isolated from a colony-purified transformant by alkaline lysis followed by purification using an affinity spin column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The insert within pACE1 was isolated by EcoRI digestion followed by agarose gel filtration and affinity spin column purification and ligated to EcoRI-digested pBlueScript SK cloning vector. Transformants of E. coli INVαF′ were selected on Ap-containing LB agar, and plasmid pACE2 was isolated as described above. This plasmid was used to transform the Dam methylase-deficient E. coli strain, GM2163. The plasmid was purified from a resulting transformant and digested withNruI that cleaved the insert DNA once within the putativepdhA open reading frame. A Km resistance cassette within pBSL86 (43Alexeyev M.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 52-55PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated by HincII digestion and agarose gel filtration, as described above, and ligated to the uniqueNruI restriction site in the pACE2 insert. The resulting plasmid, pACE4, was isolated as described above from a Km- and Ap-resistant bacterial colony following transformation of E. coli INVαF′ and was used to generate a meningococcal acetate auxotroph. Transformation of the naturally competent meningococci has been described previously (44Stephens D.S. McAllister C.F. Zhou D. Lee F.K. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2947-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Catlin, B. W. (1959) 79, 579–590.Google Scholar). In brief, meningococcal strain, NMB, was incubated with pACE4 (∼1 × 107colony-forming units/50 ng DNA) on GC agar for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2/95% atmosphere. The resulting transformants were incubated on supplemented brain-heart infusion medium agar (see “Bacterial Culture Conditions”). Genomic DNA preparations from selected colony-purified transformants were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using primers 1 and 2 (above) to verify the presence of the Km cassette within the putativepdhA open reading frame (data not shown). The Km-resistant, Ap-sensitive NMB transformant NMBACE1 was chosen for further study. This same method was used to generate an acetate auxotroph (NMBACE2) of the acapsular NMB mutant (PBCC- 7232-NMBΔsiaA-D). Acetate auxotrophy of NMBACE1 and NMBACE2 was established by measuring bacterial growth in MDM supplemented with 0–5 mm sodium acetate. Bacterial growth was measured as increasing turbidity using a Klett-Summerson Photoelectric Colorimeter (green filter) (Manostat, New York, NY). Lysates of bacteria were analyzed for PDH activity by measuring the conversion of NAD to NADH (A 340 nm) in the presence of pyruvate and cocarboxylase. Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase (A 660 nm = 0.4) in supplemented MDM with 3.5 mm acetate. The bacteria were washed and resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 1 mmMgCl2 and lysed in a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. (SLM Aminco). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for PDH activity as described (46Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Meningococci were harvested from supplemented GC agar, resuspended in MDM containing 1.5 mmsodium acetate to a density of A 660 nm = 0.05, and incubated to late log phase. Incubations contained 2 μCi/ml of [1,2-14C]sodium acetate to measure synthesis of14C-LOS during bacterial growth or 160 μCi/ml of [1,2-14C]sodium acetate to prepare 14C-LOS of high specific radioactivity. Synthesis of 14C-LOS was monitored by measuring incorporation of [14C]acetate into 3-OH-fatty acids that are unique to LOS (5Kulshin V.A. Zahringer U. Lindner B. Frasch C.E. Tsai C.M.

Immun. 1998; 66: 5939-5947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cells were treated sequentially with 4 n HCl and 4 n NaOH at 90 °C to release ester- and amide-linked FA and then extracted with chloroform/methanol to recover labeled 3-OH- and nonhydroxylated FA in the chloroform phase (39Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonhydroxylated- and 3-OH-FA were separated by TLC (0.25-mm silica gel G HPTLC; Analtech, Newark, DE) using petroleum ether/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (70:30:1 v/v/v) as the solvent system. Individual FA were resolved by reverse phase TLC (0.2 mm HPTLC, RP-18; Merck) using acetonitrile/acetic acid (1:1 v/v) as the solvent system (39Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and identified by comigration with purified14C-FA. The relative amounts of labeled 3-OH-FA and nonhydroxylated FA were determined by image analysis (PhosphorImager; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using a tritium screen that permitted quantitation of as little as 200 cpm after 24 h of exposure. From these data, the absolute amount of radiolabeled 3-OH-FA could be calculated ((14C cpm in chloroform phase after acid/base treatment) × (fraction of 14C-labeled species in chloroform phase migrating as 3-OH-FA during TLC)).14C-Labeled species were measured in a Beckman LS 5000TD liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). No free [14C]3-OH-FA was detected without acid/base treatment, indicating that these FA were covalently linked to LOS. The amount of 3-OH-FA in various purified 14C-LOS preparations was measured by GC-MS using a gas chromatograph with a DBXLB column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm; J & W Scientific) connected to a Hewlett Packard Mass-ENGINE. Samples were prepared from bacteria metabolically labeled with 1 μCi/ml [14C]acetate in 2 mmsodium acetate to ensure that recovered FA contained mainly nonisotopic carbon. Samples were chemically hydrolyzed and extracted as described above. Recovered free FA in the chloroform phase were spiked with 15:0 to provide an internal standard. Perfluorobenzyl derivatives were prepared by reaction of FA with α-bromo-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-toluene and N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile at 40 °C for 1 h. Derivatized FA were separated from excess reagents by TLC using a silica gel G plate developed in ethyl acetate/methanol (98:2 v/v). Eluted derivatized FA were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in a 1:1 mixture ofN,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and acetonitrile and incubated at 40 °C for 1 h to produce trimethyl silane derivatives. After evaporation of solvent, the sample was resuspended in 10–25 μl of isooctane and injected (1–4 μl) for GC-MS analysis. FA were eluted using a temperature gradient from 70 to 250 °C developed at a rate of ∼10 °C/min. Derivatized FA species were ionized by negative ion chemical ionization using methane gas. Species from experimental samples were identified and quantified by comparison with elution of known amounts (20–500 pg) of appropriate FA standards. Data were acquired and processed using HP Chemstation. Recoveries of derivatized 14C-FA in isooctane (before application to GC) and of the internal standard (15:0) (after GC) were monitored to correct for losses of material during sample preparation (recovery was >70%). The amount of LOS in samples from which 3-OH-FA were derived was estimated on the basis of the known mass and composition of NMB LOS and of the 3-OH-FA present within LOS (5Kulshin V.A. Zahringer U. Lindner B. Frasch C.E. Tsai C.M. Dmitriev B.A. Rietschel E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kahler C.M. Stephens D.S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 24: 281-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By SDS-PAGE and silver staining or autoradiography, nearly all LOS contained the full-length oligosaccharide chain. The specific radioactivity of 14C-LOS was calculated from image and GC-MS analyses and corrected for dilution in the growth medium of [14C]acetate with unlabeled acetate to determine the specific radioactivity of 14C-LOS derived from acetate auxotrophs metabolically labeled with [14C]acetate alone. 14C-LOS was purified from radiolabeled bacteria by a modification of the hot phenol-water method. In brief, bacteria were harvested after growth to late log phase in MDM containing [14C]acetate, resuspended in 0.1–0.4 vol of lysozyme (2 mg/ml), and incubated overnight with gentle shaking at room temperature. Nuclease (2.5 units/ml) was added, and the sample was incubated with gentle shaking (200 rpm) for 3 h at 37 °C. After addition of an equal volume of hot phenol (65 °C), the sample was incubated at 65 °C for 20 min with vigorous shaking and then placed on ice for 15 min. The aqueous and phenol phases were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. After removal of the aqueous phase, the remaining phenol phase was re-extracted twice with an equal volume of water. The recovered aqueous phases were combined, and LOS was precipitated by the addition of 0.1 vol of 3 m sodium acetate and 2 vol of 95% ethanol. After overnight incubation at −20 °C, the sample was spun at 10,000 × g to sediment 14C-LOS. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was washed three times with ice-cold 95% ethanol. The remaining pellet was dried at 37 °C, resuspended in cold distilled water to an estimated concentration of 100 μg LOS/ml, and sonicated at room temperature for 15 min in a water bath sonicator. Aliquots of resuspended and sonicated 14C-LOS were diluted in HEPES-buffered (10 mm, pH 7.4) Hanks' balanced salts solution (HBSS with divalent cations) supplemented with 0.1–1% human serum albumin and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before gel filtration chromatography. Samples containing from 4 to 8 μg of LOS were applied in 0.2–0.5-ml samples on a 1.5 cm × 17.5 cm column of Sephacryl S500 HR equilibrated in the same buffered solution. Fractions (1 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. Aliquots of the collected 14C-LOS fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Recoveries of the radiolabeled LOS ranged from 70 to 90%. To preclude contamination of purified LOS preparations, all solutions were pyrogen-free and sterile. The glass columns and connecting tubing were either autoclaved or washed extensively with 70% ethanol. After chromatography, selected fractions were pooled and passed through syringe sterile filters (pore size, 0.22 μm) with greater than 90% recovery of labeled material in the sterile filtrate. Fractions were stored under sterile conditions at 4 °C for up to 3 months with no detectable changes in chromatographic or functional properties. The column was calibrated using 14C-oleate-labeled E. coli PL-2 and [14C]acetate as markers of the void (10–11 ml) and inclusion volumes (25–26 ml), respectively, in column buffer with or without 0.1% albumin. Additional standards included blue dextran (estimated molecular mass, 2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (650 and 1300 kDa, monomers and dimers, respectively), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Elution profiles of bacteria, blue dextran, and acetate were unaffected by the presence of albumin in the column buffer. 14C-FA composition of purified14C-LOS was determined as described above. Quantitation of14C-fatty acids, resolved by reverse phase TLC, was achieved by image analysis. Dilute samples were lyophilized before chemical hydrolysis. SDS-PAGE of 14C-LOS was carried out in 16% acrylamide containing glycerol. 14C-LOS was visualized by autoradiography. To permit analysis of samples containing as little as 50 ng LOS/ml, selected fractions from Sephacryl S500 chromatography were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centricon-100 and rechromatographed on Sephacryl S200 in HEPES-buffered HBSS to deplete fractions containing LOS of albumin. Recovered LOS-containing fractions were desalted using Centricon-100. Recoveries of 14C-LOS at each step was ≥80%. HUVEC were routinely cultured on collagen-coated plasticware (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 10 ng/ml human endothelial growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were subcultured and grown to confluence (∼4–5 days). Cell monolayers were then washed twice with warm HBSS to remove traces of serum before adding experimental media. Experiments were done with cells between passages 2 and 6. Human polymorphonuclear"

Prostaglandins have been detected in high concentrations in certain corals, and previous evidence suggested their biosynthesis through a lipoxygenase-allene oxide pathway. Here we describe the discovery of an ancestor of cyclooxygenases that is responsible for prostaglandin biosynthesis in coral. Using a homology-based polymerase chain reaction cloning strategy, the cDNA encoding a polypeptide with ∼50% amino acid identity to both mammalian COX-1 and COX-2 was cloned and sequenced from the Arctic soft coral Gersemia fruticosa. Nearly all the amino acids essential for substrate binding and catalysis as determined in the mammalian enzymes are represented in coral COX: the arachidonate-binding Arg120 and Tyr355 are present, as are the heme-coordinating His207 and His388; the catalytic Tyr385; and the target of aspirin attack, Ser530. A key amino acid that determines the sensitivity to selective COX-2 inhibitors (Ile523 in COX-1 and Val523 in COX-2) is present in coral COX as isoleucine. The conserved Glu524, implicated in the binding of certain COX inhibitors, is represented as alanine. Expression of the G. fruticosa cDNA afforded a functional cyclooxygenase that converted exogenous arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. The biosynthesis was inhibited by indomethacin, whereas the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide was ineffective. We conclude that the cyclooxygenase occurs widely in the animal kingdom and that vertebrate COX-1 and COX-2 are evolutionary derivatives of the invertebrate precursor.

COX is a hemoprotein with two distinct catalytic activities: the cyclooxygenase activity involved in the formation of PGG2 from arachidonic acid and the peroxidase activity that catalyzes the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 (3Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). There are two COX isozymes called COX-1 and COX-2 (6Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Lipid Mediat.

COX-1 is expressed constitutively in nearly all mammalian tissues and forms prostaglandins with housekeeping functions. COX-2, although absent from most cells, can be rapidly induced in many cell types upon treatment with inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (8Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The highly active peroxidase-lipoxygenase fusion protein identified inPlexaura homomalla that catalyzes conversion of arachidonic acid into allene oxide is not involved in prostaglandin synthesis (17Koljak R.

Our previous biochemical studies showed that (i) crude enzyme preparations of the Arctic soft coral Gersemia fruticosa convert exogenous arachidonic acid into a mixture of prostaglandins with typical mammalian stereochemistry; (ii) the biosynthetic pathway involves a common hydroperoxyendoperoxide intermediate, PGG2; and (iii) the synthesis is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (18Varvas K.

These findings provide strong evidence that a relative of mammalian cyclooxygenases is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis in coral. However, no enzyme has been isolated, cloned, or otherwise characterized from coral or any other invertebrate.Here we report investigations aimed at characterization of this enzyme. Using a homology-based PCR strategy, we cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding the functional cyclooxygenase that catalyzes transformation of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins in the prostaglandin-containing Arctic coral G. fruticosa. In expression studies, the coral enzyme was located in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope of COS-7 cells, and the putative N-terminal signal peptide of the enzyme was cleaved. Our results indicate that the first cloned COX from non-vertebrates is an ancestor of vertebrate cyclooxygenase isozymes.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Total RNAFor preparation of total RNA, the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar) gave the crude product with a remarkable amount of low molecular mass decomposition products as determined by denaturing RNA gel electrophoresis. The best results were obtained with the method used by Su and Gibor (22Su X. Gibor A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for RNA isolation from marine red or green algae. Stage A gave an almost colorless pellet of RNA that was successfully used for cDNA synthesis. Approximately 3 g ofG. fruticosa stored at −70 °C was pulverized to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. 10 ml of lysis buffer (150 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) was added immediately to the coral powder and vortexed for 2 min. Then 1 ml of 8m guanidinium-H Cl was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 1 min. The solution was extracted with 1 volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1, v/v), and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The aqueous phase was collected and re-extracted with 1 volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1, by volume), and the sample was then centrifuged again. To remove the traces of phenol, the aqueous phase was re-extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1, v/v). Precipitation of the total RNA was carried out by addition of 0.33 volume of 12 m LiCl and β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration of 1% (v/v)) at −20 °C for 24 h. The total RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 90 min and washed with 75% ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. All operations were carried out at 0 to +4 °C. The pellet of RNA was dissolved in 1 mmEDTA and quantified by UV spectroscopy. Approximately 2 mg of total RNA was recovered using this protocol.mRNA purification for 5′-RACE was carried out with an oligo(dT)-cellulose column and purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and yielded 10 μg of poly(A)-rich RNA from 1.45 mg ofG. fruticosa total RNA. For Northern blot analysis, the mRNA was purified using an Oligotex spin column (Oligotex mRNA midi kit, QIAGEN Inc.). Approximately 20 μg of mRNA was recovered from 330 μg of total RNA using this protocol.cDNA Synthesis and PCR CloningcDNA reactions were run as described previously (23Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) using total RNA and an oligo(dT) sequence linked at the 5′-end to an adaptor sequence (5′-ATG-AAT-TCG-GTA-CCC-GGG-ATC-C(T)17-3′).Initial PCR CloneUpstream degenerate primers were based on the conserved sequence of mammalian COX-1 and COX-2, FAFFAQHFTHQFFKT, 5′-TTT-GCN-TTY-TTY-GCN-CAR-CAY-TT-3′ (see Fig. 1, primer F1) for the first round and 5′-TTC-ACN-CAY-CAR-TTY-TTY-AAR-AC-3′ (primer F2) (where R is A or G; Y is C or T; and N is A, G, C, or T) for the second round of nested PCR. Downstream primers were based on the conserved sequence TFGGDVG, 5′-CC-CAC-NTC-NCC-NCC-RAA-NGT-3′ (see Fig. 1, primer R1), and for the second round of nested PCR, the conserved sequence in the region of the active-site tyrosine, WHPLLPD, 5′-TC-AGG-CAK-NAR-NGG-RTG-CCA-3′ (primer R2) (where K is G or T).The first round of PCR was primed with G. fruticosa cDNA prepared from 0.4 μg of total RNA using 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2with 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.4 μm primers, and 0.25 μl (1.25 units) of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 480 thermal cycler. After a hot start at 80 °C, the PCR was programmed as follows: 94 °C for 45 s for one cycle; 47 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 94 °C for 45 s for 30 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. The second round reaction was primed with the equivalent of 0.1 μl of the first round reaction products (added as a 10-fold dilution). The protocol used was as follows: 94 °C for 45 s for one cycle; 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C 45 s for 30 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products visualized on 2.0% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide were purified on an agarose gel (GENO-BIND, CLONTECH) and subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen).3′-RACEThis was accomplished using first strand cDNA prepared using the adaptor-linked oligo(dT) primer. The upstream primers for the first and second rounds of PCR were gene-specific: 5′-CA-GAG-CTA-GTG-TTT-GAC-CAT-GGC-3′ and 5′-C-TAC-GAC-AAT-CGT-ATC-CAC-GTC-G-3′. The downstream primer was based on the adaptor sequence of the cDNA synthesis primer 5′-ATG-AAT-TCG-GTA-CCC-GGG-3′. A PCR program of one cycle at 94 °C for 45 s; 30 cycles at 47 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 94 °C for 45 s; and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min was used for the first round of PCR. A PCR program of 30 cycles at 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 96 °C for 15 s followed by one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min was used for the second round of half-nested PCR.5′-RACEThis was accomplished using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using 1.6 μg of mRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA was diluted 1:50, and 1 μl of the dilution was used per 50-μl PCR. For the 5′-RACE reaction, the upstream primer for the first and second rounds of PCR was specific for the ligated adaptor sequence, 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′. The downstream primer for the first round reaction was 5′-TT-TTG-TCG-CTC-CAT-ATC-CTG-ACC-3′. The PCR program was one cycle at 94 °C for 45 s; 30 cycles at 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2.5 min, and 96 °C for 15 s; and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. For the second round reaction (primed with 0.1 μl of first round reaction products), the downstream primer was 5′-GA-GAC-ATC-CAC-TCC-ATG-ATT-CCC-3′, and a similar PCR program was used except that the extension time was shortened to 2 min.Full-length cDNA Clones Obtained by PCRThe upstream primer encoded the N terminus of the polypeptide and the natural Kozak consensus sequence from the coral (AAG-ATG-G) for translation initiation (24Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar); the BamHI site was added at the 5′-end to facilitate subcloning: 5′-T-CAC-GGA-TCC-AAG-ATG-GTG-GCC-AAG-TTT-GTC-G-3′. The downstream primer encoded the C terminus of the polypeptide with an added 5′-EcoRV site to facilitate subcloning: 5′-TC-TAG-GCC-TGA-TAT-CTA-AAG-TTC-ATC-TCT-TGC-TTC-3′. PCRs were run using 1 μl of the first strand cDNA and the cloned PfuDNA polymerase (Promega) with the buffer supplied (10× buffer: 100 mm KCl, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 200 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.75), 20 mm MgSO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 200 μm each dNTP, and 0.4 μm each primer using the hot start protocol: one cycle at 95 °C for 5 min; cooling to 4 °C and addition of DNA polymerase (2.5 units/50-μl reaction); one cycle at 94 °C for 1 min; three cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 5 min; and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The 3′-A overhang was added by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The PCR product was purified on agarose gel and subcloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega).DNA Sequencing and Sequence AnalysesPlasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN plasmid purification system. The clones were sequenced using an ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer. The amino acid sequence data were compared with entries in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank using BLAST (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar). The signal peptide cleavage site was predicted using SignalP Version 1.1 (26Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were obtained with the Clustal method using the Lasergene program (DNASTAR, Inc.).Northern Blot AnalysisPoly(A)-rich RNA (1 and 10 μg) from G. fruticosawas fractionated on a 1.0% denatured formaldehyde-agarose gel and immobilized on a Hybond-N+ 0.45-μm nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech RPN119B). Immobilized RNA was hybridized with radiolabeled DNA by incubating the nylon membranes at 65 °C for 2 h with the initial 566-bp PCR product labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH 8015-2). The membranes were then washed as follows: 2 × 25 min with 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS at room temperature; 2 × 15 min with 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C; and 1 × 15 min with 1× SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography after overnight exposure at −70 °C using Kodak x-ray film.PlasmidsThe ORF of the coral COX cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in the vaccinia/HeLa expression system and into pCR3.1, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and pCG-E2Tag (27Kaldalu N. Lepik D. Kristjuhan A. Ustav M. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) vectors for transient expression in COS-7 cells. The 1.8-kilobase BamHI/EcoRV fragment was isolated from the coral COX-pGEM-T Easy construct and cloned into a suitable expression vector. This fragment contains the translational start and stop codons, and the cohesive ends allow the fragment to be ligated into expression vectors in the proper orientation. The XbaI/BamHI digestion removed the E2Tag from the N terminus of the coral COX sequence in the pCG-E2Tag construct (see Fig. 4 A). For insertion of the E2Tag epitope in the middle of the protein, the Eco91I (BstEII) site, 23 amino acids from the C terminus, was used (see Fig. 4 A). The pcDNA3.1 expression vector containing rabbit COX-2 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Matthew Breyer (Vanderbilt University).Figure 4Expression of the coral COX cDNA in COS-7 cells.

For transfection, COS-7 cells were trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. 250 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 800 ng of plasmid DNA and 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a disposable electroporation cuvette and was subjected to an electric discharge of 180 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 970-microfarad capacity. After the discharge, the cell/DNA mixture was left at room temperature for 15 min, and then cells were washed and plated. Cells were grown either at 37 °C for 48 h or at 28 °C for 72 h. Cells were collected using a rubber policeman, washed with ice-cold PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Transfected cells from 2–12 tissue culture plates (100 mm, 2–2.5 × 106cells/plate) were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and disrupted by sonication. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman Ti-70.1 rotor to yield the microsomal fraction.

Parik J. Juronen E. Sedman T. Abroi A. Liiv I. Langel U. Ustav M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4670-4677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ovine COX-1-specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.), or rat COX-2-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) and with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (LabAs Ltd., Tartu, Estonia) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Detection was performed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's manual.Immunofluorescence AnalysisFor immunofluorescence analysis, COS-7 cells transfected with the appropriate expression vector were grown on coverslips for 48 h and fixed in cold (−20 °C) acetone/methanol (1:1) for 15 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 30 min. Anti-E2Tag monoclonal antibody was added at a concentration of 5 ng/μl (in bovine serum albumin/PBS) and anti-COX-2 monoclonal antibody in a dilution of 1:100, and both were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. As a secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (LabAs Ltd.) was used at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were examined on an Olympus Vanox-S AH2 microscope.Enzyme AssayIncubations of the microsomal fraction of transfected cells with [14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration of 50 μm) were performed in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm adrenaline and 1 μmhemin for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of 100 mm SnCl2 as an aqueous suspension. After acidification to pH 3, the products were recovered by extraction with ethyl acetate and subjected to TLC analysis with unlabeled authentic standards (a generous gift from Kevelt Ltd., Tallinn, Estonia) (20Varvas K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9923-9929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).For inhibition studies, the enzyme (microsomal fraction) was reconstituted with hemin (1 μm) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm adrenaline and preincubated at room temperature for 5 min with various amounts of inhibitors added in a few microliters of ethanol. An equal amount of ethanol was added to the control. The reaction was initiated with [14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration of 30 μm). The incubation was carried out for 10 min, followed by treatment with SnCl2. The products were extracted and analyzed as described above.DISCUSSIONG. fruticosa cyclooxygenase cDNA was cloned by PCR using degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of known vertebrate COX enzymes. The primary structure of coral COX has ∼50% amino acid identity to both mammalian COX-1 and COX-2. The residues shown to be catalytically important for both peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities in mammalian COX isozymes are present in coral COX. However, significant structural differences can be found around the catalytic sites as well as in the pattern of glycosylation.The Peroxidase Active SiteThe hydroperoxide-reducing site of mammalian COX-1 and COX-2 lies on the surface of the catalytic domain on the distal side of the liganded heme prosthetic group (10Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Amino acids proposed to be important for heme binding and catalytic activity (proximal heme ligand His388 and distal heme His207 and Gln203 (6Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) are conserved in the coral enzyme (Fig. 3). However, there are significant differences in the amino acid substitutions at residues 289–295 that are proposed to form a small shield above His207 and Gln203. The occurrence of the sequence HPFYSML in G. fruticosainstead of QEVFGLL in COX-1 may reduce the opening to the hydroperoxide-reducing site and thus sterically restrict access of bulky fatty acid hydroperoxides to the heme iron. Also, essential sequence differences between the coral and mammalian COX enzymes can be found in the loop of residues at positions 211–220 that are supposed to form binding sites for PGG2 and the reducing substrates (10Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies showed a very low hydroperoxide-reducing activity of native G. fruticosa preparations as evidenced by (i) significant amounts of 15-keto-PGs among the endogenous prostaglandins, (ii) formation of 15-keto-PGs in incubations with exogenous arachidonic acid, and (iii) accumulation of PGG2instead of PGH2 in short incubations even in the presence of different electron donors (18Varvas K.

DsbC reduces wrongly paired disulfides by transferring electrons from its catalytic dithiol motif 98CGYC. Genetic evidence suggests that recycling of this motif requires at least three proteins, the cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) and thioredoxin (TrxA) as well as the DsbD membrane protein. We demonstrate here that electrons are transferred directly from thioredoxin to DsbD and from DsbD to DsbC. Three cysteine pairs within DsbD undergo reversible disulfide rearrangements.

Proteins. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993Google Scholar). Proteins acquire disulfide bonds after entry into the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells (2Freedman R.B.

In bacterial cells, disulfide bond formation occurs in the periplasm, a compartment that is located between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes ofEscherichia coli (4Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev.

Disulfide bond formation requires oxidation of a pair of cysteine sulfhydryl residues, a reaction catalyzed by bacterial DsbA (6Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J.

Electrons generated by oxidative folding are transferred from DsbA to DsbB, an inner membrane protein (8Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J.-O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DsbB uses quinones or menaquinones, hydrophobic compounds embedded within the cytoplasmic membrane, as electron acceptors for its recycling (12Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T.

Hence, DsbB functions to couple the DsbA-dependent oxidation of protein thiols in the periplasm to the electron transport chain in the cytoplasmic membrane. DsbA displays no proofreading activity for the repair of wrongly paired disulfides (14Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, this as well as other reactions are catalyzed by DsbC (14Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E.

For example, reduced DsbC (DsbC-(SH)2) donates electrons to misfolded polypeptides resulting in the transfer of disulfides from misfolded polypeptides to DsbC (14Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). During this rearrangement, the active site98CGYC101 thiol (sulfhydryl) residues of DsbC are oxidized (DsbC-S2). What is the origin of electrons that are required for the proofreading activity of DsbC? Regeneration of reduced DsbC requires the DsbD membrane protein (19Missiakas D. Schwager F. Raina S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as well as cytoplasmic thioredoxin (TrxA)1 and thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) (20Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). TrxB transfers electrons from the NADPH coenzyme to oxidized thioredoxin (TrxA-S2) thereby contributing to the reducing environment of the cellular cytoplasm (21Russel M.

This study examines the specific mechanism whereby DsbD mediates electron transfer from the cytoplasm across the membrane. Strains and plasmids used are listed in Table I. Sequences of primers used in this study can be obtained from the authors upon request. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (23Miller J.

Induction of His6-tagged DsbD using the pSE420 plasmid (Invitrogen) was accomplished by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Plasmids expressing TrxAC32S (pTrxAC32S) and TrxAC35S(pTrxAC35S) were obtained from M. Russel (Rockefeller University).

Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) and carries a 3.1-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the entire coding region for dsbD with upstream sequences. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. For purification of mutant DsbD proteins, clones encoding the full-length dsbD gene (wild-type or mutant) with a C-terminal His6 tag, His6-tagged DsbD, were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pSE420 (Invitrogen) using Eco RI andBam HI restriction sites as described earlier (25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl groups were modified using either 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) or 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) reagents. Cells were grown to A 595 nmbetween 0.5 and 1.5 and incubated in the presence of 2.5 mmMTSEA (freshly prepared in water) for 5 min at room temperature. For analytical purposes, samples were precipitated with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, spun, and suspended in 0.5 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 4% SDS. Samples were analyzed by 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE as well as by Western blot. For purification of the mixed disulfide species, cells were harvested at 4 °C directly after MTSEA treatment. Such pellets were washed and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). Cells were kept frozen at −80 °C until further use. The redox state of DsbD in vivo was assessed using AMS as described previously (12Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Wild-type DsbD (pJC350), DsbDC103A (pCC61), and DsbDC285A (pCC15) with an appended C-terminal His6 tag were expressed by cloning the structural genes into pSE420 (Invitrogen). Cells expressing either one of the various His6-tagged DsbD proteins were grown to A 595 nm and incubated for 2 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Prior to lysis by French pressure (p.s.i. 14,000), cells were incubated with 2.5 mm MTSEA for 5 min at room temperature. Cleared cell extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Membrane proteins in the sediments were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2% octylglucoside, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation prior to affinity purification of the various His6-tagged DsbD proteins on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Genetic analyses suggest that to maintain DsbC, DsbG, and DsbE in a reduced state, electrons must flow from cytoplasmic NADPH to the periplasm (18Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J.

A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This process is dependent on TrxB, TrxA, and DsbD. TrxB is a cytoplasmic, dimeric protein. Each monomer includes one redox active disulfide (135CATC138) and one FAD molecule and catalyzes the reduction of TrxA by NADPH (22Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 28Lennon B.W. Williams C.H.J. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). TrxA is a small cytoplasmic protein (∼10 kDa) that contains one redox active site32CGPC35 (21Russel M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Electrons flow from NADPH to TrxA by a mechanism involving the formation of a mixed disulfide intermediate between the NADH-activated TrxB enzyme and its substrate, TrxA. The TrxB thiolate Cys135 attacks the disulfide of TrxA-S2 to form transiently the mixed disulfide between TrxB and TrxA, Cys135–Cys32. This mixed intermediate is resolved by the Cys138 thiolate, resulting in the release of reduced TrxA-(SH2) (22Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar,29Wang P. Veine D.M. Ahn S.H. Williams C.H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4812-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mixed disulfide intermediates are tethered by a disulfide bond to the active site dithiol of redox active proteins. Because such intermediates are extremely short lived, they are never observedin vivo. One way to capture these reaction intermediates is to make use of redox proteins containing only half of the redox active site. For example, substituting Cys138 of TrxB and Cys35 of TrxA for serine captures the mixed disulfide between TrxB and TrxA, the C135–C32intermediate (29Wang P. Veine D.M. Ahn S.H. Williams C.H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4812-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution of the second cysteine (Cys33) of the dithiol of DsbA with alanine (30CPHA) leads to the production of a stable complex with a disulfide bond between Cys30 of DsbA and Cys104of DsbB (10Guilhot C.

In contrast, mutation of the second cysteine in the dithiol motif of either DsbC (DsbCC101A) or TrxA (TrxAC35S) results in a large spectrum of intermolecular disulfide species as the reduced dithiol of these reductants recognizes many different polypeptide substrates (see Electron Transfer between TrxA and DsbD). To elucidate the mechanism of electron transfer to periplasmic DsbC, we sought to capture reaction intermediates as an intermolecular disulfide between DsbD and DsbC. The overall topology of DsbD has been previously shown by constructing fusions of DsbD membrane-spanning segments to the mature part of alkaline phosphatase (25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Gordon E.H. Page M.D. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two of these studies have revealed that both the N- and C-terminal domains of DsbD (each ∼10 kDa in size) are positioned in the periplasm (Fig.1 A), suggesting that DsbD is initiated in the secretory pathway via a cleavable signal sequence prior its insertion in the cytoplasmic membrane (25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Gordon E.H. Page M.D. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both N- and C-terminal domains harbor two pairs of cysteines, Cys103–Cys109 and Cys461–Cys464, respectively (Fig.1 A). The two domains are connected by eight transmembrane (TM) segments containing three cysteine residues, Cys163(TM1), Cys282 (TM4), and Cys285 (TM4) (Fig.1 A). DsbD residue Cys282 (C4) is dispensable for electron transfer. In contrast, alanine substitution of cysteine residues at any one of the other cysteines (C103(C1), Cys109 (C2), Cys163(C3), Cys285 (C5), Cys461(C6), and Cys464 (C7)) abolishes DsbD-mediated electron transfer, causing accumulation of DsbC-S2 (25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When examined by immunoblotting of cellular extracts, none of the DsbD substitution mutants formed a stable intermolecular intermediate with DsbC (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the presumed disulfide intermediate between DsbD and DsbC appears to be unstable and may be resolved rapidly by the attack of the second thiol, Cys101 of DsbC. To test this possibility, E. coli strains expressing DsbCC101A and various DsbD cysteine substitution mutants were examined. An intermolecular intermediate was observed in cells expressing DsbCC101A and DsbDC103A (Fig.1 C) whereas alanine substitution at any other cysteine of DsbD did not produce a mixed disulfide (Fig. 1 B). To characterize the nature of the intermolecular intermediate, DsbDC103A with a C-terminal His6 tag was purified from E. coli extracts by affinity chromatography (Fig. 2). Immunoblotting of eluted fractions revealed the presence of two electrophoretic species with an apparent molecular mass of 56 (DsbDC103A, alone) and 80 kDa (DsbDC103A–DsbCC101A), respectively. Antibodies raised against DsbD (α-DsbD) and DsbC (α-DsbC) recognized the 80-kDa DsbDC103A–DsbCC101Aspecies. In contrast, only α-DsbD bound to 56-kDa DsbDC103A. Incubation with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) resolved the 80-kDa mixed disulfide and resulted in the appearance of a 24-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2). α-DsbC, but not α-DsbD, bound to the 24-kDa protein, indicating that this species represents DsbCC101A released from its disulfide linkage with DsbDC103A. Cysteine 98 of DsbC, the first sulfhydryl within the dithiol motif (98CGYC), must be one component of the intermolecular disulfide with DsbD. To identify the corresponding cysteine residue of DsbD, we analyzed DsbD variants harboring alanine substitutions at Cys103 as well as at other cysteine residues. DsbDC103A/C109A failed to form the intermolecular disulfide with DsbCC101A (Fig. 1 C; lanes labeledC1 and C2 for DsbDC103A/C109A). All other combinations of alanine substitutions produced the mixed disulfide species (data not shown). Thus, electron transfer between DsbD and DsbC involves the formation of a disulfide between cysteine 109 of DsbD and cysteine 98 of DsbC. Further, the intermolecular disulfide is resolved by the Cys103 thiol of DsbD, generating the intramolecular cystine Cys103–Cys109 (C1 andC2) as well as reduced DsbC-(SH)2. E. coli lacking thioredoxin (ΔtrxA) accumulate oxidized DsbC (20Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and DsbD (Fig.3 A). Both cysteines of the dithiol motif of thioredoxin (32CGPC35) are required for electron transfer, as either mutant TrxAC32Sor mutant TrxAC35S accumulated oxidized DsbD (Fig.3 A). Substitution of TrxAC35S but not TrxAC32S produced a spectrum of disulfide-linked intermolecular intermediates (Fig. 3 B). Thus, substitution of the second cysteine of thioredoxin with serine (TrxAC35S) results in a mutant protein capable of attacking numerous cytoplasmic disulfides but unable to resolve the mixed disulfide intermediates. Although cells expressing TrxAC35Saccumulated DsbD in an oxidized state, a mixed disulfide between DsbD and the mutant thioredoxin was not detected (data not shown). Thus, similar to DsbC, the proposed disulfide intermediate between thioredoxin and DsbD appears to be unstable and may be reduced either by DsbD itself or by other cytoplasmic redox factors. To explore this possibility, cells expressing TrxAC35S and DsbD variants with single cysteine to alanine substitutions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Initial experiments failed to reveal a mixed disulfide between TrxA and DsbD. Perhaps some of the intermolecular disulfides formed by TrxAC35S are unstable and can be reduced by other factors in the E. coli cytoplasm. We modified our experimental strategy and quenched all cellular disulfide exchange with MTSEA, a reagent that rapidly blocks cysteine thiols without attacking disulfides (32Smith D.J. Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 764-771Google Scholar, 33Akabas M.H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12496-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). When extracts of cells treated with MTSEA were analyzed by immunoblotting, DsbDC285A was observed to form an intermolecular disulfide with TrxAC35S (Fig. 3 D) but not with wild-type TrxA (Fig. 3 C). DsbD variants with alanine substitutions at any other cysteine did not produce this intermediate. MTSEA is a membrane-permeable methanethiosulfonate (33Akabas M.H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12496-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with MTSET, a membrane-impermeable methanethiosulfonate, did not stabilize the TrxAC35S–DsbDC285A disulfide (34Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To identify the cysteine residue required for the formation of the mixed disulfide, we analyzed DsbD variants harboring alanine substitutions at cysteine 285 as well as at other cysteine residues. DsbDC163A/C285A failed to produce a mixed disulfide (Fig.3 D; lanes labeled C3 and C5 for DsbDC163A/C285A), whereas alanine substitutions at other cysteines had no effect on the formation of the mixed disulfide (data not shown). DsbD and DsbDC285A were purified by affinity chromatography from MTSEA-treated cell extracts and examined by immunoblotting. Wild-type DsbD migrated as a single 56-kDa species on SDS-PAGE, whereas DsbDC285A appeared as a 56- and a 66-kDa species (Fig. 4). Antibodies raised against thioredoxin (α-TrxA) bound to 66-kDa DsbDC285Abut not to 56-kDa DsbDC285A or DsbD. DTT reduced the 66-kDa species to generate 56-kDa DsbDC285A and 10-kDa TrxAC35S (Fig. 4). Thus, electron transfer between TrxA and DsbD involves the formation of a disulfide bond between cysteine 32 of TrxA and cysteine 163 of DsbD. Our results suggest a mechanism for the transfer of electrons across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli (Fig.5). The NADPH cofactor of thioredoxin reductase donates electrons to reduce the disulfide within the active site dithiol motif of thioredoxin (29Wang P. Veine D.M. Ahn S.H. Williams C.H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4812-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin transfers its electrons directly to DsbD. Indeed, a mixed disulfide species could be captured between TrxAC35S–DsbDC285A. In this species, the thiol of cysteine 32 of TrxA is cross-linked to cysteine 163 in the DsbD molecule. We assume that during electron transfer a reversible disulfide bond is formed between cysteines 163 (C3) and 285 (C5) within the transmembrane region of DsbD. Upon reduction of this disulfide bond by TrxA, electrons will then travel within the DsbD molecule across the cytoplasmic membrane into the periplasm of E. coli. Reduction of cysteines 163 and 285 must be accompanied by a conformational change within DsbD. This conformational change likely allows the thiol of cysteine 285 to be approached by the disulfide in the C-terminal periplasmic domain of DsbD (461CVAC). Even though such a reaction intermediate has not yet been demonstrated experimentally, we presume its existence because substitution of cysteine 461 (C6) with alanine abolishes electron transfer (25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, this defect is restored by expression of a soluble C-terminal periplasmic DsbD domain with intact cysteines (data not shown). In addition to bearing a typical thioredoxin motif (CXX C), this domain shares sequence similarity with the thioredoxin-like domain of protein-disulfide isomerase and thus is likely to adopt a thioredoxin fold (35Ellis L.B. Saurugger P. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) similar to protein-disulfide isomerase, DsbA, or DsbC (36Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 38McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our results further predict that the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain transfers its electrons to the N-terminal domain of DsbD by attacking the disulfide between cysteines 103 and 109 (C1 andC2). The final electron transfer step involves reduction of the DsbC dithiol motif (98CGYC) via the formation of a disulfide intermediate with DsbDC109. Although this has not yet been examined, electron transfer between DsbD and DsbE or DsbG, two periplasmic thiol oxidoreductases, presumably uses the same steps. All electron transfer steps examined here occur by a common mechanism. The active site thiolate of the CXX C motif attacks disulfides, resulting in the formation of an intermolecular intermediate that is resolved by the second thiol. Electron transfer requires direct interaction between thioredoxin-like domains and unique peptide configurations harboring disulfides. Some of these interactions are promiscuous, e.g. recognition of the DsbD Cys103–Cys109 disulfide by the dithiol motifs of DsbC, DsbE, and DsbG or interaction of DsbC, TrxA, and DsbA with folding substrates. However, the active site thiolate cannot resolve disulfides within another thioredoxin-like domain presumably because electrons cannot be favorably transferred to any one of these molecules. For example, DsbA does not recognize the DsbD Cys103–Cys109 disulfide. This interaction would otherwise result in a wasteful flow of electrons between cytoplasmic, membrane, and periplasmic compartments. Oxidative protein folding catalyzed by the DsbA-DsbB system can be regarded as electron transfer from the periplasm to the membrane. It involves only two thioredoxin-like reactions: electrons flow from the substrate to the dithiol 30CPHC of DsbA to DsbB Cys104–C130 disulfide and then to the dithiol 41CVLC of DsbB and finally to the electron transport system (39Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 99: 117-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, electron transfer from the cytoplasm to the periplasm requires a sequence of three thioredoxin-like reactions: 1) [Cys32]TrxA–[Cys163]DsbD, 2) [Cys285]DsbD–[Cys461]DsbD, and 3) [Cys109]DsbD–[Cys98]DsbC (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that DsbD has evolved as a fusion of two unique peptide configurations harboring disulfides tethered to a thioredoxin-like domain. DsbD-mediated electron transfer across the cytoplasmic membrane ofE. coli has been studied by several investigators (25Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,31Gordon E.H. Page M.D. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stewart et al. (30Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have examined the membrane topology of DsbD and were the first to propose a mechanism for sequential electron transfer. In the Stewart model, the thiolate within the C-terminal thioredoxin-like motif of DsbD attacks the disulfide of periplasmic DsbC, another thioredoxin-like motif. Electrons are transferred from the membrane-embedded disulfide of DsbD to the N-terminal disulfide and finally to the C-terminal periplasmic domain. Thioredoxin within the cytoplasm of E. coli attacks the membrane-embedded disulfide of DsbD and is recycled by thioredoxin reductase. It should be noted that the Stewart model was derived solely from topological analysis, positioning the cysteine residues of DsbD on either side of the cytoplasmic membrane; mixed disulfide species between interacting partners were not generated (30Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As is demonstrated here, electrons flow from the N-terminal domain of DsbD to DsbC and not from the C-terminal domain of DsbD. Thus, the Stewart model does not appreciate the general mechanism of electron transfer between thioredoxin-like motifs and cognate peptides bearing disulfide bonds. In fact, step three of the Stewart model proposes transfer of electrons between the membrane-embedded disulfide of DsbD and the N-terminal periplasmic domain. As neither of these two domains assumes a thioredoxin-like motif, we believe that it is unlikely electrons can travel this path. Our hypothesis presumes a conformational change of DsbD as the membrane-embedded disulfide/cysteines (Cys163 and Cys285) must be accessible to cytoplasmic thioredoxin and to the periplasmic domains of DsbD. If the distance between Cys163 and Cys285 were similar to the distance between the inner and outer leaflets of the cytoplasmic membrane, the conformational change would have to span a distance of 30 nm. Thus, disulfide bond formation would require mass movements of the polypeptide chain. We think it is more likely that DsbD assumes an overall conformation that minimizes the distance between Cys163 and Cys285, allowing access of thioredoxin and of the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of DsbD within the plane of the cytoplasmic membrane. If so, electron transfer across the membrane may not require a massive conformational rearrangement and could make do with relatively small movements of DsbD transmembrane domains. Our future work will aim to characterize these events. We thank O. Schneewind (UCLA) for critical review of this manuscript."

Relative independence of RXR generally was seen when the TRE upstream half-site has a TA or TG 5′ to the core hexamer.

This ligand-induced stimulation was stronger in the presence of TR alone than with RXR plus TR, suggesting a preference for TIF2 activation of TR homodimers.

TRs, along with the receptors for steroid hormones, retinoids, and vitamin D, belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G.

Like other nuclear receptors, TRs exhibit a modular structure with separable functional domains. A ligand-independent transcription activation function (AF-1) is located in the highly variable N-terminal A/B domain (2Wilkinson J.R. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23824-23832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The highly conserved DNA binding domain containing two zinc finger motifs is centrally located and characterizes the members of the superfamily (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

The moderately conserved C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) possesses a strong receptor dimerization interface and a ligand-dependent activation function, AF-2 (3Spanjaard R.A. Darling D.S.

TRs exert their effects on gene expression through direct interaction with specific DNA sequences known as thyroid hormone response elements (TREs), usually found in the 5′-flanking regions of T3-responsive genes. Unlike steroid hormone receptors, TRs interact with TREs even in the absence of ligand. TREs usually are composed of two or more receptor-binding hexameric half-sites related to the sequence AGGTCA arranged as direct repeats (6Brent G.A. Williams G.R. Harney J.W. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or, less commonly, everted repeats (7Williams G.R. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although TRs are capable of binding to TREs without auxiliary factors, they preferentially bind to many TREs as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (8Kliewer S.A. Umesono K.

Based on this observation, it is thought that TRs activate gene expression primarily as heterodimers with RXR (reviewed in Refs. 1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G.

However, the physiological role of RXR in TR action remains to be elucidated, largely because RXR-null mammalian cells do not exist. It has been shown that TRs and RXRs prefer to bind to different DNA sequences T(A/G)AGGTCA and GGGGTCA (12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Subauste J.S. Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30232-30237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, we postulate that certain TREs are primarily responsive to TR, whereas others require RXR-TR heterodimers for gene activation. To test this hypothesis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model system. S. cerevisiae is devoid of endogenous nuclear receptors and thus can be manipulated to express TRs and/or RXRs, which allows for the analysis of receptor requirements dictated by the TRE for TR-mediated gene expression. Transcriptional regulation by TRs or other nuclear receptors is accomplished by the concerted action of an array of coregulatory proteins including coactivators and corepressors (14Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the binding of unliganded TRs to “positive” TREs results in repression of transcription, which is mediated by interaction of the TR with a corepressor complex (15Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 16Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand triggers conformational changes in the TR LBD that result in release of the corepressor complex and recruitment of coactivators (17Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), thereby leading to gene activation. Little is known about the potential influence of TRE sequence on coactivator function. Yeast lack endogenous proteins homologous to mammalian corepressors and coactivators and thus provide a null background that should be advantageous for gaining insight into this issue. In the present report, 10 naturally occurring mammalian TREs were studied in a yeast model system to test the importance of RXR for the transcriptional activity of TR. The data demonstrate that thyroid hormone response element sequence plays an important role in determining the nuclear hormone receptor and coactivator requirements for TR action. Yeast strains bearing chromosomally integrated reporter genes were constructed as described previously (19Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded oligonucleotide response elements were inserted into the Bgl II site upstream of a basal cytochrome c promoter (cyc1) linked to a β-galactosidase reporter gene in the yeast integrating plasmid p83:305. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing and were integrated into the chromosome of S. cerevisiae strain SEY6210 (MATα; ura3-52; leu2-3,-112; his3-200; trp1-901; lys2-801; suc2-9) by homologous recombination at the leu2 locus. Strains bearing single reporter construct insertions were identified by Southern analysis and were selected for further study. The pRSGalH-TRβ1, pRSGalH-TRβ1-RXRα, and p413-TEF-TIF2 expression plasmids were described previously (19Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). pRSGalH-TRβ1(E457A) and pRSGalH-TRβ1(L454A) were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit and confirmed by sequencing. Yeast strains were transformed with pRSGalH-TRβ1, pRSGalH-TRβ1-RXRα, p413-TEF-TIF2, or the empty expression vectors. Resultant transformants were grown overnight in an appropriate selection medium supplemented with 3% glycerol and 3% ethanol, a nonrepressive carbon source that does not induce nuclear receptor expression. Cultures were diluted to an absorbance of 0.2 at 650 nm and grown overnight at 30 °C in the presence of 3%d-galactose (to induce nuclear receptor expression) with or without 1 μm 3,5,3′-triiodothyroacetic acid (triac), a T3 analog. Following overnight growth, theA 650 of each culture was measured as an indicator of cell density. One ml of each culture was pelleted by microcentrifugation, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C for β-galactosidase activity assay (20Braell W.A. DyNA Quant Application Note 2.

In brief, frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 0.7 ml of reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and solubilized with 2 drops of both chloroform and 0.1% SDS (21Reynolds A.

After vortexing, 40 μl of cell suspension were incubated with 160 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.3 mm4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside (Sigma) at 37 °C. After 1 h, 1.9 ml of stop solution containing 133 mmglycine, 83 mm Na2CO3 (pH 10.7) was added to terminate the reaction. Fluorescence was measured with 50 nm 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma) used as a standard to read 500 (excitation wavelength 365 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm). Full-length rat TRβ1, full-length mouse RXRα, and the human TIF2 nuclear receptor interaction domain (amino acids 624–869) (22Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21 carrying the fusion protein expression vectors were grown at 30 °C. The cultures were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h at 30 °C. To increase the solubility of the receptor fusion proteins, a plasmid expressing E. coli thioredoxin (24Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was coexpressed with GST-TRβ1 or GST-RXRα. After harvesting, the cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 tablet of Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 25 ml, and passed through a French press twice at 1200 lb/in2. The bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with cold phosphate buffer and once with thrombin cleaving buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, the agarose beads were resuspended in 1 ml of thrombin cleaving buffer. The TRβ1, RXRα, and TIF2 receptor interaction domains were cleaved from GST on the agarose beads by addition of 3.6 units of thrombin (Novagen, Madison, WI), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and purified by centrifugation. To perform EMSAs, double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by fill-in reactions using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide probes used are listed in TableI. 1.5 × 104 cpm of radiolabeled oligonucleotides were incubated with 0.25 μg of purified TRβ1, RXRα, or both together. Where indicated, incubations also included 0.2 μg of the purified TIF2 nuclear receptor interaction domain. Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 40 min in a total volume of 17.5 μl in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 0.9 μg of poly(dI·dC). After incubation, the mixtures were analyzed on 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gels using 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The gels were fixed, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography and/or PhosphorImager analysis.Table IGene abbreviations and T3 response element sequencesAbbreviationGeneSequencesRef.rαMHCRat α-myosin heavy chainTGGAGGTGACAGGAGGACAG6Brent G.A.

Ten naturally occurring direct repeat TREs (TableI) were examined in yeast. The TREs were inserted upstream of a basal cyc1 promoter linked to a β-galactosidase reporter (19Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and then integrated into the chromosome of S. cerevisiae. β-Galactosidase activity assays were performed with yeast reporter strains, in which TRβ1, RXRα, or both together were expressed. Data are expressed as β-galactosidase activity relative to identical yeast strains with an empty nuclear receptor expression vector (fold induction). As shown in Fig.1, TR mediated reporter gene induction from each of these TREs in the absence of thyroid hormone. This ligand-independent reporter gene stimulation reflects the function of the AF-1 domain (2Wilkinson J.R. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23824-23832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as it is uninfluenced by mutations in AF-2 (see Fig. 9) or by the expression of AF-2-dependent coactivators (data not shown). The focus of these studies is not on the absolute magnitude of reporter gene induction but on the relative reporter gene induction seen in the presence of RXR + TR versus that seen in the presence of TR alone. TREs exhibit a continuous spectrum of RXR dependence, which is reflected in the ratio of β-galactosidase activity induced by RXR + TR to TR alone (Fig.2). The higher the ratio, the more the RXR dependence. At one end of this spectrum, RXR is virtually required for reporter gene activation, as illustrated by the rat α-myosin heavy chain (rαMHC) TRE. Coexpression of RXRα and TRβ1 resulted in a 4.2-fold increase (from 1.7- to 7.3-fold induction) in reporter gene activation as compared with expression of TRβ1 alone (Fig. 1,lane 1, and Fig. 2). At the other end of the spectrum, reporter gene activation from the rat uncoupling protein 1 (rUCP) TRE was almost entirely independent of RXR. TRβ1 alone activated reporter gene expression 5.3-fold, and the coexpression of RXR only resulted in a further increase of 1.2-fold (Fig. 1, lane 10, and Fig.2).Figure 9Effect of TR β1 AF-2 mutations on reporter gene expression in yeast. β-Galactosidase activities of reporter constructs were measured while TRβ1 or TRβ1 point mutants (E457A or L454A) were expressed in the absence or presence of triac.

For example, as shown in Fig. 2, rUCP and hPL possess a TG upstream of the 5′ core hexamer and display minimal RXR dependence for TR-mediated reporter gene expression. In contrast, RXR dependence is maximal for rαMHC, rGH, and rP450, none of which contains the dinucleotide T(A/G) upstream of the 5′ core hexamer. Since the polarity of RXR-TR heterodimers is such that RXR occupies the 5′ half-site (25Kurokawa R., Yu, V.C. Näär A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), it is reasonable that the TRE 5′ half-site sequence is the one that influences RXR activity. To assess further the importance of the 5′ T(A/G) upstream of the core hexamers, we generated a mutant rαMHC reporter construct in which the first G of the 5′ dinucleotide GG was replaced by T, creating rαMHC(TG) (Table I). As predicted and shown in Fig.3, expression of TRβ1 alone led to a 5-fold induction of β-galactosidase activity from rαMHC(TG), and addition of RXR resulted in a further increase of only 1.4-fold (Fig.3 A). In contrast, expression of TRβ1 alone led to only a 1.7-fold induction from wild type rαMHC, but this increased 4.3-fold with the addition of RXR (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrate that a single substitution of T for G two nucleotides 5′ to the upstream core hexamer is capable of shifting the nature of the rαMHC TRE from more RXR dependence to less RXR dependence. In summary, the results confirm that RXR is not always required for TR-mediated gene activation. The dinucleotide T(A/G) 5′ to the upstream TRE half-site is important in determining the RXR requirement for TR-mediated gene expression. However, RXR dependence is not all-or-none but, rather, varies continuously. This suggests that, in addition to the 5′ T(A/G), the sequence and spacing of the TRE half-sites may modify the RXR dependence of TR-mediated gene expression from certain TREs. To determine whether the different requirements of RXR for TR-mediated gene expression correlate with the different binding abilities of RXR-TR heterodimers versus TR alone to these TREs, we performed EMSAs using purified recombinant TRβ1 and RXRα. Fig. 4 A shows that TRβ1 itself is able to bind to almost all these natural response elements, although the level of binding varies considerably. The strongest binding of TRβ1 is seen with hDI, rSerCa2, hPL, and rUCP (lanes 6, and 8–10). These TREs generally exhibit a relatively high β-galactosidase activity induced by TRβ1 alone or less RXR dependence for TR-mediated gene activation (Figs. 1and 2). However, the binding of RXR-TR heterodimers to rSerCa2, hPL, and rUCP was essentially undetectable (Fig. 4 B, lanes 8–10). In contrast, TREs such as rαMHC, rP450, and rME that display more dependence on RXR for gene activation support the formation of RXR-TR heterodimers (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1, 3, and 4) but bind TRβ1 alone weakly relative to rSerCa2, hPL, and rUCP (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1, 3, and4 versus 8–10). hDI binds well both to RXR-TR heterodimers and to TR alone and thus is intermediary in RXR dependence for gene activation. The correlation between RXR-TR DNA binding and RXR dependence of yeast reporter gene activity was evaluated by plotting the ratio of (RXR + TR heterodimer DNA complexes)/(TR DNA complexes) determined by EMSA versus the reporter gene induction data (Fig. 4 C). This plot shows that TREs capable of forming stronger RXR-TR heterodimers are more heavily dependent on RXR for gene activation. Since we observed that the mutant TRE rαMHC(TG) exhibits increased reporter gene induction by TR alone and less RXR dependence, we were interested in determining if the binding of TR to this mutant TRE also is altered. EMSA showed that, as expected, the binding of TRβ1 to rαMHC(TG) was greatly enhanced when compared with the binding to wild type rαMHC (Fig. 4 D). This indicates that a single base change in a TRE can regulate the importance of RXR for both TR binding and gene activation. Taken together, these data suggest that the different binding affinities of TR alone versus RXR-TR heterodimers account in large part for the different requirements of RXR for TR-mediated gene expression. The importance of the 5′ dinucleotide T(A/G) in determining the RXR requirement for TR-mediated gene expression appears to be through enhancing TR binding, at least for certain TREs. Nuclear hormone receptors activate transcription in a ligand-dependent manner through an interaction of their AF-2 domains with coactivator proteins. The p160 coactivator family has previously been shown to induce hormone-dependent transcriptional activation on the artificial T3 response element 8DR4 (TAAGGTCATCTAAGGTCA) in a yeast expression system (19Olson D.P. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9907-9914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We asked whether the related p160 coactivator TIF2 (18Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) could potentiate hormone-dependent gene activation from these natural TREs. To do so, the previously studied yeast strains were transformed with an expression vector for TIF2 (or empty vector), and β-galactosidase activity was measured following incubation with or without triac, a T3 analog. In the absence of coactivator, β-galactosidase activity driven by all of these natural TREs was not increased by triac. Instead, triac caused a small (20%) but reproducible suppression of β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig.5, ligand induction of reporter gene expression from almost all these TREs could be restored by coexpression of TIF2 and TRβ1. However, the level of ligand-induced reporter gene expression varied considerably among the TREs. For example, β-galactosidase induction from rUCP was stimulated 6.1-fold by triac (Fig. 5, lane 10, solid bar), whereas induction from rαMHC was stimulated only 1.6-fold (lane 1, solid bar). Interestingly, coexpression of RXRα with TRβ1 and TIF2 reduced the ligand induction of reporter gene expression on nearly all TREs. For example, the triac induction from rUCP fell from 6.1- to 2.9-fold when RXR was coexpressed (lane 10). Thus, in general, TIF2 mediated ligand-dependent reporter gene expression is stronger when TR alone is present than TR and RXR. In addition, a strong triac-dependent increase (3.4-fold) in reporter gene activation was observed from rαMHC(TG) when TIF2 and TRβ1 were coexpressed (Fig. 5, lane 11, solid bar). In the context of wild type rαMHC, such TIF2-mediated ligand-dependent activation was only 1.6-fold (Fig. 5,lane 1). This difference is consistent with the enhanced ability of rαMHC(TG) to bind TR in the absence of RXR and substantiates the preference of TIF2 as a coactivator for TR alone rather than RXR-TR. Strong triac induction was seen only with the hDI, rUCP, and MHC(TG) TREs, all of which bind TR well in the absence of RXR. However, the rSerCa2 and hPL TREs also bind TR well, even though they support only minimal triac induction. To investigate this further, EMSAs were performed with these TREs and recombinant TR ± TIF2 (Fig.6). Two distinct TR-TIF2-TRE complexes were identified, the slower of"

Unlike pol V, these polymerases do not require any additional proteins for their polymerase and/or lesion bypass activities, at least in vitro. In this sense pol V is more similar to the recently discovered DNA polymerase RI, product of the plasmidic mucB gene, whose activity also requires RecA and SSB (20Goldsmith M. Sarov-Blat L. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11227-11231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most intriguing is the requirement for RecA, a protein known to be required also for gap filling by recombinational repair. Here we show that the assembly of a RecA nucleoprotein filament is required for translesion synthesis by pol V. UmuD′ and MBP·UmuC (a fusion of UmuC to maltose-binding protein) were overexpressed and purified as previously described (8Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol.

SSB and RecA were purified as described (21Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a phosphocellulose purification step was added for RecA. Their degree of purity was estimated to be >95%. Restriction nucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England BioLabs; T7 gp6 exonuclease was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and ATPγS was from Sigma. The preparation of the gapped plasmid GP21 carrying a site-specific lesion was recently described (23Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Tomer G. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5948-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GP21 contains a site-specific synthetic (tetrahydrofuran) abasic site and a ssDNA region of ∼350 nucleotides (see Fig. 1). The translesion replication reaction was performed as previously described (8Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Reuven N.B. Arad G. Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) with minor changes. The standard reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP, 0.1 μg (2 nm) of gapped plasmid, 50 nm SSB, 2 μm RecA, 500 nm UmuD′, and 5–220 nm pol V (MBP·UmuC). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C as follows. RecA and the DNA substrate were incubated in the assay buffer for 2 min at 37 °C, and were then transferred to ice. Next SSB and UmuD′ were added, and reactions were incubated for 4 additional min at 37 °C. MBP·UmuC was then added, and incubation continued for the indicated periods of time. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl (final concentrations) followed by heat inactivation (65 °C for 10 min), and the DNA was purified from the proteins by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was digested with Asp700 (5 units) at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, 5 units of BstXI were added, and incubation was continued at 55 °C for another 2 h. This restriction yielded radiolabeled DNA fragments 15, 25, and 43 nucleotides long, representing the unextended primer, the replication stop at the lesion, and the bypass product, respectively. Alternatively, a modified procedure was used as follows. The purified DNA mixture was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (0.2 units, 1 h, 37 °C) to hydrolyze remaining dNTPs (11Reuven N.B. Arad G. Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The DNA was then digested with Asp700 (5 units) andMspA1I (5 units) at 37 °C instead of BstXI. This produced radiolabeled DNA bands which were 4 nucleotides longer than those obtained with the Asp700/BstXI cleavage, namely, fragments 19, 29, and 47 nucleotides long, representing the unextended primer, the replication stop at the lesion, and the bypass product, respectively (see Fig. 1). The DNA samples were fractionated by 15% PAGE-urea, followed by phosphorimager analysis (Fuji BAS 2500). The extent of bypass was calculated by dividing the amount of bypass products by the amount of the extended primers (lesion bypass). When indicated, the bypass was also calculated differently, by dividing the amount of bypass products by the total amount of DNA (molecules bypassed of total). Protein-DNA complexes were fixed by addition of glutaraldehyde to 0.2% followed by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C (complexes stabilized with ATPγS did not require fixation). Samples were diluted and washed in 5 mm magnesium acetate before uranyl acetate staining, as previously described (25Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Complexes were visualized at magnifications of × 20,500 using a Philips CM100 electron microscope. The experimental system for assaying lesion bypass was previously described (8Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is based on a gapped plasmid carrying a site-specific synthetic abasic site in the ssDNA region and an internal radiolabeled phosphate in the primer strand (Fig.1). Upon addition of pol V the 3′-primer terminus is extended up to the abasic site, where synthesis may terminate or proceed through the abasic site (lesion bypass). At the end of the reaction the DNA is isolated and restricted withMspA1I, which cleaves 4 nucleotides upstream of the radiolabel, and with Asp700, which cleaves downstream of the lesion. This yields radiolabeled DNA fragments of 19, 29, and 47 nucleotides long, for the unextended primer, the block at the lesion, and the bypass product, respectively (Fig. 1). Bands in the length range of 20–46 nucleotides represent pol V pause or dissociation sites (see for example Figs. 2 and 6). In some cases the DNA products were restricted with Asp700 andBstXI, yielding products which were 4 nucleotides shorter than with the Asp700/MspA1I cleavage. The DNA were fractionated by urea-PAGE and visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging.Figure 6Translesion replication by pol V in the presence of ATPγS. Reactions were performed with the gap-lesion GP21, 90 nm pol V, 500 nm UmuD′, 50 nm SSB (as tetramers), 2 μm RecA, and 1 mm ATP or ATPγS for 2, 4, and 6 min. In lanes 11–13, ATPγS was added from the beginning of the RecA·DNA preincubation, and ATP was added with the addition of pol V. Restriction of the DNA products prior to PAGE analysis was done with Asp700 and MspA1I. The details are described under “Materials and Methods.” Bypass activity was calculated in two ways: 1)as a percentage of the extended primers (lesion bypass) or 2) as a percentage of total substrate molecules (molecules bypassed out of total). The value for percentage of primers initiated (of total substrate molecules) is also presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity of the RecA protein in recombination or SOS induction requires its binding to DNA. This binding is stoichiometric and cooperative, leading to the formation of a helical RecA filament along ssDNA, composed of multiple RecA monomers (reviewed in Refs. 26Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 27Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament is required also for lesion bypass. First, a titration experiment was performed, to determine the amount of RecA needed to saturate the bypass reaction. As can be seen in Fig. 2, although lesion bypass could be observed at 0.5 μm RecA, 2 μm RecA was required to reach a saturation level of bypass. Further increases up to 16 μm RecA had little effect on lesion bypass (Fig. 2). For comparison, a titration of pol V was performed. As can be seen in Fig. 3, bypass activity reached saturation at 50–100 nm pol V, 20–40-fold lower than the saturating concentration of RecA. The concentration of the DNA in the reaction was 2 nm of gapped molecules, which translates into 700 nm nucleotides in the ssDNA region. Because a single RecA molecule binds 3–4 nucleotides (26Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), this means that ∼200 nm RecA will be sufficient to cover the ssDNA region. The result that the saturating concentration of RecA is 10-fold higher than required to cover the ssDNA region is consistent with the formation of RecA nucleoprotein filament, reflecting the equilibrium between bound and free RecA. In addition, the RecA filament may extend to the double-stranded portion of the DNA molecule, as previously shown (28Shaner S.L. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9211-9219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shaner S.L. Flory J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9220-9230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The formation of a stable RecA nucleoprotein filament requires a ssDNA region longer than 50 nucleotides (26Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Thus, if a stable RecA nucleoprotein filament is required for lesion bypass, this should be reflected in a requirement for a long ssDNA region in the substrate DNA. This prediction was examined by using DNA substrates with single-stranded regions 12, 100, 350, or 850 nucleotides long. Fig. 4 shows the results of lesion bypass with DNA gaps 12 and 350 nucleotides long. In these experiments, the primer terminus was located opposite the nucleotide preceding the lesion in the template strand. This configuration of the DNA substrate gave lesion bypass results similar to those obtained with the standard substrate where the primer terminus was located 11 nucleotides upstream of the lesion (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 4, when the DNA substrate contained a small gap of 12 nucleotides, no bypass was observed by pol V, UmuD′, RecA, and SSB (Fig. 4, lane 7). Furthermore, in a control reaction, bypass by pol I was higher than pol V on this substrate (Fig. 4, lane 2 versus lane 7). Attempts to examine whether omission of one of the protein components will allow lesion bypass on this DNA substrate showed no bypass under all the conditions examined (Fig. 4, lanes 3–6). No bypass was observed even with a 100-nucleotide-long gap (data not shown). In contrast, effective bypass was observed with gaps of 350 (Fig. 4, lane 14; see also Figs. 2 and 3) or 850 nucleotides long (see Fig. 8 below).Figure 8Titration of UmuD′ required to saturate lesion bypass on DNA with large gaps. Reactions were performed on gap-lesion plasmids with a 350-nucleotide gap (GP21) or a 850-nucleotide gap (GP21XL) with 100 nm pol V and the indicated concentrations of UmuD′ for 8 min. For GP21, 2 μm RecA and 50 nm SSB were added, whereas for GP21XL 6 μm RecA and 150 nm SSB were added. ●, GP21XL; ■, GP21.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The formation of RecA nucleoprotein filaments under the conditions of the bypass reaction was examined using electron microscopy. The components of the reaction were mixed and incubated at 37 °C. Then the mixture was treated with glutaraldehyde to form protein-protein and protein-DNA cross-links and visualized by electron microscopy. As can be seen in Fig.5 C, RecA formed a filament along the ssDNA region in the DNA substrate. The length of the filament corresponds to the size of the gap in the plasmid. A similar picture was obtained when both RecA and SSB were present (Fig. 5 D) or when the complete bypass reaction mixture was analyzed (Fig.5 F), although the size of the protein filament is somewhat larger. This may reflect coverage of the dsDNA adjacent to the gap; however, binding of RecA was largely restricted to the ssDNA region. This is not because of a shortage in RecA, because upon addition of ATPγS, all DNA molecules were entirely covered with RecA (Fig.5 E). ATPγS is a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, which is known to strongly stabilize RecA nucleoprotein filaments (26Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). When lesion bypass was examined with ATPγS instead of ATP, there was a strong reduction in lesion bypass (Fig.6, lanes 5–7). This effect of ATPγS was also observed in the presence of ATP (Fig. 6, lanes 11–13). Lesion bypass was calculated in this case by two methods. 1) The usual measure of lesion bypass was calculated as the percentage of bypass products of the primers that were extended. This measures lesion bypass directly, correcting for the efficiency of initiation of synthesis at the primer terminus. Molecules bypassed of total is the percentage of molecules on which bypass has occurred. For a substrate in which the primer terminus is located several nucleotides upstream to the lesion, this will be lower than lesion bypass, because usually not all primers are extended. As can be see in Fig. 6, the effect of ATPγS is primarily on the initiation of DNA synthesis, as indicated by the decrease in the fraction of primers that were extended, and by the molecules bypassed of total (Fig.6, lanes 2–4 versus lanes 5–7). Additionally, it seems that the bypass step itself is also inhibited, but the effect is considerably smaller (Fig. 6; lesion bypassed, %). In the presence of ATPγS, the RecA filaments extend to cover the entire DNA molecule under our reaction conditions (see Fig. 5 E, below). Therefore, the inhibition of pol V by ATPγS can be because of reduced accessibility to the primer terminus caused by the tight RecA·DNA complex. Alternatively, the altered conformation of the RecA nucleoprotein in the presence of ATPγS may be inhibitory. Lesion bypass was also observed in the absence of either ATP or ATPγS (Fig. 6, lanes 8–10), presumably because of the presence of dATP. This is consistent with previous results showing that dATP can replace ATP as a cofactor for RecA activities (26Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). SSB was previously shown to stimulate RecA-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament (31Flory J. Radding C.M. Cell. 1982; 28: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Cox M.M. Soltis D.A. Livneh Z. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2577-2585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This occurs at low SSB concentrations, which favor a limited cooperativity mode of binding to DNA, leading to the appearance of beads (octamers of SSB) on a string (ssDNA Ref. 33Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To examine whether the SSB requirement in lesion bypass is related to the loading of RecA on DNA, a titration of SSB was performed. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the highest bypass activity was observed at 50 nm SSB. Increasing SSB concentration above 50 nm caused a slight decrease in bypass activity, followed by a plateau. Electron microscopy analysis of SSB binding to the gapped plasmid under our reaction conditions (50 nm SSB) revealed the appearance of beads on a string (see Fig. 5 B, above). This is consistent with the notion that under lesion bypass reaction conditions, SSB binds ssDNA in the limited cooperativity mode and may facilitate the formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament. If the only function of SSB in bypass is to help assemble the RecA nucleoprotein filament, then bypass should be observed also in the absence of SSB. Similar situations exist for other RecA-catalyzed reactions such as strand exchange. This reaction is stimulated by SSB, but it occurs also in its absence (26Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). When SSB is absent, however, the concentration of Mg2+ should be kept low to prevent secondary structures from interfering with RecA polymerization on DNA (34Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. Chase J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have therefore performed a preincubation step of RecA and the DNA, in the absence of SSB, under 1 mm Mg2+. Then pol V and UmuD′ were added, and the concentration of Mg2+ was raised to 10 mm to enable optimal activity of the polymerase. No bypass was observed under these conditions (data not shown). Other experimental protocols that were carried out included prolonged preincubation times with RecA prior to the addition of pol V, usage of higher concentrations of RecA, and addition of ATPγS instead of ATP. Under any of these conditions no bypass was observed in the absence of SSB (data not shown). In an attempt to examine whether a RecA nucleoprotein filament was formed in the absence of SSB, we assayed strand exchange between the gapped plasmid and a homologous DNA fragment. We found that RecA promoted strand exchange in the absence of SSB under the same conditions in which no lesion bypass was observed. 3A. Berdichevsky and Z. Livneh, unpublished data. This indicates that a functional RecA nucleoprotein filament was formed in the absence of SSB. Therefore, it seems that facilitating the formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament is not the only role for SSB in lesion bypass. Plasmon surface resonance analysis has shown that complexes of UmuD′2C bind along a RecA nucleoprotein filament (35Rehrauer W.M. Bruck I. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32384-32387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This binding is mediated most likely through UmuD′, which was previously shown to interact with RecA (36Frank E.G. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). So far, there was no demonstration of a direct binding between UmuC and RecA. A report that UmuC was retained on a column of immobilized activated RecA was based on a cell extract as a source of UmuC, and therefore binding could have been mediated via a third protein (37Freitag N. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8363-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The binding of UmuD′2C along the RecA nucleoprotein filament may be related to the tendency of multiple UmuD′2 molecules to form long filaments in crystalline state (38Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This property of UmuD′ might be also reflected in its structure in solution (39Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To examine whether such filaments might be required for lesion bypass, the following experiments were performed. In addition to the standard substrate with a gap of 350 nucleotides, a DNA substrate with an extended gap of 850 nucleotides was also constructed. A stoichiometric binding of UmuD′2 or UmuD′2C along the RecA·ssDNA complex would be reflected in a requirement for higher concentrations of these proteins in the case of the extra large gap. We performed a titration of UmuD′ under a constant concentration of 100 nm UmuC. As can be seen in Fig. 8, maximal bypass on the 350 nucleotides gap was obtained with 100 nmUmuD′2. This concentration is equimolar with the concentration of UmuC on the one hand, but it is also sufficient to cover the RecA-bound ssDNA region, assuming that one UmuD′2molecule binds two RecA monomers (Ref. 35Rehrauer W.M.

The type XI collagen molecule consists of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains, namely α1(XI), α2(XI), and overglycosylated α1(II) chains, and is typical of the fibrillar class of collagens having a 300-nm triple helical domain (1Burgeson R.E.

Although type XI collagen is a relatively minor collagen in cartilage, it is believed to be important in the regulation of fibril diameter (2Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H.

However, neither the domains of type XI collagen responsible for these activities nor the molecules with which they interact are known. By immuno-electron microscopy, it was found that the triple helical domain of type XI collagen was buried within the heterotypic fibril (4Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H.

Brandt K.D. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the triple helix of type XI collagen may have the potential to bind glycosaminoglycans present on the surface of chondrocytes. Although type XI collagen is associated with type II collagen in cartilaginous matrices, several studies show that chains of type XI and type V collagen can coexist within tissues (9Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Kleman J.P. Hartmann D.J. Ramirez F. van der Rest M. Eur. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), placenta-derived cell lines (13Bernard M. Yoshioka H. Rodriquez E. van der Rest M. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17159-17166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in a variety of noncartilaginous embryonic chick tissues (14Nah H.D. Barembaum M. Upholt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22581-22586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, type V and type XI collagen chains are believed to participate in the formation of heterotypic molecules with stoichiometries not previously assigned. They are therefore considered as a single collagen type (15Fichard A. Kleman J-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Much work has been done on the glycosaminoglycan and cell binding properties of type V collagen (for review, see Ref 15Fichard A. Kleman J-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and a region within the α1(V) chain has been identified as the site through which ionic interactions with glycosaminoglycan moieties occur (16Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This site contains several basic amino acid residues and is located ∼100 nm from the amino-terminal end of the triple helical domain of the molecule. Further studies (17Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrate that binding of heparin to residues 905–921 in this α1(V) site is influenced by secondary structure. The α1(XI) chain shows considerable homology with the α1(V) chain of type V collagen (12Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sequence of amino acids comprising the heparin binding site within α1(V) is also present within α1(XI). The recognition of heparin and heparan sulfates as surface components in various cell types (18Koda J.E. Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8157-8162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) suggests that type XI collagen may be important in cell-matrix interactions. The glycosaminoglycans associated with the cartilage matrix, however, are hyaluronic acid, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. In this study, we have used competitive binding experiments to determine the relative affinities of the type XI collagen molecule for various glycosaminoglycans. The contribution of heparinase- and collagenase-labile interactions to chondrocyte binding to type XI collagen has also been investigated. Furthermore, the use of rotary shadowing techniques has enabled localization of heparin binding sites on the triple helical molecule. These studies provide evidence for a more complex range of interactions between the triple helical domain of type XI collagen and glycosaminoglycans than was previously thought. Such interactions may be partly responsible for the role of type XI collagen in establishing and maintaining cartilage matrix integrity. Type XI collagen was isolated from porcine articular cartilage by limited pepsin digestion. The cartilage was extracted with 4 m guanidinium chloride in 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, to remove proteoglycan. Pepsin (1 mg/100 mg of tissue) was dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid and added to the insoluble material. After digestion at 4 °C overnight, insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the pepsin-extractable material was precipitated sequentially with 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, and 2.0 m NaCl. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation. The 1.2 mprecipitable fraction was redissolved in acid and reprecipitated. This was repeated until the fraction appeared to be homogeneous and free of other collagen types, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)1(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides of type XI collagen were prepared by incubating 5 mg of purified pepsinized type XI collagen with 10 mm dithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently with 5 mg of CNBr in 70% (v/v) formic acid at 30 °C for 4 h. After digestion, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with water, dialyzed extensively against 10 mm acetic acid, and lyophilized. To quantify binding of heparin to type XI collagen, native pepsinized type XI collagen diluted in 5 mm acetic acid was separated into aliquots and applied to nitrocellulose discs 4 mm in diameter. The coated discs were air-dried and incubated for 2 h in 96-well plates (Falcon) in 100 μl of PBS-Tween containing radiolabeled (N-[35S]sulfonate) heparin solution (15.8 mCi/g; 2 mCi/ml; 4–6-kDa molecular mass) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a final activity of 0.1–2.0 μCi/ml. After extensive washing in PBS-Tween supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.25m, the amount of radiolabeled heparin bound to the discs was determined by scintillation counting. To determine the specificity of the type XI collagen-glycosaminoglycan interaction, competitive binding assays were performed. Type XI collagen-coated nitrocellulose discs were incubated simultaneously with radiolabeled heparin (1 μCi/ml; 64 μg/ml) and unlabeled heparin, heparan sulfate, de-N-sulfated heparin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid (0–1.05 mg/ml) in PBS. Unlabeled heparin preparations (from porcine intestinal mucosa) and other glycosaminoglycans were obtained from Sigma. Articular chondrocytes were isolated from porcine femoral head and condylar cartilage. The cartilage was digested with 0.4% (w/v) Pronase (protease E, Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cartilage was digested with collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum, Sigma) at 0.3% (w/v) in the same medium. Cells were recovered and washed by centrifugation at 100 × g. The cells were maintained in suspension cultures (5 × 105 cells/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10%(v/v) fetal calf serum for up to 48 h. Microtiter plate wells were coated overnight with type XI collagen at 200 ng/well in 10 mm acetic acid at 4 °C. The plates were subsequently blocked at room temperature using a 1 mg/ml solution of bovine serum albumin in PBS. Control incubations were prepared by coating wells with 200 ng/well BSA. The plates were washed with PBS and used directly for the attachment assays. Cells were harvested from the suspension cultures and incubated for 2 h with a highly purified bacterial collagenase preparation that exhibits no other proteinase activity (Form III, Advance Biofactures Corp.) at 1.5 units/ml or with heparin (Sigma) at 10 units/ml. The chondrocytes were collected by centrifugation at 100 ×g for 10 min, washed twice in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium by resuspension and centrifugation, and dispensed onto the washed plates at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were allowed to attach for 90 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2. The plates were rinsed three times with PBS to remove unattached cells, and the number of attached cells was determined by measuring the N-acetylhexosaminidase activity (21Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). For subsequent experiments, collagenase-pretreated cells were washed and incubated on coated plates as above in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of either heparinase (heparinase III from Flavobacterium heparinum, Sigma) at 2.5 units/ml or heparin at 10 units/ml. Whole and cyanogen bromide digests of purified pepsinized type XI collagen were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22Towbin H. Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). After incubation in PBS containing 0.05%(v/v) Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with 35S-radiolabeled heparin at 2 μCi/ml for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-Tween containing 0.25 m NaCl for 2 h, the blots were air-dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP radiography film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5 days. To isolate CNBr peptides containing heparin binding sites, CNBr digests (5 mg) of type XI collagen in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an aliquot of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. After extensive washing of the heparin-Sepharose with 0.25 m NaCl in the same buffer, the adsorbed peptide(s) was eluted using 0.5 mNaCl, incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 60 °C for 30 min, and resolved on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Peptides separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel were electroblotted onto Problott polyvinylidene membrane (Applied Biosystems) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11. NH2-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation on a protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) at the University of Manchester. Type XI collagen was solubilized in 10 mm acetic acid at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. An aliquot of the collagen (25 μl) was added to 1.25 ml of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, containing 25 μl of commercially available BSA-conjugated heparin (Sigma). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for up to 24 h, and subsequently, glycerol was added to the mixture to give a final concentration of 30% (v/v). Samples were prepared by the sandwich method. 25 μl of sample was spread between two 1.5-cm2sheets of freshly cleaved mica (Agar Scientific Ltd., UK), which were separated after 1 min and dried under vacuum in a metal-coating system (Edwards 306). The samples were rotary-shadowed with platinum at an angle of 9° and subsequently coated with pulse-evaporated carbon at 90°. The replicas were floated onto distilled water, picked up on 400-mesh copper grids, air-dried, and examined by electron microscopy (Philips EM 400 or EM 208). Images were recorded at 50,000× magnification and scanned at 600 dots/inch using an Epson GT-7000 scanner. Measurements of molecular length and respective sites of heparin-BSA binding were acquired using a Windows 95 ProScan image analysis program after calibration with reference to the 8.75 crystal lattice-spacing of beef liver catalase. Heparin-agarose has been employed successfully for the affinity purification of type XI collagen, both before and after pepsinization. To ascertain the specificity of this binding with respect to glycosaminoglycan species, a nitrocellulose membrane solid phase assay was established in which heparin-collagen binding could be optimized and quantified (Fig.1). Optimal concentrations of the collagen and of the radiolabel were established to be 10 μg of type XI collagen/disc and 1 μCi/ml (64 μg/ml) radiolabeled heparin. The heparin was maintained at ∼64 μg/ml for subsequent assays. The stoichiometry of the binding could not be calculated on a molar or weight ratio by introducing unlabeled heparin preparations of a range of molecular weight (average) into the assay (Fig.2). The relationship between the molecular weight of the glycosaminoglycan species and inhibition of radiolabel bound was not linear. On a molar basis, this nonlinearity was accentuated further with the concentration of the 3-kDa (average) heparin preparation, required to reduce bound radiolabel by 50%, being 45-fold greater than the required concentration of the 17 kDa (average) species. The average molecular mass of the radiolabeled heparin was 6 kDa. The pattern of charge densities along the heparin molecule appears to be a major factor in determining the affinity of binding, and this is consistent with the lack of binding of de-N-sulfated heparin. These assays were not optimized for reliable measurement of binding affinity, but the data obtained would suggest that the affinity is low (not shown). Nevertheless, low affinity binding would still be physiologically significant if the binding were complex, involving multivalent interactions or several component molecules. The specificity of the heparin binding site(s) was investigated by introducing unlabeled glycosaminoglycan species into the assay. Relative specificity of the glycosaminoglycans was ascertained by their capacity to compete with the radiolabeled heparin for type XI collagen binding. Over the concentration range studied, there appeared to be a hierarchy of binding affinity of the glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 3). None of the glycosaminoglycans could compete with radiolabeled heparin as successfully as heparin itself. Both heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate significantly inhibited binding of radiolabel in a concentration-dependent manner. Hyaluronic acid, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and keratan sulfate were all ineffective over the concentration range studied (up to 1.05 mg/ml) (Table I).Table IInhibitory effect of glycosaminoglycans on binding of radiolabeled heparin to type XI collagen immobilized on nitrocellulose1.048 mg/ml0.262 mg/ml0.065 mg/mlHeparin2.54.16.9Heparan sulfate4.38.834.7Dermatan sulfate4.335.061.0Chondroitin-6-sulfate73.073.0106.0Chondroitin 4-sulfate101.086.092.0Hyaluronic acid84.085.096.0Keratan sulfate110.0111.0113.0The percentage of radiolabeled heparin bound to type XI collagen in the presence of unlabeled glycosaminoglycans at 1.048, 0.262, and 0.065 mg/ml is shown below. Binding of heparin in the absence of unlabeled glycosaminoglycan is taken as 100%. Each value represents the mean of duplicates. Open table in a new tab The percentage of radiolabeled heparin bound to type XI collagen in the presence of unlabeled glycosaminoglycans at 1.048, 0.262, and 0.065 mg/ml is shown below. Binding of heparin in the absence of unlabeled glycosaminoglycan is taken as 100%. Each value represents the mean of duplicates. To address the possibility that glycosaminoglycan type XI collagen interactions may be of importance at the chondrocyte-matrix interface, the binding of chondrocytes to native type XI collagen was investigated using a cell binding assay. Fig.4 a summarizes the observed effects of chondrocyte pretreatment with exogenous heparin and bacterial collagenase on attachment to type XI collagen. The highly purified bacterial collagenase preparation used only digests regions containing the Gly-X-Y repeat of collagen, without digesting the noncollagenous proteins or domains. Pretreatment of cells with purified bacterial collagenase to remove cell surface collagen reduced the binding. Heparin also significantly reduced cell attachment to type XI collagen (p < 0.05) but also increased nonspecific binding to BSA, suggesting that specific binding was reduced to a greater extent. This indicates that heparin inhibits chondrocyte interaction with type XI collagen. To ascertain whether the inhibitory effect of exogenous heparin was due directly to a cell surface heparin-like molecule, chondrocytes pretreated with collagenase were incubated with heparinase (Fig.4 b). Heparinase and heparin treatment both significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the specific cell attachment, indicating that the type XI collagen-chondrocyte interaction observedin vitro was due in part to a cell surface heparan sulfate-like molecule. Type XI collagen binds to heparin-Sepharose with approximately the same affinity, whether it has been digested with pepsin or not (data not shown). Therefore, at least one binding site must be located within the triple-helical region of the collagen molecule. The nature of this binding was investigated further to establish whether a binding site(s) could be found on individual chains resolved by SDS-PAGE, or were composites of sequences contained within more than one chain. Pepsinized type XI collagen was resolved into its component α chains on 7% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Autoradiography of radiolabeled heparin bound to electroblotted type XI collagen revealed that both the α1 and the α2 chains of type XI collagen contained binding sites (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and2), suggesting that the primary structure of the individual chains was sufficient for heparin binding. Heparin did not bind to the α1(II) chain. The binding of heparin to electroblotted CNBr peptides of type XI collagen indicated that the binding site was not susceptible to CNBr cleavage (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). NaCl concentrations of greater than 0.35 m were required to elute the radiolabel from the electroblotted type XI collagen chains or peptides (data not shown), suggesting that the affinity of binding to denatured collagen was similar to that of native type XI collagen. CNBr peptides containing a heparin binding site were adsorbed onto a heparin-Sepharose column at a NaCl concentration of 0.25 mand, following extensive washing of the column with the same buffer, were eluted using a NaCl gradient, a peak of eluant occurring at around 0.375 m NaCl (data not shown). This experiment was repeated using batch-wise elution of heparin-Sepharose to which type XI collagen CNBr peptides had been bound (Fig. 6). CNBr peptides of type XI collagen were applied to heparin-Sepharose at 0.15 m NaCl. After washing in 0.25 m NaCl, the heparin-Sepharose was washed with an equal volume of 0.5 mNaCl. The peptides contained in each fraction are shown in Fig. 6. The eluted peptides were resolved on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Problott). Several faint bands are apparent in the 0.5 m NaCl fraction. However, one main band was seen, as described earlier. NH2-terminal sequencing revealed that the peptide was the product of CNBr cleavage of α1(XI) at methionine 792 and commenced with the sequence GLKGDRGEVGQ. From the human α1(XI) sequence (12Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it was deduced that this peptide would contain the sequence identified as the heparin binding site within α1(V), GKPGPRGQRGPTGPRGSRGARGP (16Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), confirming that this homologous region is a binding site in both type XI and V collagen. An equivalent α2(XI) CNBr peptide bound to heparin-Sepharose was not isolated. To establish whether heparin binds to other sites along the triple helix, the binding of type XI collagen to a heparin-BSA conjugate was observed using rotary shadowing (Fig.7 a); the heparin conjugate had an approximate stoichiometry of five heparin molecules per BSA molecule (information from supplier). Large aggregates were often observed, presumably due to the presence of multiple heparin molecules on each BSA molecule. However, in a sample of 115 isolated molecules (mean length 306.7 ± 8.4 nm), 50 exhibited heparin-BSA binding. As shown in the upper six panels of Fig. 7 a, the heparin-BSA appeared to bind predominantly to a site localized at 95.3 ± 11.7 nm from one end of the triple helix of the type XI collagen molecules. In addition, a near-terminal site located ∼281.7 ± 6.0 nm from one end of the molecule was observed (Fig.7 a, lower left and lower middle panels). The frequency distribution of binding along the type XI collagen triple helix is presented in Fig. 7 b. We have investigated the glycosaminoglycan binding properties of the 300-nm triple helical domain of type XI collagen to evaluate further its potential to interact with proteoglycan species in cartilage, thereby extending previous studies on the type XI collagen-glycosaminoglycan interaction (8Smith Jr., G.N. Brandt K.D. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Smith-Jr G.N. Williams J.M. Brandt K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10761-10767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we have found that type XI collagen interacts with other matrix molecules in cartilage, necessitating the use of SDS to extract it from growth plate and articular cartilage (6Wardale R.J. Duance V.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 975-984PubMed Google Scholar) after pepsin digestion. From the current study, heparin binding to type XI collagen appears to be independent of the triple helical conformation as it interacts with both native and denatured preparations of the collagen. The glycosaminoglycan specificity of the binding to the native triple helical molecule is very similar to that reported for other heparin binding molecules (24Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 361: 350-358Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with heparin and heparan sulfate showing the greatest affinity for the type XI collagen. As confirmation that the specificity observed was due to charge density alone, the nonphysiological but highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, dextran sulfate, containing four sulfate groups per disaccharide and an average molecular mass of 10 kDa (Sigma), was found to bind with greater affinity than heparin itself (data not shown). Furthermore, in the current study, de-N-sulfated heparin did not interact with type XI collagen. In our cell binding studies, we found that chondrocytes bind to type XI collagen and that this binding was reduced when cells were incubated with heparin or heparinase, suggesting that type XI collagen binds to a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Previous studies (7Smith Jr., G.N. Hasty K.A. Brandt K.D. Matrix. 1989; 9: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed that chondrocytes in culture retained type XI collagen at the cell-medium interface, whereas type II collagen could be released into the medium. Also, immunolocalization studies showed that the triple helix of type XI collagen and, presumably, the heparin binding site are accessible in pericellular regions in cartilage (25Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 376Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 5Ricard-Blum S. Hartmann D.J. Herbage D. Payen-Meyran C. Ville G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 146: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It may be speculated, therefore, from the specificity of the binding, that type XI collagen triple helix binds to the small heparan sulfate or dermatan sulfate containing proteoglycans that are present in cartilage, particularly at the cell surface. The binding of type XI collagen to cell surface proteoglycan may be important in the organization and stabilization of the cartilage matrix. Type XI collagen can regulate type II collagen fibril diameterin vitro (26Vaughan-Thomas, A., and Duance, V. C. (1994) Int. J. Exp. Pathol.75, (abstr.) 41–42Google Scholar, 2Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J. Hascall V. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar), and as fibrillogenesis is initiated at the cell surface, the anchoring of type XI collagen may in some way control this process in vivo. Although alternative splicing of the NH2-terminal domains of type XI collagen (27Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicates an important role for these domains in cartilage development, it is not known whether these proteolytically susceptible domains (29Maciewicz R.A. Wotton S.F. Etherington D.J. Duance V.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 30Wu J-J. Lark M.W. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5625-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are retained in adult cartilage. Therefore, the interactions of proteoglycans with the triple helical domain may be important for maintaining tissue integrity, particularly in the pericellular environment. We have identified two heparin binding sites on type XI collagen at around 24 and 95 nm from the NH2-terminal of pepsin-extracted collagen. The location of the 25-nm site is derived from the rotary shadowing data that indicate the presence of a site at around 280 nm from one end of the helix, which is located around 70 nm from the 95- or 100-nm site identified by sequence analysis and from previous studies. The 95-nm site identified by rotary shadowing coincides with the sequence obtained from the heparin-binding CNBr peptide of α1(XI) (Fig. 8 a). Both the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains of type XI collagen contain, in register, the motif of basic residues identified in the α1(V) chain as the 100-nm heparin binding site. It is surprising therefore, that the corresponding α2(XI) CNBr peptide was not identified by binding of radiolabeled heparin. The sequence of amino acids in α2(XI) is not identical to the KPGPRGQR sequence in α1(V) and α1(XI), defined as the heparin binding motif (31Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference would not, however, explain the anomaly that the whole α2(XI) chain can bind heparin, whereas the CNBr peptide containing the postulated site does not. A recent study of type V collagen heparin binding has indicated that the stoichiometries of type V collagen chains present may contribute to binding sites of varying affinities (17Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) due to the presentation of basic residues on one face of the polyproline II helix of each α1(V) chain. Thus, the α1(V)3 homotrimer has a greater affinity than the α1(V)2α2(V) heterotrimer. We have not been able to isolate the α2(XI) peptide that corresponds to the 100-nm site or that can bind heparin within the denatured α2(XI) chain. Nevertheless, the α2(XI) chain may contribute to the 100-nm site in the α1(XI) α2(XI) α1(II) heterotrimer, akin to the α1(V)2α2(V) molecule. Similar to the α1(V)2α2(V) heterotrimer, this site in type XI collagen would have positive charges on the outside of the two contributing α-chains and would not form a continuous band around the triple helical molecule. The 20-amino acid sequences depicted in Fig.8 a represent a distance of ∼6 nm in the triple helix, which would accommodate 7 disaccharide units. If the complete binding site is required for optimal binding, this may explain why the 3-kDa heparin (average 6 disaccharides) did not bind as well as the larger heparin molecules. However, if the sequence (KPGPRGQR), defined as the sequence accommodating a pentasaccharide (31Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the functional site, the 3-kDa species should bind as well as the larger species. The 25 nm binding site identified by rotary shadowing corresponds, in both the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains, to a region where there are a number of basic residues (Fig. 8(b)). In fact, both chains contain the postulated consensus heparin-binding motif XBBXBX (32Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R.

Such a site has been implicated in binding the triple helical collagen tails of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase to heparin (33Deprez P.N. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, sequences R581 to R588 and R539 to R546 in the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains respectively, also agree with the heparin binding motif described earlier which accommodates a pentasaccharide (31Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the α1(XI), α2(XI) and α1(V) chains have potential to bind heparin at the NH2-terminal end by either of these motifs. While we have identified this site in type XI collagen by rotary shadowing, this site has not been reported for type V collagen. The corresponding type XI collagen CNBr peptides of ∼5 kDa were not detected in the assay in which radiolabeled heparin was bound to CNBr peptides electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. In both the α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains however, the site is followed immediately by a methionine that would be cleaved by CNBr. This may prevent the CNBr peptide assuming a structure suitable for heparin binding. It has been suggested that there is a requirement for conformational constraint within a polyproline II helix on the heparin binding sequence of each chain; flanking sequences would influence this secondary structure (17Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The sequences may however also need the constraints of being in a triple helical structure to function as an efficient binding site. It is unlikely that multivalent binding can occur between a single glycosaminoglycan chain and both sites identified on one type XI collagen molecule, either in our in vitro studies or in vivo, due to spatial constraints. However, it is possible that both sites are accommodated by glycosaminoglycan chains present on different cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This, along with the formation of cross-links between type XI collagen monomers (34Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18865-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), presents the possibility that type XI collagen-glycosaminoglycan interactions contribute to cell surface-matrix interactions of a range of complexity and affinity. Indeed, the sum of a range of interactions between type XI collagen and matrix or cell-associated proteoglycans may be advantageous to matrix stabilization during periods of dynamic remodeling. The interactions between the triple helical domain of type XI collagen and glycosaminoglycan species may contribute therefore, to the cohesiveness and integrity of articular cartilage matrix.

Since the amino acid sequences of PSS1 and PSS2 are only ∼30% identical, it is likely that they are encoded by different genes. We have screened a murine liver genomic DNA library, included in bacterial artificial chromosomes, with full-length murine PSS1 cDNA and isolated a clone containing the majority of the PSS1 gene. This gene spans ∼35 kilobases and contains 13 exons and 12 introns. The sizes of the exons range from 44 to 1035 base pairs. The gene was localized to chromosome 13 in region B-C1. According to reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction, PSS1 and PSS2 mRNAs were expressed in all murine tissues examined. The mRNA encoding PSS1 was most abundant in kidney, brain, and liver, whereas PSS2 mRNA was most highly expressed in testis. In general agreement with the levels of mRNA expression, the choline exchange activity (contributed by PSS1, but not PSS2) was highest in brain, whereas serine and ethanolamine exchange activities were highest in testis and kidney. The transcriptional initiation site for PSS1 was identified 111 base pairs upstream of the ATG specifying the start of translation. The putative 5′-proximal promoter region of the gene contained no TATA or CAAT box, but did have a high GC content.

In mammalian cells, PtdSer is synthesized by a calcium-dependent base exchange reaction catalyzed by PtdSer synthase (PSS) activity that exchanges l-serine for the polar head group of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (10Hübscher H.G.

Interestingly, plants make PtdSer from both the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway (15Moore T.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 235-259Crossref Google Scholar) and a base exchange reaction (16Vincent P.

The existence of two mammalian PSSs, PSS1 and PSS2, was deduced from studies with mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (17Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 423-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In intact cells, PSS1 uses PtdCho as donor of the phosphatidyl group, whereas PSS2 uses PtdEtn (21Saito K. Nishijima M. Kuge O. J. Biol.

In Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat liver, serine exchange activity is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (22Jelsema C.J. Morré D.J. J. Biol.

Mitochondrion-associated membranes have been proposed to consist of a specialized domain of the endoplasmic reticulum that is juxtaposed with mitochondria, and mitochondrion-associated membranes have been proposed to mediate the import of newly synthesized PtdSer into mitochondria (24Vance J.E.

Using antibodies raised against PSS1 and PSS2 as well as Myc-tagged murine PSS1 and PSS2 expressed in rat hepatoma cells, we have recently shown that these two proteins are localized almost exclusively to mitochondrion-associated membranes (26Stone S.J.

Since the predicted amino acid sequences of PSS1 and PSS2 are only ∼30% identical, with no long continuous stretches of homology (18Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 342: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), PSS1 and PSS2 appear to be encoded by different genes. We have expressed murine PSS1 and PSS2 cDNAs in McArdle rat hepatoma cells and M.9.1.1 cells (a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking PSS1 (19Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) (30Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When the synthesis of PtdSer was increased by expression of murine PSS1 in hepatoma cells, the cellular content of PtdSer and PtdEtn remained unchanged, whereas the production of PtdEtn via PtdSer decarboxylation increased, and PtdEtn synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was reciprocally decreased (30Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the rates of synthesis and degradation of PtdSer and PtdEtn are tightly regulated. We now report the isolation of the murine PSS1 gene. A murine genomic DNA library, contained in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC), was screened with full-length cDNA encoding murine PSS1. Examination of positive BAC clones showed that the PSS1 gene resides on murine chromosome 13 in region B-C1 and consists of 13 exons and 12 introns. We also demonstrate, using reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR and enzymatic assays, that PSS1 and PSS2 are widely, but differentially, expressed in murine tissues. Restriction endonucleases, the random primer labeling kit, and the end labeling kit were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The radioisotopes ([α-32P]CTP and [γ-32P]ATP) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Quebec, Canada). Accurase long-range polymerase was from DNamp Ltd. (Farnborough United Kingdom) and Ex-Taq and Rec-Taq polymerases were from Takara Biomedicals, Inc. (Panvera, Madison, WI). The TOPO-TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen (Mississauga, Ontario). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma (Oakville, Ontario) or Fisher (Nepean, Ontario). BAC DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN midiprep kit (tip 100), and plasmid DNA was isolated with a Wizard miniprep or maxiprep kit (Promega, Madison, WI). For Southern blot analysis, DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10× SSC (SSC = 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m trisodium citrate) using a vacuum blotter (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by capillary action overnight in 0.8 m NaOH. Prehybridization and hybridization steps were performed using 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml probe, as required. Membranes were washed under conditions of low (2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature) or high (0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 37 or 55 °C) stringency and then scanned using a Storm 540 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Using the full-length cDNA encoding murine liver PSS1 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF042731) (30Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a BAC murine genomic library was screened by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). To confirm the presence of the PSS1 gene in isolated clones, BAC DNA was digested using EcoRI or BamHI and subjected to Southern analysis with a radiolabeled full-length murine PSS1 cDNA probe. The integrity of the clone was confirmed by comparison with the restriction enzyme digestion pattern of murine liver genomic DNA using the same probe and also by sequencing using primers specific for murine PSS1 cDNA. BAC DNA containing the PSS1 gene was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII,Xba, and KpnI. Fragments containing exonic sequences were identified by Southern blotting using radiolabeled murine PSS1 cDNA or exon-specific oligonucleotides as probes. Fragments that hybridized were subcloned into pBluescript II/SK (Stratagene, Aurora, Ontario). Using primers based on the murine PSS1 cDNA sequence, exon-intron boundary sequences were identified by sequencing the BAC DNA directly and aligning the sequence with the corresponding PSS1 cDNA sequence. Primers were synthesized at the DNA Core Facility of the University of Alberta using a Model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). A typical PCR program was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 74 °C for 30 s; and 74 °C for 3 min. For amplification of some large DNA fragments, PCR was performed using Accurase from DNamp Ltd. (Farnborough, United Kingdom) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 6 min; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 6 min + 20 s/cycle; 68 °C for 7 min; and 4 °C. Murine tissues (adipose, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and testis) from 129/J mice were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was evaluated by performing electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde gels stained with ethidium bromide. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an 18-mer oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 μg of RNA from tissues were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min in the presence of 1 μl of oligo(dT) primer (10 μm). After a brief centrifugation, 4 μl of “first strand buffer,” 2 μl of dithiothreitol (0.1m), and 1 μl of dNTP mixture (10 mm) were added and incubated at 42 °C for 2 min prior to addition of Superscript reverse transcriptase (1 μl) and another incubation at 42 °C for 45 min. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min. PCR was performed on the cDNA products using an antisense primer (396AS; see Table I) and a sense primer (85S; see Table I) spanning the ATG codon. Amplification was performed for 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 74 °C for 30 s and an extension step at 74 °C for 3 min. Southern blot analysis of the reaction products was performed using a radiolabeled internal probe (276AS; see Table I). The same PCR conditions were used with two primers specific for PSS2 (1S, TGGAGTCACACAAGCCAAAGAC; and 2AS, GTAGGTTGGAATGTTCCAGAGG). The identity of the product was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using oligonucleotide 3S (GGACAAGCTGGATGGCTTTGTT) as a probe. Cyclophilin was used as an internal control (95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 61 °C for 30 s, and 74 °C for 30 s and an extension step at 74 °C for 3 min).Table ISequences of primers used for PCR amplification and sequencingPrimer5′-Sequence-3′Positions in cDNAExon85AGAAGAACTATGGCGTCCTGCG85–1061106CGGAGGACGCCATAGTTCTTCT106–851276GACTCCGTTCCAGAAGA276–2922298TGTTGTCTTCTGGAACGGAGTC298–2712316CAGGATGCCTCTCCAGATGTTG316–2952376TCGACCTCATCCAGCCTTATGG376–3973396CATAAGGCTGGATGAGGTCGAG396–3753498GGATCCAGCCAATACATCAGGG498–4774510TGCTACACGAGAAGCGGACATC510–5314620GGCCATGAAGGCCTTGTTGATCCGT620–6445630TTCATGGCGGAAGCCCAGAAAT630–6195715GCATCTCCTGCCCAATTTTGCT715–7386845TCCTTGAAGCTTGCCCAGTGGT845–8246855ACCACCACAGGGAAGATCAAGC855–8767913TATGAATGTCCTTGAAGCTTGCCCA913–88871027GTGTTCCAGCCAGCCATCCCT1027–104881091GAGCCGTAATGCAGCCGATGAA1091–107081104GTACTATGCCTACCTCACGGAC1104–112591159CCCAGCACTGTGTCCCTACACG1159–113891170CATTGGTTTCCTGGAAGCTATTG1170–1191101249GCATCACGTAGAGTATCTGGGTC1249–1228101273CCACGTTCCTGTGTCTGTACGG1273–1294111330CCCGGTGACCATATTGCTCTGC1330–1309111357GGCACTTACAGTCCAGAGATCTC1357–1378121400GAGCCTTTCCCATGATGCCAGG1400–1379121486TGGACTTGGAATGCCGGTTCCT1486–1465131920GAGTCGCCTGTCCATTTGATTG1920–1941132312CACTAGCACCTCACATGAGCCA2312–2291131UAGGGCGACATCGTAGACTCTCAPromoter2UTAGGTTGCACGGTCGCTGTGAAPromoter3UTAAAGAGTCTAAGGACTGCGGCTGCPromoter4UGCCTGTTTCGGCTCTGATTCCTPromoterPositions in the forward order indicate that the sequences are identical to those of the cDNA; positions in the reverse order are complementary to cDNA sequences.

Total RNA was prepared from liver samples of 129/J mice using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA quality was evaluated by performing electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde gels stained with ethidium bromide. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a 22-mer primer (913AS; see Table I) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase as described above. The cDNA was washed using the Prep-A-gene DNA purification kit (Bio-Rad) and then tailed using dATP and recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 4 μl of ATP (1 mm), 5 μl of buffer, and 1 μl of enzyme were added to the cDNA and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. The incubation mixture was diluted to 500 μl with Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). PCR was performed on the reverse-transcribed tailed products using an antisense primer (396AS; see Table I) and a sense primer (Race dT, GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) specific for the poly(A) tail. The program used for the PCR was as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 38 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 5 min, 72 °C for 40 min, 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and an extension step at 72 °C for 8 min. Southern blot analysis was performed on products of the reaction using a radiolabeled internal probe (85S; see Table I). Hybridizing fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1 using the TOPO-TA kit and sequenced. The sequence was compared with that of murine PSS1 cDNA. Total RNA was prepared from 129/J mouse liver using Trizol. RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed for 3 h at 42 °C using adapter primer Ad68 dT (GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. PCR was performed using adapter primer Ad68 and primer 620S (see TableI) with the following program: 95 °C for 5 min; 55 °C for 3 min; 72 °C for 40 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; and a final step at 72 °C for 10 min. Southern blot analysis was performed on the reaction products using radiolabeled murine PSS1 cDNA as a probe. The 5′-sequence proximal to the transcriptional initiation site was obtained by “gene walking” using primers 1U, 2U, 3U, and 4U (see Table I) for sequencing directly from 5 μg of BAC DNA. The sequence of the putative promoter region was evaluated using the Transfac search engine. The chromosome location of the murine PSS1 gene was determined by DNA Biotech Inc. at the University of Toronto (Toronto, Canada). Lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleen and cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 3 mg/ml concanavalin A, 10 mg/ml lipopolysaccharide, and 5 × 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol. After 44 h, the cultured lymphocytes were treated for 14 h with 0.18 mg/ml 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. The synchronized cells were washed and re-cultured at 37 °C for 4 h in minimal essential medium containing thiamine (2.5 mg/ml). Chromosome identification slides were prepared by hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air drying. For the DNA probe, we used a pure preparation of BAC clone 595 F12 isolated using a QIAGEN midiprep kit (tip 100). The DNA probe was biotinylated with dATP using the Bio Nick labeling kit (15 °C, 1 h; Life Technologies, Inc.) (33Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The procedure for FISH detection was as described previously (33Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 34Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h and then treated with RNase A. The material on the slides was denatured with 70% formamide in 2× SSC for 2 min at 70 °C, followed by dehydration with absolute ethanol. Probes were denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization mixture consisting of 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate and then prehybridized for 15 min at 37 °C. After an overnight hybridization reaction with the probes, the slides were washed, and hybridization was detected and amplified (33Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). FISH signals and the DAPI banding patterns were recorded separately, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data to chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-banded chromosomes (34Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). PSS activity was determined as previously described (24Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen tissues were homogenized in HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 msucrose. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 ×g to pellet nuclei and cellular debris, and PSS activity was measured in the supernatant. Typically, 50–100 μg of protein were incubated with [3-3H]serine (50 μCi/μmol, 0.4 mm), [1-3H]ethanolamine (20 μCi/μmol, 0.2 mm), or [methyl-3H]choline (50 μCi/μmol, 0.2 mm) in 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4 mm hydroxylamine and 10 mmCaCl2 in a final volume of 200 μl for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Water (1.5 ml) was added for phase separation, after which the lower phase was washed three times with 1.5 ml of methanol/water (1:1, v/v), and radioactivity was measured. Five BAC clones were isolated from a 129/J murine genomic library by PCR screening and Southern blot analysis using radiolabeled exon-specific probes and radiolabeled full-length PSS1 cDNA. One of these genomic clones, 595 F12, contained the majority of the murine PSS1 gene. However, this clone lacked 437 base pairs at the 3′-end of the PSS1 cDNA. None of the other four clones contained the entire 3′-end of the cDNA. The integrity and identity of the cloned PSS1 gene were confirmed by comparison of the restriction enzyme fragmentation patterns of genomic DNA and the BAC clone (data not shown). One restriction fragment derived from genomic DNA was not the same size as any of those derived from the BAC clone. We confirmed that this fragment corresponded to the 3′-end of the PSS1 gene by performing PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers (1920S and 2312AS; Table I) specific for the 3′-end of murine PSS1 cDNA, with genomic DNA and full-length PSS1 cDNA as templates. Although clone 595 F12 lacked 437 base pairs at the 3′-end of the cDNA, this portion of the gene did not appear to contain any introns since (i) the PCR product obtained using murine liver genomic DNA as a template was the same size as the PCR product that would be expected from PSS1 cDNA, and (ii) the sequence of the human PSS1 gene obtained from the NCBI Database (accession number AC068091; 966284529-3551-12509) did not reveal any introns in this region of the human gene. Radiolabeled full-length cDNA encoding murine PSS2 was also used in Southern blot analysis to confirm that the clones with which PSS1 cDNA hybridized did not contain the PSS2 gene. These results demonstrate that murine PSS1 and PSS2 are encoded by different genes. On the basis of these results, clone 595 F12 was used to study the organization of the PSS1 gene. A combination of Southern blotting and sequencing using specific primers identified the exonic sequences and facilitated determination of exon and intron sizes as well as sequences at the exon-intron splice junctions (Fig. 1 and TablesII and III). The PSS1 gene is ∼35 kb in length, which is ∼15 times longer than the PSS1 cDNA. The gene is composed of 13 exons interrupted by 12 introns (Fig. 1 and Table II). Exon 1 contains the ATG codon of the translational start site (Fig.1 A). We have designated the first nucleotide of exon 1 of the PSS1 gene as nucleotide +1. The sizes of the exons range from 44 to 1035 bp. Exon 13 contains the stop codon (TGA) and the 3′-natural flanking region. To determine the sizes of the introns, two main strategies were used. First, we performed PCR amplification using primers flanking the exon-intron boundaries. Second, we mapped the region of the gene that contained an intron and then subcloned this fragment into pBluescript. Since some of the introns (e.g.introns I, VI, and IX) were large, we used the enzyme Accurase, which allowed more accurate amplification of large DNA fragments. The introns range in size from 0.3 to >5 kb (Fig. 1 A and TableIII). We noted that the organization of the mouse PSS1 gene is similar to that of the human gene. For example, exon-intron boundaries of the human PSS1 gene are at exactly the same positions as in the murine gene; and, consequently, the sizes of the exons are the same in the two species. Our data base search of the human gene showed that the sizes of introns VII and XI are 2.3 and 2.2 kb, respectively. We estimated that the sizes of introns VII and XI of the murine gene are 1.6 and 2 kb, respectively.Table IIPositions and sizes of exons in the 129/J mouse PSS1 geneExonPositions in the putative 129/J murine cDNACodon sequences interruptedAmino acids at sequence interruption11–264 (264)AG/GArg602265–356 (92)G/GTGly903357–401 (45)G/GTGly1054402–526 (125)ATG/GAGMet145/Glu1465527–685 (159)GAG/CTGGlu198/Leu1996686–836 (151)AAG/GACLys250/Asp2517837–975 (139)TGG/CAGTrp296/Gln2978976–1092 (117)AG/AArg33591093–1157 (65)GG/GGly357101158–1259 (102)GTG/GCCVal390/Ala391111260–1327 (68)AAG/ACCLys414/Thr415121328–1397 (70)G/GTGly438131398–2432 (1035)TT/CPhe637Numbers in parentheses indicate sizes of exons in base pairs.

Glaser B. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This step is catalyzed by hexokinase through a low K m pathway and by glucokinase through a high K m pathway (2Xu L.Z. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9939-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Schuit F. Moens K. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D. J. Biol.

Glucokinase predominantly regulates intracellular glucose metabolism when ambient glucose concentration is increased (4Matschinsky F.M. Collins H.W. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the reduced activity of this enzyme has been reported to decrease glucose-induced insulin release (5Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Glucokinase is also expressed in the liver, which is another regulatory center of glucose homeostasis. Van Schaftingenet al. (6van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. da Cunha Veiga M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have reported that the rat liver contains a regulatory protein that binds to glucokinase, and the activity of glucokinase coupled to this protein is thought to be mediated by competitive binding of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1-phosphate in the liver (6van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. da Cunha Veiga M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Vandercammen A. van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, this feedback regulation may affect the balance of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. There have also been attempts to find a corresponding protein in pancreatic islets (8Tiedge M. Steffeck H. Elsner M. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fructose 1-phosphate converted from fructose was reported to enhance glucokinase activity in vitro (9Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Davies D.R. Vandercammen A. van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and a greater increase in glucokinase activity has been reported in extracts from islets overexpressing glucokinase without an increase of glucose utilization (10Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Lynch R.M. Hirose H. Tokuyama Y. Bell G.I. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 390-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These reports suggested the existence of a factor capable of regulating glucokinase activity or its affinity for glucose under physiological intracellular conditions, although as yet, no direct evidence for such a molecule has been reported. To clarify whether a glucokinase regulatory protein is present in pancreatic islets, we screened for a cDNA library of the HIT-T15 cell line with the cDNA of glucokinase from rat pancreatic β cells using the yeast two hybrid system and found a novel binding regulator for glucokinase. Rat pancreatic islet glucokinase full-length cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 using pancreatic β cell glucokinase-specific oligonucleotides (11Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA was subcloned into the following two types of plasmids: pBTM116, the “bait” for yeast two hybrid screen (pBTM116-GK), and pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused glucokinase (GST-GK). Full-length cDNA of precursor of propionyl-CoA carboxylase β subunit (pβPCCase) in pancreatic islet was also amplified from rat pancreatic islets cDNA by PCR using the oligonucleotides for rat liver pβPCCase (12Kraus J.P. Firgaira F. Novotny J. Kalousek F. Williams K.R. Williamson C. Ohura T. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8049-8053Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rat pancreatic islet glucokinase and pβPCCase were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 and transformed intoEscherichia coli strain M15. Following induction of protein expression with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactosidase, the GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (13Inada A. Someya Y. Yamada Y. Ihara Y. Kubota A. Ban N. Watanabe R. Tsuda K. Seino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21095-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The produced protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Recombinant glucokinase without GST tag (rGK) was made by thrombin cleavage according to the manufacturer's instruction. Yeast two hybrid screening was performed as described previously (14Kotake K. Ozaki N. Mizuta M. Sekiya S. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29407-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid was pBTM116-GK, in which rat pancreatic β cell glucokinase was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain. The yeast strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-LacZ) was transformed with pBTM116-GK using the lithium acetate method (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Strain L40 carrying pBTM116-GK was transformed with a HIT-T15 (hamster pancreatic β cell line (16Ashcroft S.J. Hammonds P. Harrison D.E. Diabetologia. 1986; 29: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) cell cDNA library. Approximately 1.0 × 106 transformants were screened for growth on Yc plate medium (2% glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 1% succinic acid, and 0.12% yeast nitrogen base) containing 0.5 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole but lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, and leucine. His+ colonies were then placed on paper filters and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for β-galactosidase activity as described (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Two His+ and LacZ+ clones were obtained with this screening. The plasmids were transformed to E. coli and isolated. Pancreatic islets were isolated from male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (17Kajikawa M. Ishida H. Fujimoto S. Mukai E. Nishimura M. Fujita J. Tsuura Y. Okamoto Y. Norman A.W. Seino Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4706-4712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were then sonicated in RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the islet extract. Rat liver tissue was also homogenized in RIPA, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C as liver extract. Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed for collected islets by the previously described method (18Hogebon G.H. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 16-19Crossref Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Islets in the 0.25 m sucrose were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with 6 strokes of a close-fitting Teflon pestle. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g. The pellet was further purified by the method of Blobel-Potter to obtain the purified nuclear fraction (19Blobel G. Van Potter R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 × g. The pellet was collected as the mitochondrial fraction, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 × g. The resultant pellet was the microsomal fraction, and the supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. Each subcellular fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-pβPCCase serum as described previously (13Inada A. Someya Y. Yamada Y. Ihara Y. Kubota A. Ban N. Watanabe R. Tsuda K. Seino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21095-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The anti-pβPCCase serum was made from a rabbit immuned with GST-pβPCCase. GST pull-down assay was performed as described previously (13Inada A. Someya Y. Yamada Y. Ihara Y. Kubota A. Ban N. Watanabe R. Tsuda K. Seino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21095-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Each assay contained GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, samples containing glucokinase (5 μg of rGK, rat pancreatic islet extract, or liver extract) were incubated with 3 μg of GST (molecular mass, 27 kDa) or 9 of μg GST-pβPCCase (molecular mass, 89 kDa) or 8 μg of GST-GK (molecular mass, 79 kDa) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with binding buffer (10-fold volume of beads) and resuspended in elution buffer (binding buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione). The bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting with rabbit anti-glucokinase antibody or anti-pβPCCase serum as described previously (13Inada A. Someya Y.

Kamiyama M. Ogiso S. Okuda J. Nonogaki T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Glucokinase enzyme activity was measured by a fluorometric assay according to the method reported previously (21Miwa I. Mita Y. Murata T. Okuda J. Sugiura M. Hamada Y. Chiba T. Enzyme Protein. 1995; 48: 135-142Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glucokinase activity was measured as the fluorescence of NADPH at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 450 nm, respectively. The reaction was performed in a solution consisting of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NADP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/ml of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP at various concentrations, and 0.2 μg/ml of GST-GK supplemented with various concentrations of glucose at 37 °C for half an hour and was stopped by addition of stop solution (300 mm NaH2PO4, 0.46 mmsodium dodecylsulfate, pH 8.0). Reagent blanks were incubated in the absence of ATP and were subtracted from the total fluorescence of the corresponding complete reaction mixtures. The K m ,V max, and Hill coefficient were determined by the nonlinear least squares routine to fit the Hill equation using Sigma Plot (1Matschinsky F.M. Glaser B. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 9Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Davies D.R. Vandercammen A. van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as means ± S.E., with n values being the number of experiments performed. Statistical significance was determined by paired Student'st test. The yeast two hybrid system was used to identify cDNAs in the HIT-T15 cell cDNA library encoding the regulatory protein using the bait plasmid pBTM116-GK. The resultant cDNA insert was isolated by nutritional selection and β-galactosidase activity and was shown to be 68% of the rat liver pβPCCase gene by sequence analysis. The full-length cDNA of pβPCCase was obtained from rat pancreatic islet cDNA by a PCR-based method. The specificity of the interaction between pancreatic islet glucokinase and pancreatic islet pβPCCase was tested in vitro. The GST-fused pβPCCase (GST-pβPCCase) could bind to rGK and glucokinase in cellular extracts of rat pancreatic islets and liver (Fig.1). Furthermore, the GST-fused glucokinase (GST-GK) could bind to pβPCCase in cellular extracts of rat pancreatic islets (Fig. 1 D). Western blotting was performed to confirm the subcellular localization of pβPCCase in islets. pβPCCase was shown to be present in the mitochondrial fraction and cytosolic fraction, but it was not detected in the microsomal or nuclear fractions (Fig.2). Next, the effects of GST-pβPCCase on glucokinase activity were investigated. When 25 μg/ml GST-pβPCCase was added, GST-GK activity was significantly higher than that in controls within the range of 3 to 50 mm glucose (Fig.3 A), whereas the GST tag alone did not show any effect on GST-GK activity (data not shown). GST-pβPCCase had no activity of hexokinase or glucokinase. The glucokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose at 20 mm suppressed the activity of GST-GK by 67 or 60% in the presence or absence of pβPCCase, respectively, when the activity was assayed in the presence of 10 mm glucose and 5 mm ATP. TheV max value of GST-GK for glucose was increased by about 23%, and the K m value was reduced by 18% when GST-pβPCCase was added (Table I). The Hill number was 1.8 in the presence of GST-pβPCCase, which was not significantly different from the value of 1.7 in controls (TableI). Furthermore, the K m value of GST-GK for ATP was not affected by addition of GST-pβPCCase (see Fig. 3 B and Table I). The activity of GST-GK was increased in a GST-pβPCCase concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). In the previous reports, palmitoyl-CoA has been shown to suppress glucokinase activity at higher concentrations beyond physiological ones (22Tippett P.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tippett P.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Printz R.L. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 463-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of pβPCCase on glucokinase activity in the presence or absence of palmitoyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. The activating effect of GST-pβPCCase was not influenced by the presence of 3 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 3 μm propionyl-CoA (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters of GST-GK activity in the presence or absence of GST-pβPCCaseK mV maxhK m (ATP)mmμmol/min/mgmmGST-GK6.39 ± 0.3046.89 ± 3.411.7 ± 0.30.47 ± 0.08GST-GK + GST-pβPCCase5.16 ± 0.7557.47 ± 4.341.8 ± 0.20.59 ± 0.11pValue0.0160.005NSNSh, Hill coefficient number; NS, not significant.

Liver and pancreatic β cells play crucial roles in glucose homeostasis, but they have distinctive functions (28Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the liver, in response to changes in plasma glucose concentration, hepatic glucose uptake and glucose output are alternatively increased to maintain the plasma glucose concentration. Accordingly, an abrupt alteration of ambient glucose concentration might require a negative feedback loop for glucokinase activity by binding of a regulatory protein coupled to fructose 6-phospate (6van Schaftingen E.

On the other hand, pancreatic β cells secrete insulin in response to increasing glucose concentration (4Matschinsky F.M. Collins H.W. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A glucose-induced insulin secretion is subject to intracellular glucose metabolism, and in β cells glucose metabolism unidirectionally flows toward the direction of ATP production with the metabolic characteristic of development of a glycerol phosphate shuttle (30MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lack of fructose-bisphosphatase (31Sener A. Malaisse W.J.

However, a positive regulator of glucokinase, which has the lowest activity among all the glycolytic enzymes, had not been found in pancreatic β cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that pβPCCase increased V max of glucokinase for glucose and reduced K m . Such regulation may enable maximal enhancement of glucose metabolism in the range of physiological ambient glucose concentrations. pβPCCase is a precursor of the β subunit in propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that is present in the matrix of mitochondria (25Browner M.F. Taroni F. Sztul E. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12680-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Moss J. Lane M.D. Adv.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pβPCCase protein (61.5 kDa) is known to be synthesized on cytoplasmic polyribosomes and transferred to the mitochondria via a specific transporter. After arrival at the mitochondrial matrix, pβPCCase is processed to mature β subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase protein (54 kDa) by a Zn2+-dependent proteolytic component in the matrix (27Kraus J.P. Kalousek F. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, pβPCCase could exist in the cytoplasmic compartment. The importance of the regulation of glucokinase activity by pβPCCase remains to be determined. Pancreatic β cells are continuously exposed to not only glucose but also fatty acids, which are known to affect glucose-induced insulin secretion (33Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitate and oleate are strong potentiators of glucose-induced insulin release (35Hosokawa H. Corkey B.E. Leahy J.L. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Warnotte C. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and Liu et al. (33Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that glucose utilization examined using [2H]glucose was augmented accompanied by a decrease in the level of glucose 6-phosphate in islets cultured with oleate. These findings seemed to be consistent with the hypothesis that a precursor of PCCase β subunit, which exists in the cytosolic compartment and is known to become as functional as PCCase in fatty acid metabolism in the mitochondrial matrix (36Warnotte C. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 37Scholte H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 178: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), enhances the glycolytic pathway by up-regulating glucokinase activity. This hypothesis might be applicable to the glucose metabolism in the liver. In addition, pβPCCase might contribute to the localization of glucokinase by transporting the coupled enzyme in the liver and pancreatic β cells. In conclusion, pβPCCase has been shown to be a novel activator of glucokinase. Unlike the binding regulatory protein in the liver (7Vandercammen A. van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. da Cunha Veiga M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), pβPCCase alters the K m andV max values of glucokinase for glucose, resulting in enhanced enzyme activity in islets. Because glucokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme (28Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pβPCCase may be directly involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets.

Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) initiate the excision repair of this aberrant base by catalyzing the hydrolysis of theN-glycosidic bond. UDGs are expressed by nearly all known organisms, including some viruses, in which the functional role of the UDG protein remains unresolved. This issue could in principle be addressed by the availability of designed synthetic inhibitors that target the viral UDG without affecting the endogenous human UDG. Here, we report that double-stranded and single-stranded oligonucleotides incorporating either of two dUrd analogs tightly bind and inhibit the activity of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) UDG.

Uracil in DNA arises from the misincorporation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) during replication and from the hydrolytic deamination of cytosine (1Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 315-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar). Cytosine deamination generates highly mutagenic G:U mismatches that lead to G:C to A:T transition mutations. Characterized by a high substrate specificity, UDGs are able to distinguish between such structurally similar bases as uracil and thymine. Unlike other DNA glycosylases, UDGs remove uracil from both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, often with higher efficiency for the single-stranded substrates (1Mosbaugh D.W. Bennett S.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 315-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Eftedal I. Guddal P.H. Slupphaug G. Volden G. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 21: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). DNA glycosylases accomplish the formidable task of scanning a large excess of normal DNA bases, recognizing and then catalyzing the excision of damaged bases. A molecular-level description of how DNA glycosylases achieve recognition and repair requires the formation of stable protein-substrate complexes that can be studied by x-ray crystallography or NMR. Such studies are not ordinarily possible because of the transient nature of the enzyme-substrate interaction. One way to circumvent this problem involves mutating the enzyme so as to obtain a catalytically inactive form that retains the ability to recognize its substrate (4Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An alternative approach is in effect to “mutate” the substrate by preparing synthetic analogs that bind the enzyme specifically but cannot be processed by it (6Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L.

Powerful features of the substrate modification approach are that it requires no prior knowledge of the enzyme active site and that it can be structurally very conservative, entailing changes of as little as a single atom. UDGs have an unusually broad phylogenetic distribution, being present in organisms from the simplest free-standing bacterium (13Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, UDGs have been identified in the genomes of herpesvirus and poxvirus. HSV-1 UDG is dispensable for HSV-1 replication in cell culture, presumably because the cellular UDG can supplant the activity of the viral enzyme (16Reddy S.M. Williams M. Cohen J.I. Virology. 1998; 251: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Mullaney J. Moss H.W. McGeoch D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, an intact HSV-1 UDG gene appears to be necessary for efficient viral replication and reactivation in the murine nervous system (18Pyles R.B. Thompson R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4963-4972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the efficiency of viral replication and reactivation between thein vitro and in vivo studies has been attributed to the lack of detectable endogenous UDG expression in neurons, which are terminally differentiated (19Focher F. Mazzarello P. Verri A. Hubscher U. Spadari S. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies of HSV-1 in neural systems are relevant because HSV-1 establishes latency in the neuronal ganglia (20Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these results, the role of UDG in herpesvirus replication and reactivation remains unclear. For example, variella-zoster virus (VZV), another member of the herpesvirus family, has been shown to replicate in the absence of detectable endogenous or host UDG activity (16Reddy S.M. Williams M. Cohen J.I. Virology. 1998; 251: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Human cytomegalovirus (CMV), another herpesvirus, is unlike HSV-1 or VZV in that the disruption of its UDG gene results in a longer replication cycle with delayed DNA synthesis in tissue culture (21Prichard M.N. Duke G.M. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potent and highly specific inhibitors of viral UDGs could serve as valuable tools to elucidate the in vivo role of the enzyme in herpesvirus replication and virulence. The availability of such molecules could provide the impetus to pursue HSV-1 UDG as a novel target for anti-viral therapy (22Argnani R. Focher F. Zucchini S. Verri A. Wright G.E. Spadari S. Manservigi R. Virology. 1995; 211: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Despite the potential therapeutic interest in HSV-1 UDGs, few synthetic inhibitors of UDGs have been reported. The most potent non-protein UDG inhibitors thus far reported have IC50 values in the micromolar range (23Focher F. Verri A. Spadari S. Manservigi R. Gambino J. Wright G.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Sun H. Zhi C. Wright G.E. Ubiali D. Pregnolato M. Verri A. Focher F. Spadari S. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of two inhibitors of UDGs. Our results demonstrate that these two oligonucleotide-based inhibitors bind and inhibit HSV-1 UDG while having little effect on the human enzyme. HSV-1 and human UDG (UDGΔ84) were generous gifts from Prof. Laurence H. Pearl (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London) and Prof. Hans Krokan (UNIGEN Center for Molecular Biology, The Norwegian University of Science and Technology), respectively. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard β-cyanoethyl solid phase chemistry on a 1 μmol scale using an ABI model 392 DNA synthesizer and were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. End-radiolabeling reactions were performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and γ32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Duplexes were prepared by annealing with 10-fold excess of complementary strand. The radiolabeled strand of each duplex is the top strand, as shown in Sequence 1. The phosphoramidite of 2′-β-flouro-2′-deoxyuridine βFdUrd) was synthesized according to published procedures (25Howell H.G. Brodfuehrer P.R. Brundidge S.P. Benigni D.A. Sapino Jr., C. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 85-88Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The phosphoramidite of furan homouridine (fhUrd) was synthesized by an adaptation of a published procedure (26Hossain N. Blaton N. Peeters O. Rozenski J. Herdewijn P.A. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 5563-5578Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 2Y. Sekino, S. D. Bruner, and G. L. Verdine, unpublished results. The standard binding reaction mixture (20 μl) contained varying amounts of protein and 0.4 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides in 100 μm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were resolved on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA running buffer. The thermodynamic dissociation constants (K d= [protein][DNA]/[protein-DNA complex]) were measured as the concentration of the protein at which half of the target DNA is bound, under conditions in which [DNA] ≪ K d. Data from at least three titration gels were averaged to obtain the reportedK d values, which have standard errors of ± 50%. Example gels and binding data used to determine the experimental equilibrium constants are available as supplemental information. The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 20 fmol of 32P-labeled dU/G duplex oligonucleotides, varying dilutions of enzyme and 1 pmol of competitor oligonucleotide duplex. The reaction buffers were as follows: human UDG (60 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8); HSV-1 UDG (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for HSV-1 UDG and 10 min at 30 °C for human UDG and were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of formamide loading dye and 5 μl of 2 m piperidine. The sample mixtures were then boiled for 30 min prior to resolving on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Like all DNA glycosylases, UDG processes its substrate through a transition state having partial dissociative (SN1) character, wherein positive charge is accumulated on the sugar ring, especially at C-1′ and O-1′ (27Horenstein B.A. Parkin D.W. Estupinan B. Schramm V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10788-10795Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Kline P.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Erion M.D. Stoeckler J.D. Guida W.C. Walter R.L. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11735-11748Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Inhibitors have been designed either to mimic this transition state or to destabilize it electronically. The latter principle was employed in this study. Namely, analog 1 (2′-β-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, βFdUrd) (Fig. 1 c) possesses a 2′-fluoro substituent, which destabilizes the transition state by withdrawing electron density from the already electron-deficient C-1′ center. Analog 2 (fhUrd) (Fig. 1 c) interposes a CH2 unit between the base and its sugar, thereby depriving the transition state of assistance from the lone pair electrons on O-1′. The increased distance from C-1′ to the base in 2 may resemble the lengthening of the glycosidic bond that occurs during displacement of the base (Fig. 1 b). Both analogs possess an attached uracil base, which UDG is expected to recognize specifically. Indeed, analog 1 has previously been shown to bind and inhibit the human G/T glycosylase at subnanomolar concentrations (12Schärer O.D. Kawate T. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4878-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The βFdUrd and fhUrd nucleoside analogs were synthesized and incorporated into the middle of 25mer oligonucleotides using standard solid phase phosphoramidite chemistry. For double-stranded inhibitors, inhibitor oligonucleotides were annealed with complementary oligonucleotides containing a G opposite the analog. The binding affinities of the HSV-1 and human UDGs for the designed inhibitors were evaluated by EMSA (Fig.2). HSV-1 UDG binds the double-stranded (ds) βFU inhibitor tightly with an apparent K d of 4 nm. Under the same experimental conditions, the dsβFU inhibitor fails to form a specific gel shift complex with human UDG. A 25mer containing inhibitor 2 was tested in the same way using EMSA and was found similarly to bind with high specificity to only the viral UDG, albeit with lower affinity (K d = 160 nm). UDGs are known to excise uracil from both single-stranded (ss) and dsDNA. We therefore tested the binding of HSV-1 and human UDGs to inhibitors 1 and 2 in ssDNA. Although HSV-1 UDG does not bind detectably to the ssfhUrd inhibitor, HSV-1 UDG retained nanomolar affinity for the ssβFdUrd inhibitor (K d= 47 nm). Neither uracil analog in ssDNA bound the human UDG even at concentrations as high as 1 μm. Thus, the βFdUrd inhibitor is exquisitely specific for the viral over the human UDG, irrespective of whether the DNA is single- or double-stranded. To determine whether binding of the analogs to UDG results in inhibition of catalytic activity, we analyzed the ability of the analogs to interfere with cleavage of a natural substrate by UDG. In this assay, a 5′-32P-labeled uracil-containing substrate is incubated with UDG in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor analog. Processing of the natural substrate creates an abasic site, which undergoes strand cleavage to generate shortened oligonucleotide products upon treatment with aqueous piperidine. As shown in Fig.3 a, a 50-fold excess of dsβFU gives nearly complete inhibition (∼90%) of HSV-1 UDG activity (lane 4). The ssβFU oligonucleotide also inhibited HSV-1 UDG activity strongly (lane 7). Under the conditions of these assays, the fhUrd analog inhibited cleavage by ∼40% in dsDNA (lane 5) but not to any significant extent in ssDNA (lane 8). By contrast, neither analog caused pronounced inhibition of human UDG, although βFU in both ssDNA and dsDNA showed evidence of modest inhibition (<25% relative to nonspecific DNA, Fig. 3 b). Overall, the trends seen in cleavage inhibition assays closely parallel those in binding assays, consistent with the notion that these analogs target the enzyme active site. Here, we have described the design and evaluation of nanomolar inhibitors of HSV-1 UDGs. These UDG inhibitors have several potential applications. Although previous structural analyses of several UDGs, notably of human,Escherichia coli, and HSV-1 UDGs (4Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A.

The precise mechanism by which these enzymes scan the genome to locate and excise uracil residues remains unknown. The present inhibitors allow the formation of such stable complexes and are thus expected to shed further insight into the process of substrate recognition and catalysis by UDGs. Viral infections represent a major human health concern with few therapeutic options available. The fact that many members of the poxvirus and herpesvirus families carry a functional UDG in their limited genome and that other viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, actively package host UDG protein into viral particles suggests a potentially important functional role for this enzyme (35Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise function of UDGs in viral infection remains unclear. Highly selective and specific inhibitors described in this communication provide new reagents to probe thein vivo role of viral UDGs. Although oligonucleotides often suffer from poor cell permeability, there is reason to be optimistic in the case of these inhibitors, as oligonucleotides containing as few as 7 nucleotides inhibit HSV-1 UDG in vitro.2 We thank Prof. Lawrence H. Pearl and Prof. Hans E. Krokan for their generous gifts of HSV-1 and human UDGs and Orlando Schärer for synthesis of the βFU oligonucleotides.

The latter was ascribed to PIC due to its specific elution pattern on Blue Sepharose and Affi-Gel. 3H-AzHA photolabeling of recombinant PIC was prevented by methanephosphonate and diphosphonates and after premodification with 4-azido-2-nitrophenylphosphate. Hence, the demonstrated PIC interaction with monovalent long-chain FA anions, but with divalent phosphonates of short chain only, indicates a pattern distinct from that valid for the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1. The electroneutral Pi uptake via the phosphate carrier (PIC) in rat liver and heart mitochondria is inhibited by fatty acids (FAs), by 12-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylamino)dodecanoic acid (AzDA) and heptylbenzoic acid (∼1 μm doses) and by lauric, palmitic, or 12-azidododecanoic acids (∼0.1 mmdoses). In turn, reconstituted E. coli-expressed yeast PIC mediated anionic FA uniport with a similar pattern leading to FA cycling and H+ uniport. The kinetics of Pi/Pi exchange on recombinant PIC in the presence of AzDA better corresponded to a competitive inhibition mechanism. Methanephosphonate was identified as a new PIC substrate. Decanephosphonate, butanephosphonate, 4-nitrophenylphosphate, and other Pi analogs were not translocated and did not inhibit Pi transport. However, methylenediphosphonate and iminodi(methylenephosphonate) inhibited both electroneutral Pi uptake and FA cycling via PIC.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but alternatively, a Pi/OH− antiport has been proposed to be the most plausible mode (13Stappen R. Krämer R.

In addition to monovalent phosphate (15Herick K. Stappen R. Krämer R. Palmieri F. Thirty Years of Progress in Mitochondrial Bioenergetics. Elsevier, Amsterdam1995: 83-87Google Scholar), arsenate and divalent monofluorophosphate (16Freitag H. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are also translocated. With the human genome available, a major effort will be made in the coming years to ascribe particular phenotypes to the revealed genes. Some proteins possess several functions; consequently, a complete spectrum of functions for a given protein should be known. It is not uncommon that a carrier fulfills several functions. For example, the ADP/ATP carrier is thought to participate in the so called mitochondrial permeability transition (17Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gilles Pie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which is also activated by fatty acids (18Schönfeld P. Schlüter T. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although they share a similartrans-membrane folding (10Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg.

IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MACPs exert diverse functions and conduct anions of different charge and by different modes (symport, antiport, uniport). They all contain positively charged and membrane-embedded arginines or lysines located ontrans-membrane α-helices (11El Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Sluse F.E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Jez̆ek P. Urbánková E. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may contribute to the putative anion binding sites for fatty acid anions and other hydrophobic anions (12Jez̆ek P. Urbánková E. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jez̆ek P. Engstová H. Z̆ác̆ková M. Vercesi A. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interaction of some MACPs with fatty acids seems to represent another common feature, probably their second phenotype. Consequently, probing carriers with artificial hydrophobic substrate analogs might reveal some new structure/function relationships. Indeed, PIC (20Z̆ác̆ková M. Krämer R. Jez̆ek P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as well as homologous proteins, the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC; Refs. 19Jez̆ek P. Engstová H. Z̆ác̆ková M. Vercesi A.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This allows for the FA uncoupling cycle, suggested by Skulachev (28Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 29Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). For UCPs, the FA cycling should represent a major physiological function, whereas for AAC, PIC, and other carriers, it could be a “tolerated” side function (19Jez̆ek P. Engstová H. Z̆ác̆ková M. Vercesi A. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Z̆ác̆ková M. Krämer R. Jez̆ek P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FAs usually inhibit the other functions of the carriers. Thus, anion uniport via UCP1 is inhibited by various FAs (23Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), including 12-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylamino)dodecanoic acid (AzDA; Ref. 24Jez̆ek P. Hanuš J. Semrad C. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6199-6205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The latter also inhibits ADP uptake on AAC (21Brustovetski N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27329-27336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the dicarboxylate carrier-mediated transport (30Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). UCP1 was also found as a prominently labeled band among PAGE-separated proteins of brown adipose tissue mitochondria, photolabeled with 3H-AzDA (24Jez̆ek P. Hanuš J. Semrad C. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6199-6205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), or with its hexadecanoic acid analog (3H-AzHA; Ref.25Růz̆ic̆ka M. Borecký J. Hanuš J. Jez̆ek P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 3H-AzHA labeling was successfully applied to AAC as well (21Brustovetski N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27329-27336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIC has also been found to be partially inhibited by fatty acids; however, it has been interpreted in terms of a surface charge effect (31Wojtczak L. Załuska H. Quagliariello E. Palmieri F. Papa S. Klingenberg M. Function and Molecular Aspects of Biomembrane Transport. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1979: 327-330Google Scholar). Besides FAs, the only reported hydrophobic substrate analog was 4-azido-2-nitrophenylphosphate, which inhibited Pitransport by PIC only upon photoreaction when it was covalently attached to PIC after UV irradiation (32Tommasino M. Prezioso G. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hence, the specificity of FA interaction with PIC remains to be elucidated, mainly to determine whether FAs interfere with a putative H+(OH−) translocation pathway or with a Pi binding site or translocation pathway in the PIC structure. It is not known whether an H+(OH−) translocation pathway is identical or overlapping with the Pi pathway. A possibility that H+ flux concomitant to Pi flux during the physiological electroneutral Pi transport on PIC would be ensured by the FA cycling mechanism, as in UCP1 (23Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), is unlikely, since in this hypothetical case, when PIC would act as a phosphate/fatty acid antiporter, the Pi transport should be activated by FAs. In this paper, we studied both inhibition of PIC by fatty acids and other hydrophobic anions, namely hydrophobic phosphate analogs, as well as fatty acid cycling mediated by PIC. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of PIC interaction with hydrophobic anions is distinct from that of UCP1 (33Jez̆ek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Alkylphosphonates were purchased from Fluka (Switzerland); materials for electrophoresis, hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP), and Affi-Gel were from Bio-Rad. AzDA and 3H-AzHA were synthesized as described elsewhere (24Jez̆ek P. Hanuš J. Semrad C. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6199-6205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Růz̆ic̆ka M. Borecký J. Hanuš J. Jez̆ek P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The autoradiography enhancer ENTENSIFY NEF-992 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Other materials were from Sigma. For 12-azidododecanoic acid, 100 mg of 12-bromododecanoic acid methylester (0.36 mmol) and 116 mg of NaN3 (1.8 mmol) were stirred in 2 ml of dryN,N-dimethylformamide at 20 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 6 ml of water and extracted with ether. The organic layer was dried and evaporated to an oil, which was hydrolyzed by stirring with 0.3 ml of 1 n methanolic KOH (20 °C for 12 h) and subsequently diluted with water and acidified with 5 n HCl, and 12-azidododecanoic acid was extracted several times with ether. The organic fraction was washed with water, dried, and evaporated to a colorless oil (81 mg) that crystallized in a refrigerator. The product exhibited typical IR (KBr) spectral peaks at 2097 cm−1 (N3) and 1710 cm−1 (COOH). When esterified with diazomethane and analyzed on a gas chromatograph with mass detector, the chemical purity found was 96%, MS: 228 (M + 1 − 28). 4-Azido-2-nitrophenylphosphate was synthesized by the modified method of King and Nicholson (34King E.J. Nicholson T.F. Biochem. J. 1939; 33: 1182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from 4-azidonitrophenol prepared according to Ref. 35Lauquin G. Pougeois R. Vignais V. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4620-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, since the original procedures, based upon reaction of 4-azido-2-nitrophenol and 1,4-diaza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane in POCl3 or 4-azido-2-nitrophenol and trichloroacetonitrile in phosphoric acid (35Lauquin G. Pougeois R. Vignais V. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4620-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), gave very low yield. Thus, 250 μl of POCl3 (2.8 mmol) was cooled to −5 °C, and the solution of 180 mg (1 mmol) of 4-azido-2-nitrophenol in 2 ml of dry pyridine was slowly added at −5 °C. The solution was stirred at 20 °C for 15 min and at 110 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 0 °C, 2 ml of water was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 30 °C for 90 min. Pyridine was removed in vacuo; rest was dissolved in a methanol/water mixture (1:1) and filtered through a small column of Dowex 50 (H+). The column was thoroughly washed with the same solvent, the washes were collected and evaporated, and the rest was evaporated two times with dry EtOH. The crude product was then extracted to CHCl3 and alkalinized in chloroform while saturated with NH3. The yellow precipitate crystallized in a refrigerator to give yellow powder. The powder was extracted several times with hot MeOH and evaporated to dryness to give a crude product. TLC (silica gel 60 F254 (Merck), MeOH-NH4OH, 9:1) exhibited the principal spot at R F = 0.6, a spot ofR F = 0.95 (slightly longer versus starting 4-azido-2-nitrophenol), and three spots ofR F < 0.45. The crude product was further purified on a silica gel column (Merck; 0.04–0.063 mm, 4 × 10 cm) in CHCl3-MeOH-concentrated NH4OH, 8:2:0.2 (100 ml), 5:5:0.5 (100 ml), and MeOH-concentrated NH4OH, 9:1. The first eluate, showingR F = 0.95 on TLC (MeOH-NH4OH, 9:1) and obtained as yellow crystals (5 mg): mp 135–140 °C, dec. MS: 421 (M-1), 393 (M-29), was identified as bis(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)phosphoric acid, which is in good accordance with its MS and chromatographic behavior. A second fraction (TLCR F = 0.6) gave the final product, i.e. 4-azido-2-nitrophenylphosphoric acid, isolated as yellow crystals (35 mg): mp189–191 °C dec. TLC: CHCl3-MeOH-concentrated HCOOH, 7:3:0.5,R F = 0.55, single spot. MS: 261 (M + 1). Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from Wistar rats in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmTris-MOPS, 0.1 mm Tris-EGTA, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% BSA. BSA was omitted in the final washing. Mitochondria from trypsinized rat heart in 180 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4, were isolated by differential centrifugation in 180 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% BSA (36Schaller H. Letko G. Kunz W. Acta Biol. Med. Germ. 1978; 37: 31-38PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to swelling measurement, the KCl content was minimized by two washings in a sucrose medium. The yeast phosphate carrier was expressed in Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (8Schroers A. Krämer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The aliquots of inclusion bodies containing about 3 mg of protein were suspended and washed two times in 10 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. The washed pellet was presolubilized by 1.5 ml of 5 mmTEA-TES, 30 mm TEA2SO4, 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.2, containing 0.3% sodium lauroylsarcosinate. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min, the resulting pellet was solubilized in 0.75 ml of 5 mm TEA-TES, 30 mmTEA2SO4, 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.2 containing 1.67% sodium lauroylsarcosinate and 1% octylpentaoxyethylene. Anion transport in mitochondria was indicated by osmotic swelling while detecting light scattering (LS) at 530–550 nm as an apparent absorbance on a diode-array spectrophotometer (Spectronics 3000). LS intensity, reflecting the inverse volume, allows measurement at a protein concentration as low as 0.2 mg/ml in an optimum 40% isotonic medium osmolarity (270 mosmol as 100%). 44 mm KPi, 54 mm salts of monovalent anions, 36 mm salts of divalent anions, and 27 mm salts of trivalent anions were employed, all roughly corresponding to 108 mosmol at full ionization. The changes in the normalized reciprocal absorbance β are directly proportional to the transport rates in min−1(37Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows, β=P/P1*(A−1−α)Equation 1 where P is protein concentration, (P 1 = 1 mg/ml), and α is a machine constant, 0.1163 for the Spectronics 3000. The Pi/Pi antiport mediated by the reconstituted recombinant yeast PIC was determined by measuring [33P]phosphate flux using a forward exchange procedure (8Schroers A. Krämer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Schroers A. Burkovski A. Wohlrab H. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14269-14276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Kinetics was evaluated by variations of the external [Pi], while 30 mm [Pi] was kept constant in the vesicle interior. Proteoliposomes prepared in a medium containing 30 mm [Pi] were washed on a Sephadex G25–300 soaked with the desired external [Pi], while PIC was blocked by mersalyl (0.3 mm). Transport was then initiated by the addition of 50 mm dithiothreitol. An inhibitor-stop assay has been employed, so that 64 mmpyridoxal phosphate was added after a given time. The sample was then passed through the Dowex column (1-X10, Cl− form) to remove the external label. Forward exchange rates were determined by fitting the time course of isotope equilibration to a single exponential, Y = A(1 −e −kt) + B, leading to the first order rate constant k(min−1). A specific activity in μmol·min−1(mg of protein)−1 was calculated using k, the known external [Pi] (the total Pi amount in the sample volume) and the protein amount in the sample in mg (usually 4 μg of PIC protein, which equals a lipid/protein ratio of 400 or a molar lipid/PIC monomer ratio of 18,100. Reconstitution was performed by 14 cycles of detergent removal on a single column as described elsewhere (8Schroers A. Krämer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Schroers A. Burkovski A. Wohlrab H. Krämer R. J. Biol.

Briefly, 94 μl of PIC (e.g. 0.596 mg/ml) solubilized from inclusion bodies, 224 μl of preformed liposomes (22.4 mg of lipid) from E. coli lecithin (Avanti Polar Inc.), and 140 μl of Triton X114 were vortexed and supplied by stock solutions to obtain 1.4 ml of suspension containing PIC (e.g. 56 μg), 30 mmKPi, 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 6.8. It was passed 14 times over a column filled with 0.6 g of Bio-Beads-SM2 (Bio-Rad). PIC reconstitution was performed by the detergent removal method designed for fluorescent H+ transport monitoring by SPQ quenching on a Shimadzu fluorometer, RF5301 PC, as described elsewhere (20Z̆ác̆ková M. Krämer R. Jez̆ek P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To assay H+ fluxes, monitored as δH+, i.e. changes in internal [H+] relative to the initial state, FAs were added to proteoliposomes containing recombinant yeast PIC, and after their redistribution to both sides of the membrane apparent as interior acidification, 1 μm valinomycin was added to initiate H+ efflux. Measured fluorescence traces were converted into “H+ traces” (20Z̆ác̆ková M. Krämer R. Jez̆ek P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), from which the derived rates in mm·s−1(mg of lipid)−1 were multiplied by the internal vesicle volume (estimated from SPQ volume distribution) and divided by a surface of 1 mg of liposomes (in μm2) so that an H+ flux density per μm2 was obtained in pmol of H+·s−1·μm−2. Mitochondrial photomodifications with AzDA and photoaffinity labeling with 3H-AzHA were performed using protocols described for brown adipose tissue mitochondria (25Růz̆ic̆ka M. Borecký J. Hanuš J. Jez̆ek P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rat liver or rat heart mitochondria (3 mg of protein) were resuspended in 10 ml of BSA-free isolation medium and shaken for 10 min in an ice bath. 3H-AzHA (or nonradioactive AzDA) was added to reach a final concentration of 0.46 μm (1.5 nmol/mg of protein), and the mixture was shaken in an ice bath, first in darkness for 10 min and then for 10 min under UV illumination with a 400-watt xenon arc lamp equipped with a WG 8 filter (Schott Glass, Germany) transmitting light above 270 nm. Labeled mitochondria were washed by three centrifugations with BSA and three without BSA at 8500 × g. The last pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the sucrose medium. Chromatography on hydroxylapatite was conducted using stepwise fractionation on spin columns. Lower loads of mitochondrial octylpentaoxyethylene or Triton X-100 extract (45 mg of protein per 3 g of dry HTP) gave higher yields of PIC and AAC content. The labeled mitochondria were either applied to the HTP column, or proteins contained in the HTP pass-through (38Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were photolabeled in the detergent micelles with3H-AzHA, using a protocol developed for UCP1 (24Jez̆ek P. Hanuš J. Semrad C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were further fractionated on blue Sepharose (2 mg/ml of column) using a modified procedure of Rojo and Wallimann (39Rojo M. Wallimann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). BS was prewashed, and the first four elutions (1 ml each) were also performed with 150 mm Na2SO4, 20 mm Na-HEPES, 0.2 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0, containing 0.5% detergent. Thus, a “flow-through” and four “wash” fractions were obtained. A stepwise NaCl gradient (0.9, 1.5, 2, and 2.7 m) in 20 mm Na-HEPES, 0.2 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0, with 0.5% detergent was subsequently applied, while the final elutions were performed four times with 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5% SDS. Since BS retained mostly AAC, other proteins, including PIC, were contained predominantly in the flow-through fraction. Proteins of the HTP or BS flow-through fractions were further separated using organomercurial affinity chromatography on Affi-Gel 501 (Bio-Rad) soaked in the same medium as BS. After loading samples, five elutions (0.5 ml each) were conducted with the BS medium and two subsequent series of five elutions by the BS medium with 1.5 and 30 mm mercaptoethanol, respectively. The Affi-Gel 501 was reported to retain the PIC (40Kaplan R.S. Pratt R.D. Pedersen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and hence elutions with 1.5 mm mercaptoethanol should yield PIC, since the combination of BS and Affi-Gel excludes most proteins of the HTP eluate. Laemmli SDS-PAGE was conducted, either on a Mighty Small II apparatus (Hoefer, minigels), or on a Protean IIxi (Bio-Rad, 15-cm gels). In both cases, high resolution 17% acrylamide gels were cast with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 150:1, allowing for an expansion of the 30–40-kDa region (38Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Parallel gels to those for autoradiography were silver-stained using the bichromate method. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were treated with an autoradiography enhancer ENTENSIFY and dried between plastic follies and a filter paper under vacuum. Dried gels with peeled-out follies were exposed in the steel cassettes on Kodak Scientific Imaging Film X-Omat, AR-5, for 5–10 days (mitochondria) or 10–21 days at −70 °C. Films were developed by Dektol (Kodak) for 25 min and fixed in Kodak fixer for 5 min, both at 21 °C. Percentages of the remaining 3H-AzHA label were quantified from the band density compared with controls using one-dimensional image analysis software (EDAS 40, Digital Science, Kodak). Rapid electroneutral phosphate uptake was induced in rat liver (Fig. 1 a) or rat heart (Fig. 1 b) mitochondria as a passive swelling initiated by nigericin in 44 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4.

https://openalex.org/W2068370467,"We investigated the effects of high hydrostatic pressure in the range of 1–3 kilobars on tetradecameric GroEL, heptameric GroES, and the GroEL-GroES complex. Unlike GroEL monomers formed by urea dissociation, which can be reassembled back to the tetradecamer, the pressure-dissociated monomers do not reassemble readily. This indicates an alteration of their native structures, an example of conformational drift. Pressure versus time profiles and kinetics of the dissociation of both GroEL and GroES at fixed pressures were monitored by light scattering. Unlike GroEL, GroES monomers do reassociate readily. Reaction conditions were varied by adding ATP, Mg2+, ADP, AMP-PNP, and KCl. At any individual pressure, the dissociation process is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetics. This leads to the decrease in the yield of monomers at lower pressures. In the presence of Mg2+ and KCl, GroEL is stable up to 3 kilobars. The presence of either ATP or ADP but not AMP-PNP leads to GroEL dissociation at lower pressures. Interestingly, the GroEL-GroES complex is very stable in the range of 1–2.5 kilobars. However, the addition of ADP destabilizes the complex, which dissociates completely at 1.5 kilobars. The results are rationalized in terms of different degrees of cooperativity between individual monomers and heptameric rings in the GroEL tetradecamer. Such allosteric interactions leading to the alteration of quaternary structure of GroEL in the absence of chemical denaturants are important in understanding the mechanism of chaperonin-assisted protein folding by the GroEL-GroES system.

Their quaternary structures are crucial to the mechanism of chaperonin-assisted protein folding. These two proteins are coexpressed from a common GroE operon in Escherichia coli (1Georgopoulos C.P.

GroES is a single rotationally symmetric ring of seven identical 10-kDa subunits with a dome-shaped architecture (7Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). GroEL is a tetradecamer (14-mer) of 57-kDa subunits arranged in two seven-membered rings stacked back to back to yield a cylindrical structure. There are no tryptophan residues, and each subunit contains three cysteines, Cys138, Cys458, and Cys519. The x-ray crystal structures of GroES (7Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), GroEL (8Braig K. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) are available in the literature. The GroEL crystal structure demonstrates that each monomer is folded into three distinct domains. First, the apical domain faces the solvent and forms the opening to the central channel and is the peptide-binding site; second, a highly helical equatorial domain is the ATP binding site and forms the inter- and intraring contacts; and third, a hingelike intermediate domain links the apical and equatorial domains. The GroEL-assisted protein folding reaction cycle consists of a number of sequential reactions, i.e. (i) binding of the polypeptide at the apical domains of the cis-ring; (ii) binding of seven molecules of ATP and GroES, forming a stable cis assembly and freeing the tightly bound polypeptide into an “Anfinson's cage” where it folds; (iii) hydrolysis of ATP; and (iv) release of ADP, GroES, and the folded polypeptide (10Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 11Lorimer G. Nature. 1997; 388 (, 723): 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Xu Z.

In a recent investigation involving a GroEL containing binding-defective mutant apical domains, Horwich et al. (13Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) demonstrated that binding of polypeptides to the apical domain of GroEL requires a minimum of three binding-proficient apical domains for stringent substrate proteins, such as malate dehydrogenase and Rubisco, while only two were required for binding a less stringent substrate such as rhodanese (13Farr G.W.

In addition to GroES and ATP, the presence of Mg2+ and K+ is also necessary for the GroEL-assisted folding (14Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The role of ATP is important both as an energy source and an allosteric effector. It has been suggested that ATP binding displays both intraring positive cooperativity and interring negative cooperativity (19Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 20Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1521-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The conformational changes attributed to the binding of Mg2+, ADP, and AMP-PNP with GroEL have been investigated from the stability of such complexes as assessed by urea dissociation, followed by both light scattering and intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence (21Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the stabilities decrease in the following order: GroEL-Mg complex > GroEL > GroEL-Mg-AMP-PNP complex > GroEL-Mg-ADP complex. The binding of ATP has been suggested to destabilize the quaternary structure of GroEL (22Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Kovalenko O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). From labeling of the three cysteines (Cys138, Cys458, and Cys519) of the GroEL 14-mer, it was demonstrated that the binding of adenine nucleotides induces specific changes in the conformation of the protein oligomer (23Jai E.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that labeling at Cys458 by fluorescein 5-maleimide (23Jai E.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or 4,4′-dithiopyridine (24Bochkareva E. Safro M. Girshovich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20756-20758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) leads to the disassembly of GroEL. These conformational changes due to the binding of nucleotides regulate the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on the 14-mer that have been suggested to be important for the binding of protein and GroES during assisted folding by GroEL. High hydrostatic pressure techniques are increasingly used as tools to study dissociation and unfolding of protein aggregates (25Weber G. Protein Interactions.

The important theories behind this technique and excellent experimental details can be found in several edited books and monographs (25Weber G. Protein Interactions.

At pressures lower than 4–5 kbar, oligomeric proteins or protein assemblies generally undergo reversible dissociation (35Gross M. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) with denaturation (25Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall Inc., New York1992Google Scholar, 35Gross M. Jaenicke R.

The resulting monomers may undergo conformational drifts away from their conformations in the oligomer and, therefore, may not reassociate rapidly upon depressurization. The application of higher hydrostatic pressure can cause many single chain proteins to denature. A combination of moderate pressure and low concentrations of chaotropes has been found to be suitable for studying the unfolding of proteins (37Sasahara K. Sakurai M. Nitta K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Sasahara K. Nitta K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and for the recovery of proteins from aggregates (39St John R.J. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13029-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to providing information on the nature of physical forces involved in the dissociation of oligomeric chaperonins, elucidation of the dissociation mechanism would provide insights into whether such structures would withstand high pressure in bacteria under the depths of the ocean and still be functional for assisting protein folding. Three causes have been suggested for the pressure-induced dissociation of oligomeric proteins (25Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The first cause is due to imperfect van der Waals contact between the participating monomers and the restriction of amino acid residues approaching too close to each other due to the repulsion of their of their electronic clouds. Such repulsion leads, even with optimal close packing, to creation of small “free volumes” or “dead spaces” (25Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall Inc., New York1992Google Scholar, 36Paladini Jr., A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, upon the application of hydrostatic pressure, these small volumes will disappear because of better packing of the solvent against each dissociated subunit/monomer or the unfolded peptide chain. A second cause is due to the existence of salt linkages at the interfaces of monomers/subunits of oligomers, which upon dissociation are exposed and solvated, causing a decrease in volume of the system as a result of solvent electrostriction (25Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). A third cause, which is less well established, is the solvation of nonpolar groups at boundaries of contact between the monomers in the oligomer (25Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). In an earlier investigation, we reported that high hydrostatic pressure can dissociate GroEL tetradecamers (40Gorovits B.M. Raman C.S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2061-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After depressurization, the monomers reassociated back to the oligomer very slowly with at 12of 150 h at 25 °C. The dissociation and association reactions were facilitated by Mg-ATP only if it was present during pressurization. From their reassociation properties, it has been demonstrated that the monomers formed by pressure dissociation of the 14-mer are different from those formed by the action of 2.5m urea (40Gorovits B.M. Raman C.S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2061-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we have studied the effects of high hydrostatic pressure on GroES and GroEL in both the absence and presence of Mg2+ and adenine nucleotides and on the isolated complex GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7. Although other divalent cations such as Ca2+ are known to stabilize macromolecular assemblies (41Bonafe C.F. Villas-Boas M. Suarez M.C. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13210-13216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bonafe C.F. Araujo J.R. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the role of Mg2+ as a functional ligand is unique for the GroEL-GroES system (14Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The results are rationalized in terms of different degrees of cooperativity between individual monomers and heptameric rings in the GroEL tetradecamer. GroEL and GroES were purified as described previously (43Staniforth R.A. Cortes A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 44Clark A.C. Hugo E. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 complex was prepared and isolated according to the method of Lorimer et al. (19Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μm GroEL (14-mer) was added to 20 μm GroES (7-mer) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 5.0 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmATP. The total reaction volume was 100 μl. After 1 min of reaction, 20 μl of 50%glycerol was added to the mixture; the complex was isolated from excess unbound nucleotide and excess GroES using a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (1.0 × 17 cm; bed volume, 13.3 ml). The elution buffer was the same as the reaction buffer but lacking EDTA and nucleotide. The fractions corresponding to the complex were pooled and quantified by Bradford protein determination. The buffer solutions used in the investigation were filtered through 0.2-μm surfactant-free cellulose acetate membrane syringe filters (Nalgene). The 640-nm polystyrene microspheres (latex beads) were from Poly Sciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). Tris buffer is suitable for pressure experiments because of the small pKadependence upon hydrostatic pressure (45Neuman Jr., R.C. Kauzman W. Zipp A. J. Phys. Chem. 1973; 77: 2687-2691Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). SDS was from Bio-Rad. The high pressure cell and photon counting spectrofluorometer were from ISS Inc. (Champaign, IL). The stainless steel alloy cell with quartz windows can be pressurized up to 3 kbar. Protein samples for the experiments were filled in quartz bottles (1-ml volume) with pressure caps (provided by ISS). These bottles are placed in the metal bottle holder and immersed in the pressurizing fluid (spectroscopic grade ethanol). The high pressure generator was from Advanced Pressure Products (Ithaca, NY). The pressure generator is electronically controlled and programmable to obtain pressure gradients. The temperature of the high pressure cell was maintained by a circulating water bath. Two independent computers controlled the Advanced Pressure Products pressure generator and ISS spectrofluorometer. The pressure gradients were controlled by computer using a program written for the Advanced Pressure Products software. The pressure was increased in 0.1-kbar increments and held for 1 min between the successive steps. The generated data were imported to Origin software (version 6; Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) and analyzed. Kinetics experiments were done after the protein sample in the pressure cell (from ISS) was equilibrated (30 min) to the desired temperature. After equilibration, the fluorometer recording was turned on, followed by the pressure machine. Protein dissociation was followed by monitoring scattering at 400 nm (excitation and emission slits were 2 mm each). To reach the desired pressure, the rate of pressurization was controlled through the Advanced Pressure Products software. In typical experiments, to reach pressures of 1 kbar required 1 min, 2 kbar required 3 min, and 3 kbar required 4 min at a pump speed of 2.0. This introduces severe limitations on following kinetics that would occur in less than the time taken to achieve the target pressure. In some instances, we were able to pressurize and depressurize much faster than the indicated times, but in most cases, rapid pressure change caused damage by shattering the quartz windows or sample bottles. To ensure that the intensity changes were not contributed by dimension changes of the cell due to high pressure, controls were run with latex beads in the sample bottle. The scattering intensity increased slightly under the pressure gradient and then reversed back to the original intensity upon depressurization (data not shown). The data were truncated to take account of the time taken by the pressure cell to reach the target pressure. The rates were evaluated by fitting the data to either mono- or biexponential equations: Y =A1 * exp(−k1 *t) + A2 or Y =A1 * exp(−k1 *t) + A2 * exp(k2 * t) +k3, respectively. The independent variableY was the observed scattering intensity in counts/s after subtracting the scattering due to buffer. The pseudo-first order rate constants k1 and k2 and the amplitudes A1, A2, and A3 were obtained from iterative nonlinear least squares regression of the data using Origin software program (Microcal). The method for nondenaturing gel electrophoresis for the analysis of GroEL monomer and resolution of GroEL14 from GroES7-GroEL14 complexes on native gels has been described in an earlier publication (46Horowitz P.M. Lorimer G.H. Ybarra J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2682-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The dissociation and reassociation of GroES by the application of high hydrostatic pressure of 2.5 kbar and depressurization to 1 bar followed by scattering is shown in Fig. 1. The top panel is without Mg2+, whereas in the experiment shown at the bottom panel, the sample contains 10 mm Mg2+. In both cases, the dissociation is fully reversible. The results indicate that Mg2+ has no effect on either the dissociation of GroES heptamer or the reassociation of the monomers. These results suggest that there is no significant conformational drift in the dissociated monomers that would prevent their reassociation. In an earlier study, it was shown that urea could dissociate and unfold GroES in a single, two-state transition as monitored by fluorescence anisotropy of dansyl-labeled GroES, intrinsic fluorescence, bis-ANS binding, sedimentation velocity, and limited proteolysis. From intrinsic fluorescence and sedimentation velocity analysis, it was demonstrated that dissociation by urea and reassociation of the monomers upon removal of the denaturant is reversible (47Seale J.W. Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4079-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Typical plots for the dissociation of GroEL as a function of high hydrostatic pressure are shown in Fig. 2. The results in the absence and presence of Mg2+ and nucleotides are presented in Table I. The p 12values, which represent the pressure at the midpoint of dissociation transition, are in the following order: Mg2+ = AMP-PNP + Mg2+ > ATPγS = ATP = buffer only > ADP > ATPγS + Mg2+ + KCl > ATP + Mg2+ + KCl > ADP + Mg2+ + KCl. In all of the conditions except when Mg2+ and AMP-PNP + Mg2+ were present, the 14-mer dissociates completely (Fig.2, lower curve). In the presence of Mg2+ or AMP-PNP + Mg2+, the light scattering intensity under the pressure gradient occurs to only about 20%of the scattering intensity relative to that for complete dissociation, and upon depressurization the scattering reverses back to the initial value (Fig. 2, upper curve). This depressurized sample did not show any significant increase in the scattering intensity even after 5–10 h of depressurization.Table IDissociation of GroEL (14-mer) in the absence and presence of Mg2+ and nucleotidesCondition 1-a[GroEL]14-mer = 0.36 μm, [Tris-HCl] = 50 mm, pH 7.8, T = 20 °C.

Open table in a new tab The kinetics of reassociation of pressure-dissociated GroEL monomers in the absence of ligands has been studied in our laboratory and has been shown to have a t 12of 150 h at 25 °C (40Gorovits B.M. Raman C.S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2061-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The observation that ATP + Mg2+ destabilized the 14-mer in the pressure dissociation experiments reported in this investigation is in agreement with the earlier results from urea dissociation (40Gorovits B.M. Raman C.S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2061-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The stability of GroEL in the presence of Mg2+ has also been seen in the case of its dissociation by urea (21Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), where the U 12values (urea concentration at the midpoint of transition) were in the following order: Mg2+ > AMP-PNP + Mg2+ > buffer only > ADP + Mg2+. Kinetics of dissociation of GroEL samples at 2.5 kbar in the presence of Mg2+ and different nucleotides were monitored by light scattering. The observed rates are summarized in TableII. The dissociation rates are in the following order: Mg2+ = AMP-PNP + Mg2+ > ATP-γS = ATP = ADP > ATPγS + Mg2+ + KCl > ATP + Mg2+ + KCl > buffer only > ADP + Mg2+ + KCl. The general trend is similar to the order of dissociation rates presented in Table I, with the stabilization of the oligomeric structure attributed to the binding of Mg2+and its destabilization when both Mg2+ and an adenine nucleotide were present. The kinetics in the presence of ATPγS + Mg2+ + KCl was biphasic, and both a slow and a fast rate could be evaluated (see Table II). The depressurized samples were analyzed by native 6.5%PAGE. It may be noted that the gel analysis provided a reasonable measure of the formation of monomers because their reassociation rate is extremely slow, with at 12= 150 h (40Gorovits B.M. Raman C.S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2061-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The results are presented in Fig. 3. In these gels, the monomers, given an equivalent number of subunits, always stain more intensely than the 14-mers. Upon comparing the intensities of the bands for the 14-mer and monomers with the standards (native 14-mer inlane 1 and urea-dissociated monomer inlane 2), it is evident that the GroEL showed maximum stability when either Mg2+ or AMP-PNP + Mg2+ were present in the sample. This is a clear indication that Mg2+ induces subunit interactions that lead to a tight oligomeric structure, which can be destabilized by adding ADP (lane 5) or ATP. The dissociated sample when ATP alone (not shown) was present resembles that of ATP + Mg2+(lane 8). The gel pattern indicates that, although the 14-mer did not dissociate completely at this pressure, significant dissociation occurred, depending upon the nature of nucleotide (see lanes 6 and 8), even in Tris buffer alone without Mg2+ and nucleotides (lane 3).Table IIObserved rates for the dissociation of GroEL (14-mer) in the absence and presence of Mg2+ and nucleotides at 2.5 kbarCondition 2-a[GroEL]14-mer = 0.36 μm, [Tris-HCl] = 50 mm, pH 7.8, T = 20 °C.kobss−1Buffer only4.0 ± 0.04 × 10−3With ATP2.5 ± 0.03 × 10−3With ATPγS2.4 ± 0.03 × 10−3With ADP2.6 ± 0.02 × 10−3With ATP,"

Locus-specific down-regulation of MHC class I gene expression is frequently observed in human tumors, leading to decreased susceptibility to cytotoxic T-cell-mediated lysis. The mechanism of this down-regulation is incompletely understood. Here, we describe the identification of human CCAAT displacement protein (CDP/cut) as a locus-specific repressor of HLA-B and C gene expression. Transient and stable transfections in HeLa and K562 cells demonstrated the presence of a repressor element 650 base pairs upstream of the first exon of HLA-B7. A specific binding complex with the HLA-B7 and Cw2 repressor elements was demonstrated by EMSA. Formation of the EMSA complex was inhibited specifically with polyclonal antiserum to human CDP/cut, demonstrating that CDP/cut binds the HLA-B7 repressor element. The corresponding region of the HLA-A2 promoter neither repressed HLA-A2 gene expression nor bound CDP/cut. Overexpression of CDP/cut in cell lines deficient in CDP/cut resulted in a nearly 4-fold repression of reporter constructs containing the HLA-B7 repressor element but not the corresponding region of the HLA-A2 promoter. Repression of HLA-B and C gene expression by CDP/cut does not involve displacement of NF-Y, nor is CDP/cut associated with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 when bound to the HLA-B7 repressor element.

Therefore, changes in MHC class I gene expression can have profound effects on the overall susceptibility to NK cell and cytotoxic T-cell-mediated lysis, the net effect depending on the specific MHC Class I genes involved.Down-regulation of MHC class I gene expression is observed in many human tumors and transformed cell lines, resulting in decreased susceptibility to cytotoxic T-cell-mediated lysis (8Travers P.J.

Global down-regulation of surface class I expression can arise by several mechanisms, including loss of β2-microglobulin or peptide transporter gene expression (9Restifo N.P. Kawakami Y. Marincola F.

For example, selective down-regulation of HLA-B locus gene expression has been observed in many cell lines derived from patients with metastatic melanoma (15Marincola F.M. Shamamian P. Axexander R.B. Gnarra J.R. Turetskaya R.L. Nedospasov S.A. Simonis T.B. Taubenberger J.K. Yannelli J. Mixon A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1225-1237PubMed Google Scholar) and colon cancer (16Browning M.J. Krausa P.

The specific MHC class I alleles in a particular tumor that activate cytotoxic T-cells may be different from those that inhibit NK cell function. Therefore, understanding how MHC class I antigen expression is controlled at the level of specific loci and alleles is an important goal with possible implications for the development of vaccine-based cancer therapeutics.The mechanisms that mediate locus-specific down-regulation of MHC class I gene expression are incompletely understood. Transcriptional mechanisms appear to be involved in many cases (17Soong T.W. Hui K.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2008-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 18Soong T.W. Hui K.M. Int. J.

The promoter and 5′-flanking regions of most MHC class I genes contain several highly conserved, well characterized DNA sequence elements involved in maintenance of constitutive expression (20van den Elsen P.J.

Down-regulation of MHC class I expression due to decreased binding of members of the rel family of transcription factors to the highly conserved enhancer A element has been reported in human tumor cell lines (23van't Veer L.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously shown that another highly conserved element, the interferon-stimulated response element, functions as a locus-specific activator of HLA-A gene expression in several hematopoietic tumor cell lines (25Waring J.F.

The relative contribution of these and other positive regulatory elements in determining the steady state expression of specific MHC class I genes in normal and malignant cells remains to be elucidated.In addition to positive regulatory elements, DNA sequence elements that mediate repression of classical MHC class I gene expression have been identified in the 5′-flanking region of some MHC class I genes, including the mouse classical class I genes H2-K andH2-L (26Liu X.

The factors that bind to most of these elements have not been fully characterized, and none of these elements has been shown to function in a locus-specific manner.Many of the factors that bind MHC class I gene regulatory elements produce a relatively small (2–3-fold) effect on MHC class I gene expression when acting alone. However, even small changes in the level of constitutive MHC class I mRNA levels have been shown to result in much larger changes in MHC class I surface antigen expression and cytotoxic T-cell function (35Fromm S.V.

It is likely that the large locus-specific variations in MHC class I gene expression observed in many human tumors are the result of net changes in the relative levels of several individual MHC class I transcriptional activators and suppressors in a given tumor type.In the current studies, we report the identification of human CDP/cut as a locus-specific (HLA-B and -C versus HLA-A) repressor of MHC class I gene expression in human tumor cells. We hypothesize that CDP/cut may contribute to the suppression of constitutive HLA-B7 gene expression observed in some human tumors (15Marincola F.M. Shamamian P. Axexander R.B. Gnarra J.R. Turetskaya R.L. Nedospasov S.A. Simonis T.B. Taubenberger J.K. Yannelli J. Mixon A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1225-1237PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we have identified what is to our knowledge the first example of a locus-specific (HLA-B and -C versus HLA-A) repressor element in an MHC class I gene promoter. These experiments also identify the protein that binds to this novel repressor element as CDP/cut, the mammalian homologue of theDrosophila protein cut (54Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1988; 333: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). CDP/cut overexpression in Panc-1 cells results in a 3.5-fold repression of the HLA-B7 promoter (Fig. 5 B). This degree of repression is similar to that reported for several other genes containing one or two CDP/cut binding sites (55Antes T.J. Chen J. Cooper A.D. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26649-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 56Ai W. Toussaint E. Roman A. J.

While complete sequence information in this region of the promoter is available for only a few MHC class I genes, many of the alleles in Table I occur in vivo with high frequency. Therefore, it is likely that the most frequently occurring HLA-B and C alleles are susceptible to repression by CDP/cut, whereas most HLA-A alleles and nonclassical MHC class I genes are not. In contrast, none of the murine MHC class I genes (H2-D, H2-K, andH2-L) contain any regions that are homologous to the HLA-B7 repressor element.CDP/cut is a ubiquitous transcriptional repressor first identified as a negative regulator of the sperm-specific sea urchin histone H2-B-1 gene (58Barberis A.

CDP/cut expression is high in many undifferentiated cell types and decreases when the cells are induced to differentiate (60Lievens P.M. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CDP/cut expression also appears to be increased in most tumor cell lines (63Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, CDP/cut overexpression may down-regulate the expression of several developmentally important genes during malignant transformation.CDP/cut contains a distinctive homeodomain and three highly conserved CRs. Each of the three CRs and the homeodomain of CDP/cut are able to bind DNA independently with broad binding specificities that are distinct but overlapping (47Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 69Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). While the overall consensus binding sequence contains significant variability, the CCAATA core has been shown to be important for efficient CDP/cut binding (47Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the HLA-B7 repressor element contains two closely spaced regions which are homologous to the consensus binding sequences for the CR-1 and CR-2 domains of CDP/cut (47Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The EMSA and immunoablation experiments in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 demonstrate that CDP/cut binds selectively to this region upstream of HLA-B and C promoters. Both the CCAAT and TATT motifs in the HLA-B7 promoter must be altered simultaneously to disrupt CDP/cut binding and to relieve transcriptional repression (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that CDP/cut-binding to the HLA-B7 repressor occurs through either site. In the HLA-A2 promoter, both the CCAAT and TATT motifs contain sequence variations that have been shown to disrupt binding of CDP/cut to other targets (47Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the 5′ CCAAT motif of the HLA-A2 promoter differs from the HLA-B7 promoter CCAAT motif by only one base pair (Table I), the mutation alters the important CCAATA core sequence. This sequence variation significantly interferes with CDP/cut binding to the HLA-A2 promoter (Fig.3, B and D) and results in the inability of CDP/cut to repress expression from the HLA-A2 promoter (Figs. 1 B and 5 B). In contrast, the corresponding region of the HLA-Cw2 promoter contains two CAATA motifs, consistent with the apparent higher affinity of this site for CDP/cut(Fig. 3 C). A recent study demonstrated that cooperative binding of isolated recombinant CDP/cut CR-1 and CR-2 domains is enhanced by the presence of two juxtaposed CAAT sites, compared with a single site (48Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The same study also showed that the ATCAAT motif, present in the HLA-Cw2 promoter (Table I), is a high affinity site for cooperative binding of the CDP/cut CR-1 and HD domains. Despite increased affinity of the HLA-Cw2 promoter for CDP/cut compared with the HLA-B7 promoter, both of these elements repress reporter gene expression to a similar extent (Fig.1 B). Since the degree of repression observed with either element is relatively small, it is possible that any difference may not be detectable. Alternatively, maximal repression may occur only when one CDP/cut site is occupied due to interference from a closely bound second CDP/cut molecule at the adjacent site or due to conformational restraints resulting from a single CDP/cut molecule bound at both sites.The mechanism of transcriptional repression of HLA-B and -C locus gene expression by CDP/cut remains to be elucidated. CDP/cut was initially identified as a protein that directly displaces the transcriptional activator CCAAT-binding protein in the histone H2-B-1 gene (58Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and the gp91-phox gene (59Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, CDP/cut represses transcription by displacing the B-cell-specific Bright transcription factor from its binding site in the intronic enhancer (67Wang Z. Goldstein A. Zong R.T. Lin D. Neufeld E.J. Scheuermann R.H. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Displacement of the CCAAT-binding transcriptional activator NF-Y by CDP/cut has been demonstrated for a few genes (50Kim E.C. Lau J.S. Rawlings S. Lee A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1329-1338PubMed Google Scholar, 52Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Coccia E.M. Mantovani R. Testa U. Battistini A. Blood. 1999; 93: 519-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In CDP/cut-deficient Panc-1 cells, the HLA-B7 repressor element functions as a weak activator of the HLA-B7 promoter (see Fig.5 B, experiments with the empty expression vector PMT2), which suggests that CDP/cut may be displacing a positive transcriptional activator from an overlapping binding site. However, our EMSA results using nuclear extracts that contain NF-Y, but very little CDP/cut, suggest that NF-Y does not bind the HLA-B7 repressor element (Fig. 7). A TRANSFAC analysis (70Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) using the 32-nt HLA-B7 and Cw2 repressor elements failed to identify other known transcription factors that could potentially bind these regions. Therefore, if CDP/cut represses HLA-B and -C gene expression by displacement of positive regulatory factors, the identity of these factors remains unknown. Alternatively, the 120-nt DNA sequence used in the reporter constructs in this study may contain an unidentified positive regulatory element for which activity is only observed in the absence of CDP/cut expression.Other evidence suggests that the C-terminal domain of CDP/cut functions at a distance as a direct transcriptional repressor of some genes (71Mailly F. Berube G. Harada R. Mao P.L. Phillips S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), possibly by association with histone deacetylase activity (49Li S. Moy L. Pittman N. Shue G. Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7803-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 53O'Connor M.J. Stunkel W. Koh C.H. Zimmermann H. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that neither DNA binding nor transcriptional repression of HLA-B7 gene expression by CDP/cut appear to require HDAC1. Taken together, these observations suggest that CDP/cut represses transcription by multiple, promoter-specific mechanisms. Whatever the mechanism, transcriptional repression mediated by CDP/cut binding to the HLA-B or -C repressor elements does not appear to involve interactions that are specific for MHC class I promoters. As seen in Fig. 6, activated transcription driven by the HSV tk promoter is repressed nearly 6-fold when the HLA-B7 repressor element is inserted upstream of the tk promoter.While MHC class I repressor elements have been previously described, none of these elements are locus-specific. Only one of these elements, a silencer identified in the miniature swine class I genePD1, is homologous to the HLA-B locus repressor element (34Weissman J.D. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The PD1 silencer element was among the first negative elements to be described in an MHC class I gene. Given the similarity of the swine PD1 silencer element to the human HLA-B repressor element, it is possible that swine CDP/cut also binds the PD1 silencer element.Most reported regulatory factors have a relatively small effect on MHC class I gene transcription, depending on the cell type and the specific MHC class I locus (25Waring J.F.

However, even small changes in MHC class I gene expression (i.e. 2-fold) can have a profound effect on MHC class I antigen cell surface expression and the resultant effect on cytotoxic T-cell function (35Fromm S.V.

For this reason, it is likely that overexpression of CDP/cut in tumor cells, which produces up to a 3.5-fold decrease in expression driven by the HLA-B7 promoter (Fig. 5 B), has important consequences on MHC class I antigen surface expression.In summary, we have identified a repressor element that mediates locus-specific down-regulation of HLA-B and -C (versus HLA-A) gene expression in human tumor cell lines. We have also shown that the transcriptional repressor CDP/cut binds this element in a locus-specific manner and mediates the observed repression. It is interesting to speculate that overexpression of CDP/cut contributes to the frequent observation of selective HLA-B locus down-regulation in melanoma, colon cancer, and other human tumors. Understanding the mechanisms that control locus-specific regulation of MHC class I gene expression has potentially important implications for the development of vaccine-based cancer therapeutics. The human MHC1 class I genes encode the highly polymorphic HLA class I antigen heavy chains, membrane-spanning proteins that combine with the invariant β2-microglobulin to form the HLA class I surface antigen (1Ploegh H.L.

Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). u-PAR domains 2 and 3 may also reversibly bind an enlarging series of integrins (including β1, β2, and β3integrins). The interaction of integrins with u-PAR modulates the affinity of the integrin for its corresponding ligand. Some experiments indicate that interaction with u-PAR reduces the affinity of the associated integrin for certain ligands, whereas in other experimental setups the affinity of the interaction between integrin and ligand increases after binding of u-PAR to the integrin (2Plesner T. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both interactions of u-PAR-associated integrins with extracellular matrix (ECM) and the activation of a cell surface-associated proteolytic cascade by u-PAR-bound u-PA (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, 3Vassalli J.-D. Pepper M.S. Nature. 1994; 370: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) are required for invasion of cells within ECM in processes such as cancer and angiogenesis (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L.

Del Rosso M. Ziche M. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1109-1119PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of u-PAR expression and u-PAR affinity for u-PA on the cell surface is critical for the regulation of cell invasion. Activation of certain cellular oncogenes leads to a higher expression of some of the components of the u-PA/u-PAR system (5Duffy M.J. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 7: 295-302Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Many hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and tumor promoters regulate the expression of the system at the transcriptional level (6Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 215-237Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Mignatti P. Rifkin D. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 103-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A transcriptional activation of the u-PAR gene has been observed in invasive colon cancer cells (8Wang H. Skibber J. Juarez J. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a post-transcriptional regulation of u-PAR mRNA by integrin engagement was reported in leukocytes (9Wang G.J. Collinge M. Blasi F. Pardi R. Bender J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Few studies deal with the post-translational regulation of the u-PA/u-PAR system. The internalization and rapid degradation of u-PAR-bound u-PA after complex formation with plasminogen activator inhibitors (10Cubellis M.V. Wun T.C. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was the first described mechanism regulating u-PAR exposure and u-PAR-bound u-PA. On the cell surface u-PAR is present in two forms as follows: a three-domain form (domain 1 + 2 + 3), which exhibits u-PA-binding properties, and a two-domain form (domain 2 + 3), lacking domain 1 and therefore u-PA binding activity. The two-domain form is the product of u-PA or plasmin cleavage of the three-domain form. Such cleavage may represent a post-translational mechanism exploited by proteinases to control their own activity on cell surface (11Høyer-Hansen G. Ploug M. Behrendt N. Ronne E. Danø K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, the level of glycosylation modulates u-PAR affinity for its ligand (12Møller L.B. Pöllänen J. Rønne E. Pedersen N. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11152-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). u-PA has a significant affinity for heparin (HP)-like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), namely heparan-sulfate (HS) (13Andrade-Gordon P. Strickland S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4033-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which is one of the most ubiquitous molecules present on cell surface, ECM and basement membrane (14Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) in the form of proteoglycans (PG). u-PA does not contain the typical HP-binding consensus sequence reported by Cardin and Weintraub (15Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it seems to bind to HP through the kringle domain of its amino-terminal fragment (ATF), where several basic amino acid residues are found (16Fears R.

There is also evidence that the u-PA B-chain and the u-PA catalytic site participate in u-PA/HP interactions (19Rijken D.C. de Munk G.A. Jie A.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Edelberg J.M. Weissler M. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, injection of HP in mice increases the fibrinolytic activity in the plasma euglobulin fraction by an increase of u-PA protein levels, probably following u-PA elution from endothelial cells (21Bertolesi G.E.

(22Brunner G. Reimbold K. Meissauer A. Schirrmacher V. Erkell L.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has reported that sulfated GAGs enhance tumor cell invasion in vitro by stimulating plasminogen activation both in the fluid phase and on the cell surface. We report here that HS promotes the interaction of u-PA with u-PAR, thereby providing an efficient post-translational mechanism by which the pericellular environment may regulate u-PA activity on the cell surface and the subsequent degradation of anatomical barriers, which is required for cell invasion. We show that a form of HS, characterized by a hexosamine and uronic acid composition very close to that of HP, exhibits affinity for u-PA and that in the absence of HS a specific u-PA/u-PAR interaction does not occur. Such activity is expressed by a sequence of more than 5 repeats of uronic acid-glucosamine. These data suggest that HS functions as an adaptor molecule allowing the interaction between u-PA and u-PAR. Human skin fibroblasts (HSF) from skin biopsies and Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts (CHO K1) were grown as monolayers at 37 °C, in 175-cm2 dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.

Incorporation of radioactive precursors was performed in low sulfate and low leucine medium for 48 h with l-[3H]leucine (20 μCi/ml) and 35SO42− (50 μCi/ml) (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation with radioactive precursors, the culture medium was decanted and the cell monolayer washed 3 times with 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/dish. Cells were extracted overnight at 4 °C with 4m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and 1% Triton X-100, containing proteinase inhibitors (10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mmdiisopropylphosphofluoridate, 10 mm EDTA). The extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was subjected to isopycnic density gradient centrifugation in CsCl. The extract was adjusted to a density of 1.35 g/ml in 4m GdmCl, 1% Triton X-100 by adding solid CsCl, Triton X-100, and water (25Schmidtchen A. Carlstedt I. Malmstrom A. Fransson L.A. Biochem.

After centrifugation for 48 h at 100,000 × g in an International IEC/B-60 ultracentrifuge, fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube (1-ml fractions) and assayed for radioactivity and density. PGs were pooled from the high density fractions (fractions 1–6) (ρ = 1.45–1.3 g/ml), which showed high 35S and low3H radioactivity (26Carlstedt I. Coster L. Malmstrom A. Fransson L.A. J. Biol.

The dual-labeled material was pooled, and fractions of 100 μl were precipitated with at least 4 volumes of 95% ethanol at 4 °C overnight and recovered by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellets were air-dried and then solubilized in 200 μl of the appropriate buffer prior to digestion with chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris or heparitinase from Flavobacterium heparinum(Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). Either the ethanol precipitates of crude preparations or the digested samples were used in affinity chromatography experiments. After incubation for 48 h with 50 μCi/ml35SO42−, cell monolayers were washed twice with 20 ml/dish of phosphate-buffered saline and removed from the culture dish by trypsinization. The trypsinate and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with Pronase (Calbiochem, B grade) and papain (Merck) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml each. After addition of trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration), the mixture was kept at 4 °C for 60 min and centrifuged 10 min at 15,000 × g. The sulfated GAG side chains of PGs were precipitated from the supernatant fraction by addition of 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol. The samples were maintained for 24 h at 4 °C, centrifuged at high speed, and washed twice with ethanol, and the pellet was dissolved in distilled water (27Del Rosso M. Cappelletti R. Vannucchi S. Romagnani S. Chiarugi V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 586: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sulfate-labeled GAGs were subjected to affinity chromatography as such or after treatment with chondroitinase ABC or heparitinase. HSF or CHO monolayers were incubated with 30 mm sodium chlorate for 12 days to inhibit ATP sulfurylase and hence the production of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, the active sulfate donor for sulfotransferases (28Miao H.-Q. Ishai-Michaeli R. Atzmon R. Peretz T. Vlodavsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4879-4886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To control the effectiveness of such a treatment, parallel cell monolayers were incubated in the presence of35SO42− (50 μCi/ml) added on days 1 and 5 and then processed for GAGs extraction as described above. Sulfate-labeled GAGs were then incubated with bacterial heparitinase (2.5 units/ml, 12 h, 37 °C, pH 6.2). Sulfate-labeled HS degradation products were analyzed by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. Chlorate-treated cell monolayers were used for binding studies with labeled u-PA. For some experiments, HSF or CHO monolayers were treated with heparitinase or chondroitinase ABC. Cell monolayers were incubated with 2.5 units/ml F. heparinum heparitinase (Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd., Japan) or 1 unit/ml ofP. vulgaris chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) (Seikagaku Kogyo Co Ltd., Japan) in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature. At the end of incubation cells were washed twice with cold PBS and used for binding experiments. HP by-products from beef lung (HS) were supplied by Glaxo Operations Ltd. (Runcorn, UK) and were fractionated according to Rodén et al. (29Rodén L. Baker J. Cifonelli J.A. Mathews M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 73-140Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and Fransson et al. (30Fransson L.A. Havsmark B. Sheehan J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, crude material (1 g) was treated with alkaline copper sulfate to remove dermatan sulfate. The soluble material was fractionated with ethanol as the calcium salt to remove chondroitin sulfate. GAGs that precipitated between 18 and 36% (v/v) ethanol were recovered and fractionated as quaternary ammonium complexes with cetylpyridinium chloride. The complexes were dissociated and dissolved by increasing concentrations of NaCl. The following fractions were obtained: HS-1 (0.2–0.4 m NaCl), HS-2 (0.4–0.6 m), HS-3 (0.6–0.8 m), HS-4 (0.8–1.0 m), and HS-5 (1.0–1.2 m). The amino sugar and uronic acid composition of each fraction was reported (31Fransson L.A. Sjoberg I. Havsmark B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were prepared from HS-4 by periodate oxidation/alkaline elimination (32Fransson L.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 235-244Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Fransson L.A. Malmstrom A. Sjoberg I. Huckerby T.N. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 80: 131-145Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, HS-4 (50 mg) was solubilized in 25 ml of 0.05 formate buffer, pH 3.0, 0.02 m NaIO4 for 24 h at 4 °C in the dark. Oxidation at pH 3.0 selectively destroys glucuronic acid (GlcUA) in GlcNAc-containing block regions. Such oxyglycans were dialyzed and cleaved by alkaline elimination (5 mg/ml solutions were adjusted to pH 12 with 2 m NaOH and kept at room temperature for 30 min at 20 °C). The solutions were adjusted to pH 5 with 2 macetic acid and subjected to gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50 superfine (size 20 × 2500 mm; eluent 0.2 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.0; elution rate 30 ml/h). The structure of the fragments obtained may be described by the following general formula: GlcN − (HexUA − GlcN)n − R (32Fransson L.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 235-244Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Fransson L.A. Malmstrom A. Sjoberg I. Huckerby T.N. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 80: 131-145Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar); where HexUA is a periodate-resistant uronic acid (glucuronic or iduronic acid); GlcN is glucosamine, and R is a C3 fragment of the structure –O–C(CHO)=CH2. Each glucosamine may be substituted with –NSO3 (N-linked sulfate group), –NAc (N-linked acetyl group), –OSO3(O-linked sulfate group). Fragments with n = 1–4 and >5 were obtained, as evaluated by coelution with molecular standards commercially available (Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan). It is interesting that the reported analysis of HS4 degradation products (33Fransson L.A. Malmstrom A. Sjoberg I. Huckerby T.N. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 80: 131-145Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicates that oligomers with n = 5 andn >5 (which account for more than 50% of degradation products) are compatible with the presence of alternating repeats containing glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and iduronic acid (IdoUA). Such oligomers are rich in heparin-like repeats, i.e. GlcN2-NSO3(6-OSO3)-IdoUA(2-OSO3). HS subfamilies and oligomers from HS-4 were used in ligand binding competition experiments on cell monolayers and in affinity chromatography. Human two-chain u-PA was provided by Lepetit Research Center, Varese, Italy, courtesy of Dr. M. L. Nolli and was also purchased from Serono (Rome, Italy). Human u-PA was purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose CH-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) substituted withp-aminobenzamidine (34Holmberg L. Bladh B. Åstedt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 445: 215-222Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), as described previously (35Del Rosso M. Dini G. Fibbi G. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 630-636PubMed Google Scholar). u-PA was pure on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed after the purification step (not shown). Binding studies were performed as described previously (36Del Rosso M. Pedersen N. Fibbi G. Pucci M. Dini G. Anichini E. Blasi F. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using 125I-u-PA iodinated with IODO-GEN (Pierce), with a specific activity of 25 μCi/μg. Briefly, confluent monolayers of cells cultured in 24-well multiple plates (Nunc-Intermed, Denmark), maintained in serum-free conditions for 24 h after reaching confluence, were washed 4 times with ice-cold PBS. One ml of ice-cold PBS containing increasing amounts of125I-u-PA was then added to each well. Each ligand concentration was added in triplicate wells, and the plates were incubated on ice for 60 min. After 4 washes of the unbound radioactivity with ice-cold PBS, the monolayers were solubilized with 0.3 ml of NaOH 1.0 m and counted in a LKB-Minigamma Counter. Specific binding was determined by measuring the difference of cell-bound radioactivity in the presence and absence of 5 μg of unlabeled u-PA. The results of binding experiments were analyzed by the Scatchard plots to obtain both the receptor number and theK d values of receptor/ligand interaction. Before binding, the cells were also subjected to acid wash to uncouple endogenous u-PA from u-PAR (37Anichini E. Fibbi G. Pucci M. Caldini R. Chevanne M. Del Rosso M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight (33,000 Da) u-PA (LMW u-PA), a kind gift of Dr. M. L. Nolli (Lepetit Research Center, Varese, Italy) was also iodinated and used in affinity chromatography experiments (specific activity, 23 μCi/μg). A soluble recombinant form of human u-PAR (su-PAR), a gift from Dr. U. H. Weidle (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was iodinated with the same method, for use in affinity binding experiments (specific activity 28 μCi/μg). su-PAR, which lacks the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor linking u-PAR to the cell surface, was released into the culture medium of a CHO cell line transfected with the GPI-defective human u-PAR (namely CHOdhfr− cell line), was purified on u-PA-substituted affinity columns, and retained the property of binding human u-PA. IMUBIND total u-PAR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (American Diagnostica) and was also used to measure u-PAR number. In this case, cell monolayers were lysed with lysis buffer, as suggested by the manufacturer, and an aliquot of cell lysate was used for u-PAR determination. In some experiments, we also measured the ratio between externally and internally located u-PAR. Cell monolayers were treated with GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) as described (36Del Rosso M. Pedersen N. Fibbi G. Pucci M. Dini G. Anichini E. Blasi F. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to cleave the GPI anchor linking u-PAR to the cell surface. The quantity of receptor was then determined on aliquots of the cell lysate of GPI-PLC-treated cells (internal u-PAR) and of the GPI-PLC incubation medium (external u-PAR). Various HS subfamilies were prepared from beef lung HP by-products as described above (29Rodén L. Baker J. Cifonelli J.A. Mathews M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 73-140Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Fransson L.A. Havsmark B. Sheehan J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); HP from beef intestinal mucosa was a kind gift from Laboratorio Derivati Organici (Vercelli, Italy); DS was obtained as the copper salt from the same procedure on the material of the same source (beef lung) and then transformed into the sodium salt; HA was from human umbilical cord; C6S was from shark cartilage, and C4S from bovine trachea was of commercial origin (Sigma). GAGs were immobilized on Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) activated with CNBr and substituted with adipic acid dihydrazide, as previously described (38Del Rosso M. Cappelletti R. Viti M. Vannucchi S. Chiarugi V. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); C4S, C6S, and HA were partially periodate-oxidized for 5 min at 37 °C in 0.02m NaIO4, 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; HP, various HSs, and DS were oxidized in 0.02m NaIO4, 0.05 m formate buffer, pH 3.0, at 4 °C for 5 min. Both reactions were stopped by the addition of 10% mannitol. The partially periodate-oxidized chains were dialyzed and then coupled to adipic acid-substituted agarose. The resulting aldimines were stabilized by reduction with NaBH4. The incubation mixture (5 mg of GAGs/ml agarose) was washed in distilled water, and amino sugars were measured in an amino acid analyzer. The binding efficiency was 90%. Affinity chromatographies were performed at room temperature on columns (10 × 150 mm) containing 12 ml of gel. The columns were equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.1% BSA. Either one of125I-labeled u-PA or su-PAR (10 ng in 1 ml of the same buffer) was applied and drained into the column. 5 ml (void volume) was then eluted to distribute the ligand throughout the whole bed of the gel. 2 h later the column was washed with the same buffer at a rate of 40 ml·cm−2·h−1. 5 column volumes (50 ml) were eluted, until radioactivity decreased to the background value. Elution was then performed with a linear gradient of 0.0–1.5 m NaCl in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.1% BSA, at a flow rate of 40 ml·cm−2·h−1. The slope of the gradient was checked by conductivity measurements. Affinity chromatographies of labeled cell PGs and GAGs were performed on u-PA- or u-PAR-substituted CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, derivatized with the ligands according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel loading and washing were as described above, but the amount of gel was 6 ml (10 × 75 mm column), and the flow rate 20 ml·cm−2·h−1. The same flow rate was used in NaCl gradient elution, which was performed with the same buffer described above. Fig. 1 a shows the binding profile of 125I-u-PA on HP-substituted agarose. No binding was observed to HA, C4S, C6S, whereas DS exhibited only a weak binding (data not shown). HP-bound u-PA eluted between 1 and 1.2m NaCl. Copolymeric oversulfated HS-5, whose composition is very close to HP (molar ratio of uronic acid (carbazole) to hexosamine above 1, like that of HP) and displays anti-coagulant activity (31Fransson L.A. Sjoberg I. Havsmark B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), was not used in the preparation of affinity gels. The other HS subfamilies (fractions 1–4, where the same ratio was close to 1), devoid of anti-coagulant activity, showed increasing u-PA binding along with increasing complexity of the GAG molecule. In fact, u-PA eluted from HS-4 at 0.8–0.9 m NaCl, whereas low sulfated HS-1/3 released u-PA at NaCl concentrations below 0.5 m(Fig. 1 b). Fig. 1 c shows u-PA affinity chromatography on HS-4-substituted agarose, where 125I-u-PA binding was competed with HS-4-derived oligomers. The ligand (10 ng of125I-u-PA) was preincubated with 100 μg of each HS-4 degradation product at 37 °C for 1 h before application to the affinity gel and then loaded on the top of the column, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Affinity binding patterns clearly indicate that only oligomers with n >5 (namely oligomers with more than five dimeric repeats of uronic acid and glucosamine) were able to compete efficiently with u-PA/HS-4 binding (Fig.1 c). When LMW 125I-u-PA was used as ligand in affinity chromatographies, no binding was measured (data not shown). These results indicate that u-PA/GAGs interactions mainly occur through a sequence present on the u-PA ATF, which is not present in LMW u-PA. No binding was observed when 125I-su-PAR was used in affinity chromatography experiments on GAG-substituted gels (data not shown), indicating that the receptor does not exhibit any affinity for HS and other GAGs. Fig.2 a shows the isopycnic density gradient centrifugation in CsCl, 4 m GdmCl, 1% Triton X-100 of a crude dual-labeled PG preparation from HSF monolayers. Highly sulfated fractions (ρ = 1.45–1.3 g/ml) were pooled, dialyzed against 4 m GdmCl, and chromatographed on Sepharose CL-2B (Fig. 2 b). Fractions containing highly sulfated material were pooled as indicated in Fig. 2 b and ethanol-precipitated, to be used in affinity chromatography experiments. The crude dual-labeled PG preparation was affinity chromatographed on u-PA-substituted agarose (Fig.3 a). The elution pattern showed that highly sulfated material elutes at 1.0 m NaCl. Fig. 3 b shows that chondroitinase ABC treatment, able to cleave C4S, C6S, DS, and HA, leaves unaltered the PG/u-PA affinity, which is completely abolished by heparitinase treatment, that specifically degrades HSs. These results indicate that neither the protein nor the chondroitin-sulfate moiety affect PG/u-PA affinity, which relies solely on u-PA-HS side chain interactions. To confirm these observations, purified 35S-labeled GAGs extracted from cultured HSF were chromatographed on the same gels. The undigested GAGs mixture eluted at 1.0 m NaCl (Fig.3 c), whereas the treatment with heparitinase abolished the binding, which was unaffected by chondroitinase ABC treatment (Fig.3 d), thus giving further support to the data indicating HS as the only u-PA-binding GAG. Affinity chromatography of PGs and GAGs on u-PAR-substituted agarose gave negative results (not shown), thus confirming data obtained with 125I-u-PAR on GAGs-substituted columns.Figure 3Affinity chromatography of PGs and GAGs from HSF monolayer cultures, on Sepharose u-PA. Before application to affinity columns, aliquots of double-labeled ethanol-precipitated PGs, pooled from Sepharose Cl 2B as described in Fig. 2, were solubilized in distilled water (40 × 10335S cpm were applied). a, chromatography of PGs (only 35S labeling is shown) on"

Following stimulation of a cell with chemoattractant, a significant rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by intracellular signaling pathways and results in polarization of the cell and movement via pseudopod extension. Amoeboid myosin Is play a critical role in regulating pseudopod formation inDictyostelium, and their activity is activated by heavy chain phosphorylation. The effect of chemotactic stimulation on thein vivo phosphorylation level of aDictyostelium myosin I, myoB, was tested. The myoB heavy chain is phosphorylated in vivo on serine 322 (the myosin TEDS rule phosphorylation site) in chemotactically competent cells. The level of myoB phosphorylation increases following stimulation of starving cells with the chemoattractant cAMP. A 3-fold peak increase in the level of phosphorylation is observed at 60 s following stimulation, a time at which the Dictyostelium cell actively extends pseudopodia. These findings suggest that chemotactic stimulation results in increased myoB activity via heavy chain phosphorylation and contributes to the global extension of pseudopodia that occurs prior to polarization and directed motility.

Zigmond S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Extracellular chemoattractants bind to G protein-coupled receptors that, in turn, transmit signals to the actomyosin cytoskeleton that generates biased motility (2Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The intracellular signals that regulate and coordinate these processes are beginning to be understood, but the full pathway from the receptor to the cytoskeleton remains to be elucidated. Dictyostelium has proven to be an invaluable model organism for investigating the molecular basis of chemotaxis. Many, if not all, of the components of the signaling cascade are shared with those found in mammalian cells and the motile response of the cell is indistinguishable from that of a leukocyte (1Devreotes P.N. Zigmond S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Stereotypical transient morphological and cytoskeletal changes rapidly occur inDictyostelium amoebae following cAMP stimulation (3Chen M.Y. Insall R.H. Devreotes P.N. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Within the first 20 s, the cell rounds up or “cringes” (4Futrelle R.P. Traut J. McKee W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cell then actively extends pseudopodia in random directions 60 s following stimulation. Finally, by 90–120 s, the cell becomes repolarized and moves in the direction of the stimulus (5Hall A. Schlein A. Condeelis J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These morphological changes are accompanied by alterations in the levels of F-actin and the phosphorylation state of the myosin II heavy chain. Concomitant with the cringe (0–20 s) is an increase in total F-actin (with a peak at 10 s) (5Hall A. Schlein A. Condeelis J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is followed by an increase in the level of myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation (that promotes depolymerization of myosin II thick filaments (Ref. 6Kuczmarski E.R. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)), with a peak of phosphorylation at 30–40 s (7Rahmsdorf H. Malchow D. Gerisch G.

Myosin II is also translocated to the cortex, where it is thought to become more accessible to the heavy chain kinase (9Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol.

Cytoskel. 1989; 13: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The F-actin levels then increase again, with a second peak at 60 s, coincident with active pseudopod extension (5Hall A. Schlein A. Condeelis J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This sequence of molecular and morphological events provides a fundamental framework for understanding how chemotactic stimulation results in directed cell migration. A key process in the chemotactic response is the orderly extension of pseudopodia and work in Dictyostelium has revealed that class I myosins play an important role in controlling their location and number (12Wessels D.

The class I myosins are ubiquitous; they are expressed in organisms ranging from yeast to man (15Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They all share a conserved motor domain, a light chain binding domain, and a tail region that contains a polybasic region that directly binds to membranes via electrostatic interactions and also to actin (15Coluccio L.M.

Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Titus M.A. Wessels D. Spudich J.A. Soll D. Mol. Biol.

Consistent with its role in motility, myoB has been shown to be localized to the leading edge of chemotactic cells (23Fukui Y. Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and its level of expression is significantly increased during aggregation (i.e. when Dictyostelium cells become highly chemotactic) (24Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III., J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The activity of the amoeboid myosin Is is likely to be strictly regulated in vivo by heavy chain phosphorylation. This has been demonstrated by the finding that mutation of the TEDS rule site at residue 332 from serine to alanine renders this motor inactive in vivo (25Novak K.D. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Wu C. Lytvyn V. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol.

Understanding the basis of myosin I functions in vivo requires the identification of the signals and conditions that change its phosphorylation state. Although recent progress has been made in the identification and characterization of MIHCKs in bothAcanthamoeba and Dictyostelium, virtually nothing is known about the kinase that acts on Dictyostelium myoB, an important regulator of pseudopod formation inDictyostelium (12Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ability to synchronize populations of Dictyostelium during chemotactic stimulation was, therefore, exploited to directly examine changes in the levels of myoB heavy chain phosphorylation in vivo to determine whether increased myoB activity is correlated with active pseudopod extension. The Dictyostelium discoideum Ax3 axenic strain and the myoB-strain HTD3–4 (31Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were maintained in HL5, a nutrient medium for axenic stains (32Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), in suspension at 150 rpm. Strains expressing mutant forms of myoB were maintained in HL5 supplemented with 20 μg/ml blasticidin (Calbiochem Chemical Corp., San Diego, CA). The S332A-myoB and myoB/SH3− strains were generated by transformation of themyoB − null strain with an expression plasmid containing altered forms of the myoB gene (27Novak K.D. Titus M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The S332A-myoB heavy chain carries an alteration in the TEDS rule site; the serine residue at position 332 is changed to alanine. The myoB/SH3− heavy chain is a truncated form of myoB that lacks the C-terminal SH3 domain. Prior to all experiments, log-phase cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in starvation buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4). Cells were resuspended to a density of 2–4 × 107cell/ml and shaken at 150 rpm for 3.5 h at room temperature. The onset of starvation initiates the Dictyostelium developmental program, and cells prepared in this manner are referred to as aggregation-competent throughout this paper. In some experiments the cells were pulsed with 50 nm cAMP every 6 min for 2.5 h after the first hour of starvation to ensure initiation of the early developmental program. Aggregation-competent cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of starvation buffer. A 100-μl sample was taken for the time 0 sample and lysed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of sodum dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% SDS, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, fresh 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (CLAP)) and stored on ice until further processing. A 1 × 10−6m pulse of cAMP (final concentration) was added to the sample with rapid mixing, and 100-μl samples were added to an equal volume of ice-cold SDS lysis buffer at various times point up to 90 s. The samples were then heated at 100 °C for 3 min, cooled to room temperature, and the myoB heavy chain immunoprecipitated as described below. One ml of cells at a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml were labeled with35S-amino acids by incubation at room temperature in starvation buffer containing 0.6 mCi/ml of Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) while shaking at 150 rpm for 3.5 h. Labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation at 510 ×g for 5 min and the pellet washed two times with starvation buffer. Cells were labeled with 32P to detect phosphorylated proteins by incubating them in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate during the final stages of starvation. A total of 4–8 × 107 aggregation-stage cells were collected at 3.5 h and resuspended in 0.5 ml of starvation buffer containing 0.2–0.4 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Biomedical, Irvine, CA) and 20 mm DTT (8Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with shaking at 190 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Some experiments included the addition of 10 mm DTT to inhibit extracellular phosphodiesterase following 3 h of pulsing to suppress spontaneous cAMP oscillations. Triton X-100 was added to the cooled cell lysates to a final concentration of 0.2%. Two to three μl of undiluted rabbit polyclonal anti-myoB (31Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal anti-mhcA antibody (an antibody specific for the conventional myosin heavy chain; kind gift of Dr. J. Spudich, Stanford University, Stanford, CA (Ref. 8Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)) were added and the mixtures incubated with gentle shaking for at least 1.5 h at room temperature. Fifty μl of Protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and the sample mixed by gentle shaking at room temperature for 1 h. In some experiments, the Protein-A-Sepharose beads were pre-cleared by incubation with amyoB − cell lysate prepared in a similar manner for 1 h and then washed extensively in the lysis buffer. The beads were collected by a brief centrifugation (10 s) in a microcentrifuge and gently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by two washes with lithium buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 0.1m Tris, pH 7.4) to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The washed pellets were then resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The immunoprecipitated gel samples were briefly spun to pellet the beads and equal portions of each supernatant applied to a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was either stained briefly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and dried on filter paper or immediately transferred to either PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were detected by exposing the dried gel or membrane to Kodak XAR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 6 - 8 days in the initial experiments. The films were scanned using an Epson ES1200C color scanner (Epson, Pittsburgh, PA) and the amount of signal determined by densitometry of the scanned film using NIH Image 1.54 software. In later experiments, the dried gels or membranes were exposed to a phosphorimage storage screen for 24–48 h and radioactive bands detected using a phosphorimager system (either the Fuji MacBas 1000 phosphorimaging system (Fuji Medical Systems, Stanford, CT) or the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 400). Manufacturer's software was used to quantify the signal in each lane. Following autoradiography, the levels of myoB heavy chain on the blotted membranes were determined. The membrane was incubated with the myoB antibody followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was performed determined with an ECL kit per manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Multiple exposures of the immunoblot films were taken to ensure that the bands were in the linear range, and these were scanned using an Epson scanner. The amount of protein was determined by densitometry of the scanned film using NIH Image 1.54 software. The relative level of phosphorylation was determined by dividing the amount of phosphorylation determined by autoradiography by the amount of protein at that time point as determined by scans of the Western blots. A total of 2–4 × 10732P-labeled aggregation-competent cells in a 2-ml volume were stimulated with chemoattractant by adding 1 × 10−6m cAMP, as described above. Sixty seconds after the addition of chemoattractant, the cells were lysed and the myoB heavy chain immunoprecipitated. The entire sample was run on a 6% SDS-PAGE curtain gel, electrotransferred to PVDF, and exposed to a phosphorimager screen. The position of the 125 kDa phosphorylated myoB heavy chain was confirmed by immunodetection. The major band that correlated with a band of radioactivity was excised from the membrane, rinsed briefly in methanol, then water, and incubated in 6 m HCl under N2 gas at 100 °C for 1 h in a screw-top vial (34Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was collected and counted by Cerenkov counting to confirm the recovery of32P. The phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage electrophoresis on a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate in parallel with phosphoamino acid standards as described in (35Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer was a 50:156:1794 (v/v/v) mixture of 88% formic acid-glacial acetic acid-distilled H2O mixture. Following electrophoresis, the TLC plate was sprayed with ninhydrin to visualize the position of the phosphoamino acid standards and then exposed to a phosphorimager plate overnight. First, a clarified high speed supernatant was made from aggregation-competentDictyostelium (see above). Cells were collected after 4 h of starvation and resuspended to a final density of 1 ml/g of cells in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 30% sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 40 μg/ml TLCK, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CLAP. Cells were drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cells were thawed by dilution to 20% sucrose with ice cold 100 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methylester (TAME), 50 μg/ml TLCK, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, and CLAP, then lysed with three passes through a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ). DTT was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 3 h at 4 °C to obtain supernatant “S2.” Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration 80% for storage at −20 °C. Small samples were dialyzed into HEMK (20 mmHEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4) buffer when needed. In vitro kinase assays of myoB were carried out by incubating 200 μl of S2 plus 1 μl of a 1:1:1 mixture of saturated phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m DTT, and CLAP with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for various times at room temperature. Samples also included 10 μl of phosphatase inhibitors (200 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 250 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 nm okadaic acid, 50 μm cypermethrin and deltamethrin) in the reaction mixture. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding lysis buffer without SDS and heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The samples were then cooled, and the myoB heavy chain was immunoprecipitated as described above. SDS-PAGE samples were applied to a 6% gel, transferred to PVDF membrane, and subjected to autoradiography and immunodetection. The phosphorylation state of a protein of interest in vivo can be determined by immunoprecipitation from labeled cell lysates. This method also allows one to test for various cellular conditions that could alter the protein's phosphorylation state. A specific rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a denaturedDictyostelium myoB tail fusion protein (31Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1205-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was tested for its ability to immunoprecipitate myoB from a cell extract. Because the myoB heavy chain is not a highly abundant protein, cells were removed from nutrient media and starved for 4 h to increase endogenous levels (24Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III., J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cells were labeled with 35S-amino acids and aliquots lysed with detergent, boiled, and incubated with the antibody of interest. The antibody-antigen complex was then isolated using Protein A-Sepharose beads. Following electrophoresis of the samples and autoradiography of the dried gel, a single band at ≈125 kDa was observed in immunoprecipitates with the myoB antibody but not when the preimmune sera is used (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2). An antibody that recognizes the myosin II heavy chain was used as a control for the immunoprecipitation method (8Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and it was found to precipitate the expected 240-kDa band (Fig.1 A, lane 3). The amoeboid myosin Is are phosphorylated in vitro by a specific MIHCK (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Maruta H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8329-8332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the TEDS rule serine is essential forin vivo function of the lower eukaryotic myosin Is (25Novak K.D. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Wu C. Lytvyn V. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol.

It was therefore predicted that the Dictyostelium myoB heavy chain would be phosphorylated in vivo. The in vivo phosphorylation of myoB was examined by incubating aggregation-competent cells with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, blotting, and autoradiography of the myoB heavy chain. Immunodetection was used to verify the presence of the myoB heavy chain as Coomassie staining of the gel did not always reveal the presence of a prominent band at 125 kDa. The immunoprecipitated myoB heavy chain was phosphorylated (Fig.1 B, lane 1). A control experiment that employed a myoB null mutant (myoB −) strain was performed in parallel. No 125-kDa band was visible either in the immunoblot or in the autoradiogram (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), again demonstrating the specificity of the antibody and the immunoprecipitation protocol. The MIHCKs from Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium are present in high speed supernatants (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that a significant proportion of these enzymes may be readily solubilized. Since the myoB heavy chain has been shown to be a poor substrate for the Dictyostelium MIHCK (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), an extract was tested for a kinase activity that might phosphorylate the myoB heavy chain. A high speed supernatant from aggregation-competent cells enriched for myoB was incubated at room temperature in a reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors. The myoB heavy chain was immunoprecipitated from the reaction at various times following the addition of ATP, and the level of phosphorylation quantified. A steady increase in the level of myoB phosphorylation was observed over the 30-min time course (Fig. 1 C). Little or no phosphorylation was detected in a sample that did not contain phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 1 C). The identity of the in vivo phosphorylated residue on the myoB heavy chain was determined by phosphoamino acid analysis. The phosphorylated myoB heavy chain was isolated following transfer to PVDF membrane and hydrolyzed by acid. The hydrolysate was then separated by high voltage one-dimensional electrophoresis at pH 1.9. The phosphoamino acid(s) were visualized by autoradiography and the position compared with known standards. Serine was the sole phosphoamino acid detected (Fig. 2). To determine whether serine 332 (the TEDS rule site) was the site of phosphorylation, the S332A-myoB heavy chain was immunoprecipitated from cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Following immunoprecipitation, autoradiography revealed that the S332A-myoB heavy chain was not phosphorylated while the control wild type myoB heavy chain was (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the sole site of myoB heavy chain phosphorylation in vivo is serine 332, the TEDS rule site.Figure 3Serine 332 is the sole site of phosphorylation on the myoB heavy chain. A, the S332A-myoB heavy chain is not phosphorylated in vivo. The S332A-myoB heavy chain (lane 2) was immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled extracts and its phosphorylation examined by autoradiography (phos). A control immunoprecipitate from radiolabeled wild type cells is shown for comparison (lane 1). The presence of the myoB heavy chain in each sample was determined by immunoblotting of the same sample (α-myoB).B, the myoB/SH3− heavy chain is phosphorylatedin vivo. The myoB/SH3− heavy chain (lane 2) was immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled extracts and its phosphorylation examined by autoradiography (phos). A control immunoprecipitate from radiolabeled wild type cells is shown for comparison (lane 1). The presence of the myoB heavy chain in each sample was determined by immunoblotting of the same sample (α-myoB). Each lane shows only the portions of the gels containing the full-length myoB and S332A myoB heavy chains (125 kDa) or the slightly shorter myoB/SH3− heavy chain (119 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium MIHCKs contain a PXX P motif that has the potential to bind to SH3 domains (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 38Hammer III, J.A. Albanesi J.P. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

The amoeboid myosin Is have C-terminal SH3 domains and deletion of the myoB SH3 domain renders this motor nonfunctionalin vivo without altering the localization of this myosin (25Novak K.D. Titus M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Novak K.D. Titus M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One explanation for the inactivity of the myoB/SH3− heavy chain (a truncated myoB heavy chain that lacks the C-terminal SH3 domain) is that the kinase can not bind to the myosin I via its SH3 domain and phosphorylate the TEDS rule sitein vivo. The in vivo phosphorylation of the myoB/SH3− heavy chain was examined to test this possibility. Both the wild type and truncated myoB heavy chain are phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, loss of the SH3 domain does not affect the ability of the MIHCK to phosphorylate the myoB heavy chain in vivo. This result is consistent with a recent analysis of Acanthamoeba myosin IC tail mutants demonstrating that deletion of the SH3 domain does not affect either the K m or V maxfor phosphorylation by MIHCK (17Liu X. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24886-24892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells lacking myoB exhibit defects in pseudopod formation (12Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), indicating that myosin I activity is required for efficient motility. The effect of chemotactic stimulation on the level of myoB phosphorylation was tested. Aggregation-competentDictyostelium were stimulated with a physiological dose of cAMP as described for the analysis of myosin II phosphorylationin vivo (8Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated either in the presence or absence of caffeine (this inhibits adenylcyclase, blocking the production of intracellular cAMP) and [32P]orthophosphate and then subjected to a single, physiological, 1 × 10−6m pulse of cAMP. Samples were taken every 20–30 s and the myoB heavy chain immunoprecipitated and analyzed for phosphorylation. The level of myoB heavy chain phosphorylation appeared to increase either in the presence (Fig.4 A) or absence (Fig.4 B) of caffeine, with a peak at 60 s. This indicates that the increased phosphorylation was not due to an intercellular increase in cAMP but is due to signaling via the cAMP receptor. The relative increase in the level of heavy chain phosphorylation was determined by normalizing the levels of phosphorylation to the amount of myoB in each sample in three independent experiments. The overall level of phosphorylation increased 3-fold by 60 s (Fig.5), after which time it returned to resting levels.Figure 5Maximal phosphorylation of the myoB heavy chain occurs 60 s after stimulation with chemoattractant. The relative amount of myoB heavy chain phosphorylation was determined at various times following stimulation with cAMP. The level of phosphorylation before stimulation (0 s) is arbitrarily set at 100%. Shown are the results from three independent experiments (▪, experiment 1; ●, experiment 2; ♦, experiment 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chemotactic stimulation of Dictyostelium results in a significant increase in myoB heavy chain phosphorylation at the TEDS rule site (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Higher levels of heavy chain phosphorylation most likely result in increased myosin I activity (18Pollard T.D. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed peak of phosphorylation 60 s (Fig. 5), a time at which active pseudopod formation takes place, is consistent with a role for myoB in pseudopod formation and cell motility (12Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This work reveals that chemotactic signaling through the cAMP receptor results in increases in myosin I activity either by activating MIHCK or by making myosin I more available for phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of myosin I heavy chains has been reported forAcanthamoeba and brush border myosin Is (40Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Verner K. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 42Swanljung-Collins H.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). LikeDictyostelium myosin Is, the Acanthamoeba myosin Is are regulated by phosphorylation at the TEDS rule site (18Pollard T.D. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of Acanthamoeba myosin IA, IB, and IC revealed that each of these myosin Is are phosphorylated in vivo (43Baines I.C. Corigliano-Murphy A. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fraction of each myosin I that was phosphorylatedin vivo varied for each myosin I, but the phosphomyosin Is were concentrated in actively motile regions. The activity of brush border myosin I (BBMI) is, in contrast, regulated by calcium-calmodulin (15Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the BBMI heavy chain is phosphorylated in cytoskeleton preparations (40Howe C.L. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Verner K. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and in vitro experiments revealed that BBMI can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C on both serine and threonine when BBMI is associated with acidic phospholipids (42Swanljung-Collins H. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3445-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site of phosphorylation resides in the C-terminal tail region, but the role of phosphorylation in BBMI function is unknown (42Swanljung-Collins H. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3445-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single MIHCK has been identified Dictyostelium (21Lee S.F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côtè G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is highly homologous to the Acanthamoeba MIHCK and is a member of the PAK family of small G protein-regulated kinases (21Lee S.F. Egelhoff T.T. Mahasneh A. Côtè G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The MIHCKs are activated by the non-Dictyostelium small G proteins Cdc42 and Rac1, autophosphorylation, and acidic phospholipids (20Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 44Lee S.F. Mahasneh A. de la Roche M. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27911-27917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Dictyostelium G protein that activates MIHCK in vivo or the exchange and activating factors that act upon it have not yet been identified. However, a number of small G proteins are expressed in aggregation-competent cells, and it will be of interest to determine which plays a role in the activation of MIHCK and the signaling pathways that activate it. The purified Dictyostelium MIHCK does not appear to be capable of phosphorylating the myoB heavy chain (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Instead, it can phosphorylate the closely related myoD heavy chain (29Lee S.F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a myosin I not known to play a major role in cell motility based on mutant analyses (45Jung G. Fukui Y. Martin B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further underscoring the physiological distinction between myoB and myoD, the overall levels of the myoB heavy chain increase significantly during development (up to 7-fold 8.75 h after the onset of development) but those of the myoD heavy chain remain unchanged (24Jung G. Wu X. Hammer III., J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, quite likely that the myoB heavy chain is phosphorylated by a distinct MIHCK, perhaps one that is developmentally regulated or contains regulatory sequences that respond to signals from the cAMP receptor. The identification of myoB heavy chain kinase activity in cell extracts (Fig. 1 C) suggests that a kinase required for activating this myosin I is present during chemotaxis. Purification of this kinase and identification the mechanism of its activation should help to elucidate how stimulation of cells by chemoattractants results in efficient, directed motility.
