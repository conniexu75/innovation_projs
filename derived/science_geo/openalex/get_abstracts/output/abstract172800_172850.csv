To evaluate the importance of mucin in intestinal carcinogenesis, we constructed mice genetically deficient in Muc2, the most abundant secreted gastrointestinal mucin. Muc2 −/− mice displayed aberrant intestinal crypt morphology and altered cell maturation and migration. Most notably, the mice frequently developed adenomas in the small intestine that progressed to invasive adenocarcinoma, as well as rectal tumors. Thus, Muc2 is involved in the suppression of colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1996518756,"Protein folding and unfolding are coupled to a range of biological phenomena, from the regulation of cellular activity to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Defining the nature of the conformations sampled in nonnative proteins is crucial for understanding the origins of such phenomena. We have used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to study unfolded states of the protein lysozyme. Extensive clusters of hydrophobic structure exist within the wild-type protein even under strongly denaturing conditions. These clusters involve distinct regions of the sequence but are all disrupted by a single point mutation that replaced residue Trp62 with Gly located at the interface of the two major structural domains in the native state. Thus, nativelike structure in the denatured protein is stabilized by the involvement of Trp62 in nonnative and long-range interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2005254595,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other neurotrophins are critically involved in long-term potentiation (LTP). Previous reports point to a presynaptic site of neurotrophin action. By imaging dentate granule cells in mouse hippocampal slices, we identified BDNF-evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrites and spines, but not at presynaptic sites. Pairing a weak burst of synaptic stimulation with a brief dendritic BDNF application caused an immediate and robust induction of LTP. LTP induction required activation of postsynaptic Ca2+ channels and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and was prevented by the blockage of postsynaptic Ca2+ transients. Thus, our results suggest that BDNF-mediated LTP is induced postsynaptically. Our finding that dendritic spines are the exclusive synaptic sites for rapid BDNF-evoked Ca2+ signaling supports this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2005528863,"Type III secreted “effector” proteins of bacterial pathogens play central roles in virulence, yet are notoriously difficult to identify. We used an in vivo genetic screen to identify 13 effectors secreted by the type III apparatus (called Hrp, for “hypersensitive response and pathogenicity”) of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae . Although sharing little overall homology, the amino-terminal regions of these effectors had strikingly similar amino acid compositions. This feature facilitated the bioinformatic prediction of 38 P. syringae effectors, including 15 previously unknown proteins. The secretion of two of these putative effectors was shown to be type III–dependent. Effectors showed high interstrain variation, supporting a role for some effectors in adaptation to different hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2108623931,"Siderophore-mediated acquisition systems facilitate iron uptake. We present the crystallographic structure of the integral outer membrane receptor FecA from Escherichia coli with and without ferric citrate at 2.5 and 2.0 angstrom resolution. FecA is composed of three distinct domains: the barrel, plug, and NH 2 -terminal extension. Binding of ferric citrate triggers a conformational change of the extracellular loops that close the external pocket of FecA. Ligand-induced allosteric transitions are propagated through the outer membrane by the plug domain, signaling the occupancy of the receptor in the periplasm. These data establish the structural basis of gating for receptors dependent on the cytoplasmic membrane protein TonB. By compiling available data for this family of receptors, we propose a mechanism for the energy-dependent transport of siderophores."
https://openalex.org/W2162194950,"Synthetic amphiphiles are widely used as a carrier system. However, to match transfection efficiencies as obtained for viral vectors, further insight is required into the properties of lipoplexes that dictate transfection efficiency, including the mechanism of delivery. Although endocytosis is often referred to as the pathway of lipoplex entry and transfection, its precise nature has been poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that lipoplex-mediated transfection is inhibited by more than 80%, when plasma membrane cholesterol is depleted with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Cholesterol replenishment restores the transfection capacity. Investigation of the cellular distribution of lipoplexes after cholesterol depletion revealed an exclusive inhibition of internalization, whereas cell-association remained unaffected. These data strongly support the notion that complex internalization, rather than the direct translocation of plasmid across the plasma membrane, is a prerequisite for accomplishing effective lipoplex-mediated transfection. We demonstrate that internalized lipoplexes colocalize with transferrin in early endocytic compartments and that lipoplex internalization is inhibited in potassium-depleted cells and in cells overexpressing dominant negative Eps15 mutants. In conjunction with the notion that caveolae-mediated internalization can be excluded, we conclude that efficient lipoplex-mediated transfection requires complex internalization via the cholesterol-dependent clathrin-mediated pathway of endocytosis.

Currently, several carrier systems, including those based on synthetic cationic amphiphiles, are exploited for delivery of DNA constructs into cells for cell biological or therapeutic purposes. Compared with viral vectors, the transfection efficiency with most of the amphiphilic carriers (“lipoplexes”) is still relatively low. However, because the latter offer considerable advantages over the former in terms of biological inertness, health risks, and large scale production, efforts are ongoing to improve their effectiveness of delivery. To achieve this goal it will be imperative to carefully define their mechanism of cellular entry. In fact, the mechanism of uptake of cationic amphiphilic gene carriers by cells is still a matter of debate. Early work suggested that cationic amphiphile-DNA complexes could enter the cell via fusion with the plasma membrane (1Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P.

Although attractive given its membranous nature, lipid mixing assays did not reveal a correlation between fusion events of lipoplexes with cellular membranes and their transfection efficiency (2Zhou X.

Next to fusion, a mechanism that involves internalization via endocytosis has received most support thus far (6Wrobel I. Collins D. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the precise effect of a certain metabolic inhibitor is often difficult to interpret because both attenuation and diminution of transfection efficiency have been reported, while using one and the same inhibitor (6Wrobel I.

An additional complication of the use of several of these inhibitors is that some of these compounds perturb processes following the actual internalization of the DNA construct or plasmid into cells. The goal of the present work was to more accurately define the involvement per se and nature of the endocytic process in accomplishing cationic amphiphile-mediated DNA delivery. To this end, transfection was determined following cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) 1The abbreviations used are: MβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinDOPEdioleoylphosphatidylethanolamineEps15epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15)HBSSHanks' balance salt solutionGFPgreen fluorescence proteinCDCHOLcyclodextrin-cholesterol complexN-Rh-PEN-lissamine rhodamine B phosphatidylethanolamineBodipy-LacCerBodipy-lactosylceramideRTroom temperatureTftransferrinFIIIfilipin IIISAINTsynthetic amphiphile international (14Kilsdonk E.P.C.

As has been recently shown, cholesterol depletion, as accomplished in this manner, results in the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis is much less affected. It was demonstrated that the decrease in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is caused by the disability of coated pits to invaginate and detach from the plasma membrane (17Rodal S.K. Skretting G.

Because MβCD treatment of cells, next to an interference of coated pit organization, may potentially interfere with the internalization via caveolae as well, the effect of two additional drugs, filipin III and chlorpromazine, were tested to differentiate between the involvement of either type of endocytosis (non-coated pit (caveolae) versus coated pit (clathrin-dependent)). In addition, colocalization studies with transferrin, which is internalized via the clathrin-coated endocytic pathway, were carried out. Moreover, the effects of potassium depletion and expression of dominant negative mutants of Eps15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15) on lipoplex internalization were investigated, both treatments modulating the pathway of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (21Larkin J.M.

Our data demonstrate that SAINT-2/DOPE-mediated transfection of cells requires prior internalization and that effective transfection depends on cellular entry of the complex via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Lipoplexes were prepared in serum-free cell culture medium. An equal volume of a 2 μg/ml plasmid DNA solution (pEGFP-N1, CLONTECH) was added to a 30 μm solution of SAINT-2/DOPE (1:1) liposomes, resulting in the formation of lipoplexes with a molar charge ratio of 2.5:1 (cationic lipid:DNA). SAINT-2 was synthesized as described in detail elsewhere (24Meekel A.A.P. Wagenaar A. Smisterova J. Kroeze J.E. Haadsma P. Bosgraaf B. Stuart M.C.A Brisson A. Ruiters M.H.J. Hoekstra D. Engberts J.B.F.N. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 4: 665-673Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar); DOPE was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). One day before transfection, COS7 cells were seeded into 6-wells plates at 3 × 105 cells per well. Prior to transfection, cells were depleted of cholesterol (see below) and/or washed once with HBSS (Calbiochem). 1 ml of the lipoplex solution (15 nmol of lipid, 1 μg of pDNA) was added per well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then the transfection medium was replaced by cell culture medium. After 24 h the medium was refreshed, whereas after another 24 h the cells were screened for GFP-reporter gene expression by FACS-analysis (Elite, Coulter; λex. 488 nm, λem. 530 nm; 5000 events). COS7 cells were incubated with a 10 mm MβCD solution in serum-free cell culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Lovastatin (1 μg/ml), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, was added, during both cholesterol depletion and subsequent transfection, to prevent refill of the depleted plasma membrane cholesterol pool by newly synthesized cholesterol. Alternatively, plasma membrane cholesterol was bound by the pentaene macrolide antibiotic filipin III (1 μg/ml, 1 h, 37 °C), which was kept present during the entire transfection. To investigate the reversibility of the effect of cholesterol depletion with MβCD on the transfection efficiency with lipoplexes, we replenished cellular cholesterol prior to transfection according to two protocols. First, following cholesterol depletion, replenishment of the cellular cholesterol pool was allowed to occur via de novo biosynthesis by incubating the cells overnight with complete (serum-containing) cell culture medium prior to transfection. Alternatively, cholesterol was repleted exogenously by incubation with a cyclodextrin-cholesterol complex (CDCHOL) in the presence of lovastatin for 1.5 h at 37 °C. CDCHOL was made as described by Klein et al. (25Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125 mg of MβCD was dissolved in 2.5 ml of millipore water. 3.75 mg of cholesterol (in chloroform) was added in small aliquots to the MβCD solution under continuous stirring in a water bath at 75 °C. After complete dissolution of the cholesterol, the solution was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried overnight. The remaining powder was dissolved in 0.94 ml of HBSS to make a CDCHOL stock solution containing 4 mg/ml cholesterol. Cells were incubated with CDCHOL (400 μg/ml cholesterol) by diluting the stock solution in serum-free cell culture medium. To quantify the amount of cell-associated and internalized lipoplexes in control and cholesterol-depleted COS7 cells, we included14C-labeled SAINT-2, prepared as described elsewhere (26Zuhorn I.S. Visser W.H. Bakowsky U. Engberts J.B.F.N. Hoekstra D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 78207: 1-12Google Scholar) (specific activity: 8 × 105 dpm/ml), in the initial liposome formulation. After 1–4 h of incubation with lipoplexes cells were treated with CellScrub buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to remove surface-associated lipoplexes. In a control experiment (not shown), we determined, using this procedure, that 85–90% of the cell-associated lipoplex fraction could be removed following an incubation at 4 °C. The fractions of associated (CellScrub buffer supernatants) and internalized lipoplexes (cellular fraction, collected by trypsinization) were counted in a scintillation counter. To follow the effect of cholesterol depletion on the internalization of lipoplexes by COS7 cells, 0.5 mol% of the fluorescent lipid N-lissamine rhodamine B phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Rh-PE) was included in the initial liposome formulation. After 1 h of incubation with lipoplexes, the cells (grown on coverslips) were washed twice with HBSS and examined with an Olympus fluorescence microscope. To distinguish between extracellularly and intracellularly localized lipoplexes, the samples were incubated in a 0.2% trypan blue solution in HBSS (10 min, RT) to quench extracellular fluorescence. To determine the efficiency of the inhibitory effect of filipin III treatment on caveolar functioning, we followed its effect on the internalization of Bodipy-LacCer, a sphingolipid that is internalized via caveolae (27Puri V. Watanabe R. Deep Singh R. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To this end, COS7 cells were incubated with filipin III for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by an incubation with 3 μm Bodipy-LacCer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in serum-free medium in the presence of filipin III (30 min at 10 °C). The cells were subsequently washed with cold HBSS and transferred to 37 °C for 5 min, followed by “back exchange” (six washes for 10 min in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in HBSS at 10 °C) to remove extracellular lipid. Fluorescence images were taken with an Olympus camera. The amount of intracellular fluorescence was quantified using computer software (Scionimage, Scion Corp.). 7–10 fields of ∼10 cells/field/condition were analyzed. After 1 h of transfection, cells were first fixed for 30 min at RT in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were rinsed trice in the same buffer with 6.8% sucrose and subsequently postfixed in 1% OsO4/1.5% K4Fe(CN)6 followed by an en bloc staining with 1% uranyl acetate in water. For visualization of clathrin-coated vesicles, cells were fixed for 1 h at RT in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 1% sucrose, pH 7.4. Subsequently, cells were stained with 2% tannic acid and 1% uranyl acetate. After rinsing followed by dehydration in graded alcohol series, the cells were finally embedded in Epon 812 and polymerized 4 days at 45 °C. Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined using a Philips CM 100 electron microscope operating at 60 kV, and micrographs were taken. COS7 cells grown on coverslips were incubated with N-Rh-PE-labeled (0.25 mol%) lipoplexes (30 min, 37 °C), extensively washed with HBSS, and subsequently incubated with fluorescein-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation with transferrin, the cells were washed with HBSS (4 °C) and kept on ice until examination by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2, Germany;N-Rh-PE-lipoplexes: λex 543 nm, λem 600–700 nm; fluorescein-transferrin: λex 488 nm, λem 500–530 nm). Settings were chosen such that no red signal was visible in the green channel and vice versa. COS7 cells were rinsed with K+-free buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml d-glucose, pH 7.4) and subsequently rinsed for 5 min with hypotonic buffer (K+-free buffer diluted 1:1 with distilled water). Cells were then washed three times with K+-free buffer and incubated with N-Rh-PE-labeled lipoplexes in K+-free buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Extracellular fluorescence was quenched by incubation in trypan blue prior to examination by fluorescence microscopy, as described above. As a control, cells were incubated with lipoplexes in a similar buffer containing 10 mm KCl. The amount of intracellular fluorescence was quantified using Scionimage. 7–10 fields of ∼10 cells/field/condition were analyzed. EH21, DIII, and D3Δ2 GFP-constructs were a kind gift from Alexandre Benmerah and Alice Dautry-Varsat (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). COS7 cells were transfected with the above-mentioned constructs as described under “Lipoplex Preparation and Transfection.” Two days after transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with N-Rh-PE-labeled lipoplex. After quenching of extracellular fluorescence with trypan blue, the amount of internalized lipoplex was measured by fluorescence microscopy and quantified using Scionimage (7–10 fields of ∼10 cells/field/condition). As shown previously (5Oberle V. Bakowsky U. Zuhorn I.S. Hoekstra D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1447-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Audouy S. Molema G. de Ley L. Hoekstra D. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) COS7 cells are readily transfected with SAINT-2/DOPE lipoplexes, giving rise to transfection efficiencies as high as 80–90%. When the cells had been depleted of cholesterol, as accomplished by treatment with 10 mm MβCD for 1 h prior to transfection, the efficiency, expressed as a percentage of GFP reporter gene-expressing cells, decreased by more than 80% (Fig. 1 a). Lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, was included in the incubation medium during the incubation with lipoplexes to prevent de novo synthesis of cholesterol and re-supply of the extracted pool. Transfection in the presence of lovastatin per se, i.e. without depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with MβCD, resulted only in a minor decrease in transfection efficiency (∼10%, data not shown), implying that the inhibition of transfection efficiency specifically relates to cholesterol depletion. Depletion of cellular plasma membranes of cholesterol in this manner has been specifically associated with an interference of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (17Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred Ø. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 18Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Because the disappearance of cholesterol-rich caveolae cannot be excluded, the next set of experiments were aimed at obtaining further insight into the mechanism by which lipoplexes were internalized by cultured cells. To examine whether cholesterol depletion might have affected the extent of interaction of lipoplexes with the cells, which could consequently have led to a diminished internalization and, presumably, transfection, we compared the amount of cell surface-associated radiolabeled lipoplexes in cholesterol-depleted and untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 2, irrespective of MβCD treatment there was no difference in the total cell-associated fractions of lipoplexes. However, after subsequent treatment with CellScrub buffer, the amount of internalized lipoplexes (see “Materials and Methods”) in cholesterol-depleted cells was substantially reduced. Thus, over an incubation period of 4 h, an inhibition of complex internalization of ∼60–70% was seen after cholesterol removal. To further characterize the effect of cholesterol depletion on cellular processing of the lipoplexes, we monitored their fate by fluorescence microscopy, using N-Rh-PE-labeled lipoplexes. As shown in Fig. 3, following cholesterol depletion of COS7 cells with MβCD, a typical chain-like accumulation of lipoplexes at the cell surface became visible. Also note that the morphology of cells depleted of cholesterol was changed from a round to a more jagged shape, as noted before (18Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). After incubation with trypan blue, which quenches accessible rhodamine fluorescence and does not penetrate viable cells, the typical chain-like staining at the cell surface disappeared, consistent with their surface localization. As anticipated, compared with control cells, cholesterol-depleted cells showed a considerable decrease in intracellularly accumulated fluorescence (Fig. 3, C versus D), which is entirely consistent with the data obtained when quantifying the intracellular fraction, as determined by radiolabeling (Fig. 2). Moreover, electron micrographs of cholesterol-depleted COS7 cells further confirmed the strong reduction in intracellularly localized complexes, implying that cholesterol depletion inhibited complex internalization. Thus as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (E and F), the cytoplasm of untreated cells revealed the presence of numerous endosomal structures containing electron-dense internalized material (presumably representing internalized lipoplexes), whereas most cholesterol-depleted cells were virtually devoid of such structures. When cells were investigated early after the onset of transfection (10 min) electron-dense material was detectable in coated vesicles (Fig. 4, B,F, and G), whereas in non-transfected cells the coated vesicles appeared empty (A, D, and E). Strikingly, in transfected cells the coated vesicles were more abundant and often localized in clusters compared with their appearance in non-transfected cells (cf. Fig. 4,A and B). Cells that were depleted of cellular cholesterol prior to incubation with lipoplex showed flat-coated pits (Fig. 4 C), consistent with data presented by other laboratories (17Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred Ø. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 18Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E.

In control cells (A, D,E) coated vesicles are conspicuously devoid of any electron-dense material. By contrast, in transfected cells (B, F, G) coated vesicles often appear in clusters, are more abundant than in control cells, and contain electron-dense material. In MβCD-treated cells (C) flat-coated pits could be visualized. The scale bar in A also applies to B and C and represents 1355 nm. The scale bar in D also applies to E, F, and G and represents 205 nm. Arrows indicate coated pits and vesicles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, the data demonstrate that cholesterol depletion following treatment of the cells with MβCD resulted in an extensive decrease (60–70%) in the internalization of lipoplexes, without affecting the total cell-association fraction. As a consequence, a dramatic decrease in transfection efficiency (approximately 80%) was observed. These data imply that to accomplish productive transfection, the plasmid requires prior internalization, rather than that it gains direct cytosolic excess by crossing the plasma membrane. To investigate whether the transfection efficiency after cholesterol depletion with MβCD was lowered due to the absence of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, we next examined whether the effect of cholesterol depletion on transfection efficiency was reversible. To this end we took advantage of the fact that cholesterol can be transferred to cells via preformed cyclodextrin-cholesterol complexes because of the natural preference of cholesterol to partition into a phospholipid-rich environment (e.g. the plasma membrane) (28Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 a, by incubating cholesterol-depleted cells with a preformed cyclodextrin-cholesterol complex in the presence of lovastatin we were able to restore the level of transfection efficiency up to 85% of that obtained for non-treated cells. Alternatively, restoration of plasma membrane cholesterol content via de novo synthesis, following an overnight incubation of the cells in serum-containing medium (endogenous), also led to an essentially complete recovery of the transfection efficiency. In light of previous studies on the effect of cholesterol depletion and re-supply on endocytosis, showing an inhibition and recovery of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ligands like transferrin (Tf) and epidermal growth factor, respectively (17Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred Ø. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar,18Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), the data obtained thus far would similarly support a mechanism that would involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a critical step in the mechanism of lipoplex-mediated transfection. To obtain further support for such a mechanism, we therefore verified in the present system the processing of Tf and determined whether the lipoplexes colocalized with this ligand in early endocytic compartments. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), cholesterol depletion inhibits internalization of Tf uptake in COS7 cells, as clearly revealed by the distinct (fluorescent) membrane boundary, apparent in cholesterol-extracted cells (Fig. 5 B), indicating that Tf internalization, but not binding, was inhibited. Hence these data imply that cholesterol depletion inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in COS7 cells. To examine the fate of the lipoplexes relative to that of Tf, we first incubated the cells with N-Rh-PE-labeled lipoplexes for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were labeled with fluorescein-labeled transferrin for 5 min. Fig. 5 C shows the merged image of confocal microscopy scans for N-Rh-PE-lipoplex and fluorescein-transferrin. Because transferrin (∼80 kDa) is much smaller than the average lipoplex (around 200 nm) Fig. 5 D is included to facilitate visualization of the small yellow dots, indicating colocalization of transferrin and lipoplex. Is it realistic to assume that complexes with sizes as large as up to 200 nm can be accommodated in clathrin-coated vesicles? Although coated vesicles in neuronal synapses typically have a size of 70–90 nm, coated vesicles that mediate receptor uptake can reach sizes up to 200 nm (29Crowther R.A. Finch J.T. Pearse B.M. J.

The purpose of our study was to determine whether there is altered regulation of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in the diabetic kidney and whether SREBPs mediate the abnormal renal lipid metabolism and diabetic renal disease. In streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat, there were marked increases in SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression, resulting in increased triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin prevented the increased renal expression of SREBP-1 and the accumulation of TG. The role of hyperglycemia in the up-regulation of SREBP-1 was confirmed in renal cells cultured in a high glucose media. High glucose induced increased expression of SREBP-1a and -1c mRNA, SREBP-1 protein, and FAS, resulting in increased TG content. To determine a direct role for SREBP in mediating the increase in renal lipids and glomerulosclerosis, we studied SREBP-1a transgenic mice with increased renal expression of SREBP-1. The increase in SREBP-1 was associated with increased expression of FAS and acetyl CoA carboxylase, resulting in increased TG content, increased expression of transforming growth factor β1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria. Our study therefore indicates that renal SREBP-1 expression is increased in diabetes and that SREBP-1 plays an important role in the increased lipid synthesis, TG accumulation, mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria by increasing the expression of transforming growth factor β and vascular endothelial growth factor.

Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of cardiovascular and renal disease in the United States and most of the world. In the United States, diabetes mellitus now accounts for more than 50% of the patients who develop end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or transplantation for the maintenance of life (1National Institutes of HealthUSRDS 1999 Annual Data Report. National Institutes of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, MD1999Google Scholar). In addition to the prominent role played by hypertension, hyperglycemia, growth factors (including angiotensin II, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, 1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorFASfatty acid synthaseTGtriglycerideSTZstreptozotocinMCTmurine cortical tubuleTBSTris-buffered salinePASperiodic acid SchiffECMextracellular matrixHGhigh glucoseLGlow (normal) glucoseTgSREBP-1aSREBP-1a transgenicWTwild-typeMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorFASfatty acid synthaseTGtriglycerideSTZstreptozotocinMCTmurine cortical tubuleTBSTris-buffered salinePASperiodic acid SchiffECMextracellular matrixHGhigh glucoseLGlow (normal) glucoseTgSREBP-1aSREBP-1a transgenicWTwild-typeMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and advanced glycation end products, abnormal lipid metabolism, and renal accumulation of lipids have also been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (2Keane W.F.

Since the description by Kimmelstiel and Wilson (4Kimmelstiel P. Wilson C. Am. J. Pathol. 1936; 12: 83-98PubMed Google Scholar) of the classical nodular glomerulosclerosis and presence of lipid deposits in the diabetic kidney, several investigators have shown the presence of lipid deposits in the kidneys of diabetic humans and experimental animals, and they have proposed that these deposits may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (5Guijarro C. Kasiske B.L. Kim Y. O'Donnell M.P. Lee H.S. Keane W.F. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 152-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Lee H.S. Lee J.S. Koh H.I. Ko K.W. Clin. Nephrol. 1991; 36: 67-75PubMed Google Scholar). The major assumption has been that these lipid deposits originate solely from increased levels of serum lipids. However, the possibility of an increase in renal lipid synthesis also resulting in renal lipid accumulation has not been entertained. Furthermore, whether the accumulation of lipids per se may mediate diabetic renal disease also has not been directly determined. transforming growth factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein vascular endothelial growth factor fatty acid synthase triglyceride streptozotocin murine cortical tubule Tris-buffered saline periodic acid Schiff extracellular matrix high glucose low (normal) glucose SREBP-1a transgenic wild-type 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid transforming growth factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein vascular endothelial growth factor fatty acid synthase triglyceride streptozotocin murine cortical tubule Tris-buffered saline periodic acid Schiff extracellular matrix high glucose low (normal) glucose SREBP-1a transgenic wild-type 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that regulate fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. SREBPs belong to basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family and activate the entire program of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in liver (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 8Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). SREBPs are synthesized as ≈1150-amino acid precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar). To be activated, the NH2-terminal segment must be released from the membrane by a sequential two-step cleavage process (9Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). After the second cleavage, the ≈500-amino acid NH2-terminal segment of SREBP is released from the membrane and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to enhancer regions of target genes to activate transcription. Currently, there are three SREBP isoforms that have been identified and characterized (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 11Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and -1c are derived from a single gene through the use of alternative transcription start sites that produce alternate forms of exon 1 (12Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A., Wu, J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The third SREBP isoform, SREBP-2, is derived from a separate gene and is ≈45% identical to SREBP-1a (13Hua X. Yokoyama C., Wu, J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In most cultured cell lines, the predominant SREBP-1 isoform is SREBP-1a (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In contrast, in most animal tissues, SREBP-1c is the predominant SREBP-1 isoform (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 have different relative effects on target genes. SREBP-1 preferentially activates genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, including acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (FAS), whereas SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis such as hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthase, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase (15Pai J.

The proteolytic process can be blocked by sterols and activated by sterol depletion (9Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Because SREBPs play important roles in the regulation of lipid homeostasis, altered regulation of this transcription factor may be involved in diabetic nephropathy by modulating renal lipid metabolism. In the present study, we found that in streptozotocin-induced diabetes, a type I diabetes model characterized by hyperglycemia and no changes in serum lipids, SREBP-1 expression was increased in the kidney cortex, resulting in up-regulation of enzymes responsible for fatty acid synthesis and, as a consequence, high renal triglyceride content, and was associated with mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin to correct the hyperglycemia prevented the increase in renal expression of SREBP-1 and the renal accumulation of triglyceride. The effect of hyperglycemia per se on up-regulation of SREBP-1 was confirmed in a cell culture model, in which we demonstrated that high glucose levels stimulated the expression of both SREBP-1a and -1c, which in turn augmented expression of FAS and acetyl CoA carboxylase, resulting in a higher triglyceride content. To directly prove a role of SREBP-1 in renal disease, we studied the SREBP-1a transgenic mice that overexpress the transcriptionally active form of SREBP-1a in kidney, adipose tissue, and liver (24Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Although they have decreased serum glucose and triglyceride levels, these mice have an elevated renal content of triglycerides, increased expression of TGF-β1 and VEGF, mesangial expansion, accumulation of the extracellular matrix proteins type IV collagen and fibronectin, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria. We therefore propose that activation of renal SREBP-1 resulting in triglyceride accumulation plays a direct and an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against SREBP-1 and -2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-collagen type IV and anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sigma. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Chemiluminescence detection reagents were obtained from Pierce. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g; obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were housed in colony cages, maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed Teklad 4% Mouse/Rat Diet 7001 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets (Madison, WI). Rats in the streptozotocin (STZ) group were injected intravenously with 60 mg/kg body weight STZ in 50 mm sodium citrate solution (pH 4.5), and rats in the control group were injected with 50 mm sodium citrate solution. Tail vein blood glucose levels were measured every day, and animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after the induction of diabetes. One group of STZ rats was treated with regular and neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin to achieve normal glucose levels. For these experiments, we studied 12 control rats, 12 STZ rats, and 12 STZ rats treated with insulin. Transgenic mice overexpressing amino acids 1–460 of human SREBP-1a under the control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylkinase promoter have been described previously (24Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). All mice were housed in colony cages with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and maintained on Teklad 6% (w/w) Mouse/Rat Diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets. For these experiments, we studied eight male SREBP-1a transgenic mice and eight littermate male wild-type mice. Murine cortical tubule (MCT) cells were a kind gift from Fuad Ziyadeh (University of Pennsylvania). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 4 mmglutamine, with a normal d-glucose concentration of 100 mg/dl. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passed every 3 days by trypsinization. For experiments, cells at 80% confluence were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 mg/dl glucose (normal glucose) or 450 mg/dl glucose (high glucose) for 24–48 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and scraped with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.6). Kidney cortex was homogenized in the same buffer. To prepare membrane fractions, cell lysates or tissue homogenates were passed through a 25-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Pellets were incubated under constant shaking for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected as membrane fraction. To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were scraped into ice-cold 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, passed through a 21-gauge needle, and incubated on ice for 15 min. Kidney cortex for this purpose was homogenized in the same buffer. Nuclei were harvested by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min), the pellet was washed twice with the above-mentioned buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin), and nuclear protein was extracted with 0.3m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C for 1 h. The chromatin material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and stored at −70 °C. All protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% w/v), as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% dried milk in TBST (0.2% Tween 20 in 1× TBS), incubated in the respective primary antibodies (the antibody titer was optimized for each antibody) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution), washed four times with 1× TBS, and then developed using the chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Total RNA was isolated as described previously (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was obtained to quantify and assess the purity of the RNA fraction. cDNA probes were made using a digoxigenin labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and hybridizations were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. A plasmid containing fragments of SREBP-1a and -1c was linearized with Hin dIII, and antisense RNA probe was synthesized using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNase protection assays were performed with a kit from Ambion according to the manufacturer's protocol. Totals lipids were extracted from 100 mg of tissue by the method of Folch et al. (28Folch J.M. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contents of triglyceride and cholesterol were measured with respective kits from Sigma. Rats and mice were anesthetized and perfused at a pressure of 180 mm Hg through the abdominal aorta with a fixative buffer that consisted of 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% picric acid in a 6:4 mixture of cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4; adjusted to 300 mosmol with sucrose) and 10% hydroxyethyl starch. After 5 min of fixation, the rats were perfused for an additional 5 min with the cacodylate buffer. Paraffin sections were stained for (a) hematoxylin and eosin and (b) PAS. Frozen sections were used for Oil-Red O staining to determine the renal accumulation of neutral fats (29Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The stained kidney sections were imaged with an Olympus microscope and scored semiquantitatively in a blinded manner by the renal pathologist. For immunofluorescence, frozen sections were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 3% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100. They were then covered overnight at 4 °C with the type IV collagen or fibronectin antibody diluted 1:200 in the preincubation solution. The sections were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were mounted using DAKO-Glycergel™ (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) plus 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-{2.2.2}-octane (DABCO; Sigma) as a fading retardant. The kidney sections were then imaged with a Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 410). Results are presented as the means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Dunnett's or Student-Newman-Keuls tests for multiple comparisons or by Student's t-test for unpaired data; statistical significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. To study the potential association between hyperglycemia and altered renal SREBP-1 expression and lipid metabolism in diabetes, we treated Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats with a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight). This dose resulted in an elevation of blood glucose levels the second day after injection (data not shown) that persisted for at least 2 weeks, at which point the animals were sacrificed. As shown in Table I, the glucose levels of streptozotocin-treated rats (469 ± 108 mg/dl) were markedly higher than those of the control animals (109 ± 11 mg/dl;p < 0.01). However, there were no significant changes in the serum lipid levels, including triglyceride, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein.Table IPhysiological parameters of control and STZ-treated ratsControl (n=8)STZ-treated (n = 8)pGlucose (mg/dl)109 ± 11469 ± 108<0.01Triglyceride (mg/dl)41 ± 1654 ± 10NS1-aNS, nonsignificant.Cholesterol (mg/dl)72 ± 1057 ± 6NSLDL (mg/dl)10.6 ± 4.18.0 ± 6NSVLDL (mg/dl)7.8 ± 3.710.8 ± 0.75NSUrine protein (mg/24 h)0.72 ± 0.023.4 ± 0.5<0.011-a NS, nonsignificant.

SREBPs are members of the basic helix-loop-helix zipper family of transcription factors (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 30Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), and they activate genes in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Because SREBP-1 is regulated by glucose at the level of transcription (21Repa J.J. Liang G., Ou, J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar), we asked whether accumulation of lipids in the glomeruli of STZ-treated rats was caused by activation of SREBP by glucose and subsequent up-regulation of genes responsible for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Immunoblotting of renal cortical homogenates revealed significant increases in both precursor (3-fold) and mature forms (2.0-fold) of SREBP-1 (Fig. 3 A). Because SREBP-1 is also activated by insulin, and Shimomura et al. (31Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) reported that SREBP-1 was down-regulated in livers of STZ-treated Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats due to the depletion of insulin, we also performed immunoblotting of liver homogenates in parallel with kidney homogenates. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both the precursor and mature form of SREBP-1 were significantly decreased in livers of STZ-treated animals, suggesting that the activation of this factor in kidney of STZ rats may be due to a tissue-specific effect of insulin deficiency and/or hyperglycemia. Immunoblotting with SREBP-2 antibody did not show any difference between kidney cortex homogenate from control and STZ-treated animals (Fig. 3 C). Increased expression of SREBP-1 was further confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 4 A). The mRNA abundance of important enzymes that mediate fatty acid synthesis (namely, FAS) was up-regulated, whereas acyl CoA oxidase, an enzyme involved in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, was not changed (Fig. 4 A). As a consequence of up-regulation of SREBP-1 and its target genes, we observed a higher content of triglyceride in the kidney cortex of experimental groups (Fig. 4 B). This result also correlated well with the Oil-Red O staining (Fig. 1). Renal cortical cholesterol levels did not differ between control and streptozotocin-treated rats (results not shown), consistent with the absence of a change in SREBP-2 expression (Fig. 3). To determine whether the above-mentioned renal changes in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats, including increased SREBP-1 expression, accumulation of neutral fat, and sclerosis of the kidney with increased matrix protein accumulation, were indeed mediated by insulin deficiency and the resulting hyperglycemia, we treated the STZ diabetic rats with insulin to achieve normal blood glucose levels. Insulin treatment resulted in prevention of increased renal SREBP-1 expression (Fig. 5 A), neutral fat accumulation (Fig. 1, bottom left panel), increased PAS staining (Fig. 1, bottom right panel), and matrix protein accumulation (Fig. 2, bottom panels). Insulin treatment also corrected the decreased SREBP-1 expression in the liver (Fig. 5 B). SREBP-1 and its target genes responsible for fatty acid synthesis were activated in the cortex of STZ-treated rats, a model of type I diabetes in which the major factor is hyperglycemia. To further elucidate the effect of high glucose levels per se on SREBP-1 and its target genes, we used a cell culture model. MCT cells derived from the mouse proximal tubule were cultured in media containing normal glucose levels (100 mg/dl; LG) or high glucose levels (450 mg/dl; HG), which is similar to the glucose levels in STZ-treated rats. We observed significant elevation of SREBP-1 protein in HG groups (Fig. 6 A) because both the precursor and mature form of this transcription factor were increased at 24 h. RNase protection assay using a probe that can detect both isoforms of SREBP-1 indicated that SREBP-1a and -1c were increased 3.2- and 4.4-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 B). A similar up-regulation of SREBP-1 was also observed in human mesangial cells cultured in high glucose media (Fig. 6 C). The increase in SREBP-1 mRNA and protein was associated with increased expression of FAS but not acyl CoA oxidase (Fig. 7 A). As a result, there was a 2.0-fold increase in the triglyceride content of cells cultured in high glucose media (Fig. 7 B). The results above strongly suggested that increased expression of SREBP-1 and stimulated fatty acid synthesis resulted in lipid accumulation and glomerulosclerosis in STZ diabetic rats. To directly address this possibility, we studied the kidneys of SREBP-1a transgenic (TgSREBP-1a) mice. Due to the ectopic expression of SREBP-1a mature forms, which ca"
https://openalex.org/W2053501816,"The serine/threonine protein kinase casein kinase I e (CKIe) is a key regulator of metazoan circadian rhythm. Genetic and biochemical data suggest that CKIe binds to and phosphorylates the PERIOD proteins. However, the PERIOD proteins interact with a variety of circadian regulators, suggesting the possibility that CKIe may interact with and phosphorylate additional clock components as well. We find that CRY1 and BMAL1 are phosphoproteins in cultured cells. Mammalian PERIOD proteins act as a scaffold with distinct domains that simultaneously bind CKIe and mCRY1 and mCRY2 (mCRY). mCRY is phosphorylated by CKIe only when both proteins are bound to mammalian PERIOD proteins. BMAL1 is also a substrate for CKIein vitro, and CKIe kinase activity positively regulates BMAL1-dependent transcription from circadian promoters in reporter assays. We conclude that CKIe phosphorylates multiple circadian substrates and may exert its effects on circadian rhythm in part by a direct effect on BMAL1-dependent transcription."

However, the potential role for ATM in regulating p53 modifications at other sites has not previously been explored.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies showed that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20 in response to IR is mediated by the ATM protein kinase and that these modifications are important for stabilizing and activating p53 as a transcription factor. We show here, for the first time, that phosphorylation of Ser9 and Ser46 also are dependent on the ATM kinase (Figs. 1 and 4). Phosphorylation of Ser46 was shown to be important for the induction of apoptosis in response to damage caused by exposure of epithelial-derived cell lines to UV light (6.Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T.

Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and HIPK2 (23.D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), both of which are activated after exposure of cells to UV light, have been described. In contrast to UV light, activation of p53 after exposure of epithelial cells to IR primarily induces cell cycle arrest in G1. However, human lymphoid and neuronal cells are much more sensitive to p53-dependent, IR-induced apoptosis, and both p53 and ATM are required for its induction (28.Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar,29.Pettitt A.R. Sherrington P.D. Stewart G. Cawley J.C. Taylor A.M.R. Stankovic T. Blood. 2001; 98: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We suggest that in lymphoid cells, activation of ATM in response to DNA double strand breaks mediates activation of an unidentified protein kinase that phosphorylates p53 at Ser46, possibly through recruitment of p53DINP1, the product of a recently identified p53-inducible gene that facilitates p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 in response to IR (30.Okamura S. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Nakanishi H. Taya Y. Monden M. Nakamura Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This protein kinase is unlikely to be p38 MAPK, which phosphorylates Ser46 in response to UV, since PD169316, a p38 kinase-specific inhibitor, failed to block phosphorylation of Ser46 (Fig. 2).We also found that ATM is required for phosphorylation of p53 at Ser9. We previously reported that Ser6 and Ser9 became strongly phosphorylated in response to both IR- and UV-induced DNA damage and suggested that Ser9 may be phosphorylated by CK1 in response to phosphorylation of Ser6 (13.Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Tong X.-H. Hong A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23199-23203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vitro CK1 phosphorylates serines and threonines two residues distal to a phosphorylated serine or threonine. The data presented here suggest that in response to IR, phosphorylation of Ser9 may be independent of phosphorylation at Ser6 and dependent upon activation of an unknown protein kinase by ATM. Thus, as for Ser20, the kinase that phosphorylates Ser9 in response to IR is likely to be activated by ATM. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that recognition of Ser9 by its kinase requires either Ser15 or its phosphorylation.The functional consequences of phosphorylation at Ser6 and Ser9 are unknown. Changing either serine to alanine had little effect on the ability of chimeric Gal4-p53(1–42) to activate transcription of a reporter in transient transfection assays (4.Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), consistent with a report that these and other N-terminal phosphorylations are not essential for p53 activity (31.Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H.G. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, coupled with our previous results (15.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) and those of others (4.Dumaz N. Meek D.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) showing that phosphorylation of Ser15 recruits CBP/p300 to p53, our current data (Fig. 3C) supports a cascade model in which phosphorylation at several N-terminal sites, of which phosphorylation of Ser15 appears to be most important, promotes acetylation at C-terminal sites (Fig. 4). Our data further suggest that the N-terminal region important for regulating p53 interactions with HATs includes the first 18 residues of human p53, since abrogation of phosphorylation by changing Ser20, Ser33, Ser37, and Ser46 to Ala did not affect C-terminal acetylation. While the double mutant L22Q/W23S also blocked C-terminal acetylation as did the equivalent mutations in mouse p53 (32.Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), these changes most likely profoundly affect the structure of the amphipathic helical region (amino acids 17–28) that is likely to be important for interactions with both HATs and MDM2 (33.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser6 and Ser9, along with phosphorylation of Thr18, may serve to amplify a primary signal initiated by the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Ser15 that is important for recruiting HATs to p53. We note, however, that changing Ser18 of mouse p53, the equivalent of human Ser15, to Ala did not block the acetylation of mouse p53 at Lys317 and Lys379, equivalent to human Lys320 and Lys382, respectively, in ES cells (34.Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of p53 acetylation through phosphorylation may not be equivalent in mice and humans. In response to DNA damage, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is phosphorylated on each of the seven serines and one threonine the in the first 50 amino acids of its N-terminal transactivation domain as well as at several sites in its carboxyl (C)-terminal tetramerization/regulatory domain (1.Appella E.

This protein kinase is unlikely to be p38 MAPK, which phosphorylates Ser46 in response to UV, since PD169316, a p38 kinase-specific inhibitor, failed to block phosphorylation of Ser46 (Fig. 2).We also found that ATM is required for phosphorylation of p53 at Ser9. We previously reported that Ser6 and Ser9 became strongly phosphorylated in response to both IR- and UV-induced DNA damage and suggested that Ser9 may be phosphorylated by CK1 in response to phosphorylation of Ser6 (13.Higashimoto Y.

Our data further suggest that the N-terminal region important for regulating p53 interactions with HATs includes the first 18 residues of human p53, since abrogation of phosphorylation by changing Ser20, Ser33, Ser37, and Ser46 to Ala did not affect C-terminal acetylation. While the double mutant L22Q/W23S also blocked C-terminal acetylation as did the equivalent mutations in mouse p53 (32.Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), these changes most likely profoundly affect the structure of the amphipathic helical region (amino acids 17–28) that is likely to be important for interactions with both HATs and MDM2 (33.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser6 and Ser9, along with phosphorylation of Thr18, may serve to amplify a primary signal initiated by the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Ser15 that is important for recruiting HATs to p53. We note, however, that changing Ser18 of mouse p53, the equivalent of human Ser15, to Ala did not block the acetylation of mouse p53 at Lys317 and Lys379, equivalent to human Lys320 and Lys382, respectively, in ES cells (34.Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of p53 acetylation through phosphorylation may not be equivalent in mice and humans. Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20 in response to IR is mediated by the ATM protein kinase and that these modifications are important for stabilizing and activating p53 as a transcription factor. We show here, for the first time, that phosphorylation of Ser9 and Ser46 also are dependent on the ATM kinase (Figs. 1 and 4). Phosphorylation of Ser46 was shown to be important for the induction of apoptosis in response to damage caused by exposure of epithelial-derived cell lines to UV light (6.Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T.

In contrast to UV light, activation of p53 after exposure of epithelial cells to IR primarily induces cell cycle arrest in G1. However, human lymphoid and neuronal cells are much more sensitive to p53-dependent, IR-induced apoptosis, and both p53 and ATM are required for its induction (28.Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar,29.Pettitt A.R. Sherrington P.D. Stewart G. Cawley J.C. Taylor A.M.R. Stankovic T. Blood. 2001; 98: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We suggest that in lymphoid cells, activation of ATM in response to DNA double strand breaks mediates activation of an unidentified protein kinase that phosphorylates p53 at Ser46, possibly through recruitment of p53DINP1, the product of a recently identified p53-inducible gene that facilitates p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 in response to IR (30.Okamura S. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Nakanishi H. Taya Y. Monden M. Nakamura Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This protein kinase is unlikely to be p38 MAPK, which phosphorylates Ser46 in response to UV, since PD169316, a p38 kinase-specific inhibitor, failed to block phosphorylation of Ser46 (Fig. 2). We also found that ATM is required for phosphorylation of p53 at Ser9. We previously reported that Ser6 and Ser9 became strongly phosphorylated in response to both IR- and UV-induced DNA damage and suggested that Ser9 may be phosphorylated by CK1 in response to phosphorylation of Ser6 (13.Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Tong X.-H. Hong A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23199-23203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vitro CK1 phosphorylates serines and threonines two residues distal to a phosphorylated serine or threonine. The data presented here suggest that in response to IR, phosphorylation of Ser9 may be independent of phosphorylation at Ser6 and dependent upon activation of an unknown protein kinase by ATM. Thus, as for Ser20, the kinase that phosphorylates Ser9 in response to IR is likely to be activated by ATM. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that recognition of Ser9 by its kinase requires either Ser15 or its phosphorylation. The functional consequences of phosphorylation at Ser6 and Ser9 are unknown. Changing either serine to alanine had little effect on the ability of chimeric Gal4-p53(1–42) to activate transcription of a reporter in transient transfection assays (4.Dumaz N. Meek D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2109994415,"Normal developmental events such as puberty, pregnancy, and parity influence the susceptibility of the mammary gland to tumorigenesis in both humans and rodent model systems. Unfortunately, constitutive transgenic mouse models that rely on mammary-specific promoters to control transgene expression have limited utility for studying the effect of developmental events on breast cancer risk since the hormonal signals governing these events also markedly influence transgene expression levels. A novel transgenic mouse system is described that uses the MMTV-LTR to drive expression of the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator rtTA. Transgenic mice expressing rtTA in the mammary epithelium were crossed with reporter lines bearing tet operator-controlled transgenes. We tested the ability to spatially, temporally, and quantitatively control reporter gene expression after administration of doxycycline to bitransgenic mice. Transgene expression using this system can be rapidly induced and deinduced, is highly mammary specific, can be reproducibly titrated over a wide range of expression levels, and is essentially undetectable in the uninduced state. Homogeneous transgene expression throughout the mammary epithelium can be achieved. This system permits transgene expression to be restricted to any desired stage of postnatal mammary gland development. We have developed a mammary-specific, doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse model for studying the effect of mammary gland development on transgene-mediated phenotypes. Unlike other mammary-specific, transgenic systems that have been described, this system combines spatially homogeneous transgene expression in the mammary epithelium during puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and involution with the use of an orally administered, inexpensive, and widely available inducing agent. This system offers new opportunities for the transgenic analysis of mammary gland biology in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2032492155,"Current models partition the primate visual system into dorsal (magno) and ventral (parvo, konio) streams. Perhaps the strongest evidence for this idea has come from the pattern of projections between the primary visual area (V1) and the second visual area (V2). Prior studies describe three distinct pathways: magno to thick stripes, parvo to pale stripes, and konio to thin stripes. We now demonstrate that V1 output arises from just two sources: patch columns and interpatch columns. Patch columns project to thin stripes and interpatch columns project to pale and thick stripes. Projection of interpatches to common V2 stripe types (pale and thick) merges parvo and magno inputs, making it likely that these functional channels are distributed strongly to both dorsal and ventral streams."
https://openalex.org/W2159386984,"During acute inflammation, leukocytes release proteolytic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but the physiopathological mechanisms and consequences of this process are not yet fully understood. Neutrophils, the predominant leukocyte type, produce neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) but not the tissue inhibitors of MMPs. After stimulation, these cells also activate MMPs chemically. In arthritic diseases, neutrophils undergo great chemoattraction to the synovium, are activated by interleukin-8, and are stimulated to release gelatinase B in vivo. Production levels and net activities of gelatinase B were found to be absent in degenerative osteoarthritis but significantly increased in rheumatoid arthritis. The cleavage sites in cartilage type II collagen by gelatinase B were determined by a combination of reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry analysis. The analysis revealed the site specificity of proline and lysine hydroxylations and O-linked glycosylation, the cleavage specificities by gelatinase B, and the preferential absence and presence of post-translational modifications at P2' and P5', respectively. Furthermore, gelatinase B leaves the immunodominant peptides intact, which are known from studies with (autoreactive) T cells. Lysine hydroxylation was detected at a critical position for T-cell activation. These data lend support to the thesis that extracellular proteolysis and other post-translational modifications of antigenic peptides may be critical in the establishment and perpetuation of autoimmune processes."
https://openalex.org/W2018484218,"Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) remove a specific adenine from 28S rRNA leading to inactivation of ribosomes and arrest of translation. Great interest as to a possible second physiological substrate for RIPs came from the observation that in vitro RIPs remove adenine from DNA. This paper addresses the problem of nuclear lesions induced by RIPs in human endothelial cells susceptible to the bacterial RIP Shiga toxin 1 and the plant RIP ricin. With both toxins, nuclear DNA damage as evaluated by two independent techniques (alkaline-halo assay and alkaline filter elution) appears early, concomitant with (ricin) or after (Shiga toxin 1) the inhibition of protein synthesis. At this time, the annexin V binding assay, caspase 3 activity, the formation of typical < or = 50 Kb DNA fragments, and changes in morphology associated with apoptosis were negative. Furthermore, a block of translation comparable to that induced by RIPs, but obtained with cycloheximide, did not induce nuclear damage. Such damage is consistent with the enzymatic activity (removal of adenine) of RIPs acting in vitro on RNA-free chromatin and DNA. The results unequivocally indicate that RIPs can damage nuclear DNA in whole cells by means that are not secondary to ribosome inactivation or apoptosis."

Elevating the gene dosage ofGRX1 or GRX2 increases resistance to hydroperoxides including hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide. The glutaredoxin-mediated resistance to hydroperoxides is dependent on the presence of an intact glutathione system, but does not require the activity of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (GPX1–3). Rather, the mechanism appears to be mediated via glutathione conjugation and removal from the cell because it is absent in strains lacking glutathione-S-transferases (GTT1,GTT2) or the GS-X pump (YCF1). We show that the yeast glutaredoxins can directly reduce hydroperoxides in a catalytic manner, using reducing power provided by NADPH, GSH, and glutathione reductase.

These ROS can cause wide-ranging damage to cells, and an oxidative stress is said to occur when the cellular survival mechanisms are unable to cope with the ROS or the damage they cause (1.Halliwell B.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). They form part of the glutaredoxin system, comprising NADPH, GSH, and glutathione reductase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to glutaredoxins via GSH (12.Holmgren A. Vina J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 146-154Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two glutaredoxins, designated Grx1 and Grx2, which share 40–52% identity and 61–76% similarity with those from bacterial and mammalian species (13.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In common with all classical glutaredoxins, the active sites of Grx1 and Grx2 contain two highly conserved redox-active cysteine residues. Strains deleted for both GRX1 and GRX2 are viable, but lack heat-stable oxidoreductase activity in experiments using β-hydroxyethylene disulfide as a model disulfide substrate. A new family of glutaredoxin-related proteins has been identified in yeast (GRX3–5) that is conserved throughout evolution from bacterial to mammalian species (14.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These glutaredoxin-like proteins differ from classical glutaredoxins in that they contain a single cysteine residue at their putative active sites. Thus, they would be unlikely to substitute for glutaredoxins or thioredoxins as oxidoreductases with substrates like ribonucleotide reductase, which require a dithiol mechanism (15.Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The triple mutant lacking all three isoforms (grx3–5) is inviable, and interestingly, agrx2 grx5 mutant is also inviable indicating that there may be some overlapping function between the two classes of glutaredoxins. Previous studies have shown that the yeast glutaredoxins are active as antioxidants and are required for protection against ROS. Mutants lacking the dithiol glutaredoxins are sensitive to oxidative stress conditions, and the grx1 mutant is hypersensitive to the superoxide anion (13.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, both grx1 andgrx2 mutants are sensitive to H2O2, with the grx2 mutant showing slightly higher sensitivity compared with the grx1 mutant. In addition, overexpression of GRX1 or GRX2 increased resistance to H2O2. Furthermore, the expression ofGRX1 and GRX2 is up-regulated in response to various stress conditions, including exposure to oxidants, with both genes regulated by stress-responsiveelements (STRE) (16.Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this present study, we investigated the antioxidant activity of the yeast glutaredoxins against hydroperoxides and show that they have glutathione peroxidase activity. This is the first evidence that glutaredoxins can protect against the damaging effects of ROS by directly reducing hydroperoxides.

Bound antibody was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) following incubation of the blot in donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). The peroxidase activity of Grx1 with H2O2, t-BH, and CHP was measured in vitro with purified Grx1. The components of the reaction mixture were NADPH (0.4 mm), GSH (1 mm), Glr1 (6 μg/ml), Grx1 (5 pmol), and varying concentrations of hydroperoxides in a reaction volume of 40 μl in 0.1 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4. Reactions were started by the addition of Grx1 and followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH using a microplate reader. In this assay, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) produced by the glutaredoxin catalyzed reduction of hydroperoxides is reduced by Glr1. Reactions are followed by the oxidation of NADPH, which is coupled to the reduction of GSSG to GSH by Glr1. PHGpx2 was assayed for glutathione peroxidase activity using 5 pmol of recombinant protein exactly as described for Grx1. The Reduction of CHP to cumyl alcohol by Grx1 was detected by HPLC analysis using a method described previously (19.Jacobson F.S. Morgan R.W. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 0.4 mm NADPH, 1 mm GSH, 6 μg/ml Glr1, Grx1 (5 pmol), and 0.25 mm CHP in a reaction volume of 500 μl. Control reactions were run in parallel either omitting Grx1 or GSH. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 500 μl of HPLC-grade ethyl acetate and 0.2 g of NaCl, followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation. The upper phase containing ethyl acetate, cumene hydroperoxide, and cumyl alcohol was removed and stored on ice prior to analysis. Reaction mixtures were separated using a Dionex Summit™ HPLC system with a Spherisorb octadecyl silane (2.Lefer D. Granger D. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) 5 μ of HPLC steel column (4.5 × 250 mm). Isocratic elution was performed using 35% acetonitrile in 5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The separation was followed at 254 nm. To further investigate the role of glutaredoxins in protection against oxidative stress, we examined the ability of glutaredoxin overexpression to increase resistance to hydroperoxides (Fig. 1). Overexpression ofGRX1 and GRX2 was achieved using multi-copy plasmids and was confirmed by means of Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 D). Resistance to H2O2 (Fig. 1 A), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH, Fig. 1 B) and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP, Fig. 1 C) was determined using dose-response curves following a 1 h exposure. Elevating the levels of Grx1 or Grx2 was found to increase the resistance of a wild-type strain to H2O2, and CHP compared with the vector alone control. Interestingly, overexpression of GRX1 increased resistance to t-BH, whereas, overexpression ofGRX2 had little or no effect. Thus, changes in the levels of glutaredoxins were found to affect the resistance of yeast cells to oxidative stress induced by hydroperoxides. To determine the mechanism of this glutaredoxin-mediated hydroperoxide resistance, we next examined its dependence on the components of the glutathione system. The effect of overexpressing GRX1 andGRX2 on resistance to hydroperoxides was examined in strains deleted for GSH1 or GLR1. GSH1 encodes γ−glutamylcysteine synthetase, the first enzyme in the GSH biosynthetic pathway (20.Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and GLR1 encodes glutathione reductase, which recycles oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to its reduced form (GSH) (21.Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Molec. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The gsh1 and glr1 mutants were sensitive to CHP compared with the wild-type strain, with the strain lacking GLR1 showing highest sensitivity (Fig. 2). Glutaredoxin-mediated resistance to hydroperoxides was dependent on the glutathione system because neither of the glutathione mutants with mcGRX1 or mcGRX2showed increased resistance to CHP. One key antioxidant function of GSH is as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidases. Yeast contains three phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (GPX1–3), which are required for resistance to oxidative stress induced by H2O2and t-BH (18.Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22.Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether these enzymes are required for the glutaredoxin-mediated resistance to hydroperoxides using a gpx1–3 triple mutant (Fig. 2). The strain deleted for GPX1–3 did not show increased sensitivity to CHP compared with the wild-type strain. In addition, mcGRX1 and mcGRX2 led to a 1.7-fold increase in resistance to CHP. This was slightly reduced compared with the wild-type strain (2-fold increase in resistance), but these data indicate that glutathione peroxidases are not essential for the glutaredoxin-mediated resistance to hydroperoxides. We next examined the requirement for other GSH-dependent enzymes in protection against hydroperoxides. Glutathione-S-transferases from mammalian systems can act as general hydroperoxidases catalyzing the breakdown of alkyl hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols (23.Zhao T. Singhal S. Piper J. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two genes encoding functional glutathione-S-transferases, designatedGTT1 and GTT2, have been identified in yeast (24.Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These enzymes form part of a xenobiotic detoxification pathway that catalyzes the formation of glutathione conjugates, which are removed to the vacuole via an ATP-dependent GS-X pump, encoded by YCF1 (25.Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of this system in hydroperoxide protection was tested by overexpressing GRX1and GRX2 in strains deleted for GTT1,GTT2, or YCF1 (Fig. 3). Loss of GTT1 orGTT2 did not affect the basal level of resistance to CHP. However, the increased resistance to CHP mediated by GRX1and GRX2 was completely abrogated in the gtt1 andgtt2 mutants. The ycf1 mutant was slightly more sensitive to CHP compared with the wild-type strain. Interestingly, overexpression of GRX1 or GRX2 in theycf1 mutant resulted in increased sensitivity to CHP compared with the vector alone control. This indicates that glutaredoxins may convert CHP to a product that is toxic in the absence of YCF1 (see “Discussion”). Overexpression ofGRX1 and GRX2 in the gtt1,gtt2, and ycf1 mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The requirement for GTT1,GTT2, and YCF1 indicates that glutaredoxin-mediated detoxification may involve the conjugation of hydroperoxides to GSH prior to their removal from the cell. However, given that Gtt1 does not contain a cysteine residue (24.Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that oxidoreductases such as Grx1 or Grx2 can directly affect the activity of the glutathione-S-transferases. We therefore tested whether the yeast glutaredoxins could directly reduce hydroperoxides prior to their removal by the GSH conjugation system. The ability of glutaredoxins to reduce hydroperoxides was tested in vitro using purified Grx1. Reaction mixtures contained GSH, Glr1, NADPH, and CHP (0.25 mm) and were started by the addition of Grx1 (Fig. 4 A). Reactions were followed by the oxidation of NADPH, which is coupled to the reduction of GSSG to GSH by Glr1. In the presence of all components of the assay, oxidation of NADPH was observed indicating that Grx1 can reduce CHP (Fig. 4 A). The reaction is dependent on the presence GSH, Glr1, NADPH, and Grx1 because there was little or no activity when each was omitted from the assay (Fig. 4 A). The reduction of CHP was analyzed using differing amounts of Grx1 (Fig. 4 B) and was found to show strict linearity confirming that Grx1 has efficient catalytic activity as a peroxidase. The ability of Grx1 to act as a general hydroperoxidase was investigated using varying concentrations of H2O2, t-BH, and CHP (Fig. 5 A). Grx1 could reduce all three hydroperoxides, and peroxidase activity was hyperbolic with respect to the concentration of peroxide used. Grx1 showed the greatest activity with H2O2 (V max= 110.2 μmol/min/mg), compared with t-BH (V max = 7.5 μmol/min/mg) and CHP (V max = 32.5 μmol/min/mg). To address the question of whether Grx1 is a good peroxidase enzyme, the activity of Grx1 was compared with the yeast PHGpx2 enzyme (Fig. 5 B). PHGpx2 was also able to reduce all three hydroperoxides and, similarly, showed the greatest activity with H2O2. Thein vitro peroxidase activity of Grx1 is comparable with that of the PHGpx2 glutathione peroxidase enzyme. Following the observation that Grx1 could reduce hydroperoxides, we used HPLC analysis to directly follow the conversion of CHP to the reduced product, cumyl alcohol (Fig. 6). The commercial CHP used in these studies was resolved as two peaks when chromatographed and contained a low level of cumyl alcohol. Incubation of 0.25 mm CHP with 5 pmol of Grx1 for 1 h resulted in an increase in the peak corresponding to cumyl alcohol, confirming that Grx1 could reduce CHP to cumyl alcohol. The reaction was shown to be Grx1- and GSH-dependent because there was no accumulation of cumyl alcohol in their absence (Fig. 6, B andC). Oxidative damage poses a very great risk to the survival of cells because it can undermine cellular structures including DNA, proteins, and lipids (26.Frankenberg D. Frankenberg-Schwanger M. Harbich R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 64: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27.Levine R. Williams J. Stadtman E. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar, 28.Morados-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Molec. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 29.Steels E.L. Learmonth R.P. Watson K. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this present study, we have extended our original observation that glutaredoxins are required for protection against oxidative stress (13.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In particular, glutaredoxins were found to play an important role in protecting cells against the damaging effects of hydroperoxides including H2O2,t-BH, and CHP. In addition, Grx1 and Grx2 may have some different functions, at least for the case of t-BH, since overexpression of GRX1 increased resistance tot-BH, whereas overexpression of GRX2 had no effect. Similarly, a strain lacking GRX1 is more sensitive to t-BH than a strain lacking GRX2 (data not shown) indicating that Grx1 may be more important than Grx2 for protection against this oxidant. Previous work has also indicated that the two glutaredoxin isoforms in yeast may play distinct roles. Differential gene expression of GRX1 and GRX2 in response to stress conditions was taken as evidence that the glutaredoxins are required during different growth and stress conditions, which may account for their apparent redundancy (16.Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins from higher eukaryotes have been shown to act as antioxidants both in the regulation of other antioxidant enzymes and in a more general way as oxidoreductases. For example, in vitrostudies have shown that both the glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems can serve as electron donors for human plasma (selenium-dependent) glutathione peroxidase (30.Bjornstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeastS. cerevisiae uniquely expresses three phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases and does not appear to posses any glutathione peroxidases (18.Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although PHGpx1–3 are involved in the detoxification of hydroperoxides (18.Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22.Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), they were not required for the glutaredoxin-mediated antioxidant function. Ascorbic acid is another key antioxidant, which can detoxify hydrogen peroxide and other forms of ROS. Mammalian glutaredoxins can catalyze the GSH-dependent regeneration of ascorbic acid from its oxidized dehydroascorbate form (31.Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Park J.B. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33.Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether the yeast glutaredoxins can function in a similar manner, and only the five-carbon analogue, erythroascorbic acid, has been detected in yeast (34.Kim H.S. Seib P.A. Chung O.K. J. Food. Sci. 1993; 58: 845-862Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35.Nick J.A. Leung C.T. Loewus F.A. Plant. Sci. 1986; 46: 181-187Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mammalian glutaredoxins have also been shown to catalyze the cleavage of mixed disulfides in vitro, which may serve to protect cells by reducing any mixed disulfides formed during exposure to oxidative stress conditions (36.Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, a correlation between protein-SSG reduction and glutaredoxin activity has been demonstrated in mammalian cells (37.Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and the reversibleS-glutathiolation of HIV-1 protease can be catalyzed by a glutaredoxin in vitro (38.Davis D.A. Newcomb F.M. Starke D.W. Ott D.E. Mieyal J.J. Yarchoan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25935-25940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly, the yeast glutaredoxins Grx1 and Grx2 can reduce the model disulfide substrate, β-hydroxyethylene disulfide in vitro. However, they do not affect the levels of protein-GSH mixed disulfides formed in vivo in response to H2O2 (13.Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that the yeast thioredoxins regulate the levels of mixed disulfide formation (39.Ocón Garrido E. Grant C.M. Molecular Microbiol. 2001; 43: 993-1003Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Glutathione-S-transferases protect cells against the toxic effects of various xenobiotics. In higher eukaryotes, glutathione-S-transferases are known to detoxify lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and water (23.Zhao T. Singhal S. Piper J. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, rat hepatic glutathione-S-transferase has been shown to catalyze the metabolism of ethanol to fatty acid ethyl esters (40.Bora P.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86 (S. A. 86, 4470–4473): 4470-4473UCrossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two genes encoding functional glutathione-S-transferases, designated GTT1 andGTT2, have been identified in yeast (24.Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant Gtt1 and Gtt2 are active in a glutathione-S-transferase assay using CDNB as a model substrate, but share limited sequence homology with each other (11% identity, 32% similarity) and with glutathione-S-transferases from other species. BothGTT1 and GTT2 were essential for the glutaredoxin-mediated resistance to CHP. This may indicate that glutaredoxins confer resistance to hydroperoxides in a pathway that acts through GSH conjugation and removal from the cell. In agreement with this idea, increased resistance also required the GS-X pump encoded by YCF1. Ycf1 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein super-family that shares extensive homology with the human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR). It is also a functional homologue of MRP1 and is active in the uptake of glutathione-S-conjugates into the vacuole (25.Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Ze-Sheng L. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5609-6517Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of GRX1 and GRX2made the ycf1 mutant more sensitive to CHP indicating that Ycf1 may constitute the end step of a hydroperoxide detoxification pathway. The detoxification of xenobiotics by glutathione-S-transferases is a three-stage process (24.Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In stage 1, the xenobiotic is activated by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis to introduce a functional group; in stage 2, the functional group is conjugated to GSH; and in stage 3, the GSH conjugates are eliminated from the cytosol by means of a GS-X pump. Thus, glutaredoxins may either act on hydroperoxides directly (stage 1) or, alternatively, stimulate the activity of Gtt1 and Gtt2 (stage 2). Either one of those models would end in the elimination of a GSH-conjugated xenobiotic by the Ycf1 GS-X pump. The second model was unlikely given that Gtt1 does not contain any cysteine residues and that Gtt1 and Gtt2 are active in a glutathione-S-transferase assay in the absence of glutaredoxins (24.Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested the ability of glutaredoxins to directly reduce hydroperoxides in a reaction coupled with NADPH, Glr1, and GSH. Grx1 was found to reduce all three hydroperoxides in a catalytic manner and, for the case of CHP, was shown to reduce it to the corresponding alcohol (cumyl alcohol). The peroxidase activity of Grx1 with t-BH was comparable with that of a yeast phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx2). In addition, the peroxidase activity of Grx1 is comparable with various eukaryotic glutathione peroxidases, which have specific activities ranging between 3.2–625 μmol/min/mg usingt-BH as a substrate (reviewed in Ref. 42.Tran L.-T. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, one antioxidant activity of glutaredoxins appears to be the direct reduction of hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols. The finding that glutaredoxins have peroxidase activity is unexpected and adds to the growing list of antioxidants that can detoxify hydroperoxides. In yeast, these include catalases (CTT1,CTA1), phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (GPX1–3), and thiol peroxidases (five isoenzymes) (reviewed in Refs. 6.Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 43.Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a glutaredoxin/peroxiredoxin homologue has recently been identified in Chromatium gracile, which has similarity to both the glutaredoxin and peroxiredoxin families of antioxidants (44.Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Jacquemotte F. Meyer T. Cusanovich M. Bartsch R. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This enzyme can reduce hydroperoxides including H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxides using reducing power from the glutathione derivative, glutathione amide. Thus, the hydroperoxidase activity of the yeast glutaredoxins, identified in this present study, may represent an evolutionarily conserved activity. It remains to be established whether the glutaredoxins derived from higher eukaryotes similarly posses glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity. We are grateful to Barry Rosen for donating plasmid pBAD-YGRX1 and Lisa Israel for the gpx1–3 mutant. We thank Kathryn Quinn for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1986378496,"The role of nitric oxide (NO) generated by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion is not understood. We investigated the role of iNOS during early reperfusion damage induced in genetically deficient iNOS (iNOS-/-) mice and wild-type littermates. In wild-type mice, ischemia (60 min) and reperfusion (60 min) induced an elevation in serum levels of creatine phosphokinase and myocardial injury characterized by the presence of scattered apoptotic myocytes and mild neutrophil infiltration. Northern blot analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, whose activity was markedly elevated after reperfusion. Immunohistochemistry showed staining for nitrotyrosine; Western blot analysis showed elevated expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a putative cardioprotective mediator. Plasma levels of nitrite and nitrate, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10 were also increased. These events were preceded by degradation of inhibitor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), activation of IkappaB kinase complex (IKK) and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and subsequently activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) as early as 15 min after reperfusion. In contrast, iNOS-/- mice experienced 35% mortality after reperfusion. The extensive myocardial injury was associated with marked apoptosis and infiltration of neutrophils whereas expression of HSP70 was less pronounced. Nitrotyrosine formation and plasma levels of nitrite and nitrate were undetectable. TNF-alpha and IL-6 were increased and IL-10 was reduced in earlier stages of reperfusion. Activation of IKK and JNK and binding activity of NF-kappaB and AP-1 were significantly reduced. Thus, we conclude that iNOS plays a beneficial role in modulating the early defensive inflammatory response against reperfusion injury through regulation of signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2021028340,"The ERKs are a subfamily of the MAPKs that have been implicated in cell growth and differentiation. By using the rat ERK7 cDNA to screen a human multiple tissue cDNA library, we identified a new member of the ERK family, ERK8, that shares 69% amino acid sequence identity with ERK7. Northern analysis demonstrates that ERK8 is present in a number of tissues with maximal expression in the lung and kidney. Fluorescence in situ hybridization localized the ERK8 gene to chromosome 8, band q24.3. Expression of ERK8 in COS cells and bacteria indicates that, in contrast to constitutively active ERK7, ERK8 has minimal basal kinase activity and a unique substrate profile.

Co-transfection with either v-Src or a constitutively active c-Src increases ERK8 activation indicating that ERK8 can be activated downstream of c-Src. ERK8 is also activated following serum stimulation, and the extent of this activation is reduced by pretreatment with the specific Src family inhibitor PP2. The ERK8 activation by serum or Src was not affected by the MEK inhibitor U0126 indicating that activation of ERK8 does not require MEK1, MEK2, or MEK5.

Members of one group, the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), can be identified by their TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) activation motif and include ERK1, ERK2, ERK5, and ERK7. Recently, p97, an ERK5-related kinase identified through affinity purification that is selectively recognized by anti-pTEpY antibodies, was shown to be involved in a signaling pathway leading to differentiation (5.Janulis M. Trakul N. Greene G. Schaefer E.M. Lee J.D. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2235-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ERK1 and ERK2 were the first members of the ERK family to be identified and are the most widely studied. The 44-kDa ERK1 and the 42-kDa ERK2 have been implicated in cellular pathways that mediate growth factor regulation of proliferation and/or differentiation in most cell types (2.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar).The recently identified ERK5 and ERK7 are significantly larger than the originally identified ERK1 and ERK2 due to an extended C-terminal domain. ERK5, also known as big mitogen-activated kinase 1 (6.Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 7.Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), is 110 kDa, and ERK7 is 61 kDa. Recent information indicates that the C-terminal regions of these ERKs have important regulatory functions. The C-terminal region of ERK5 appears to regulate negatively its kinase activity (6.Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal required for nuclear translocation of ERK5 in vivofollowing activation (8.Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.-D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of ERK5 also contains a myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2-interacting region and a potent transcriptional activation domain (9.Kasler H.G. Victoria J. Duramad O. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8382-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ERK7 is activated by autophosphorylation, which is regulated through interactions with the C-terminal domain (10.Abe M.K. Kahle K.K. Saelzler M.P. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21272-21279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal region is required for the ability of ERK7 to localize to the nucleus and inhibit growth (11.Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The recent identification and characterization of these larger ERKs suggest that there may be additional members of the ERK family with extended C-terminal regions.To explore this possibility, we screened a multiple human tissue library using ERK7 cDNA as a probe, and we identified a protein kinase with the characteristic TEY activation motif. The relatively low sequence identity shared between this new ERK, termed ERK8, and the previously identified rat ERK7 suggests that it is a novel MAPK. In contrast to ERK7, ERK8 does not display significant constitutive kinase activity, does not phosphorylate c-Fos, and is activated in response to stimulation by Src or serum. These divergent biochemical characteristics confirm that ERK8, although most closely related to ERK7, represents a new member of the ERK family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsBovine serum albumin (BSA), myelin basic protein (MBP), triethylamine, glycine, glycerol, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma.

Proteins were isolated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% acrylamide separating gel. The gels were either stained with Gelcode Blue (Pierce) and dried or transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation of substrate phosphorylation was determined either by scintillation counter or by the STORM system (Molecular Dynamics). The presence of HA-tagged or TEY-phosphorylated proteins in the immunoprecipitates was verified by Western analysis with 3F10 monoclonal and anti-phospho-ERK polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Quantification of HA-tagged and TEY-phosphorylated proteins was performed using densitometric scanning (SigmaScan Pro, Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). Multiple exposures were utilized to verify linearity of the samples analyzed. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed in a similar fashion; however, the immune complexes were eluted prior to the kinase reaction and subjected to Western analysis.GST Fusion ProteinsPlasmids encoding glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-c-Fos-(210–313), GST-c-Jun-(1–93), GST-c-Myc, GST-c-Max, GST-paxillin, GST-ELK-1-(307–428), GST-Grb2, and GST-c-Src SH3 were generously provided by T.

Reactions were terminated by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subsequently processed as described above for the immune complex kinase assay.Fluorescence in Situ Chromosomal HybridizationHuman metaphase cells were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. The ERK8 probe was a cDNA probe consisting of 3208 bp containing both coding and non-coding regions of ERK8. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (18.Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 53-76PubMed Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled probes were prepared by nick translation using Bio-16-dUTP (Enzo Diagnostics, New York, NY). Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and chromosomes were identified by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride.Anti-ERK8 AntibodyAnti-ERK8 rabbit antiserum (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA) was raised against a peptide representing the last 14 amino acids of the C-terminal domain of ERK8. The ERK8 peptide was synthesized by the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center Peptide Facility. The anti-ERK8 antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography using the ERK8 peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Antibodies were eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by 100 mmtriethylamine, pH 11.5. The eluents were neutralized with 1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.5. A protein A-Sepharose column was used to isolate the IgG fraction. The purified antibody was eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against 30% glycerol in PBS, pH 7.5. Peroxidase conjugation of the affinity-purified anti-ERK8 antibody was performed using the EZ-Link™-activated peroxidase antibody labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce).GenBank™ Accession NumberThe GenBank™ accession number for the ERK8 cDNA reported here is AY065978.DISCUSSIONERK8, identified through a library screen using the ERK7 cDNA as a probe, is a newly identified member of the ERK family. Analysis of the evolutionary tree (Fig. 10) suggests that ERK7 and ERK8 form a discrete branch within the ERK family of MAPKs. Although ERK8 and ERK7 share an overall amino acid sequence identity of 69%, this sequence identity is significantly lower than that shared between the orthologues of ERK1, ERK2, or ERK5 which are highly conserved across mammalian species. For example, rat and human ERK1 and ERK2 share 97 and 99% overall sequence identity, respectively. Even the much larger ERK5 with its extended C-terminal region shares an overall sequence identity of 92% between mouse ERK5 and human ERK5 (20.Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The sequence identity shared between the kinase domains of ERK7 and ERK8 is only 82%, and the isolated C-terminal regions share only 53% amino acid identity. The primary sequences, taken in the context of the other ERK family members, indicate that ERK7 and ERK8 are related but distinct molecules.The biochemical properties of ERK8 verify this distinction. ERK7 is unique because it displays a high level of constitutive activity even in serum-starved cells (10.Abe M.K. Kahle K.K. Saelzler M.P. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21272-21279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ERK8, on the other hand, does not have the same degree of constitutive activity. Because we have not yet identified a suitable in vitro substrate, a direct comparison of their kinase activities could not be made. However, Western analysis of lysates from mammalian cells using an antibody that preferentially recognizes the dually phosphorylated TEY motif suggests that, under similar conditions, ERK8 is not as highly TEY-phosphorylated as ERK7. By contrast, both serum and Src increase TEY phosphorylation of ERK8 but not ERK7. These results indicate that, unlike ERK7, a significant fraction of ERK8 is not TEY-phosphorylated in the basal state. Although lack of an effective ERK8 substrate limits our ability to characterize ERK8 biochemically, it also supports the conclusion that ERK8 and ERK7 are distinct members of the ERK family. GST-c-Fos is an in vitro substrate for ERK7 (11.Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, ERK8 does not phosphorylate GST-c-Fos in vitro even following activation by v-Src (data not shown). Not surprisingly, orthologues of ERK1, ERK2, and ERK5, as well as other members of the MAPK family share the same activation and substrate profiles across several species. The relatively low sequence identity and different substrate profile indicate that ERK8 is a distinct member of the ERK family.A possible clue to the cellular function of ERK8 may come from the finding that v-Src and c-Src can activate ERK8. The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, like the MAPKs, has been implicated in a wide range of cellular pathways involving signals initiated from G-protein-linked receptors, growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases, integrins, cytokine receptors, and even ion channels (23.Thomas S. Brugge J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). There are at least nine members of the Src family (Blk, Hck, Fgr, Fyn, Lck, Lyn, Src, Yes, and Yrk). The common structural features include an SH3 domain and an SH2 domain that are N-terminal to the kinase domain. The crystal structure of c-Src indicates that these domains interact to regulate the kinase activity of Src (24.Xu W. Harrison S. Eck M. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 25.Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating its activity, the SH3 and SH2 domains are also involved in interactions with its substrates. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase can bind to c-Src through an interaction between its p85 subunit and the SH3 domain of c-Src (26.Liu X. Marengere L.E. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as does paxillin (27.Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Sam68 and actin filament-associated protein p110 interact with the SH3 and SH2 domains of c-Src (28.Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 29.Flynn D.C. Leu T.H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and cortactin and focal adhesion kinase interact with the SH2 domain (30.Okamura H. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26613-26618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31.Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Guan J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are known to bind to proteins that contain a proline-rich motif, PXXP (32.Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A. Schrieber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). ERK8 contains two of these motifs within its C-terminal region that could facilitate its interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as c-Src. The ability of the specific Src family inhibitor PP2 to partially inhibit ERK8 activation following serum stimulation supports the notion that activation of ERK8 by c-Src is physiologically relevant. Taken together with the observation that Src both associates with and activates ERK8 in cells, these results suggest that ERK8 is a downstream effector of one or more Src family kinases.It seems unlikely that c-Src, a tyrosine kinase, activates ERK8 directly because ERK activation requires phosphorylation of the threonine residue in addition to the tyrosine residue within the TEY activation motif. For ERK1, ERK2, and ERK5, this dual phosphorylation is performed by MEK1, MEK2, or MEK5. The inability of the specific MEK inhibitor U0126 to block ERK8 activation by Src or serum indicates that these MEKs are not the upstream activators of ERK8 (33.Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that Src activates ERK8 through a classical signaling cascade involving an unidentified MEK. The ability of ERK8 to interact directly with c-Src suggests that they are components of a larger signaling complex that may serve as a selective activation mechanism, a potential feedback regulator, or a means for cellular localization of ERK8.Because c-Src has been implicated in several intracellular signaling pathways including those originating from receptor protein tyrosine kinases, integrins, G-protein-coupled receptors, and cytokine receptors, additional studies will be required to determine the specific pathway(s) that involve ERK8. Identification of natural substrates will certainly provide insight into its cellular function. Nonetheless, the identification of ERK8 expands the ERK family of MAPKs and reinforces the notion that additional members with regulatory C-terminal regions may exist.

Regulation of the activity of MAPK depends on the phosphorylation state of the threonine and tyrosine residues in a Thr-X-Tyr (TXY) motif within the kinase domain. This canonical MAPK TXY motif has also been used to classify MAPKs into three main groups. Members of one group, the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), can be identified by their TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) activation motif and include ERK1, ERK2, ERK5, and ERK7.

https://openalex.org/W2053958174,"Recent results indicate that Ca2+ transport by organella contributes to shaping Ca2+ signals and exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells. Therefore, accurate measurements of [Ca2+] inside cytoplasmic organella are essential for a comprehensive analysis of the Ca2+ redistribution that follows cell stimulation. Here we have studied changes in Ca2+ inside the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nucleus by imaging aequorins targeted to these compartments in cells stimulated by brief depolarizing pulses with high K+ solutions. We find that Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels generates subplasmalemmal high [Ca2+]c domains adequate for triggering exocytosis. A smaller increase of [Ca2+]c is produced in the cell core, which is adequate for recruitment of the reserve pool of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. Most of the Ca2+ load is taken up by a mitochondrial pool, M1, closer to the plasma membrane; the increase of [Ca2+]M stimulates respiration in these mitochondria, providing local support for the exocytotic process. Relaxation of the [Ca2+]c transient is due to Ca2+ extrusion through the plasma membrane. At this stage, mitochondria release Ca2+ to the cytosol through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, thus maintaining [Ca2+]c discretely increased, especially at core regions of the cell, for periods that outlast the duration of the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1990428892,"The transcription factor Foxa2 is implicated in blood glucose homeostasis. Conditional expression of Foxa2 or its dominant-negative mutant DN-Foxa2 in INS-1 cells reveals that Foxa2 regulates the expression of genes important for glucose sensing in pancreatic β-cells. Overexpression of Foxa2 results in blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas induction of DN-Foxa2 causes a left shift of glucose-induced insulin release. The mRNA levels of GLUT2 and glucokinase are drastically decreased after induction of Foxa2. In contrast, loss of Foxa2 function leads to up-regulation of hexokinase (HK) I and II and glucokinase (HK-IV) mRNA expression. The glucokinase and the low Kmhexokinase activities as well as glycolysis are increased proportionally. In addition, induction of DN-Foxa2 also reduces the expression of β-cell KATP channel subunits Sur1 and Kir6.2 by 70%. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, induction of Foxa2 causes pronounced decreases in the HNF4α and HNF1α mRNA levels. Foxa2 fails to regulate the expression of Pdx1 transcripts. The expression of insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide is markedly suppressed after induction of Foxa2, while the glucagon mRNA levels are significantly increased. Conversely, Foxa2 is required for glucagon expression in these INS-1-derived cells. These results suggest that Foxa2 is a vital transcription factor evolved to control the expression of genes essential for maintaining β-cell glucose sensing and glucose homeostasis. The transcription factor Foxa2 is implicated in blood glucose homeostasis. Conditional expression of Foxa2 or its dominant-negative mutant DN-Foxa2 in INS-1 cells reveals that Foxa2 regulates the expression of genes important for glucose sensing in pancreatic β-cells. Overexpression of Foxa2 results in blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas induction of DN-Foxa2 causes a left shift of glucose-induced insulin release. The mRNA levels of GLUT2 and glucokinase are drastically decreased after induction of Foxa2. In contrast, loss of Foxa2 function leads to up-regulation of hexokinase (HK) I and II and glucokinase (HK-IV) mRNA expression. The glucokinase and the low Kmhexokinase activities as well as glycolysis are increased proportionally. In addition, induction of DN-Foxa2 also reduces the expression of β-cell KATP channel subunits Sur1 and Kir6.2 by 70%. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, induction of Foxa2 causes pronounced decreases in the HNF4α and HNF1α mRNA levels. Foxa2 fails to regulate the expression of Pdx1 transcripts. The expression of insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide is markedly suppressed after induction of Foxa2, while the glucagon mRNA levels are significantly increased. Conversely, Foxa2 is required for glucagon expression in these INS-1-derived cells. These results suggest that Foxa2 is a vital transcription factor evolved to control the expression of genes essential for maintaining β-cell glucose sensing and glucose homeostasis. The forkhead/winged-helix Foxa family of transcription factors, encoded by three genes Foxa1 (Hnf3α),Foxa2 (Hnf3β), and Foxa3(Hnf3γ), regulate hepatic and/or pancreatic gene expression (1Duncan S.

However, the search for the association of FOXA2 mutations with MODY patients has not been successful (14Abderrahmani A. Chevre J.C. Otabe S. Chikri M. Hani E.H. Vaxillaire M. Hinokio Y. Horikawa Y.

Pancreatic β-cell-specific deletion of Foxa2 resulted in postnatal death due to severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, and the down-regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel subunits Sur1 and Kir6.2 has been demonstrated in these mutant mice (16Sund N.J.

Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DN-Foxa2 is a Myc-tagged truncated Foxa2 mutant protein that possesses the intact DNA-binding domain but lacks the transactivation domain (7Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DN-Foxa2 exerts its dominant-negative function by competing with the endogenous Foxa2 for cognate DNA binding (7Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The impact of altered Foxa2 function on glucose metabolism and insulin secretion was assessed in these stable clones. The gene expression profile before and after induction of the Foxa2 or DN-Foxa2 was quantified. Rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line-derived stable clones were cultured in RPMI 1640 in 11.2 mm glucose (18Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. The first step stable clone INSrαβ, which expresses the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator, was described previously (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids used in the secondary stable transfection were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs encoding the mouse Foxa2 (kindly supplied by Prof. G. Schütz) and its dominant-negative mutant (DN-Foxa2) into the expression vector PUHD10–3 (a kind gift from Prof. H. Bujard). DN-Foxa2 (truncated mutation lacking the transactivation domain but containing the intact DNA-binding domain) (7Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from Foxa2 cDNA using the following primers: 5′-gcaggatccgtaatggtgctcgggcttcaggtg-3′ and 5′-gcaggatccggcgccatggcgggcatgagcggctca3-′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into modified pcDNA3.1myc (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and sequenced. The stable transfection and the clone selection and screening procedures were described previously (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) for detection (18Wang H.

The dilutions for antibodies against Foxa2 C terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and Myc-tag (19Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts were isolated from the cells cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. For immunofluorescence, cells grown on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips were cultured for 24 h with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline. The cells were then washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA (PBS-BSA). The preparation was then blocked with PBS-BSA before incubating with the first antibodies, anti-Foxa2 (1:500 dilution) and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc-tag, (1:2 dilution), followed by the second antibody labeling. Nuclear extracts from INS-1 cells grown in culture medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h were prepared according to Schreiber et al.(20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells in 12-well plates were cultured in 11.2 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 19 h, followed by an additional 5 h equilibration in 2.5 mm glucose medium. Insulin secretion was measured over a period of 30 min, in Krebs-Ringer-Bicarbonate-HEPES buffer (KRBH, 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA) containing the indicated concentrations of glucose. Insulin content was determined after extraction with acid ethanol following the procedures of Wang et al. (21Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin was detected by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard (21Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins were extracted, according to Wang and Iynedjian (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), from cells cultured in 11.2 mm glucose medium in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Total hexokinase activity was measured at 30 °C by a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled assay in a fluorometer (Lambda Bio20, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) estimation of NADH production (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Glucokinase activity and high affinity hexokinase activity were calculated, respectively, as the differences in NADH produced at 100, 0.5, and 0 mm glucose and expressed in nmol/min (=milliunits) per mg of protein. Cells in 24-well dishes were cultured in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. The rate of glycolysis was estimated from the production of [3H]water fromd-[5-3H]glucose according to Wang and Iynedjian (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells in 10-cm diameter dishes were cultured in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 16 h, followed by an additional 8 h in culture medium with 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mm glucose. Total RNA was extracted and blotted to nylon membranes as described previously (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized and then hybridized to 32P-labeled random primer cDNA probes according to Wang and Iynedijian (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To ensure equal RNA loading and even transfer, all membranes were stripped and re-hybridized with a “housekeeping gene” probe cyclophilin. cDNA fragments used as probes for Foxa2, Hnf1α, Hnf4α, glucokinase, hexokinase I, Glut2, l-pyruvate kinase, insulin, Sur1, Kir6.2, and Pdx1 mRNA detection were digested from the corresponding plasmids. cDNA probes for rat islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), glucagon, Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2, Isl-1, β2/NeuroD, aldolase B, adenine nucleotide translocators 1 and 2 (ANT1, ANT2), mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), citrate synthase, glyceraldehydes-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hexokinase II and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) were prepared by RT-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test for unpaired data. We have established over 10 clones positively expressing Foxa2 and DN-Foxa2, respectively, using the parental INS-rαβ (INS-r3) cells (17Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The clones designated as Foxa2#51 and DN-Foxa2#45, which displayed the highest inducible protein levels without leakage under noninduced state, were selected for the present study. As illustrated in Fig. 1,A and C, the INS-1-derived cells express endogenous Foxa2 in the nucleus. Foxa2 protein was overexpressed in all of the cells treated with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. As predicted, the antibody against the carboxyl terminus of Foxa2 did not detect DN-Foxa2 with the COOH-terminal deletion (7Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). As shown in the Western blotting (Fig. 1B) and immunostaining (Fig. 1D) with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, this Myc-tagged DN-Foxa2 protein was induced in a doxycycline-dependent and an all-or-none manner. Induction of DN-Foxa2 did not interrupt the endogenous Foxa2 expression (Fig. 1B), and the induced DN-Foxa2 protein was localized in the nucleus of DN-Foxa2#45 cells (Fig. 1, B and D). We also performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown) using the Foxa2-binding site containing glucagon G2 element as a probe (22Philippe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 368-374PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Foxa2 led to a 10-fold increase in the signal density of Foxa2 binding, whereas induction of DN-Foxa2 almost completely abolished the binding activity of endogenous Foxa2 (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, overexpression of Foxa2 almost completely blunted glucose-stimulated insulin release. The cellular insulin content was reduced by 46.3 ± 5.1% (p < 0.001) after induction of Foxa2 for 24 h (see also Fig. 6 for the decrease in insulin mRNA levels). Secretion data were therefore normalized for cellular insulin content. In contrast, induction of DN-Foxa2 resulted in a left shift of the dose-response curve of glucose-stimulated insulin release (Fig. 2B) without altering insulin content. To verify the clonal variability, we randomly chose another clone DN-Foxa2# 2 and studied the effects of DN-Foxa2 induction on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. As shown in Fig. 2C, induction of DN-Foxa2 in this clone also led to a typical left-shift of glucose-dependent insulin release, suggesting a common phenomenon rather than a clonal peculiarity. Next, we examined the gene expression patterns in these cell lines to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the changes in insulin secretion.Figure 6Foxa2 suppresses β-cell gene expression and promotes glucagon levels. Cells were cultured in 2.5 mm glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 16 h and were then further incubated for 8 h at the indicated glucose concentrations. The gene expression profile in Foxa2#51 (A) and DN-Foxa2#45 (B) cells was quantified by Northern blotting. 20 μg of total RNA samples were analyzed by hybridizing with indicated cDNA probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis of the gene expression pattern in Foxa2#51 and DN-Foxa2#45 cells cultured in indicated concentrations of glucose and treated with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h is described in the legend to Fig. 3. Consistent with the immunoblotting (Fig. 1B), DN-Foxa2 mRNA was induced in an all-or-none manner, and such induction did not alter endogenous Foxa2 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). The mRNA levels of the KATP channel subunits Sur1 and Kir6.2 were reduced by 60 and 70%, respectively, after dominant-negative suppression of Foxa2 function (Fig. 3B). However, overexpression of Foxa2 alone was not sufficient to promote the expression of Sur1 and Kir6.2 (Fig. 3A). The mRNA levels of mitochondrial GDH, citrate synthase, and adenine nucleotide translocators 1 and 2 (ANT1 and ANT2) were not modulated by Foxa2 (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, overexpression of Foxa2 caused up-regulation of UCP2 (Fig. 3A), whereas induction of DN-Foxa2 did not affect the expression of UCP2 mRNA (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, overexpression of Foxa2 resulted in down-regulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) (Fig. 3A). Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy has been linked to mutations in the genes encoding Sur1, Kir6.2, glucokinase, and GDH (23Glaser B. Kesavan P. Heyman M. Davis E. Cuesta A. Buchs A.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We could rule out the possible involvement of GDH and UCP2 in the enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion observed in β-cells deficient in Foxa2 function, since their expression was not altered by induction of DN-Foxa2. The rodent pancreatic β-cell expresses high levels of the glucose transporter Glut2, which allows rapid equilibration of glucose across the plasma membrane (32Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 33Schuit F.C. Huypens P. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This is associated with extremely low levels of high affinity hexokinase isoforms (hexokinases I, II, and III) to optimize glucose sensing in the physiological blood glucose range. A β-cell-specific promoter in the glucokinase (hexokinase IV) gene maintains a precise expression level of this rate-limiting enzyme for glucose metabolism, which determines the glucose sensing in pancreatic β-cells (reviewed in Refs. 33Schuit F.C. Huypens P. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 34Matschinsky F.M.

As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of Foxa2 in Foxa2#51 cells reduced the glucokinase mRNA level by 60%, whereas induction of DN-Foxa2 in DN-Foxa2#45 raised the glucokinase expression by 2-fold. The increased glucokinase expression after induction of DN-Foxa2 was also demonstrated in another clone, DN-Foxa2#2 (Fig. 7). The INS-1-derived clones expressed hexokinases I and II (but not III) mRNAs at barely detectable levels, and induction of Foxa2 and DN-Foxa2 resulted in, respectively, down- and up-regulation of these mRNA levels (Fig. 4). Overexpression of Foxa2 also caused a 90% reduction of Glut2 mRNA expression, while induction of DN-Foxa2 left-shifted the glucose dose-dependent increase in Glut2 transcript level (Fig. 4). The suppressive effects of Foxa2 on glucose sensing were also reflected by the blunted glucose responsiveness ofl-pyruvate kinase and aldolase B mRNA expression (Fig. 4).Figure 7Graded overexpression of Foxa2 suppresses HNF4α and HNF1α expression and induction of DN-Foxa2 increases glucokinse expression.A, Foxa2#39 cells were cultured for 24 h in normal (11.2 mm) glucose medium containing, respectively, 0, 75, 150, and 500 ng/ml doxycycline.

As seen in Table I, the glucokinase activity was reduced by 60% following overexpression of Foxa2 and was increased 2.5-fold by dominant-negative suppression of Foxa2 function. Similarly, the high affinity hexokinase activity was down-regulated by 50% and up-regulated by 3-fold, respectively, by induction of Foxa2 and DN-Foxa2. Thus, Foxa2 is essential for the transcriptional regulation of enzymes controlling the β-cell glucose phosphorylation. This conclusion was corroborated by the measurements of glycolytic flux, which was decreased by 60% after overexpression of Foxa2 and increased by 2-fold after induction of DN-Foxa2 (Fig. 5).Table IEffects of induction of Foxa2 and DN-Foxa2 on the activities of glucokinase and high affinity hexokinaseFoxa2#51DN-Foxa2#45−Dox+Dox−Dox+DoxGlucokinase10.18 ± 0.973.94 ± 1.241-ap < 0.0001.9.53 ± 1.7024.60 ± 3.781-ap < 0.0001.High affinity hexokinase1.30 ± 0.360.56 ± 0.351-bp < 0.005.1.32 ± 0.464.20 ± 1.531-ap < 0.0001.Enzyme activities were measured using cytosolic proteins isolated from cells cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h and expressed as milliunits/mg of protein.

Foxa2 has been previously suggested as a master transactivator of the pancreatic transcription factors, Hnf4α, Hnf1α, Hnf1β, and Pdx1, in the transcriptional hierarchy (1Duncan S. Navas M. Dufort D.

Isl-1 is the only pancreatic transcription factor, the expression of which requires Foxa2 function (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of Foxa2 suppressed rather than enhanced the expression of Hnf4α and Hnf1α mRNAs (Fig. 6A). To verify whether this is due to a clonal variability or a paradoxical effect of high level overexpression, we also studied the effect of graded overexpression of Foxa2 on mRNA levels of Hnf4α and Hnf1α in another randomly selected clone, Foxa2#39 (Fig. 7). Titrated overexpression of Foxa2 by 3.5-, 10-, and 20-fold at 75, 150, and 500 ng/ml of doxycycline all caused significant inhibition of Hnf4α and Hnf1"

However, there is little known regarding the pathways and mechanisms controlling p27 accumulation in G0 cells. We report that inhibition of Rho, by either lovastatin or C3 exoenzyme, can increase the translational efficiency of p27 mRNA.

This Rho-responsive element lies within a 300-nucleotide region at the 3′-end of the mRNA. By supporting the significance of this signaling pathway to Rho function, we showed that the suppression of RasV12 transformation by RhoAN19 is blocked in p27−/− cells. In contrast this activity is not blocked in Rb−/− orp16−/− cells. The resistance of p27−/−cells to RhoAN19 is not associated with a failure of RhoAN19 to accumulate to amounts sufficient to block Rho activity as measured by the organization of actin stress fibers.

Following entry into S-phase, p27 levels reach a nadir because of cdk2-dependent ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (14.Millard S.S. Yan J.S. Nguyen H. Pagano M. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7093-7098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because p27 abundance is important to the decision to enter and exit the cell cycle, we expected that the rate of p27 synthesis as cells transit the G0-G1 period might be a target of mitogenic signals, so we set out to determine the signaling pathways that control translation of p27 mRNA. Here we report that the amount of p27 mRNA translation was sensitive to the activity of GTPases of the Rho family, being maximally induced when Rho is inactivated in a G0 cell. Cell cycle arrest induced by inhibition of either the PI3 or p70S6 kinase pathways or simply reducing the amount of activated Rho or activated Erk without inducing cell cycle arrest failed to affect the amount of p27 mRNA translation. We have shown that this aspect of Rho-dependent regulation required an element within the last 300 nucleotides of the mRNA. We also established that RhoAN19, a dominant negative allele of Rho, could inhibit RasV12-induced foci formation in wild-type cells and cells lacking either Rb or p16 but not those lacking p27. However, p27 status did not affect the ability of RhoAN19 to interfere with stress fiber formation. Combining these observations we suggest a model wherein Rho-dependent changes in p27 synthesis rates may impact progression during the G0/G1 interval of the cell cycle.

To generate retroviruses expressing RhoAN19, an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag was added by PCR to the cDNA of RhoAN19 from a pCEFL derivative, and the product was subcloned into pWZL-hygro (23.Serrano M.

MDA468 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose:F-12 supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm glutamine. Transient transfections were carried out for MDA468 cells essentially as described (19.Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 106 cells per 10-cm dish, grown overnight, and then transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 2.5 μg of pCMV-β (CLONTECH), and carrier DNA to a total of 20 μg per dish, unless otherwise stated. Sixteen hours after transfection precipitates were washed out with fresh medium. Where indicated, replicate dishes, transfected with the same DNA mixtures, were drug-treated 8–10 h after the washes. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed 24 or 48 h afterward as described (19.Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) Luciferase activity was normalized for efficiency (luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio) in each transfection. To calculate the change in expression by each treatment and construct, we divided the normalized activity in treated cells by the value obtained in untreated cells, and we expressed this relative to the change seen in expression from constructs lacking any UTR sequences. We measured the amount of RNA expressed from each reporter construct by RNase protection assay as described (19.Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed using an analyzer Fuji Film Bas 2500 and the MacBas version 2.5 software. Lovastatin (Merck) was activated as described previously (24.Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained PD98059 from Biomol and LY294002 and rapamycin fromCalbiochem. The amount and duration of treatment are indicated in the legends to the figures. Cell cycle phase distribution was determined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. Whole cell suspensions were washed in PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, stained in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase, 0.1% Triton X-100, and analyzed using the Multicycle software. For analysis of transfected populations, an expression vector of the CD19 surface marker was included in the DNA transfection mixture. CD19-positive transfected cells were stained as described (25.van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar); cells were detached in PBS, 0.1% EDTA, washed, and stained with a FITC-conjugated anti-CD19 antibody (BD PharMingen). After fixation in 75% ethanol, cell pellets were washed in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20 and stained in 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 200 μg/ml RNase, 0.1% Triton X-100. DNA profiles were obtained from the FITC-positive population. For immunodetection of activated forms of signaling molecules after drug treatments (Fig. 1), cells in the dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS prior to addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (20 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Cells were scraped out of the dishes and incubated for 15 min on ice. Otherwise, cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on ice and then sonicated. All lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and detected with antibodies using ECL detection system. The affinity-purified anti-p27 antibody has been described (4.Soos T.J.

Mouse embryo fibroblasts were isolated from 13.5-day post-coitum embryos generated in intercrosses of p27+/− (26.Kiyokawa H.K.R. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E. Ono M. Khanam D.

After harvesting the embryos, heads and red organs were removed and used for genotyping by both PCR and Western blot. Carcasses were cut into pieces and then digested in tyrosine at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell pellets from single embryos were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamicin, penicillin, and streptomycin, plated in a 10-cm dish, and considered as passage 0. Immortal derivatives were established following a 3T3 protocol. 3T3 fibroblasts of different genotypes were plated at 106cells per 10-cm dish and transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 2 μg of either pBabe-puro or pBabe-RasV12 and 18 μg of either pWZL-hygro or pWZL-RhoN19 per dish. After an overnight incubation, the precipitates were washed out. Cells were grown in complete medium for 24 h and then selected in the presence of 75 μg/ml hygromycin for 4–5 days. Selected cells were counted, mixed with wild-type primary MEFs (3 × 103 drug-resistant cells plus 3 × 105 wild-type cells), and plated at 3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. The medium was changed every other day. After 14 days, foci were stained with Giemsa. Foci were counted on a Bio-Rad Image Analyzer using the Bio-Rad Quantity One Analysis Software and confirmed by visual counting under microscope. Retroviral supernatants were generated by transfection of 293T cells (5 × 106cells/10 cm dish) with 15 μg of retroviral vector and 15 μg of ecotropic helper virus. Supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, pooled from replicate dishes, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. MEFs were plated at 8 × 105 cells/10-cm dish the night before infection and exposed to viral supernatants (4 ml per dish) containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. Cells were grown in complete medium for 24 h and then selected in the presence of 75 μg/ml hygromycin for 4 days. Infected MEFs plated in coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized in 1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 4 min on ice, and then stained with 2 μg/ml FITC-phalloidin (Sigma). Counts were performed on captured images. To determine whether specific signaling pathways affected the translation of p27 mRNA, we used an assay developed to measure the translational efficiency of p27 mRNA (19.Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This assay takes advantage of a reporter plasmid that expresses the luciferase gene product under the control of the SV40 promoter, SV40 polyadenylation signal, and the untranslated regions of the p27 mRNA. Following co-transfection of the reporter vector with a vector expressing β-galactosidase from a cytomegalovirus promoter into MDA468 cells, we treated them with an assortment of drugs that affected different signaling pathways. We used an inhibitor of Mek1 (PD98059), an inhibitor of PI3 kinase (LY294002) which affects both the activity of p70S6 kinase and Akt, an inhibitor of p70S6 kinase (rapamycin), or an inhibitor of protein prenylation (lovastatin). As measured by trypan blue staining the toxicity of these treatments was insignificant (data not shown). PD98059 had only a modest effect on cell cycle progression, whereas cells treated with the other drugs accumulated with a G0/G1 content of DNA (Fig. 1 A). We then prepared extracts from these cells and blotted for Erk1/2, phosphorylated Erk1/2, p70S6k, phosphorylated p70S6k, phosphorylated Akt, and p27 (Fig. 1 B). The amount of phosphorylated Erk1/2 was decreased in PD98059-treated and lovastatin-treated cells but not in LY294002- or rapamycin-treated cells. The amount of phosphorylated S6 kinase was decreased in rapamycin-, LY294002-, and lovastatin-treated cells but not in those treated with PD98059. The amount of phosphorylated Akt was decreased in LY294002- and lovastatin-treated cells but not in PD98059- or rapamycin-treated cells. The p27 protein accumulated in cells treated with lovastatin, rapamycin, or LY294002 but not PD98059 (Fig. 1 C). Similar to the increase of endogenous p27, lovastatin induced luciferase accumulation (Fig. 1 D). Lovastatin is known to increase the synthesis of p27 (15.Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and decrease the turnover of p27 (29.Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Increased synthesis doubles the available p27, and the reduction in proteolysis must make up the rest to achieve the 3–4-fold increase in steady state observed in the treated cells. Rapamycin and LY294002 did not increase reporter expression consistent with previous reports (30.Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Luo Y. Marx S.O. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Massague J. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) that these agents affect the rate of p27 turnover. The steady state amounts of luciferase and β-galactosidase mRNA were not differentially affected by the drugs used (Fig. 1 D). This suggested that increased translation of p27 would not be a general effect of G1 arrest, although an increase in p27 protein might be. To map the sequences responsible for the lovastatin-dependent induction of p27 synthesis, we examined the effect of lovastatin treatment on different mutant constructs. Constructs containing only the 3′-UTR alone had negligible activity, consistent with our previous report (19.Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that the 5′-UTR contains sequences required for both basal and induced translation of the p27 mRNA. The reporters containing only the 5′-UTR were not affected by lovastatin, suggesting that the 3′-UTR was required for the lovastatin-dependent induction of p27 (Fig. 2). We found that deleting nucleotides 1680–1978 of the 3′-UTR eliminated the lovastatin-inducible element. This loss was not due to the length of the 3′-UTR because expression from an even shorter construct lacking two-thirds of the 3′-UTR, but including this 300-nucleotide region (Δ638–1680), was induced by lovastatin treatment (Fig. 2). The yield of mRNA was equivalent in all the mutants (data not shown). We conclude that the ability of lovastatin to enhance p27 translation lies in an element within the most distal 300 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR. Lovastatin blocks the metabolic pathway leading to protein prenylation by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. This causes mislocalization of several membrane-anchored proteins and can have effect on the activity of Erk, Akt, and p70S6 kinases as well as other proteins. As the inactivation of Erk, Akt, and p70S6 kinase did not enhance synthesis individually (Fig. 1 D), we began to look at the Rho family of GTPases. Because both the Rho proteins, by C-terminal geranylgeranylation, and their GTP exchange factors, by lipid interactions with the pleckstrin homology domain (32.Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar), are membrane-localized, lovastatin will block the prenylation of Rho required for its membrane localization and its subsequent activation. Consistent with this, cells treated with lovastatin showed typical changes in morphology as well as redistribution of Rho from membranes to the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). We examined whether direct inhibition of Rho would enhance synthesis from the reporters, similar to the lovastatin-dependent localization failure. The toxin C3 exoenzyme is a highly specific inhibitor of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC that only weakly affects other GTPases (33.Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). C3 catalyzes ADP-ribosylation at asparagine 41, preventing interactions of these Rho family members with their effectors (33.Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells co-transfected with vectors expressing C3 toxin, a CD19+ cell surface marker expression vector, and the reporters showed increased luciferase activity similar to lovastatin-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). Co-expression of p27 in place of C3 toxin did not increase reporter expression (Fig. 3 A), despite the fact that both the toxin and p27 caused growth arrest in the CD19+ population of cells (data not shown). Co-transfection of either C3 or p27 did not affect the relative amounts of luciferase and β-galactosidase mRNA produced in a manner consistent with the change in activity (Fig. 3). Together these data indicate that inactivation of Rho enhances the synthesis of p27. Next we asked if we could overcome the effect of lovastatin on reporter expression by using a GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant of RhoA, RhoAQ63L. There is a disagreement in the literature as to the specific requirements of membrane localization for activity; however, many groups (34.del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35.Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31001-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that constitutively active alleles of Rho act in the absence of proper membrane localization. This may be attributed to the overexpression of the mutant, and high levels might allow it to fulfill some of the activated Rho functions simply by mass action. We co-transfected RhoAQ63L together with the reporter vectors prior to addition of lovastatin. The active form of Rho prevented the increase in translation caused by treatment with lovastatin (Fig. 3), suggesting that inactivation of Rho is a required event. This allele does not abrogate the G1 arrest induced by lovastatin (data not shown), indicating that Rho inactivation is only part of the cellular response to lovastatin. Additionally,p27−/− mouse fibroblasts arrest in response to lovastatin, arguing that changes in p27 are only part of the cellular response to the drug (data not shown). We did not attempt to ask if the RhoAQ63L allele would reverse the effect of C3 exoenzyme because ADP-ribosylation would interfere with the ability of the RhoQ63L to associate with effector proteins. Thus, we concluded that the lovastatin induced increase in reporter synthesis, and the ability of the activated mutant of Rho to suppress this is consistent with the notion that Rho could affect p27 accumulation directly, independent of cyclin E-cdk2-initiated proteolysis as shown previously (38.Hu W. Bellone C.J. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in IIC9 cells. Finally we asked if inhibiting Rho activity would be sufficient to induce p27 synthesis. We were unable to induce synthesis from the reporters when co-transfected with a vector expressing RhoAN19, a dominant negative mutant of Rho into MDA468 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, we could not document that the amount of RhoAN19 expressed was sufficient to inhibit endogenous Rho activity. We next tried NIH3T3 cells. These cells, unlike MDA468 cells, have a well organized cytoskeleton with stress fibers easily detected by phalloidin staining. Stress fiber formation is a reflection of Rho activity (32.Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with RhoAN19 and reporter activity scored and correlated to the disruption of the cytoskeleton. Although the cytoskeleton was disrupted, cells failed to arrest growth, and we failed to observe a change in reporter activity (data not shown). Consequently, from this and the data above, we conclude that Rho activity is necessary but not sufficient in cycling cells to induce changes in p27 synthesis rate. Rho function had been shown to be necessary for the transforming activity of RasV12 (39.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A.

To overcome the Arf/p53-dependent growth arrest that occurs when introducing RasV12 into primary mouse fibroblasts (28.Serrano M. Lee H. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A.

We also used NIH3T3 cells as a prototype model cell line. Most of the 3T3 clones were still dependent on serum for growth and became quiescent when grown to confluence (data not shown). There was an increase in the spontaneous transformation rate ofRb−/− cells (Footnote 2 see foci formation in Fig. 4 A as an example).

While the identity of the serine kinases is unclear, these putative proline-directed phosphorylation sites may be targetted by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).The MAPKs comprise a family of serine/threonine kinases that are activated by extracellular signals. There are at least three distinct types of MAPKs: the classical ERK1/ERK2 kinases, the p38HOGMAPKs (hereafter referred to as p38), and the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun kinase (SAPK/JNK; hereafter referred to as SAPK) subfamily. All play important roles in erythropoietin-induced differentiation or apoptosis (36.Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 94: 853-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is JAK2-dependent but does not require EPO-R tyrosines, whereas STAT5A and STAT5B tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by EPO-R Tyr343. STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation minimally requires a proximal portion of the EPO receptor which is also necessary for ERK and p38, but not SAPK activation. In contrast, STAT5A and STAT5B serine phosphorylation is independent of SAPK, ERK, and p38. We propose that distinct signal transduction pathways couple to EPO-dependent serine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B.DISCUSSIONSTAT proteins have been implicated in a variety of EPO-induced responses, but the mechanisms linking EPO to STAT activation remain less clearly understood. Here we demonstrate that EPO regulates the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B in Ba/F3 cells and in primary murine splenocytes. Our data show that tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins require identical regions of the EPO-R. Specifically, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 requires a membrane-proximal region of the EPO-R whereas STAT5A and STAT5B tyrosine and serine phosphorylation minimally requires Tyr343 of the EPO-R. Our results indicate that distinct pathways regulate phosphorylation of each STAT molecule. Using genetic and pharmacologic analyses we show that MEK or p38 MAPK inhibitors perturb STAT1 serine phosphorylation, while only MEK antagonists block STAT3 serine phosphorylation. STAT5A and STAT5B serine phosphorylation is unaffected by either MEK or p38 inhibitors.Recent data utilizing a genetic knock-in of a mouse EPO-R deletion mutant demonstrated that EPO-R tyrosine residues are dispensable for viability in vivo (29.Zang H. Sato K. Nakajima H. McKay C. Ney P.A. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3156-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed that STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is observed in a Ba/F3-EPO-R deletion mutant devoid of cytoplasmic tyrosines, but capable of robust EPO-dependent JAK2 activation. We failed to observe tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in primary erythroblasts, suggesting that the role of STAT1 activation may be most relevant in vivo. These results raise the possibility that STAT1 collaborates with STAT5A/B in effective erythropoiesis. It has been recently reported that erythroid burst-forming units from STAT1-deficient mice are impaired compared with normal mice (33.Pang Q. Fagerlie S. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Faulkner G. Diaz J. Rathbun R.K. Bagby G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4724-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and STAT1 expression is increased in STAT5A/STAT5B knockout mice (26.Teglund S. McKay C. schuetz E. Deursen J.M.v. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). STAT5A/B nullizygous animals display a modest phenotype with fetal anemia (28.Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 23: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and impaired differentiation of splenic erythroblasts isolated from adult mice (30.Socolovsky M. Nam H. Fleming M.D. Haase V.H. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3261-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This suggests that STAT5 may be required during expansion of the erythropoietic compartment, but may be compensated by STAT1 at other times.Our data shows that EPO stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in a Ba/F3 cell line expressing an EPO-R deletion mutant devoid of tyrosines. In contrast, a recent paper suggests that in UT-7 cells expressing G-CSF-R/EPO-R chimeras, STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by Tyr432 of the human EPO-R (corresponding to murine EPO-R Tyr431) (55.Kirito K. Nakajima K. Watanabe T. Uchida M. Tanaka M. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. Blood. 2002; 99: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear whether these differences from our data represent variations in EPO-dependent tyrosine kinase activation in different cell lines or inconsistencies in the phosphorylation of chimeric cytokine receptors examined in the Kirito et al.study (55.Kirito K. Nakajima K. Watanabe T. Uchida M. Tanaka M. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. Blood. 2002; 99: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The requirement of identical EPO-R domains for tyrosine and serine phosphorylation suggests that the phosphorylation events may be functionally linked. However, only in certain contexts has tyrosine phosphorylation been associated with serine phosphorylation. For example, simultaneous tyrosine and serine phosphorylation bas been observed on expression of oncogenic RhoA mutants (56.Aznar S. Valeron P.F. del Rincon S.V. Perez L.F. Perona R. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3282-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and STAT serine phosphorylation does not occur in JAK2-deficient cells (57.Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell J.J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, serine STAT1 phosphorylation is not associated with detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages (58.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and Chung et al. (39.Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) reported that serine phosphorylation negatively modulates tyrosine phosphorylation. In all cases rigorously examined, tyrosine phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for STAT serine phosphorylation (59.Kovarik P. Mangold M. Ramsauer K. Heidari H. Steinborn R. Zotter A. Levy D.E. Muller M. Decker T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) even when activation of JAK2 is required for both phosphorylation events (57.Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell J.J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 60.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that both JAK2-dependent and –independent pathways can contribute to STAT serine phosphorylation in different contexts.Despite our evidence that STAT1/3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation requires JAK2 activation, full STAT-induced gene expression appears to require additional regions of the EPO-R (Fig. 12). Compared with the EPO-R −99 mutant, EPO-R −99,F1 mutants have impaired EPO-induced STAT-dependent gene expression, suggesting an important role of Tyr343 in STAT regulation. These results indicate that STAT tyrosine and serine phosphorylation are not sufficient for maximal activity, and point to other mechanisms of regulation.

Specific inhibition of p38 abolishes STAT1 serine phosphorylation, but not phosphorylation of other STAT molecules. In contrast, ERK pathway inhibitors block STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation. STAT5A and STAT5B serine phosphorylation does not correlate with activation of any of the MAPKs tested, and none of the inhibitors affected STAT5A/B serine phosphorylation.As STAT1 and STAT3 share similar sequences surrounding the serine phosphorylation site, the differences in STAT kinase pathways suggests there may be additional determinants of STAT kinase specificity. One possibility is sequences distant from the phosphorylation site may interact with signaling molecules and confer specificity. It would be interesting to examine STAT1/3 chimeras to localize determinant regions. STAT5A and STAT5B serine phosphorylation occurs via the same portion of the EPO-R and are both insensitive to the MAPK pathway inhibitors. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that serine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B molecules are regulated identically.Our results linking JAK2 and ERK/p38 activity are consistent with previous reports in interferon-γ (69.Takaoka A.

We have shown that treatment of Ba/F3-EPO-R with the JAK inhibitor, AG490, blocks ERK and p38-dependent gene expression (data not shown). The requirement of both ERK and p38 activation for STAT1 serine phosphorylation suggests that these MAPKs may not directly phosphorylate the STAT molecules, but rather share a common effector. This possibility is consistent with the relatively inefficient phosphorylation of STAT1 by p38 (57.Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell J.J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 58.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).The physiological role of STAT serine phosphorylation is unclear. STAT serine phosphorylation may prime the cell for subsequent transcriptional activity, as several reports indicate a requirement for serine phosphorylation in maximal cytokine-stimulated transcriptional activity (35.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 60.Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T.

Mutation of Ser727 of STAT1 differentially affects basal and induced expression of target genes (59.Kovarik P. Mangold M. Ramsauer K. Heidari H. Steinborn R. Zotter A. Levy D.E. Muller M. Decker T.

To investigate whether MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 operate similarly with their known native alpha subunit partners (KCNQ1, HERG, and Kv3.4, respectively) two conserved residues associated with human disease and influential in channel function were evaluated. As MiRPs assemble with a variety of alpha subunits in experimental cells and may do so in vivo, each peptide was also assessed with the other two alpha subunits. Inherited mutation of aspartate to asparagine (D --> N) to yield D76N-MinK is linked to cardiac arrhythmia and deafness; the analogs D82N-MiRP1 and D90N-MiRP2 were studied. Mutation of arginine to histidine (R --> H) to yield R83H-MiRP2 is associated with periodic paralysis; the analogs K69H-MinK and K75H-MiRP1 were also studied. Macroscopic and single-channel currents showed that D --> N mutations suppressed a subset of functions whereas R/K --> H changes altered the activity of MinK, MiRP1, and MiRP2 with all three alpha subunits. The findings indicate that the KCNE peptides interact similarly with different alpha subunits and suggest a hypothesis: that clinical manifestations of inherited KCNE point mutations result from disruption of multiple native currents via promiscuous interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1999533225,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α and γ play key roles in the transcriptional control of contrasting metabolic pathways such as adipogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Both ligand-activated nuclear receptors bind to common target gene response elements and interact with distinct domains of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 to attain their full transcriptional potency. Thus, PPAR subtype specificity may be determined by ligand availability and transcription factor or coactivator expression levels. To identify other, perhaps more precise mechanisms contributing to PPAR subtype specificity, we studied PGC-1 recruitment by PPARs using a previously described hormone response element in the humanUCP1 promoter and a human brown adipocyte cell line as our model system. As in rodents, PGC-1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the UCP1 gene in humans and mediates the effects of PPARα and PPARγ agonists and retinoic acid. Interestingly, a previously postulated PGC-1 repressor selectively affects the PPARα-mediated activation of UCP1 gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling, known to regulate the PGC-1/repressor interaction, decreases the stimulatory effect of PPARα agonist treatment without reducing the response to thiazolidinedione or retinoic acid.

Because each factor binds to the same consensus sequence in theUCP1 promoter, mechanism(s) must exist that regulate PPAR subtype specificity. The distinct transcriptional programs of PPAR subtypes could be realized through differential activation by endogenous and exogenous ligands. In addition, PPARα has also been shown to be more sensitive to sequences in the 5′-flanking regions of PPAR-response elements (PPREs), a finding that might help to explain subtype specificity (19.Juge-Aubry C.

Moreover, distinct physical and functional interactions of PPARs with tissue-specific coactivators or corepressors and subtype-specific recruitment mechanisms of such factors may profoundly affect the transactivation properties of individual PPARs.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that competition of a repressor with PPARα for binding to PGC-1 contributes to PPAR subtype specificity. We used a multipartite response element of the UCP1 promoter to confirm that PGC-1 is a potent transcriptional coactivator of PPARα and PPARγ. However, the PPARα-mediated transcriptional response was negatively regulated by a putative PGC-1 repressor and by inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling, whereas the PPARγ-mediated transcriptional response remained unaltered. Thus, regulation of coactivator recruitment by PPARs contributed to PPAR subtype specificity in the context of theUCP1 promoter. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Promega (Madison, WI). Cell culture media, fetal calf serum, and LipofectAMINE 2000 were obtained from Invitrogen. The synthetic PPARα ligand WY 14,643, 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), all-trans-retinoic acid, dexamethasone, insulin, and triiodothyronine were purchased from Sigma. Troglitazone (TZD) was from Sankyo (Tokyo, Japan), and SB 202190 was purchased from Calbiochem. The QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Dual Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega. The (−3846)UCP1-Luc plasmid in which the region from −3846 to + 71 of the human UCP1 gene drives the promoterless firefly luciferase gene was generated using 5′ CATACGCGTCAGCGATTTCTGATTGAACCACAGTT 3′ (−3846 to −3820) and 5′ CATCTCGAGAGTCCGATCCCCTCCTACCCAC 3′ (+49 to +71) as upper and lower primers to amplify a 3917-bp DNA fragment that was cloned into the pGL3-Basic Vector (Promega). Numbers in parentheses refer to primer positions relative to the transcriptional start site (GenBank™ accession number U28479). MluI andXhoI restriction enzymes sites introduced into the primer sequences are in boldface. The HindIII restriction site at nucleotide −3328 was used to generate the (−3328)UCP1-Luc deletion construct by subcloning a HindIII-XhoI fragment into the pGL3-Basic Vector. For construction of the U1-EN-Luc plasmid, a 249-bp fragment spanning nucleotides −3846 to −3598 was amplified using the upper primer described above and 5′-CATCTCGAGTCAGGTTGGAGAGAGCAGTAGG-3′ (−3820 to −3798) as lower primer. The resulting fragment was ligated into the pGL3-Promoter Vector (Promega). Mutations described by Gonzales-Barroso et al. (11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D.

A mammalian expression vector containing the human cDNA for PGC-1 driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (hPGC-1) was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of the entire PGC-1 coding region (27.Esterbauer H. Oberkofler H. Krempler F. Patsch W. Genomics. 1999; 62: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession numberAF106698). A 2340-bp cDNA fragment was amplified from human kidney total RNA using 5′ TTCAGGAGCTGGATGGCGTGGGAC 3′ and 5′ TTACCTGCGCAAGCTTCTCTGAGCTTC 3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and ligated into the pcDNA6/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen). The L2mutPGC-1 construct was derived from the original hPGC-1 expression construct by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using 5′ CTCTACTTAAGAAGGCCGCACTGGCACCAGCCAA 3′ and 5′ TTGGCTGGTGCCAGTGCGGCCTTCTTAAGTAGAG 3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Mutated nucleotides are in bold. A deletion construct encompassing amino acids 92–292 (ΔPGC-1-L2) was derived from the L2mutPGC-1 construct using 5′ ACTACTGCTAGCATGGTCCTCACAGAGACACTAGAC 3′ and 5′ CAGGTACCAGTTAGGCCTGCAGTTCCAG 3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The resulting cDNA fragment was cloned into pcDNA6/V5-HisA. NheI and KpnI restriction enzymes sites introduced into the primer sequences are in bold. All constructs described were verified by dye-terminator cycle sequencing using the ABI Prism™ 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). PAZ6 cells were cultured in preadipocyte medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 15 mm HEPES buffer. For differentiation, confluent PAZ6 preadipocytes were cultivated for 4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.1 μmdexamethasone, 850 nm insulin, 1 nmtriiodothyronine, and 1 μm troglitazone (28.Zilberfarb V. Pietri-Rouxel F. Jockers R. Krief S. Delouis C. Issad T. Strosberg A.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 801-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 3 h in preadipocyte medium without drugs before transfection. Drugs at concentrations of 10 μm for troglitazone, 9-cis-retinoic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid and WY 14,643 and 20 μm for SB 202190 were added immediately before transfection. Differentiated PAZ6 cells cultured in 24-well dishes were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. Unless otherwise indicated, we used 1 μg of reporter plasmids, 0.5 μg of expression plasmids, and 20 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) as transfection control. In dose-response experiments empty pGL3-Basic Vector was added to keep the amount of transfected DNA constant. Transfected differentiated cells were collected 24 h after transfection, and firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer (Anthos Labtec Instruments, Salzburg, Austria) using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Graphs are representative for one of two experiments, each performed in quadruplicate. Results are given as means ± S.D. Nuclear extracts from differentiated PAZ6 cells were prepared, and EMSAs were performed as described recently (29.Esterbauer H. Schneitler C. Oberkofler H. Ebenbichler C. Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Ladurner G. Hell E. Strosberg A.D. Patsch J.R. Krempler F. Patsch W. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded 41-mers containing wild-type and/or mutated hexamers C–E were prepared by annealing of gel-purified sense and antisense oligonucleotides. AnEcoRI overhang was filled in using [α-32P]dATP and Klenow enzyme. Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were mixed with binding buffer containing 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) and preincubated for 15 min at room temperature. After the preincubation period 32P-labeled wild-type 41-mer (∼20,000 counts/min) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. For competition experiments increasing concentrations of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were included during preincubation. To examine the role of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 in the regulation of the human UCP1 gene, we performed cotransfection studies in PAZ6 cells expressing a low level of endogenous PGC-1 (data not shown). A plasmid construct containing 3.9 kb of human UCP1 5′-flanking sequence fused to a luciferase reporter gene (−3846UCP1-Luc) was transiently transfected into differentiated PAZ6 cells. Cotransfection with an expression vector containing the entire coding region of human PGC-1 (hPGC-1) resulted in an up to 5-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the luciferase construct in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A andB). To delineate the regulatory region of the human UCP1 gene essential for this effect, transfection studies were performed using a plasmid construct (−3328UCP1-Luc) carrying a 5′-terminal deletion of a previously identified hormone-responsive enhancer element (11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGC-1-mediated coactivation of the human UCP1 gene was completely abolished upon removal of a 460-bp region (Fig. 1 A). According to Mar Gonzalez-Barroso et al.(11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this fragment harbors five potential hexamer-binding consensus sequences for nuclear hormone receptors including retinoic acid receptor (RAR), RXR, and PPARα/γ (hexamers B–E) as well as a potential cAMP-response element-binding protein site (hexamer A). We cloned this complex element into a promoter vector (U1-EN-Luc) containing the luciferase gene under the control of the SV-40 promoter and performed cotransfection studies in differentiated PAZ6 cells. Cotransfection with hPGC-1 resulted in an up to 3-fold increase in luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1,C and D). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the three hexamer sequences (shown in Fig. 2 A) previously found to be essential for the retinoic acid- and PPARγ-mediated up-regulation of the human UCP1 gene in a rodent cell line (11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed to characterize further the region responsible for PGC-1-mediated coactivation. Cotransfections with hPGC-1 showed that mutation of any of the three hexamer sequences resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity to basal levels (Fig. 1 C). Binding of nuclear proteins to a 41-mer containing hexamers C–E was demonstrated in EMSA studies. Specificity of binding was shown by competition with a 30-fold molar excess of wild-type DNA. Three different double-stranded oligonucleotides carrying the mutations described competed much less effectively than the wild-type probe (Fig. 2 B). These results are consistent with transfection studies showing that hexamers C—E were required for PGC-1-mediated transcriptional coactivation. PGC-1 coactivates a number of nuclear hormone receptors, some of which are also implicated in the regulation of theUCP1 gene (8.Barbera M.J. Schluter A. Pedraza N. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1486-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 20.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). We studied the potential effects of retinoids as well as PPARα and PPARγ agonists on PGC-1-mediated coactivation. RA and TZD both stimulated basal transcriptional activity of the U1-EN-Luc reporter construct in transiently transfected PAZ6 cells (Fig. 3 A), whereas no increase in luciferase activity was observed with the synthetic PPARα ligand WY 14,643. No additive effect of RA and TZD was observed, and a combination of RA and WY 14,643 did not enhance luciferase activity in comparison to untreated control cells (Fig. 3 A). Compared with RA treatment alone, reporter gene activity was significantly lower (p = 0.003, t test) after treatment with a combination of RA and WY 14,643. Cotransfection experiments with the hPGC-1 expression vector enhanced RA-mediated transcriptional activation ∼2.5-fold. This result was consistent with PGC-1 being a coactivator for RXR or RAR. Treatment of cotransfected cells with all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-retinoic acid resulted in a similar increase in luciferase activity arguing for a role of RAR in the PGC-1-mediated regulation of the UCP1 gene (Fig. 3 B). TZD treatment also stimulated UCP1 gene transcription in cotransfected PAZ6 cells, but no additive effect of RA and TZD was observed. Interestingly, a stimulatory effect of WY 14,643 was not observed in cells cotransfected with hPGC-1 (Fig. 3 A). Combined treatment of cotransfected cells with WY 14,643 and RA was as effective as treatment with RA alone. The L2 (LXXLL) motif has been shown to be essential for the interaction of PGC-1 with the ligand binding domain of several nuclear receptors including PPARα (24.Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), GR (21.Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), estrogen receptor (22.Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and thyroid hormone receptor (30.Wu Y. Delerive P. Chin W.W. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether the L2 motif in the human PGC-1 sequence is involved in transcriptional coactivation of the human UCP1 gene, the double leucine was substituted by a double alanine, a mutation known to disrupt leucine-rich interaction motifs (31.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Cotransfections of U1-EN-Luc reporter plasmid with the mutated PGC-1 expression construct (L2mutPGC-1) showed that the absence of an intact L2 motif did not alter the response to RA, TZD, or a combination of both drugs, but reduced the luciferase activity to control levels in response to a combination of RA and WY 14,643. Because such a dependence on an intact L2 motif was not observed after treatment with RA alone, the changes in transcriptional activities observed upon combined treatment with RA and WY 14,643 must, at least in part, have been mediated by PPARα (Fig. 4). Previous studies (21.Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a putative repressor negatively regulates the association between PGC-1 and GR. The L3 motif has been identified as a structural motif involved in repressor binding, whereas the association of PGC-1 with GR primarily depends on the L2 domain. The latter domain is also essential for the interaction between PGC-1 and PPARα. We therefore reasoned that a repressor mechanism could also regulate PPARα coactivation by PGC-1. We constructed a PGC-1 decoy molecule comprising amino acids 92–292 and harboring the disruptive substitution in the L2 motif, and we determined the ability of hPGC-1 to enhance the activity of the U1-EN-Luc reporter construct by RA, TZD, and WY 14,643 in the presence or absence of the decoy molecule. The decoy molecule had small effects on the transcriptional response to RA (3.01 ± 0.45 versus 4.10 ± 0.42-fold,p < 0.01), TZD (1.58 ± 0.26 versus2.72 ± 0.92-fold, p < 0.1), or TZD and RA (3.11 ± 0.56 versus 5.04 ± 0.82-fold,p < 0.02). The transcriptional response to combined treatment with RA and WY 14,643, however, was dramatically increased by the decoy molecule (3.17 ± 0.53 versus 10.35 ± 1.87-fold, p < 0.005). These results lend strong support for a selective competition of the repressor with PPARα for binding to PGC-1 (Fig. 5). p38 MAPK signaling has been shown to reduce the interaction of PGC-1 with the putative repressor thereby enhancing its coactivator function (26.Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-9718Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The PPARα-mediated transcriptional activation of the muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase I promoter was also enhanced by this signaling pathway (32.Barger P.M. Browning A.C. Garner A.N. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44495-44501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and was associated with phosphorylation of PPARα. We therefore studied the effect of the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB 202190 on the PGC-1-mediated coactivation of the human UCP1 gene. Cotransfection studies of U1-EN-Luc with hPGC-1 showed that SB 202190 had no effect on the transcriptional response to RA (2.41 ± 0.30versus 2.76 ± 0.52-fold, p < 0.6), TZD (1.97 ± 0.41 versus 1.92 ± 0.34-fold,p < 0.9), or RA and TZD (2.71 ± 0.45versus 2.01 ± 0.62-fold, p < 0.3), whereas the stimulatory response to combined treatment with RA and WY 14,643 was completely abolished (2.65 ± 0.82 versus0.64 ± 0.06-fold, p < 0.03) by the inhibitor (Fig. 6). PGC-1 transduces metabolic needs to the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, adaptive thermogenesis, and respiration (20.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar, 33.Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A.

Because of these important physiological functions, it is not surprising that the PGC-1 gene locus has recently been linked to human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity (34.Ek J. Andersen G.

PGC-1 has been shown to interact with numerous members of the nuclear hormone receptor family in a ligand-dependent or a ligand-independent manner (20.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of PGC-1 target genes, includingGLUT4 and UCP1, are regulated by several transcription factors that all can associate with PGC-1 (36.Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This raises an intriguing question regarding the regulation of coactivator recruitment and activity. In an effort to approach this problem, we used the BAT-specificUCP1 promoter and PAZ6 cells derived from human brown adipocytes that express both PPARα and PPARγ. We mapped the UCP1 region required for PGC-1-mediated coactivation to a multipartite response element described previously (11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these authors were unable to observe coactivation of UCP1 by PGC-1 in a heterologous system, others (8.Barbera M.J. Schluter A. Pedraza N. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1486-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 9.Sears I.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified a PPRE that served as a promiscuous site for PPARα- and PPARγ-mediated transactivation in the rodentUCP1 upstream enhancer. The respective response element regions in the rodent and human genes exhibit 81% homology. Five hexamer motifs have been identified within the human UCP1enhancer region that match consensus sequences for nuclear hormone receptor-binding sites (11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our mutational analyses of the three most likely cis regulatory regions for PPARα and PPARγ transactivation indicated that all three sequences were essential for PGC-1-mediated coactivation. Furthermore, functional studies demonstrated that PGC-1 was involved in the stimulatory effect of nuclear receptor ligands. RA evoked a stronger transcriptional response than TZD both in the presence and absence of PGC-1, whereas treatment with the PPARα ligand did not alter transcriptional activities compared with the respective controls. However, a striking stimulatory effect of the PPARα agonist WY 14,643 was observed in the presence of RA and after trapping the putative repressor with a decoy molecule (Fig. 5). That RA was required in addition to WY 14,643 may be related to a low intrinsic amount of RA in PAZ6 cells. Studies in a mouse BAT-derived cell line showing that RA was necessary for stimulation of the human UCP1 promoter by isoproterenol and/or TZD are consistent with our results (11.Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Irrespective of the specific role of RA, we propose that PPAR subtype specificity is not only determined by the relative amounts of ligands, transcription factors, and coactivators but also depends on a repressor mechanism, which was originally postulated to control the interaction of PGC-1 with GR (25.Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The putative PGC-1 repressor specifically interfered with PPARα-mediated up-regulation of the UCP1gene. Expression of a decoy construct providing excess binding surface for the repressor in trans significantly increased the response to PPARα agonist treatment, whereas little or no effect on PPARγ agonist or retinoic acid stimulation was observed. Despite the specificity of the putative repressor for PGC-1/PPARα interactions, RA-induced increases in reporter gene activity were abolished upon costimulation with RA and WY 14,643 of cells not transfected with PGC-1 (Fig. 3) or transfected with the L2-mutated PGC-1 construct (Fig. 4). In contrast, the RA induced reporter gene activity was not altered by the addition of WY 14,643 when cells were transfected with wild-type PGC-1. Thus, the amount of wild-type PGC-1 relative to the amount of repressor affected the transcriptional response to combined treatment with both ligands. Hence, binding of ligand-activated PPARα−RXR heterodimers to the multipartite response element might inhibit binding of, and transactivation by, other transcription factors if the stoichiometry favors trapping of PGC-1 by the repressor. As a result, PPARα−RXR heterodimers could become functional repressors for other transcriptional responses. Signaling via the p38 MAPK pathway positively regulates the PGC-1-mediated coactivation of the GR by reducing the repressor/PGC-1 interaction (26.Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-9718Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Upon inhibition of p38 MAPK, we observed a complete shutdown of the PGC-1-mediated transcriptional response to combined treatment with RA and WY 14,643, whereas responses to RA and TZD alone or in combination were not affected. These results are consistent with regulation of the repressor/PGC-1 interaction by p38 MAPK but inhibition of PPARα phosphorylation may also play a role (32.Barger P.M. Browning A.C. Garner A.N. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44495-44501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Stimulation of rodent UCP1 transcription by cAMP is protein kinase-dependent but can be abrogated by inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling (37.Cao W. Medvedev A.V. Daniel K.W. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27077-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Whether the permissive role of p38 MAPK signaling in the context of UCP1 transactivation by cAMP-response element-binding protein is related to the control of PGC-1/repressor interactions is not known. Very recently, cytokines have been shown to activate PGC-1 through phosphorylation by p38 MAPK. As a result, respiration and the expression of genes involved in energy expenditure were increased in muscle cells (38.Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J. Wu Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by p38 MAPK enhanced the half-life of PGC-1, but only part of the responses observed could be attributed to an increased PGC-1 tissue level. Interestingly, the three amino acid residues phosphorylated by p38 MAPK are all located within or close to the PGC-1 surface implicated in the interaction with the putative repressor.

PGC-1 enhances RXR-mediated transcription, and the L2 motif of PGC-1 is required for coactivation of RXR (23.Delerive P. Wu Y. Burris T.P. Chin W.W. Suen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3913-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because PGC-1-dependent transcriptional responses were similar after stimulation with 9-cis- and all-trans-retinoic acids (Fig. 3), PGC-1 must have acted as transcriptional coactivator for the RAR. Moreover, comparable reporter gene activities were observed in response to 9-cis-retinoic acid treatment of cells transfected with wild-type or L2-mutated PGC-1 (Fig. 4). Thus, in contrast to RXR-dependent transactivation, RAR-mediated transactivation appears to be independent of the L2 domain. In conclusion, our data, consistent with other studies, suggest a model whereby PPAR subtype-specific interactions with PGC-1 are regulated by a putative repressor. Furthermore, p38 MAPK signaling might control PPARα subtype specificity via modulation of the PGC-1/repressor interaction and/or perhaps direct stimulation of PPARα activity. Whether such a model is restricted to the regulation of theUCP1 gene in brown adipocytes or is also valid for other PPRE-containing genes expressed in other cell types with PPARα and PPARγ activity remains to be determined. Clearly, the identification and characterization of the putative repressor will be essential for further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2011172253,"Rab3 proteins are believed to play an important role in regulated exocytosis and previous work has demonstrated the presence of Rab3D on pancreatic zymogen granules. To further understand the function of Rab3D in acinar cell exocytosis, adenoviral constructs were prepared encoding hemagglutinin-tagged wild type Rab3D and three mutant forms, N135I and T36N (both deficient in guanine nucleotide binding) and Q81L (deficient in GTP hydrolysis), which also expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by a separate promoter. When isolated mouse pancreatic acini were cultured with 5 × 106pfu/ml adenovirus, nearly 100% of acini were infected as visualized by expression of green fluorescent protein. Cultured acini showed a biphasic dose-response to cholecystokinin (CCK); basal amylase secretion was 1.8 ± 0.3%/30 min, peak release was 7.3 ± 0.2%/30 min at 30 pm CCK and reduced secretion was observed at higher CCK concentrations. Control β-galactosidase virus infection had no effect on either basal or CCK-induced secretion in the titer range from 0.5 to 10 × 106 pfu/ml. While the expression of Rab3D and Rab3D Q81L had no effect on amylase secretion, Rab3D N135I and T36N functioned as dominant negative mutants and inhibited CCK-induced amylase release by 40–50% at all points on the CCK dose-response curve from 3 to 300 pm. Inhibition was stronger during the first 5 min (71 ± 5%) than over 30 min (36%±5%). Similar inhibition was found using other agonists including bombesin, carbachol, A23187, and cAMP. Localization of adenoviral expressed Rab protein showed wild type Rab3D localized to zymogen granules. The two dominant negative mutants did not localize to granules and were primarily in the basolateral region of the cell. Since both dominant negative Rab3D mutants had no effect on intracellular calcium increase induced by CCK, it is unlikely that they acted at receptors or transmembrane signaling. These results suggest that Rab3D plays an important role in regulating the terminal steps of acinar exocytosis and that this effect is greatest on the early phase of amylase release.

These results suggest that Rab3D plays an important role in regulating the terminal steps of acinar exocytosis and that this effect is greatest on the early phase of amylase release. Pancreatic acinar cells are the functional unit of digestive enzyme secretion and have long been used as a model to study the packaging and secretion of secretory proteins and its control by neurotransmitters and hormones (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 2Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3Jamieson J.D. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 135-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The major intracellular signaling pathway leading to acinar secretion of stored proteins in most species is an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (4Yule D. Williams J.A. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract: Stimulus-Secretion Coupling in the Pancreatic Acinus. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 5Williams J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Whereas the details of transmembrane and intracellular signaling pathways leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ have been well investigated, much less is known of the downstream events leading to the release of digestive enzymes by zymogen granule exocytosis. This process is believed to share basic mechanism with other vesicular fusion systems from yeast to neurons (6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Current models of membrane fusion have been dominated by the consideration of two types of proteins: small G proteins of the Rab family and SNARE proteins. Small GTPases of the Rab/Ypt family form the largest branch of the Ras-related small G-protein superfamily and are recognized as key protein components involved in vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells (6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 7Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rab proteins act as molecular switches which cycle between the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms. As with other small G proteins, the conversion from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form is stimulated by a Rab GEF 1The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorHAhemagglutininCCKcholecystokininEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinCMVcytomegalovirusHRHepes-Ringer 1The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorHAhemagglutininCCKcholecystokininEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinCMVcytomegalovirusHRHepes-Ringer (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and the conversion of the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form is catalyzed by a Rab GTPase-activating protein (8Segev N.

Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of Rab3 exist, denoted A through D, with different members present in different tissues. Rab3A and Rab3C are both associated with synaptic vesicles and secretory granules in brain and neuroendocrine cells (7Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rab3B is expressed in epithelial cells (10Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A., St John P. Green M.W.

Vincent J.D. Mason W.T. Zorec R. Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Rab3D was recently found in pancreatic acinar cells and other exocrine cells (12Ohnishi H.

Whereas several different approaches indicate that Rab3A is a negative modulator of exocytosis, there is also evidence that Rab3B and Rab3D are positive regulators of secretion (11Lledo P.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 129-136PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that Rab3D is the only detectable Rab3 isoform in pancreatic acini and is localized on zymogen granules. The secretory granule localization of Rab3D in various exocrine cells implies that it may be involved in regulated exocytosis. Recently, direct evidence has suggested that Rab3D may play a positive role in regulated exocytosis. Baldini et al. (22Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that expression of Rab3D N135I, a dominant negative Rab3D mutant, inhibited positioning of dense core granule near the plasma membrane and blocked regulated secretion of mature ACTH in AtT-20 cells. However, they also found that the expression of this mutated Rab3D impaired the membrane association of endogenous Rab3A in AtT-20 cells, and hypothesized that this alteration in Rab3A may be at least one of the defects that inhibits exocytosis of dense core granules in AtT-20 cells. In pancreatic acini, Onishi et al. (20Ohnishi H. Samuelson L.C. Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3044-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Rab3D enhanced the initial phase of regulated amylase secretion from pancreatic acini of transgenic mice. The authors suggested that further overexpression of mutant Rab molecules affecting the GTPase cycle was necessary to understand the regulation of exocytosis by Rab3D. We have now overexpressed in vitro Rab3D mutants that interfere with the Rab3D GTP/GDP cycle in pancreatic acinar cells and investigated their effect on acinar exocytosis. We utilized adenoviral constructs encoding HA-tagged wild type Rab3D and three mutant forms: N135I and T36N (both deficient in guanine nucleotide binding) and Q81L (deficient in GTP hydrolysis) (23Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Burstein E.S. Brondyk W.H. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22715-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and compared the effect of their expression on amylase secretion. We found that both Rab3D mutants, N135I and T36N, functioned as dominant negative mutants and inhibited regulated exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells, preferentially in the early phase of secretion. In contrast to wild type Rab3D which was localized to zymogen granules, the two dominant negative mutants did not localize to granules and were primarily in the basolateral region of the cell. Collagenase (CLSPA grade) was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals (Freehold, NJ); protein G-agarose beads from Pierce (Rockford, IL); [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) fromAmersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ); CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) from Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ); CPT-cAMP from Sigma; A23187 fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA); Fura-2/AM from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-Rab3D antisera was a gift from Dr. Mark McNiven (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 and rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody 3F10 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). All other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. The recombinant adenoviruses encoding the wild type and mutant Rab3D were produced according to the method of He et al. (25He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HA-tagged wild type and mutant mouse Rab3D cDNAs were cloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, linearized, and co-transformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells along with the adenoviral backbone vector pAdEasy-1. Recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analyses. Finally, linearized recombinant plasmid was transfected into an adenovirus packaging cell line, HEK293 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were collected 7 to 12 days after infection and were concentrated using a CsCl gradient. The shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV also encodes EGFP driven by a separate CMV promoter and thus the titers of the viral stocks were estimated by counting EGFP-expressing cells. An adenovirus (AdLacZ) expressing bacterial β-galactosidase and EGFP, each under the control of a separate CMV promoter, was a gift from Dr. He (John Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD) and used as a control. Rab3D T36N, N135I, and Q81L mutants were created using QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Pancreatic acini were isolated from male ICR mice by collagenase digestion as previously described (26Williams J.A. Korc M. Dormer R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated acini from two pancreases were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and divided into four or five 150-mm Petri dishes each containing 30 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and antibiotics, and incubated at 37 °C for 4–20 h. In the viral infection experiments, either control β-galactosidase or various Rab3D adenoviruses were added at a specified titer, usually 5 × 106 pfu/ml, to the culture medium at the beginning of the incubation. After incubation for 9 h, cultured acini were allowed to settle by gravity, resuspended in Hepes-Ringer buffer containing essential amino acids, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, and then incubated with various concentration of CCK. After the specified time the acinar suspension was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge and supernatant assayed for amylase activity using Phadebas reagent (Amersham Biosciences and Upjohn) as described previously (26Williams J.A. Korc M. Dormer R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as a percentage of initial acinar amylase content. The data presented are the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated by the Student's t test with p< 0.05 representing significance. As previously described (27Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isolated acini were incubated with 1 μm fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed and resuspended in fresh HR buffer. For measurement of intracellular Ca2+, fura-2-loaded acini were allowed to stick to a coverslip, transferred to a low volume closed chamber mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope, and continuously superfused at 1 ml/min with 37 °C HR buffer alone or HR buffer containing 300 pmCCK. Solution changes were accomplished rapidly by means of a valve attached to an 8-chambered superfusion reservoir. Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ was performed using an Attofluor digital imaging system and software (Rockville, MD). Under the conditions used, the presence of EGFP in acini did not interfere with the fura-2 signal or calculated intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Lysates of cultured acini were prepared in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and supplemented with the proteinase inhibitors: 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). An aliquot of sample was mixed with 4 × SDS stop solution (final concentrations 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Acinar samples (20 μg of protein/lane) were then loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis ready gels (Bio-Rad). After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 55 V for 1 h on ice. Western blotting was then carried out as previously described (20Ohnishi H. Samuelson L.C. Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 3044-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (0.4 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. ECL chemiluminescence reagents were used to visualize the secondary antibody. HA-tagged wild type and mutant Rab3D proteins were immunoprecipitated from the corresponding acinar lysate (1 mg of protein) by incubation with 4 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight. Protein G-agarose beads (20 μl) were added to each sample and incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and after three washes, SDS sample buffer was added. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Following the procedure of Bhullar et al. (28Bhullar R.P. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the transfer blot was soaked for 20 min in GTP binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 12 μm MgSO4, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm MgATP, 0.3% Tween 20) and then incubated with 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP in fresh GTP binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After five 10-min washes with fresh buffer, the membrane was autoradiographed for 6 h at −70 °C. Control and virus-treated pancreatic mouse acini were allowed to settle in test tubes and then were fixed for 2 h at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde (prepared from paraformaldehyde) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Acinar preparations were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, cryoprotected, and frozen with isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen as previously described (12Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar). Cryostat sections (6-μm thick) were mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fischer Scientific) and processed as previously described in detail for immunofluorscence localization (12Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000 to 1:2000) and rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:100). HA localization patterns were identical with these antibodies; in later experiments, the monoclonal antibody was generally used as it gave a slightly better signal. Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) and anti-rat IgG (diluted 1:200 to 1:600). Slides were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Digitized images were generally collected as a Z-series (0.5 μm steps). A single image from the Z-stack was then chosen (based on the most informative and sharpest fluorescence) and processed using Photoshop 5.5 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Adenovirus-mediated HA-Rab3D expression was examined by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody and found to be viral titer- and incubation time-dependent. When the incubation time was fixed at 9 h, the amount of expression increased with virus titer (Fig. 1 top panel). When the viral titer was fixed at 5 × 106 pfu/ml, expression was detected between 4 and 6 h, was significantly increased at 9 h, and gradually reached a plateau after 12 h (Fig. 1,bottom panel). To obtain adequate overexpression but also preserve acinar polarity and responsiveness, 9 h was used as a standard incubation time period. Since the recombinant adenoviral vector also encodes EGFP under the control of a separate CMV promoter, the efficiency of viral infection can be assessed by monitoring EGFP fluorescence in acinar cells. For the viral titer used in most experiments (5 × 106 pfu/ml), nearly 100% of acini displayed EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 2), although not all individual cells were fluorescent as shown latter by confocal microscopy. These data demonstrate the ability to express exogenous protein in acinar cells using recombinant adenovirus. Next we tested whether adenoviral infection itself affected acinar secretion using adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase as control (Fig. 3). Control adenoviral infection had no effect on either basal or CCK-induced amylase release within the titer range examined from 5 × 105 to 107pfu/ml.Figure 2Adenovirus efficiently infects isolated pancreatic acini. After a 9-h incubation with 5 × 106 pfu/ml HA-Rab3D adenovirus, acini were placed in a culture dish with a glass coverslip bottom. Fluorescence and bright field images were captured using a ×10 objective with a Spot digital camera. The efficiency of adenoviral infection was estimated by comparing the fluorescent and bright field images within the same field.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Control adenovirus infection had no effect on either basal or CCK-induced amylase release.

The mutants T36N (threonine at position 36 substituted by asparagine) and N135I (asparagine at position 135 substituted by isoleucine) were both expected to have reduced affinity for guanine nucleotides (23Brondyk W.H.

The mutant Q81L (glutamine at position 81 substituted by leucine) is deficient in GTP hydrolysis and should persist in the GTP bound conformation for longer time than the wild type protein (23Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression and GTP binding activity of the wild type and three mutants Rab3D are shown in Fig. 4. When 5 × 106 pfu/ml and 9 h were used as the standard viral titer and incubation time, all four HA-Rab3D proteins were expressed in acinar cells in equivalent amounts (Fig. 4), and were properly isoprenylated as indicated by partitioning into the detergent phase upon Triton X-114 phase separation (data not shown). Consistent with the observations of others (16Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18113-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Rab3D N135I seemed to have higher mobility on SDS-PAGE than the other three constructs. The expression of the four Rab3D constructs and β-galactosidase control adenovirus led to equivalent EGFP expression by Western blotting (data not shown). While the wild type and Q81L mutant Rab3D showed strong GTP binding, the other two Rab3D mutants, N135I and T36N, had undetectably low GTP binding activities. The effect of expressing the four Rab3D proteins on amylase release was then compared (Fig. 5). Amylase release from each group, stimulated by 30 pm CCK for the 30-min incubation period, is shown after the basal release had been subtracted. While the expression of wild type Rab3D and the Q81L mutant had no effect, the N135I and T36N mutants inhibited CCK-induced amylase release by 45 ± 1 and 47 ± 3%, respectively. Given their deficiency in GTP binding, the Rab3D mutants, N135I and T36N, thus behave as dominant negative mutants.Figure 5Dominant negative Rab3D mutants inhibit CCK-induced amylase release. Isolated acini were incubated with 5 × 106 pfu/ml of either control β-galactosidase, wild type, or mutant Rab3D adenovirus for 9 h. Amylase release during a subsequent 30 min incubation with or without 30 pmCCK was measured. Basal secretion was subtracted and 30 pmCCK induced secretion was compared among different groups. Results are means and S.E. for three to five independent experiments. **,p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since in normal acini the CCK dose-response curve is biphasic and characterized by supermaximal inhibition of secretion, we determined if the inhibition by dominant negative Rab3D mutants affected the biphasic shape of the CCK dose-response curve. In the cultured acini with control viral infection, amylase release was stimulated by 3 pm CCK, reached a maximum at 30 pm, and showed reduced release (supermaximal inhibition) at 300 pm (Fig. 6). Adenoviral expression of wild type Rab3D had no effect at any CCK concentration, but Rab3D T36N inhibited secretion across the CCK dose-response curve with preservation of the biphasic shape. Dominant negative Rab3D mutant N135I showed identical results as Rab3D T36N (data not shown). It is well known that the time course of stimulated amylase release has two phases with the highest rate of secretion in the early phase (during the first 5–10 min) and thereafter a slower or late phase. We therefore examined whether the inhibition by the dominant negative Rab3D mutants was greater during the early or late phase. Fig. 7 shows that the inhibition was stronger when measured at 5 min (71 ± 5%) than at 30 min (36 ± 5%). In contrast to the early phase of stimulated amylase release which is almost completely blocked, the late phase was unaffected (Fig. 7, inset). A similar result was seen from the Rab3D N135I virus treated group but not from either wild type or the Q81L virus-treated group (data not shown). Thus dominant negative Rab3D mutants preferentially inhibit the early phase of stimulated amylase secretion.Figure 7Dominant negative Rab3D mutants inhibit amylase release preferentially during the early phase. Isolated acini were incubated with 5 × 106 pfu/ml of either β-galactosidase (filled symbols) or Rab3D T36N (open symbols) adenovirus for 9 h. Acini were then resuspended in fresh buffer and incubated with (circles) or without (triangles) 30 pm CCK for the indicated period of time. Results are mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments. When error bars are not shown they were smaller than the size of the symbol. The inset shows 30 pm CCK induced secretion (with basal secretion subtracted) during the first 5 min and during the period from 20 to 30 min comparing the effect of β-galactosidase (filled bars) and Rab3D T36N (hatched bars) groups. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image"

The γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor-associated protein GABARAP was reported to have an important role for movement and sorting of GABAA receptor molecules to the postsynaptic membrane. GABARAP not only binds to GABAA receptor γ2-subunit but also to tubulin, gephyrin, and ULK1. We present for the first time the high resolution structure of human GABARAP determined by nuclear magnetic resonance in aqueous solution. One part of the molecule, despite being well ordered and rigid on a MHz time scale, exists in at least two different conformations that interchange with each other on a time scale slower than 25 Hz. An important feature of the solution structure is the observation that amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the protein directly interact with each other, which is not seen in recently reported crystal structures. The possible biological relevance of these observations for the regulation of GABARAP interactions and functions is discussed.

Rapid signaling at synapses between neurons are mediated by small molecules called neurotransmitters. Among neurotransmitters, the most prominent are acetylcholine and glutamate for excitatory synapses and glycine and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABAγ-aminobutyric acidGABAAGABA type AGABARAPGABAA receptor-associated proteinLC-3light chain-3MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopyHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationE1ubiquitin-activating enzymefor inhibitory synapses, respectively. Receptors for these neurotransmitters are important targets for drugs used to treat mental disorders or to modulate sleep and mood. The principal GABA-gated ion channel is the GABA type A (GABAA) receptor.

Sorting, targeting, clustering, and degradation of neurotransmitter receptors as dynamic processes play a key role in the construction and functional maintenance of synapses. Recently a novel protein was identified as a binding partner for the γ2-subunit of GABAA receptor, termed GABARAP (GABAA receptor-associated protein) (1.Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). GABARAP is also reported to bind tubulin (1.Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), gephyrin (2.Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and ULK1 (3.Okazaki N. Yan J. Yuasa S. Ueno T. Kominami E. Masuho Y. Koga H. Muramatsu M. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 1-12Google Scholar). It is closely related to light chain-3 (LC-3) of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B (MAP-1A and -1B) and to the “late acting intra-Golgi transport factor,” termed GATE-16, of which crystal structures are known (4.Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast to GABARAP, however, GATE-16 does not interact with gephyrin and GABAA receptor γ2-subunit (2.Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wassle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). GABARAP is postulated to have an important role for early steps in movement and sorting of GABAA receptors (5.Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and for GABAAreceptor clustering at the postsynaptic membrane. Binding affinity of GABA to GABAA receptors as well as kinetics of inactivation and desensitization of the receptors are dependent on the clustering state of the GABA receptor, which was reported to be strongly modulated by GABARAP (6.Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Modulation of GABARAP binding to its interaction partners provides a new avenue for pharmacological intervention of receptor activity and neurotransmitter action at the synapse. We and others therefore started a detailed structural investigation of GABARAP. The first available crystal structure of GABARAP (7.Knight D. Harris R. McAllister M.S.B. Phelan J.P. Geddes S. Moss S.J. Driscoll P.C. Keep N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5556-5561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) turned out to be very similar to the crystal structures of GATE-16 (4.Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which is not very surprising since sequence identity between both proteins is 57%. GATE-16 and the GABARAP crystal structures resemble ubiquitin folds with two additional amino-terminal helices. A difference in GATE-16 in the putatively flexible carboxyl-terminal residues and smaller differences in helix 2 and loop regions were found. An additional two different crystal structures of GABARAP are reported but not deposited in the Protein Data Bank (8.Coyle J.E. Qamar S. Rajeshankar K.R. Nikolov D.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) rendering them impossible to be studied in detail and compared with other structures. Coyle et al. (8.Coyle J.E. Qamar S. Rajeshankar K.R. Nikolov D.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) obtained the structures from two different crystal forms. One structure is reported to resemble closely that of GATE-16. The other crystal form was obtained under high salt conditions in which helix 1 is flipped by ∼180°, pointing away from the rest of the molecule and contacting the neighboring molecule in the crystal in a head to tail fashion. Whether this polymerized state of GABARAP might be of physiological relevance is not clear. GABARAP was expressed and purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Thrombin (Merck) cleavage was performed yielding full-length GABARAP with additional glycine and serine residues at its amino terminus. Details of cloning, protein expression, and purification of GABARAP have been described elsewhere (9.Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Dingley A.J. Luge C. Willbold D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). NMR samples contained 0.8 mmprotein in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 6.9, in 95% H2O, 5% D2O with 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% (by weight) sodium azide, and 50 μmEDTA. NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer equipped with a triple-axis pulse-field gradient1H/15N/13C probe at proton frequencies of 600 and 750 MHz. The resonance assignment of GABARAP was described previously (9.Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Dingley A.J. Luge C. Willbold D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Structural constraints were derived from15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (100-ms mixing time) (10.Zuiderweg E.R. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2387-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (80-ms) experiments (11.Muhandiram D.R. Farrow N.A. Xu G.-Y. Smallcombe S.H. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Res. 1993; 102B: 317-321Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in the described buffer, and aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (120-ms) and aromatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (120-ms) experiments with protein in the buffer after replacement of H2O by D2O. Uniformly13C-15N-labeled protein was used for these experiments. 15N-Labeled protein was used for the1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments (12.Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Based on the almost complete assignment of 1H, 13C, and15N resonances of GABARAP, a total of 4577 NOE distance constraints (including 1375 long range NOEs) could be derived from three-dimensional NOESY spectra in an iterative procedure (Table I). NOE analysis and assignment were performed using NMRView (13.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) and ARIA (14.Nilges M. O'Donoghue S.I. Prog. NMR. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interproton distances were used directly to calibrate experimental peaks and to extract distance constraints. Lower and upper bounds for distance constraints were derived from the target distances empirically by estimation of the error as 12.5% of the target distance squared. Distances involving ambiguous constraints, methyl groups, aromatic ring protons, and the nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons were treated as sum of separate contributions to the target function, known as “sum averaging” (15.Nilges M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Table IConstraints and structural statistics for the resulting 15 NMR structures of GABARAPNumber of experimental restraints Total number of assigned NOEs4577 Intraresidue (‖i − j‖ = 0)1448 Interresidue sequential (‖i − j‖ = 1)885 Interresidue medium range (1 < ‖i −j‖ ≤ 5)869 Long range (‖i −j‖ > 5)1375CNS energies (kcal/mol) Total259.19 ± 5.91 Bond12.08 ± 0.53 Angle95.04 ± 2.76 Impropers12.85 ± 0.79 van der Waals99.55 ± 3.58 NOE39.68 ± 2.17r.m.s.d. to the mean structure (nm) Backbone heavy atoms0.049 ± 0.017 All heavy atoms0.105 ± 0.014r.m.s.d. to experimental constraints and idealized geometry NOE (nm)0.00097 ± 0.00002 Bond (nm)0.00024 ± 0.00001 Angle (°)0.4126 ± 0.0060 Impropers (°)0.2791 ± 0.0086Φ, Ψ angles consistent with Ramachandran plot (%) Most favored regions72.6 Allowed regions96.8 Generously allowed regions98.4 Open table in a new tab Final structures were calculated using the simulated annealing protocol with the program CNS version 1.0 (16.Brünger A.T.

For conformational space sampling 20 ps with a time step of 10 fs were simulated using torsion angle dynamics at a temperature of 50,000 K followed by 30 ps of slow cooling to 0 K with a time step of 15 fs. In an additional Cartesian slow cooling stage, the temperature was decreased in 20 ps from 2000 to 0 K with a time step of 5 fs. After simulated annealing the structures were subjected to 2000 steps of energy minimization. A total of 15 structures that did not show any distance constraint violation of more than 0.0175 nm was used for further analysis. Geometry of the structures, structural parameters, and secondary structure elements were analyzed and visualized using the programs MOLMOL (17.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), PROCHECK (18.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1KOT. Earlier we reported almost complete assignments for backbone and side chain 1H,13C, and 15N resonances of human GABARAP (9.Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Dingley A.J. Luge C. Willbold D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Simultaneously backbone resonance assignments were reported by others (20.Harris R. McAllister M.S.B. Sankar A. Phelan J.P. Moss S.J. Keep N.H. Driscoll P.C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Reinspection of the spectra allowed us to increase especially the extent of backbone 1H and 15N amide resonance assignments to 98%. Only amide resonances of Val6 and Asp102 eluded their assignment. A total of 4577 NOE distance constraints, including 1375 long range NOEs (Table I), derived from three-dimensional 15N- or 13C-edited NOESY spectra recorded from uniformly 15N and 13C isotope-labeled recombinantly expressed GABARAP protein was taken as input for simulated annealing and refinement calculations. No other constraints were used. Together 15 structures were obtained that did not show any NOE distance violation greater than 0.0175 nm. The root mean square deviation of these 15 structures relative to their average structure was 0.049 and 0.105 nm for backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. That means the resulting structure is rather well defined as seen in the overlay of all 15 protein backbones (Fig. 1A). The structure of GABARAP exhibits a compact fold consisting of a four-stranded β-sheet with two α-helices on either side (Fig. 1B). Similar to the ubiquitin fold, the outer strands of the β-sheet are aligned antiparallel to the inner strands, which are parallel to each other, and helices α3 and α4 are located on one side of the sheet. In addition to the ubiquitin fold, GABARAP contains two additional helices, α1 and α2, that are located on the opposite side of the β-sheet relative to α3 and α4. Average local displacement values relative to the mean structure are a measure for the precision of the derived family of structures. Large values indicate either local flexibility of the protein or lack of experimental data for this region. Average local displacement values of the GABARAP solution structure indicate the regions Asp45–Lys47, Leu70–Glu73, and Glu101–Leu105 of the protein to be less defined (Fig. 2A). The first two regions also have slightly decreased heteronuclear NOE values (Fig. 2B) indicating increased dynamic behavior.1H-15N heteronuclear amide NOE values are a measure for the dynamics of the local environment within the time scale of the absolute NMR frequencies (60–750 MHz in the present study). Overall the solution structure is very similar to that of the GABARAP crystal structure (7.Knight D. Harris R. McAllister M.S.B. Phelan J.P. Geddes S. Moss S.J. Driscoll P.C. Keep N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5556-5561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Notable differences between the solution structure and all deposited crystal structures of GABARAP and GATE-16 map to residues 2–14, 37–46, 66–75, and 113–117. The first region largely overlaps with residues that appear in the NMR spectra as broadened and split resonances. Regions 37–46 and 66–75 coincide with those shown to have slightly increased mobility as inferred from heteronuclear NOE data (Fig. 2B). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) value for the backbone coordinates of residues 1–112 is 0.134 nm between GABARAP solution and crystal structure (7.Knight D. Harris R. McAllister M.S.B. Phelan J.P. Geddes S. Moss S.J. Driscoll P.C. Keep N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5556-5561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as 0.139 and 0.151 nm for GABARAP solution structure and GATE-16 crystal structures (4.Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The coordinates for the very carboxyl-terminal residues, however, differ remarkably. Backbone amide resonances of a number of residues showed up in the NMR spectra as broadened and split lines, indicating conformational exchange on an intermediate and slow time scale. Due to the lack of concentration dependence, the observed phenomenon could not be assigned to a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The respective residues map to completely different sequence regions (Val4–Lys20 without Glu12 and Ser16, His99–Leu105 without Phe103, and Lys47) that are all close to each other in space (Fig. 1C). The first region encompasses helix α1 and a large portion of helix α2, and the second region belongs to the loop between helix α4 and strand β4. The carboxyl-terminal Leu105 of the second region exhibits a split backbone amide resonance, but the corresponding proton is involved in stable β-sheet-like secondary structure hydrogen bonding with the Pro30 backbone carbonyl oxygen as suggested by inspection of the structure and the stability of the Leu105 amide proton in hydrogen exchange experiments (data not shown). Lys47 is located next to the amino terminus of strand β2, and its side chain protrudes to the amino terminus of helix α1, thus obviously opposing the dipole of helix α1. Phe103, Glu12, and Ser16 appear not to be affected by line broadening or splitting. Also the amino-terminal residues Met1, Lys2, and Phe3 are not visibly affected by conformational exchange phenomena. To estimate the time scale for a potential exchange between the different conformations corresponding to the different observed sets of resonances, the frequency distance for several pairs of split amide resonances were measured. Some of them (Arg15 and Lys20) yielded values of 25 and 27 Hz, respectively. That leads to the conclusion that, under the conditions used in the present study, any exchange between the conformers is slower than 25 Hz. Interestingly all residues involved in this conformational exchange are spatially close to Pro10. This residue is discussed as the hinge for the interchange between two different conformations yielded for GABARAP under different crystallization conditions (8.Coyle J.E. Qamar S. Rajeshankar K.R. Nikolov D.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Comparing both conformations relative to each other, helix α1 is flipped by ∼180° at residue Pro10. The potential of conformational changes around Pro10 is principally in accordance with the dynamics observations obtained for the GABARAP solution structure. However, the proposed head to tail polymerization could not be observed under the conditions used in the present study. GABARAP and GATE-16 crystal structures indicate that the carboxyl-terminal part of the respective molecule is not an integral part of the protein scaffold. In the publicly accessible crystal structures of GABARAP and the two GATE-16 conformers the carboxyl termini differ significantly among themselves and compared with the solution structure. This may be due to different favorable crystal contacts of the carboxyl-terminal end observed in the crystal structures (4.Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7.Knight D. Harris R. McAllister M.S.B. Phelan J.P. Geddes S. Moss S.J. Driscoll P.C. Keep N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5556-5561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inspection of the solution structure of GABARAP reveals that the hydroxyl oxygen of the Tyr115 phenolic ring is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone amide nitrogen of Lys2 (Fig. 3). Furthermore Tyr115 is involved in a network of hydrophobic interactions. The methyl groups of Met1, Ala36, Ala108, and Leu117, as well as the side chain of Pro37, form a hydrophobic pocket for Tyr115 as evidenced by a large number of direct NOE observations between these residues. In addition to Tyr115 and Leu117, most of the carboxyl-terminal residues are involved in numerous direct NOE-observable contacts to residues of the amino terminus and the loop connecting β-strands β1 and β2. Thus, clearly the carboxyl-terminal residues of GABARAP are an integral part of the globular and compact structure of GABARAP. Throughout the GABARAP and GATE-16 family of proteins, Phe115 appears to be highly conserved (4.Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GABARAP itself and a Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of GATE-16 are the only remarkable exceptions, containing a tyrosine at this position. Stabilizing the closed conformation of the carboxyl terminus in the GABARAP solution structure using a hydrogen bond in addition to hydrophobic interactions might therefore be a unique feature of GABARAP that is, however, not observed in the reported crystal structure.1H-15N NOE data confirm that Tyr115does not exhibit a decreased heteronuclear NOE (Fig. 2B) as would be expected for a residue not rigidly connected to the globular fold of the protein. The carboxyl terminus of GABARAP may play a decisive role in the biological function of the protein. GABARAP as well as GATE-16, MAP-LC-3, and human Apg12p were shown to be substrates for human Apg7p, a novel E1 enzyme essential for the Apg12p-conjugating system (21.Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), a system involved in autophagy. Autophagy is a process that involves the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal/vacuolar system, which is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. For the yeast system, it was shown that Apg12p is covalently attached to Apg5p via the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue of Apg12p, which is very similar to the ubiquitin system (22.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Apg12p is a homologue to GATE-16 and GABARAP. If indeed GABARAP plays a role in these kinds of covalent modification systems, its carboxyl terminus needs to be accessible during this process. The two conformations found for GATE-16 were discussed already in regard to a potential role of the carboxyl terminus as a regulating element for modulating binding events (4.Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Transferred to GABARAP, this could mean that the solution structure of GABARAP resembles the conformation of free and unliganded GABARAP. The crystal structure of GABARAP may indicate the existence of a second conformation with its carboxyl terminus detached from the major part of the protein with an increased accessibility for the carboxyl-terminal residues. Taking all observations together, it seems that the amino-terminal part of GABARAP exists in a state that allows at least two different conformations. Any decision between either one of them,e.g. upon tubulin binding, may influence subsequently the orientation of the closely attached carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. Its different orientations in the structures reported so far strongly suggest that this part of GABARAP is able to exist in various orientations relative to the rest of the protein. Such a direct conformational communication between a potentially interaction-sensitive region (residueshighlighted in Fig. 1C) with a distant region of the protein is, however, a speculation that needs to be addressed by future investigations. This kind of triggered conformational change may also be used for rational manipulation of GABARAP function. Selective stabilization of the conformation with a tightly attached carboxyl terminus may inhibit binding to interaction partners. We thank C. Beck for technical assistance. 1KOT"
https://openalex.org/W1999020288,"HLA-B*2704 is strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis. B*2706, which differs from B*2704 by two amino acid changes, is not associated with this disease. A systematic comparison of the B*2704- and B*2706-bound peptide repertoires was carried out to elucidate their overlap and differential features and to correlate them with disease susceptibility. Both subtypes shared about 90% of their peptide repertoires, consisting of peptides with Arg2and C-terminal aliphatic or Phe residues. B*2706 polymorphism influenced specificity at three anchor positions: it favored basic residues at P3 and PΩ-2 and impaired binding of Tyr and Arg at PΩ. Thus, the main structural feature of peptides differentially bound to B*2704 was the presence of C-terminal Tyr or Arg, together with a strong preference for aliphatic/aromatic P3 residues. This is the only known feature of B*2704 and B*2706 that correlates to their differential association with spondyloarthropathy. The concomitant presence of basic P3 and PΩ-2 residues was observed only among peptides differentially bound to B*2706, suggesting that it impairs binding to B*2704. Similarity between peptide overlap and the degree of cross-reaction with alloreactive T lymphocytes suggested that the majority of shared ligands maintain unaltered antigenic features in the context of both subtypes.

The molecular basis for the very strong association of HLA-B27 with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 1The abbreviations used are: ASankylosing spondylitisCTLcytotoxic T lymphocyteMSmass spectrometryHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightPSDpost-source decay (1.Brewerton D.A.

Oates J.K. James D.C. Lancet. 1973; 2: 996-998Abstract Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and other spondyloarthropathies remains a major unsolved problem. Hypotheses on the pathogenic role of HLA-B27 fall into three main categories. The classical “arthritogenic peptide” hypothesis assumes that a self-peptide presented by HLA-B27 would be the target of autoimmune CTLs activated by external antigen, such as bacteria (3.Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The occurrence of arthritis in HLA-B27 mice lacking β2-microglobulin (4.Khare S.D. Luthra H.S. David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and the fact that the HLA-B27 heavy chain can form homodimers in vitro (5.Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that HLA-B27 might act as a noncanonical peptide-presenting molecule, perhaps leading to activation of unusual T-cell responses (6.Edwards J.C. Bowness P. Archer J.R. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 256-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Boyle L.H. Goodall J.C. Opat S.S. Gaston J.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that misfolding of HLA-B27 heavy chains, perhaps exacerbated by infection or other environmental factors, might lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and inflammation independent of antigen presentation (8.Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Münz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Other effects of HLA-B27 on modulating bacteria-host interactions have also been proposed (10.Huang F. Yamaguchi A. Tsuchiya N. Ikawa T. Tamura N. Virtala M.M. Granfors K. Yasaei P. Yu D.T. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11.Laitio P. Virtala M. Salmi M. Pelliniemi L.J. Yu D.T. Granfors K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Supportive evidence for the arthritogenic peptide hypothesis comes from population studies showing differential association of some HLA-B27 subtypes with AS. Like most other class I antigens, HLA-B27 shows extensive polymorphism in human populations. As many as 25 HLA-B27 subtypes have been described thus far (see www.ebi.ac.uk./imgt/hla). The apparently low frequency of many of these precludes a statistical analysis of their putative association with AS. At least B*2702, B*2704, B*2705, and B*2707 are linked to this disease (12.Gonzalez-Roces S. Alvarez M.V. Gonzalez S. Dieye A. Makni H. Woodfield D.G. Housan L. Konenkov V. Abbadi M.C. Grunnet N. Coto E. Lopez-Larrea C. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast, B*2706 and B*2709 are not associated or are weakly associated with AS (13.Lopez-Larrea C. Sujirachato K. Mehra N.K. Chiewsilp P. Isarangkura D. Kanga U. Dominguez O. Coto E. Peña M.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 3199-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). B*2706 has been found with significant frequency in Southeast Asia and the Pacific and at much lower frequency in continental China. A population study carried out in Thailand initially showed that whereas B*2704 was strongly linked to AS in this population, no B*2706 AS patients could be found, despite the significant frequency of this allele among healthy controls (13.Lopez-Larrea C. Sujirachato K. Mehra N.K. Chiewsilp P. Isarangkura D. Kanga U. Dominguez O. Coto E. Peña M. Setien F. Gonzalez-Roces S.

Lopez-Larrea C. Tissue Antigens. 2001; 58: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This differential association of B*2704 and B*2706 in a same population was subsequently confirmed in two additional studies carried out in Indonesia (14.Nasution A.R. Mardjuadi A. Kunmartini S. Suryadhana N.G. Setyohadi B. Sudarsono D. Lardy N.M. Feltkamp T.E. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1111-1114PubMed Google Scholar) and among Singapore Chinese (15.Ren E.C. Koh W.H. Sim D. Boey M.L. Wee G.B. Chan S.H. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, in segregation studies carried out in families in whom both B*2704 and B*2706 occurred, AS was observed only in B*2704-positive individuals (18.Sudarsono D. Hadi S. Mardjuadi A. Nasution A.R. Dekker-Saeys A.J. Breur-Vriesendorp B.S. Lardy N.M. Feltkamp T.E. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 1534-1536PubMed Google Scholar). Two B*2706-positive AS patients were found in China (12.Gonzalez-Roces S. Alvarez M.V. Gonzalez S. Dieye A. Makni H. Woodfield D.G. Housan L. Konenkov V. Abbadi M.C. Grunnet N. Coto E. Lopez-Larrea C. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), suggesting that lack of association of this subtype with AS is not absolute and might be modulated to some extent by additional genetic factors. However, the very low frequency of B*2706 in China has thus far precluded case-control or family segregation studies in these populations (17.Garcı́a-Fernández S. Gonzalez S. Miña Blanco A. Martinez-Borra J. Blanco-Gelaz M.A. López-Vazquez A. Lopez-Larrea C. Tissue Antigens. 2001; 58: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ankylosing spondylitis cytotoxic T lymphocyte mass spectrometry high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight post-source decay B*2704 and B*2706 differ by only two amino acid changes: H114D and D116Y (19.Vega M.A. Bragado R. Ivanyi P. Pelaez J.L. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3557-3565PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Vilches C. de Pablo R. Kreisler M. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 219Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21.Rudwaleit M. Bowness P. Wordsworth P. Immunogenetics. 1996; 43: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both of these changes are located in the same strand of the β-pleated sheet floor of the peptide binding site of HLA-B27 and are therefore not accessible to direct contact by the T-cell antigen receptor (22.Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, due to their location, they can influence peptide specificity. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that a major difference between B*2704 and B*2706 is the more restricted specificity of the latter subtype for peptides with nonpolar C-terminal residues, including only aliphatic and Phe residues, whereas B*2704 also binds peptides with C-terminal Tyr (23.Garcia F. Marina A. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peptide binding studies using poly(Ala) peptide analogs (24.Lamas J.R. Paradela A. Roncal F. Lopez de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggested that B*2704/B*2706 polymorphism could have more complex effects than those revealed by pool sequencing by modulating peptide specificity at secondary anchor positions. These previous studies suggested a direct relationship between the lack of or weak association of B*2706 with AS and its more restricted peptide specificity, relative to B*2704, but they failed to answer some relevant questions. First, to what extent does B*2706 polymorphism change the peptide repertoire of B*2704? That is, how many of the peptides presented by B*2704 fail to bind in vivo to B*2706? Second, besides the known effect on C-terminal residue specificity, are there other differential features between B*2704 and B*2706 ligands? Third, are the antigenic features of shared peptide ligands different when presented in the context of either B*2704 or B*2706? To address these questions, we have carried out a systematic comparison of the B*2704- and B*2706-bound peptide repertoires to determine their degree of overlap. In addition, we have used mass spectrometry (MS) to sequence a sufficiently large set of natural ligands to assess the differential structural features of the peptides bound to B*2704 and B*2706. Finally, we have used an extensive panel of alloreactive CTLs to compare the degree of antigenic similarity between B*2704 and B*2706 with the overlap of their peptide repertoires. HMy2.C1R (referred to hereafter as C1R) is a human lymphoid cell line with low expression of its endogenous class I antigens (25.Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J.

B*2704- and B*2706-C1R transfectant cells were described elsewhere (23.Garcia F. Marina A. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). C1R cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen). RMA-S is a transporter associated with antigen processing-deficient murine cell line (27.Ljunggren H.G. Karre K. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 28.Townsend A. Ohlen C. Bastin J. Ljunggren H.G. Foster L. Karre K. Nature. 1989; 340: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). RMA-S transfectant cells expressing B*2704 or B*2706 and human β2-microglobulin have been described previously (29.Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were W6/32 (IgG2a; specific for a monomorphic HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C determinant) (30.Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) and ME1 (IgG1; specific for HLA-B27, HLA-B7, and HLA-B22) (31.Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This was carried out using 1010 C1R transfectant cells lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, after immunopurification of HLA-B27 with the W6/32 monoclonal antibody and acid extraction, exactly as described elsewhere (32.Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar). HLA-B27-bound peptide pools were fractionated by HPLC at a flow rate of 100 μl/min as described previously (33.Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and 50-μl fractions were collected. The peptide composition of HPLC fractions was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS using a calibrated Kompact Probe instrument (Kratos-Schimadzu) operating in the positive linear mode, as described previously (33.Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a Bruker Reflex™ III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytic GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with the SCOUT™ source in positive ion reflector mode was also used, as described previously (34.Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martı́ M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing was carried out by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS in an LCQ instrument (Finnigan ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA), exactly as detailed elsewhere (35.Yague J. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1998; 52: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36.Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some cases, peptide sequencing was also done by post-source decay (PSD) MALDI-TOF MS, as described previously (34.Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martı́ M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In all cases, peptide-containing HPLC fractions were dried and resuspended in 5 μl of methanol/water (1:1) containing 0.1% formic acid. Aliquots of 0.5 or 1 μl were used for MALDI-TOF or nanoelectrospray MS analyses, respectively. Peptides were synthesized using the standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by HPLC. The correct composition and molecular mass of purified peptides were confirmed by amino acid analysis using a 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA), which also allowed their quantification. The epitope stabilization assay used to measure peptide binding was performed as described previously (29.Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, B*2704- or B*2706-RMA-S transfectant cells were incubated at 26 °C for 22 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. They were then washed three times in serum-free medium, incubated for 1 h at 26 °C with various peptide concentrations without fetal bovine serum, incubated at 37 °C, and collected for flow cytometry after 2 h (B*2704) or 4 h (B*2706). HLA-B27 expression was measured using 50 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing the monoclonal antibody ME1. Binding of the RRYQKSTEL peptide, used as a positive control, was expressed as C50, which is the molar concentration of the peptide at 50% of the maximum fluorescence obtained at the concentration range used (10−4 to 10−8m). Binding of other peptides was assessed as the concentration of peptide required to obtain the fluorescence value at the C50 of the control peptide. This was designated as EC50. B*2704-specific CTL clones were obtained from five unrelated HLA-B27-negative donors as follows. About 106peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each donor were stimulated for a week with a mixture of 105 B*2704-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines and 106 autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells irradiated at 80 and 50 grays, respectively. About 300,000 responder cells from the primary mixed lymphocyte cultures were subsequently stimulated weekly under the same conditions in the presence of 30 units/ml recombinant interleukin 2 (a kind gift of Hoffmann-LaRoche). Alternative stimulation of mixed lymphocyte cultures with two different B*2704-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines, KNE (A1, A2, B8, B*2704, DR2, DR3) and WEWAK I (A11, A24, B62, B*2704, Cw2, Cw4, DR2) was used to improve the yield of B27-specific CTLs by minimizing restimulation of T cells specific for non-B27 alloantigens. T-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution, seeding serial dilutions of stimulated T cells in 96-well plates containing 2,000 irradiated stimulator lymphoblastoid cells/well and 20,000 irradiated feeder peripheral blood mononuclear cells/well in the presence of 30 units/ml recombinant interleukin 2. Cells in wells growing below the statistical limit for clonality were screened for HLA-B27 reactivity using a standard 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay (37.Aparicio P. Jaraquemada D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) against B*2704-C1R targets, using untransfected C1R cells as a negative control. Mixed lymphocyte cultures and T-cell clones were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax I (Invitrogen), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (all from Sigma) and 15% of myoclone (Invitrogen). T-cell clones were restimulated weekly, as described above, in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2. The reactivity of T-cell clones with B*2706 was assessed with B*2706-C1R transfectant cells, usually at an effector:target ratio of 1:1, using the same 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay as described above. The B*2704- and B*2706-bound peptide pools were isolated from the corresponding C1R transfectant cells and fractionated by HPLC under identical conditions in consecutive runs. Peptide-containing fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectrum of each HPLC fraction from one subtype was compared with the MS spectrum of the correlative, previous, and following HPLC fraction from the other subtype. This was done to account for slight shifts in retention time between consecutive chromatographic runs. Ion peaks with the same (±1) mass/charge (m/z) among the HPLC fractions compared were considered to be identical peptides shared by both subtypes. Ion peaks in one HPLC fraction not found in the counterpart from the other molecule were considered to be peptides differentially bound to one subtype. Of a total of 969 ion peaks from B*2704 and a total of 943 ion peaks from B*2706, 849 (88% and 90%, respectively) were common to both subtypes, 120 ion peaks from B*2704 (12%) lacked a detectable counterpart in B*2706, and 94 ion peaks from B*2706 (10%) lacked a detectable counterpart in B*2704 (Table I). These results indicate that B*2704 and B*2706 share about 90% of their peptide repertoires, and each subtype binds about 10–12% of peptides that are not found in the other subtype.Table IComparison of natural peptide ligands from B*2704 and B*2706B*2704B*2706Total peptides compared969943Shared peptides849 (88%)849 (90%)Subtype-specific peptides120 (12%)94 (10%)Average mass of total peptides1,139 Da1,128 DaAverage mass of shared peptides1,120 Da1,120 DaAverage mass of subtype-specific peptides1,280 Da1,200 Da Open table in a new tab To identify peptides common to both molecules but much more abundant in one of them, we selected ion peaks in each HPLC fraction whose intensity was >50% of the maximum signal intensity in that fraction. Their amount was measured as the total number of millivolts corresponding to each ion peak in all HPLC fractions in which it was detected. When the total intensity of a given ion peak was more than 10 times higher in one molecule than in the other molecule, the corresponding peptide was assigned as a quantitative difference. Of 218 peptides compared using these criteria, 15 (7%) predominated in B*2704, and 13 (6%) predominated in B*2706. This result suggests that, in addition to determining differential binding of some peptides, B*2704/B*2706 polymorphism also influences the amount of bound peptide in at least an additional 13% of the shared ligands. The size of B*2704- and B*2706-bound peptide ligands showed a very similar Gaussian distribution, with a mean peptide mass ([M + H]+) of 1139 and 1128 Da, respectively (Table I). However the size distribution of peptides differentially bound to each subtype showed some significant differences: whereas in the lower molecular mass range (850–1,100 Da), B*2706-specific peptides predominated over B*2704-bound peptides, the opposite was observed in the higher molecular mass range (Fig. 1). Thus, the mean molecular mass ([M + H]+) of B*2704 and B*2706 peptide differences was 1,280 and 1,200 Da, respectively. The 80-Da difference is compatible with slightly longer length of peptides differentially bound to B*2704 and/or bulkier amino acid side chains at some position(s). A total of 39 peptides, including 25 shared, 9 B*2704-specific, and 5 B*2706-specific ligands, were sequenced by nanoelectrospray MS/MS or PSD MALDI-TOF (Fig. 2). All shared peptides presented Arg2 and nonpolar aliphatic (V, L, I, A) or aromatic (F) C-terminal (PΩ) residues. At P3, aliphatic/aromatic residues were largely predominant (20 of 25, 80%), but basic (3 of 25, 12%), polar (1 of 25, 4%), or Gly (1 of 25) residues were also found. At P(Ω-2) (P7 in nonamers), noncharged polar (13 of 25, 52%) and aliphatic (7 of 25, 28%) residues were predominant, but basic (2 of 25, 8%), acidic (2 of 25), and aromatic (1 of 25) residues were found at lower frequency. Peptides differentially bound to B*2704 differed from B*2706-specific ones in three structural features. First, all five sequenced peptides found only in B*2706 had C-terminal aliphatic (L, I) residues. In contrast, all sequenced B*2704-specific peptides had C-terminal Tyr (6 of 9, 67%) or Arg (3 of 9, 33%). Second, the P3 residues found among B*2704-specific ligands were either aromatic (F or Y; 7 of 9), aliphatic (I; 1 of 9), or polar (N; 1 of 9). In contrast, four of five sequenced B*2706-specific peptides had a basic (R or H) P3 residue. Third, four of the five sequenced B*2706-specific peptides had a basic residue at P7 (PΩ-2), whereas basic P(Ω-2) residues were much less frequent among shared ligands (2 of 25, 8%) or B*2704-specific ligands (2 of 9, 20%). These results indicate that B*2706 polymorphism influences peptide specificity at three anchor positions: P3, P(Ω-2), and PΩ. The main restriction is at PΩ, where only nonpolar aliphatic or Phe residues are allowed. In addition, B*2706 polymorphism increased the allowance for basic P3 and P(Ω-2) residues, relative to B*2704. P3 is an important anchor position for peptide binding to HLA-B27, second only to P2 and PΩ (22.Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

To confirm the differential suitability of basic P3 residues in B*2704 and B*2706 suggested by peptide sequencing, three B*2706-specific ligands with Arg3 and peptide analogs containing Val3 or Phe3 were tested for binding to B*2704 and B*2706 in an epitope stabilization assay using RMA-S transfectant cells. For all three ligands, substitution of Val3 or Phe3 for Arg3 improved binding to B*2704, but not to B*2706 (Fig. 3; Table II). The magnitude of the effect on B*2704 was somewhat variable depending on each particular ligand, presumably reflecting the contribution of other anchor positions in each peptide. Phe3 was slightly disfavored in B*2706, relative to Arg or Val in this position. These results indicate that Arg3 is disfavored in B*2704, but not in B*2706, relative to nonpolar residues.Table IIBinding of B*2706 ligands and their P3 analogs to B*2704 and B*2706EC50 (μm) ± S.D.B*2704B*2706ARRGGVKRI>1001 ± 0.2––V––––––23 ± 30.7 ± 0.3––F––––––15 ± 24 ± 1GRRYGLIGL11 ± 21 ± 0.3––V––––––4 ± 0.81 ± 0.1––F––––––6 ± 0.53 ± 1RRRESEKSL32 ± 70.9 ± 0.5––V––––––14 ± 12 ± 0.8––F––––––11 ± 33 ± 0.9Data are means of three independent experiments and are expressed as EC50 (see “Materials and Methods”) ± S.D.

Because most alloreactive CTLs recognize peptides naturally bound to the alloantigen molecule, another way to assess the overlap between the peptides bound to B*2704 and B*2706 was to test their cross-reactivity with allospecific CTLs. Thus, 56 CTL clones were raised from five unrelated HLA-B27-negative donors against B*2704 and tested for their recognition of B*2706-CIR target cells (Table III). Of the CTLs tested, 77% cross-reacted totally (>60% relative lysis) or partially (30–60% relative lysis) with B*2706, whereas 23% of the CTLs showed little or no cross-reaction (<30% relative lysis) with this allotype. The results correlate well with the peptide overlap estimated by direct biochemical analysis. In addition, they suggest that most of the shared ligands between B*2704 and B*2706 are antigenically similar in both contexts, as assessed with allospecific CTLs.Table IIICross-reaction of alloreactive CTLs raised against B*2704 with B*2706Relative lysis3-aData are expressed as a percentage of the specific lysis obtained with the corresponding CTL clone with B*2704-C1R target cells.>60%30–60%<30%B*270456 (100%)00B*270632 (57%)11 (20%)13 (23%)3-a Data are expressed as a percentage of the specific lysis obtained with the corresponding CTL clone with B*2704-C1R target cells. Open table in a new tab Previous studies from our laboratory, based largely on pool sequencing (23.Garcia F. Marina A. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), showed that both B*2704 and B*2706 bind peptides with aliphatic or aromatic C-terminal residues. However, whereas B*2704 could accept C-terminal Tyr, B*2706 specificity was restricted to C-terminal aliphatic and Phe residues. This was confirmed in the present study by showing that all shared ligands between both subtypes had C-terminal aliphatic or Phe residues, whereas B*2704-specific ligands had Tyr or Arg. The presence of Arg as a C-terminal peptide motif of B*2704 had gone undetected in previous studies, probably because it is present in a small proportion (in our study, in 3 of 35 sequenced ligands) of the B*2704 peptide repertoire. However, peptides with C-terminal Arg accounted for 33% (3 of 9) of the natural ligands differentially bound to B*2704. Previous sequencing studies also failed to detect any other differential peptide motif between B*2704 and B*2706 but suggested an increased frequency of Lys3 and Lys7 among B*2706 ligands. In vitro binding studies using poly(Ala) peptide analogs also revealed that these two subtypes differed in their P3 residue specificity, with better acceptance of basic P3 residues by B*2706 (24.Lamas J.R. Paradela A. Roncal F. Lopez de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However the effect of this modulation on subtype-bound peptide repertoires in vivo could not be assessed from these studies. Our results now clearly establish that B*2706 polymorphism positively selects for peptides with basic P3 and/or P7 residues. Thus, of the five sequenced B*2706-specific peptides, three had basic residues at both P3 and P7, and all five had a basic residue in at least one of these two positions. Among shared ligands, only 5 of 25 peptides had a basic P3 or P7 residue, and none had basic residues at both positions. Similarly, only two of the B*2704-specific peptides had a basic P7 residue, and none had a basic residue at P3. These differences presumably account for the bigger mean size of B*2704-specific peptides. For instance, the mean residual mass of the C-terminal residues was about 47 Da higher for the nine sequenced B*2704-specific peptides (three with Arg and six with Tyr) than for the five sequenced B*2706-specific ones (all with Leu or Ile). Thus, our data do not support the possibility that B*2704 might have some specific preference for unusually long peptides. Indeed, eight of the nine characterized B*2704 ligands absent from B*2706 had the canonic length of major histocompatibility complex class I ligands: 9 or 10 amino acid residues. However, the mean molecular mass of these differentially bound peptides (1,249 Da) was 188 Da higher than that of the five sequenced peptides differentially bound by B*2706 (1,061 Da). The differential binding of a 13-mer to B*2704 can be explained just by the presence of a C-terminal Arg, which is disfavored in B*2706, rather than by differential size preferences. Recent evidence indicates that B*2704 and B*2706 do not differ from B*2705 or from each other in their tapasin dependence for peptide binding, 2A. W. Purcell, personal communication. thus supporting the view that B*2704 does not have a particular preference for suboptimal peptide ligands. The molecular basis for the restrictions in peptide specificity imposed by B*2706 polymorphism can be deduced from previous crystallographic and peptide binding studies. The greatly increased preference for nonpolar C-terminal residues is explained by the loss of an acidic charge in the F pocket as a consequence of the D116Y change in B*2706. In particular, C-terminal Leu was greatly favored over Arg or Tyr forin vitro binding of peptide analogs to a B*2705 mutant carrying the D116Y mutation (29.Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Different mutations at this same position in HLA-B27 also increased the preference for nonpolar C-terminal residues (39.Parker K.C. Biddison W.E. Coligan J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40.Fiorillo M.T. Greco G. Sorrentino R.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, introducing acidic charges by the H114D mutation in B*2706 has a rather moderate effect on C-terminal residue specificity (29.Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, residue 114 takes part in both the D and E pockets, which bind P3 and P7 residues, respectively, an observation that easily explains the increased allowance for basic residues at these positions in B*2706. This bias does not impair binding of other residues at these positions due to the plasticity of interactions in these pockets, conferred in part through involvement of water molecules (42.Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Harlos K. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Several questions concerning the peptide specificity of B*2704 and B*2706 may be relevant to the differential association of these subtypes with AS. First, how do the differences in residue specificity translate in the degree of overlap of the peptide repertoires? Second, what structural features of B*2704 ligands impair binding to B*2706? Third, do the ligands common to B*2704 and B*2706 maintain their antigenic features in the context of both subtypes? The observation that B*2706 binds in vivo about 90% of the B*2704-bound peptide repertoire suggests that putative arthritogenic peptides may be confined to a relatively small portion of B*2704 ligands. Our study indicated that the major feature of B*2704 ligands that impairs binding to B*2706 is the presence of C-terminal Arg or Tyr. In contrast, peptides with basic residues at both P3 and P7 do not bind B*2704, despite appropriate P2 and PΩ motifs. Moreover, some peptides with C-terminal Leu and a basic residue at only P3 or P7 did not bind B*2704, revealing an additional contribution of other residues. An important issue when trying to correlate peptide specificity with disease association is whether shared ligands between subtypes differentially associated with AS maintain their antigenic features in the context of both subtypes. It is possible that particular peptides can be differentially recognized by CTLs when presented by either B*2704 or B*2706. However, the level of cross-reaction of alloreactive CTLs raised against B*2704 with B*2706 (77%) was only about 13% lower than the overlap of peptide repertoires, suggesting that a majority of the shared ligands maintain their antigenic features on both subtypes. It was reported previously that B*2707, a disease-associated subtype, was unable to bind peptides with C-terminal Tyr (43.Tieng V. Dulphy N. Boisgérault F. Tamouza R. Charron D. Toubert A. Immunogenetics. 1997; 47: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which questioned the importance of this motif for determining susceptibility to AS. This conclusion was based on the presence of Tyr116 in B*2707, the absence of a C-terminal Tyr motif by pool sequencing, and limited sequencing of individual ligands. However, none of these featuresper se rule out the possibility that some peptides containing C-terminal Tyr may bind B*2707. Much more extensive sequencing of individual B*2707 ligands would be required to assess this issue. In conclusion, this study allowed us to correlate the lack or low association of B*2706 with AS to failure of this allotype to bind a relatively small portion of the peptide repertoire bound by the structurally closest disease-associated allotype B*2704 and to determine the major structural features of the differentially bound peptides. No other known structural or functional feature of B*2704 and B*2706 can be correlated with differential association of these subtypes with AS.

https://openalex.org/W2166141693,"CD38 is an ectocyclase that converts NAD+ to the Ca2+-releasing second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr). Here we report that in addition to CD38 ecto-catalysis, intracellularly expressed CD38 may catalyze NAD+-->cADPr conversion to cause cytosolic Ca2+ release. High levels of CD38 were found in the plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membranes of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. More important, intracellular CD38 was colocalized with target ryanodine receptors. The cyclase also converted a NAD+ surrogate, NGD+, to its fluorescent product, cGDPr (Km approximately 5.13 microM). NAD+ also triggered a cytosolic Ca2+ signal. Similar results were obtained with NIH3T3 cells, which overexpressed a CD38-EGFP fusion protein. The Delta(-49)-CD38-EGFP mutant with a deleted amino-terminal tail and transmembrane domain appeared mainly in the mitochondria with an expected loss of its membrane localization, but the NAD+-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signal was preserved. Likewise, Ca2+ release persisted in cells transfected with the Myr-Delta(-49)-CD38-EGFP or Delta(-49)-CD38-EGFP-Fan mutants, both directed to the plasma membrane but in an opposite topology to the full-length CD38-EGFP. Finally, ryanodine inhibited Ca2+ signaling, indicating the downstream activation of ryanodine receptors by cADPr. We conclude that intracellularly expressed CD38 might link cellular NAD+ production to cytosolic Ca2+ signaling."

We previously showed in C2C12 murine myoblasts that rapamycin arrests cells in G1phase and completely inhibits terminal myogenesis. To elucidate the pathways that regulate myogenesis, we established stable C2C12 cell lines that express rapamycin-resistant mTOR mutants (mTORrr; S2035I) that have N-terminal deletions (Δ10 or Δ91) or are full-length kinase-dead mTORrr proteins. Additional clones expressing a constitutively active S6K1 were also studied. Our results show that Δ10mTORrr signals 4E-BP1 and permits rapamycin-treated myoblasts to differentiate, confirming the mTOR dependence of the inhibition of myogenesis by rapamycin. C2C12 cells expressing either Δ91mTORrr or kinase-dead mTORrr(D2338A) could not phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in the presence of rapamycin and could not abrogate the inhibition of myogenesis. Taken together, our results indicate that both the kinase function of mTOR and the N terminus (residues 11–91, containing part of the first HEAT domain) are essential for myogenic differentiation. In contrast, constitutive activation of S6K1 does not abrogate rapamycin inhibition of either proliferation or myogenic differentiation.

This discrepancy may arise partially from the use of different clones and different end points for assessing differentiation. Whereas several reported studies have used myoblast fusion as the marker of differentiation, the single study that showed rapamycin induction of differentiation used α-actin expression in a nonfusing C3H clone to identify differentiation (13.Jayaraman T.

The S6K1 pathway controls synthesis of proteins, such as IGF-II and ribosomal proteins, whereas the 4E-BP1 pathway controls many proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. The two pathways regulate the initiation of translation of distinct classes of mRNA. Mitogen-induced phosphorylation and activation of S6K1 appear to play an important role during the G1 phase of the cell cycle (16.Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G.

Phosphorylation of the S6 protein, the small ribosomal subunit, by S6K1 permits efficient translation of mRNAs containing terminal oligopyrimidine tracts in their 5′-untranslated regions (18.Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 controls cap-dependent translation of mRNAs with extensive secondary structure. Growth factors stimulate phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, thereby reducing its affinity for the cap-binding protein eIF4E and releasing the blockade of cap-dependent translation (19.Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). mTOR phosphorylates at least two residues of 4E-BP1: Thr37 and Thr46(20.Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B.

Rapamycin negates mitogen-induced activation of S6K1 by preventing the acute phosphorylation of a specific subset of sites, including Thr229, Thr389, Ser404, and Ser411. Thr389, which resides in the linker region coupling the catalytic and autoinhibitory domains, has been identified as the principal site of rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation that leads to S6K1 inactivation (26.Pearson R.B.

Although the molecular mechanisms involved in rapamycin inhibition of cell proliferation are coming to light, the precise mechanisms by which rapamycin inhibits myogenesis have remained elusive. A recently reported study by Erbay and Chen (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) concluded that the kinase function of mTOR is not required for myogenic differentiation. In that study, rapamycin treatment of C2C12 myoblasts prevented differentiation and inhibited S6K1, but it did not induce significant hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Here we confirm the finding that rapamycin inhibits myogenesis through inhibition of mTOR. However, unlike Erbay and Chen (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we show that rapamycin induces hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and that the kinase function of mTOR is required for differentiation. Our results indicate that the extreme N terminus of mTOR (residues 1–10) is not required for differentiation, whereas residues 11–91, which include part of the first HEAT sequence, are essential. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and routinely grown in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum (growth medium (GM)). Cells were induced to differentiate by growth in differentiation medium (DM; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Anti-4E-BP1 was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Phospho-specific antibodies to the Thr37 and Thr46 residues of 4E-BP1 and the Thr389 residue of S6K1 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). M2 anti-FLAG, anti-myosin heavy chain, and antibodies to laminin, α-actin, and β-tubulin were from Sigma. Anti-Au1 was from BabCO (Richmond, CA). Anti-MyoD and anti-myogenin were from BD PharMingen, and anti-S6K1, anti-Myc, and protein A/G plus-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The S6 kinase assay kit was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. The Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce. Transfection reagent TransIT™-LT1 was from PanVera Corp. (Madison, WI). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The plasmid pcDNAmTORrr containing the entire mTOR gene with the S2035I rapamycin resistance mutation was used as a template for all additional mutations. To make truncated mTORrr mutants, we synthesized the forward primers TorF11 and TorF92 to delete N-terminal amino acids 1–10 or 1–91 of mTORrr, respectively (Table I). The HindIII restriction site and FLAG sequence were added in-frame to the 5′ end of each forward primer. One reverse primer (TorR2549) beginning at the stop codon and containing a BamHI site was used to amplify truncated mTORrr fragments. It should be noted that a high-fidelity PCR system was used. PCR products were digested with HindIII andBamHI and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The fidelity of cloned inserts was confirmed by sequencing.Table IPrimers used for construction of N-terminal truncations of mTORrr Open table in a new tab Myc-tagged, constitutively active mutant S6K1 (Myc-S6K1-D3E-E389) was a gift from G. Thomas (26.Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding rapamycin-resistant mutant mTOR (S2035I) and kinase-dead mTORrr (S2035I/D2338A, referred to hereafter as SIDA) were generously provided by R. Abraham (15.Brunn G.J.

C2C12 cells were co-transfected with Myc-S6K1-D3E-E389 and pcDNA3 by using the TransIT™ LT1 kit as instructed by the manufacturer. After selection in medium containing G418, the single clones were isolated and expanded. Protein expression was evaluated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody and by Western blot detection with anti-S6K1. These clones are designated C2C12(D3E-E389). C2C12 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Δ10, Δ91, or kinase-dead mTORrr (SIDA) or with pcDNA3 control vector by using the TransIT™ LT1 kit. Cells were selected for G418 resistance and cloned. Individual clones were screened for expression of mutant proteins by immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG or anti-Au1 antibodies and by Western blot with anti-mTOR (26E3) mouse monoclonal antibody. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton, 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C and used for immunoprecipitation or Western blots. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared with 0.25 μg/ml normal rabbit IgG and 30 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Primary antibody (2 μg/ml) was added to the supernatant, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Thirty μl of protein A/G plus-agarose were then added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, the collected beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, 30 μl of 1× protein loading buffer were added, and samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. Electrophoresis was performed under conditions that do not resolve 4E-BP isoforms, as described previously (28.Dudkin L. Dilling M.B. Cheshire P.J. Harwood F.C. Hollingshead M. Arbuck S.G. Travis R. Sausville E.A. Houghton P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1758-1764PubMed Google Scholar). Isoforms of 4E-BP1 were separated in parallel experiments that used 15% Tris-HCl denaturing gel. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant 100 V at 4 °C for 2 h. The separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane by electrophoresis at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h, and the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times in PBS-T, incubated with Supersignal substrate, and exposed to Kodak BioMax. C2C12 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were plated in triplicate in 35-mm 6-well plates (Falcon; Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin, NJ). The following day, medium was removed, and 2 ml of medium containing serial concentrations of rapamycin (0–1000 ng/ml) were added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days and lysed under hypotonic conditions. The nuclei were counted by using a Coulter counter. C2C12 cells (2.5 × 106) expressing Myc-S6K1-D3E-E389 were seeded in a 100-mm dish and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, exposed to rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 15 min, and then washed extensively and incubated for 1 h with IGF-I (10 ng/ml). Untreated cells and cells treated only with IGF-I were used as controls. The activity of S6K1 was assayed by using an S6 kinase assay kit as described previously (29.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,30.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were seeded on 35-mm plates and grown to 80–90% confluence in GM. The next day, cells were washed once, and the medium was replaced with DM with or without rapamycin (0–100 ng/ml). After 72 h, cells were fixed in Buffered Formalde-Fresh solution (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with 10% swine serum in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Cells were rinsed thoroughly, incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (Sigma; 15 μg/ml in 1% swine serum-PBS) for 2 h, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 4 μg/ml in 1% swine serum-PBS) for 2 h. All procedures were carried out at room temperature. The cells were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Both phase-contrast and fluorescence images (at least 50 fields) were recorded by a digital camera. Nonfluorescent immunohistochemical detection of myosin heavy chain was performed as described previously (31.Liu L.N. Dias P. Houghton P.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 699-711PubMed Google Scholar). Although the inhibition of C2C12 differentiation by rapamycin has been reported previously, relatively high concentrations of rapamycin were used in those studies, and myotube formation was only partially inhibited. We used C2C12 cells to examine the cellular role of rapamycin in terminal differentiation. Cells were grown in DM with rapamycin (0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml). After 3 days, cells were fixed and examined by immunofluorescence for expression of myosin heavy chain (Fig. 1 A). The results showed that C2C12 cells differentiated to myotubes when shifted to DM for 3 days and that rapamycin (10 ng/ml) completely inhibited myotube formation. To determine the effect of rapamycin on expression of muscle-specific proteins, we cultured C2C12 cells in DM in the presence or absence of rapamycin for 1, 2, and 3 days. Rapamycin either suppressed or delayed the expression of MyoD, myogenin, laminin, and α-actin (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether rapamycin inhibition of differentiation is mTOR-dependent, we derived a stable C2C12 cell line expressing a Δ10mTORrr. We first tested whether Δ10mTORrr protein conferred resistance to rapamycin-induced inhibition of proliferation. C2C12 parental cells, clones expressing Δ10mTORrr, and vector control cells were grown in GM for 5 days in the presence of increasing concentrations of rapamycin. The IC50 was <1 ng/ml for parental C2C12 cells and vector control cells but was >1000 ng/ml for the C2C12Δ10mTORrr clone (Fig. 1 C). To detect whether rapamycin inhibited the differentiation of C2C12Δ10mTORrr, we cultured C2C12 cells expressing Δ10mTORrr in DM in the absence or presence of rapamycin (1, 10, or 100 ng/ml) for 3 days. Cells were fixed and examined by immunofluorescence for expression of myosin heavy chain (Fig. 1 D). The results showed that cells expressing Δ10mTORrr differentiated in the presence or absence of rapamycin. These findings indicate that myogenesis is blocked through rapamycin inhibition of mTOR. The target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a serine/threonine kinase that signals to S6K1 and 4E-BP1. To further understand which downstream pathway is necessary for differentiation, we derived stable C2C12 cell lines expressing the Myc-tagged, constitutively active S6K1 mutant D3E-E389 by co-transfecting C2C12 with S6K1 (D3E-E389) and pcDNA3 plasmids. The proteins expressed in the presence or absence of rapamycin were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and detected by Western blot with polyclonal anti-S6K1 (Fig. 2 A). High-level expression of S6K1-D3E-E389 protein was found in five clones and was not altered by treatment of cells with rapamycin (100 ng/ml). To determine whether rapamycin inhibits IGF-I-induced stimulation of S6K1, we assayed S6 kinase activity in vector control cells (C2C12pcDNA3) and in C2C12 cells expressing S6K1 mutant D3E-E389. The D3E-E389 clone had a higher basal level of S6K1 activity than the vector control clone (Fig. 2 B) and had 50% greater total S6K1 activity than the control clone after IGF-I stimulation. Importantly, the basal kinase activity (derived from endogenous and mutant S6K1) was only slightly inhibited (∼30%) by rapamycin (100 ng/ml). These results suggest that the constitutively active D3E-E389 mutant functioned in C2C12 cells. If rapamycin inhibits differentiation through inhibition of the S6K1 pathway, the C2C12(D3E-E389) clones would be expected to continue to differentiate in the presence of rapamycin. To determine whether C2C12(D3E-E389) clones could terminally differentiate, we cultured the cells in DM in the presence or absence of rapamycin (100 ng/ml). After 3 days, cells were fixed and incubated with a monoclonal antibody to myosin heavy chain (Fig. 2 C). The C2C12(D3E-E389) cells differentiated into myotubes, which stained positively for myosin heavy chain. However, differentiation was completely inhibited by rapamycin. Similar results were obtained with four additional clones that we examined (data not shown). These results indicate that the S6K1 pathway downstream of mTOR may not be crucial in the regulation of C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Therefore, we suspect that rapamycin inhibits myogenesis through the mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway. In support of this conjecture, S6K1 activity decreased in C2C12 myoblasts undergoing normal differentiation. In vector control and D3E-E389 clones, S6K1 activity decreased by 55% and 61%, respectively, when cells were cultured in differentiation medium without rapamycin (data not shown). Erbay and Chen (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reported that whereas rapamycin suppressed activation of S6K1, it had a minor effect on dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in C2C12 cells. We examined the effect of rapamycin on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and function by using three approaches. C2C12 cells were cultured in DM with or without rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for up to 48 h. First, we determined the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 by Western blot analysis under electrophoretic conditions that separate isoforms. Rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was observed in the parental C2C12 cells at all times tested (3–48 h of culture; Fig. 3 A); this result is inconsistent with those of Erbay and Chen (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, because mTOR has been reported to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 at residues Thr37and Thr46 (20.Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), we examined the phosphorylation status of Thr37 and Thr46 of 4E-BP1 by using phospho-specific antibodies. The phosphorylation of Thr37and Thr46 was slightly decreased (∼20–30%) in rapamycin-treated C2C12 cells (Fig. 3 A). Third, we independently determined whether rapamycin affected the binding activity of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E protein. We used the 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose binding assay of Gingras et al. (32.Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) to detect 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E. Under control conditions, virtually no 4E-BP1 was associated with eIF4E (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, 4E-BP1 was associated with eIF4E in rapamycin-treated cells. These results indicate that rapamycin inhibits mTOR signaling to 4E-BP1 under conditions in which it inhibits differentiation. To further explore how mTOR signaling regulates C2C12 myogenesis, we derived stable C2C12 cell lines expressing mTORrr constructs with N-terminal truncations of 10 (Δ10mTORrr) or 91 (Δ91mTORrr) amino acids or expressing a kinase-dead (mTORrrSIDA) mutant. As shown in Fig. 4 A, rapamycin did not cause hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 or decrease phosphorylation of Thr37 or Thr46 in C2C12Δ10mTORrr cells. In contrast, 4E-BP1 was hypophosphorylated in rapamycin-treated clones expressing C2C12Δ91mTORrr or kinase-dead mTORrrSIDA. Similarly, rapamycin induced only a weak association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E in C2C12Δ10mTORrr cells, whereas 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E in the presence of rapamycin in the cells expressing C2C12Δ91mTORrr or kinase-dead mTORrrSIDA (Fig. 4 B). These results further indicate that both the N-terminal 11–91 amino acids of mTOR and the kinase domain of mTOR are crucial for phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. To determine whether C2C12Δ91mTORrr or C2C12mTORrrSIDA were resistant to the proliferation-inhibitory effects of rapamycin, vector control and clones expressing mTORrr mutants were grown in GM for 5 days with or without rapamycin, and the IC50 was calculated for each cell line (Fig. 5 A). Vector control cells and C2C12 cells expressing Δ91mTORrr or mTORrrSIDA were equally sensitive to rapamycin. Thus, neither mutant signals to 4E-BP1 in the presence of rapamycin or confers resistance to the growth-inhibitory action of this agent. To determine whether the expression of Δ91mTORrr or the kinase-dead mTORrrSIDA allowed myogenic differentiation in the presence of rapamycin, we cultured clones in DM with or without rapamycin (1, 10, or 100 ng/ml) for 3 days and used immunofluorescence to detect myosin heavy chain. C2C12 cells that expressed Δ91mTORrr or mTORrrSIDA differentiated normally in the absence of rapamycin, although cell death was slightly increased in clones expressing the kinase-dead construct (Fig. 5 B). Differentiation of both clones was markedly suppressed by 1 ng/ml rapamycin and completely inhibited by 10 ng/ml rapamycin. These results indicate that both the N-terminal 11–91 amino acids and the kinase function of mTOR are essential for the regulation of myogenesis. Myogenic differentiation is a highly complex process regulated by the balance between positive and negative effectors. The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are unique among growth factors in that they stimulate both proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells in culture (10.Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 33.Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously (29.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34.Dilling M.B. Dias P. Shapiro D.N. Germain G.S. Johnson R.K. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 903-907PubMed Google Scholar) that the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin inhibits one signaling pathway downstream of the IGF-I receptor. A rapamycin-sensitive pathway is increasingly thought to be required for myogenic differentiation. Whereas rapamycin potently inhibits cell growth and induces G1 arrest, it also prevents myogenesis in both L6 and C2C12 myoblasts. However, the precise mechanism by which rapamycin inhibits myogenesis has not been elucidated. Rapamycin, when bound to its cytosolic receptor FK506-binding protein 12, potently inhibits signaling by the serine/threonine kinase mTOR. Although it has been established that inhibition of mTOR is responsible for the growth-inhibitory effect of rapamycin (29.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), there are only two reports that rapamycin inhibits myogenesis via inhibition of mTOR (12.Shu L. Liu L.N. Dilling M.B. Houghton P.J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 12Google Scholar, 27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The investigators in the more recent study (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) concluded that the kinase function of mTOR was not essential for myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and that rapamycin did not cause hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1. If these findings are substantiated, they will have identified the first kinase-independent function of mTOR. To further understand which domains and functions of mTOR are required for myogenesis, we investigated the ability of a rapamycin-resistant mutant mTOR (S2035I) with N-terminal deletions to support downstream signaling and myogenesis in the presence of rapamycin. In parental C2C12 myoblasts, rapamycin potently inhibited differentiation and suppressed or delayed the expression of muscle-specific proteins, confirming previously reported results (10.Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 12.Shu L. Liu L.N. Dilling M.B. Houghton P.J.

C2C12 myoblasts that expressed Δ10mTORrr were highly resistant to inhibition of proliferation by rapamycin under growth conditions (GM), and they differentiated normally when shifted to DM in the absence of rapamycin. However, unlike parental and vector control clones, C2C12 myoblasts expressing Δ10mTORrr differentiated normally in the presence of high concentrations of rapamycin. This result strongly suggests that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin is the mechanism responsible for the suppression of differentiation, as reported previously (12.Shu L. Liu L.N. Dilling M.B. Houghton P.J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 12Google Scholar, 27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the N-terminal 10 amino acids does not compromise mTOR-dependent myogenesis. mTOR controls initiation of translation through two downstream pathways: 4E-BP1/eIF4E and ribosomal S6K1. mTOR directly phosphorylates S6K1 at Thr389, a residue whose phosphorylation is rapamycin-sensitive in vivo and is necessary for S6 kinase activity (21.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). When we exposed myoblasts that stably expressed the constitutively active S6K1 mutant to rapamycin, none of five clones examined differentiated, although differentiation occurred in DM in the absence of rapamycin. The basal level of S6K1 activity was increased in these cells and was relatively resistant to inhibition by rapamycin. These findings suggest that inhibition of S6K1 activity is not required for inhibition of myogenesis. We next assessed inhibition of the mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway by rapamycin. mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1 at Thr37 and Thr46and blocks its association with the cap-binding protein eIF4E in vitro. Phosphorylation of Thr46 appears to be the major regulator of the 4E-BP1-eIF4E interaction in vivo(21.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Most studies of the mTOR-4E-BP1 pathway have focused on its role in cell growth and proliferation, although a single report concluded that 4E-BP1 is unlikely to be involved in the rapamycin-sensitive regulation of differentiation in C2C12 cells (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In our present study, Thr37 and Thr46 of 4E-BP1 were hyperphosphorylated in C2C12 cells cultured in either GM or DM, and their phosphorylation was slightly decreased in rapamycin-treated cells. We observed previously (28.Dudkin L. Dilling M.B. Cheshire P.J. Harwood F.C. Hollingshead M. Arbuck S.G. Travis R. Sausville E.A. Houghton P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1758-1764PubMed Google Scholar) that relatively small changes in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were associated with inhibition of tumor growth by the rapamycin analogue CCI-779. Consistent with this finding, 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E in rapamycin-treated C2C12 myoblasts. These results differ from those of Erbay and Chen (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates potent inhibition of mTOR signaling to 4E-BP1 in rapamycin-treated C2C12 cells. Residues Thr37 and Thr46 remained hyperphosphorylated in C2C12 cells expressing Δ10mTORrr, and 4E-BP1 was not associated with eIF-4E in the presence of rapamycin. Importantly, C2C12Δ10mTORrr cells continued to differentiate in the presence of rapamycin, whereas neither C2C12Δ91mTORrr nor kinase-dead mTORrrSIDA prevented rapamycin-induced hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E. It has been reported that a kinase-inactive rapamycin-resistant mTOR mutant (D2357E) can support myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in the presence of rapamycin (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). That report is the first to describe an mTOR function that is independent of mTOR kinase activity. It has been shown that mTOR signaling to 4E-BP1 is dependent on its kinase function (15.Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Signaling to S6K1 was also shown to require kinase activity and was abrogated by deletion of 70 residues from the N terminus of mTOR (35.Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of two other rapamycin-resistant deletion mutants to support proliferation and myogenesis in rapamycin-treated C2C12 cells. Proliferation of C2C12Δ91mTORrr and kinase-dead mTORrrSIDA cells was as sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin as that of control or parental C2C12 cells. The Δ91mTORrr and kinase-dead mTORrrSIDA cells differentiated normally in DM medium, but neither differentiated in the presence of rapamycin. These results, which indicate that the kinase function of mTOR is required for myogenic differentiation, are contradictory to those of Erbay and Chen (27.Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In our study, C2C12Δ10mTORrr myoblasts were rapamycin resistant and differentiated in the presence of rapamycin, but C2C12Δ91mTORrr myoblasts were sensitive to rapamycin, and their differentiation was inhibited. This result indicates that the region of amino acids 11–91 in the N terminus of mTOR has a functional domain that is crucial for mTOR downstream signaling to both 4E-BP1 and S6K1 (35.Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar).

We previously identified high concentrations of the small heat shock protein hsp27 within podocytes as well as increased glomerular accumulation and phosphorylation of hsp27 in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) -induced experimental NS. Here we analyzed murine podocytes stably transfected with hsp27 sense, antisense, and vector control constructs using a newly developed in vitro PAN model system. Cell morphology and the microfilament structure of untreated sense and antisense transfectants were altered compared with controls. Vector cell survival, polymerized actin content, cell area, and hsp27 content increased after 1.25 microg/ml PAN treatment and decreased after 5.0 microg/ml treatment. In contrast, sense cells were unaffected by 1.25 microg/ml PAN treatment whereas antisense cells showed decreases or no changes in all parameters. Treatment of sense cells with 5.0 microg/ml PAN resulted in increased cell survival and cell area whereas antisense cells underwent significant decreases in all parameters. Hsp27 provided dramatic protection against PAN-induced microfilament disruption in sense > vector > antisense cells. We conclude that hsp27 is able to regulate both the morphological and actin cytoskeletal response of podocytes in an in vitro model of podocyte injury."

The recent structure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) bound to a PPT-containing RNA/DNA duplex has provided important mechanistic insights regarding the PPT resistance to hydrolysis (10.Sarafianos S.G.

These authors identified an unusual distortion within the (rA)4:(dT)4 stretches of the PPT,i.e. misaligned base pairing between the template and primer nucleotides, suggesting that extension of this deformation into the RNase H active site may confer resistance to hydrolysis. The crystal structure also revealed extensive contacts between the RNase H “primer grip” and the RNA/DNA hybrid. However, because a structure of the complete RNA/DNA duplex PPT in the absence of RT is unavailable, it was unclear whether structural distortions were introduced upon binding of RT or inherent to the PPT sequence. Moreover, Sarafianoset al. (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

Therefore, the mechanism of the precise cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction by RNase H has remained obscure. A crucial role of the guanine-rich segment in the specific hydrolysis of the primer was highlighted by biochemical studies (3.Pullen K.A. Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the NMR structure of an 8-bp RNA/DNA oligonucleotide containing the last four 3′-terminal residues of the PPT and the first 4 bp of U3 shows that the width and shape of the major groove are unusual (11.Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with a bend of ∼13° between the two halves of this hybrid. Taken together, it is clear that structural studies should encompass the entire PPT rather than its separate constituents when attempting to define the specificity of cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction. polypurine tract human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase nucleotide(s) Here, we have exploited chemical footprinting of duplex and chimeric RNA/DNA hybrids, mimicking the steps of PPT selection and removal from (+) RNA and DNA (Fig. 2 A).

Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), increased thymine reactivity was ascribed to bases being unpaired. In related studies, this method revealed structural distortions where weak hydrogen bonding between complementary bases was preserved (22.Reddy Y.V. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the PPT/(−) DNA hybrid comprises the T:A base pair at the PPT/U3 junction as well as two (T)4:(A)4 blocks within the PPT sequence, KMnO4 modification of template thymines allowed us to probe nucleic acid structure at the specific site of RNase H cleavage. To date, KMnO4 modification has been restricted to a study of duplex DNA. Here we show for the first time that this approach can also be successfully employed to reveal structural distortions in the context of RNA/DNA hybrids. We report here that the first template thymine in the U3 DNA duplex immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of PPT is readily susceptible to KMnO4 oxidation. Reactivity is preserved when the PPT/(+) DNA primer is substituted with its all-RNA counterpart, indicating an RNA-DNA junction is not a major determinant of this distortion. Moreover, mutations in the conserved (rG)6:(dC)6 and (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts severely diminish KMnO4 accessibility to position +1. Interestingly, there is a good correlation between reactivity at this position and selective RNase H cleavage, suggesting that the structural distortion at the PPT/U3 junction is induced by the distinct PPT sequence. A second consequence of KMnO4 footprinting is unusually high reactivity for one of two upstream (dT)4:(rA)4tracts, revealing a significant degree of structural distortion within the PPT itself in the absence of the retroviral polymerase. We demonstrate that these distortions play a role in the selective RNase H cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction and resistance of the PPT to hydrolysis. DNA, RNA, or chimeric oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos etc. or Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Based on observations with simian immunodeficiency virus (5.Ilyinskii P.O. Desrosiers R.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3766-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we retained the (U)5sequence at the HIV PPT 5′ terminus. Oligonucleotides were purified by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DNA templates for KMnO4 modification and RNA or RNA-DNA chimeras for evaluating RNase H activity were 5′-end-labeled in 20-μl reactions using T4 polynucleotide kinase and 20–30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After annealing to the complementary strand at 90 °C and slow cooling, hybrids were subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-borate EDTA buffer (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 10 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled hybrids were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and electroeluted at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Purified hybrids were precipitated and vacuum dessicated. Nucleic acids were finally dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. The present protocol was adopted from that of Kvaratskhelia et al. (23.Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PPT/U3 hybrids containing 5′-32P-labeled DNA templates were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in a buffer comprising 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μmMgCl2. The total reaction volume was 20 μl. Reactions were initiated by adding 2 μl of freshly prepared 25 mmKMnO4 solution and terminated after 30 s with 2 μl of 14 m β-mercaptoethanol. After ethanol precipitation, samples were treated with 100 μl of 1 m piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C. Piperidine was removed by vacuum desiccation. Nucleic acids were washed three times with 50 μl of water and vacuum-dried after each resuspension. Samples were finally resuspended in formamide loading mix and analyzed by electrophoresis through 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Modification products were analyzed on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX and quantified using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. Reactions were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Unless otherwise stated, prior to hydrolysis, 100 nm PPT/U3 hybrid containing 5′-end-labeled primer and 27 nm recombinant p66/p51 (24.Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) HIV-I RT were mixed with buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 60 s. Hydrolysis was initiated by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mm. At the times indicated, aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal volume of 7 m urea in 1× Tris-borate EDTA. Hydrolysis products were fractionated by electrophoresis through 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 murea and evaluated by autoradiography. Quantitation was as described above. KMnO4 preferentially oxidizes C5-C6 double bonds in unstacked thymine bases in DNA (12.Borowiec J.A. Zhang L. Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Electrophilic attack on the double bond proceeds with an out-of-plane trajectory onto the pi system, rendering the phosphodiester backbone susceptible to piperidine cleavage. However, thymines present in the context of a fully stacked structure are shielded from oxidation. Because the application of this methodology to date has been restricted to studies of duplex DNAs, we first examined the utility of KMnO4 modification for structural studies of RNA/DNA hybrids. The data depicted in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrate that whereas thymines in single-stranded DNA exhibit hyper-reactivity to KMnO4, such reactivity is severely diminished upon formation of conventional RNA/DNA or DNA/DNA hybrids. In contrast, thymines located in the single-stranded overhang regions of the hybrid duplexes remain hyper-reactive to KMnO4. Thus, our data clearly indicate that KMnO4 modification is a sensitive probe for base stacking in duplex nucleic acids including RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA hybrids. We next used KMnO4 footprinting to reveal structural distortions in DNA/RNA hybrids containing the (−) strand DNA template annealed to PPT primers extended at their 3′ terminus by 5, 10, or 15 deoxynucleotides. A homogeneous preparation of duplex was imperative for accurate footprinting because thymines present in unhybridized template DNA would result in deceptive KMnO4 reactivity. Therefore, all nucleic acid duplexes were purified via nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after annealing. A representative gel is provided in Fig. 2 C,indicating no unhybridized 32P-labeled template. Two unusual features of the PPT-containing duplexes were immediately revealed. First, template thymine +1 was readily susceptible to KMnO4 attack (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). This base is located in the duplex DNA part of the hybrid and therefore should be insensitive to oxidation. Clear differences in KMnO4 reactivity between fully stacked and unpaired thymines were revealed with PPT-DNA chimeras of different lengths of (+) DNA. Thus, in +5 DNA species, thymines +6, +7, +13, and +14 were readily modified by KMnO4 because they were located in the single-stranded region of the template. However, constraining thymines +6 and +7 within the duplex DNA structure by extending the primer with 10 deoxynucleotides sharply reduced their KMnO4 reactivity (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Quantitation of the results is presented in Fig 3 C. Similarly, reactivity at positions +6, +7, +13, and +14 was diminished on a substrate whose primer was extended by 15 deoxynucleotides (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Despite this, enhanced reactivity of template nucleotide +1 position persisted in all species. Secondly, several template thymines in the PPT RNA/DNA hybrid were KMnO4-sensitive. Quantitation revealed that reactivity of thymines −7 and −8 was comparable to that of fully stacked bases in the duplex DNA, whereas the reactivity of those between −10 and −15 increased about 10-fold (Fig. 3 C). Differing reactivities of DNA template thymines in an RNA/DNA duplex also indicated that KMnO4 modification could be used to probe base stacking in such hybrids. In fact, the crystal structure of the PPT/(−) DNA hybrid complexed with HIV-1 RT indicates similar biased distortion in the (rA)4:(dT)4 tract. In this structure (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the two adenines immediately upstream of the G:C tract (equivalent to −7 and −8 in our experiments) are properly paired with complementary DNA sequence, whereas the remaining 7 bp of the A:T tracts are distorted. The same authors (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) demonstrated that these irregularities consist of mismatches, weakly paired bases, and unpaired bases. The intrinsic limits in the sensitivity of chemical footprinting prevented discrimination between such structures. Nevertheless, whereas the crystal structure embodies the conformation of the PPT in the complex with RT, our data indicate that such distortion is a feature of free PPT/(−) DNA hybrid. To obtain additional information regarding the extent of distortion at +1 position, we designed a mismatch substituting primer dA with dC while preserving the template dT (Fig. 4 A). KMnO4 reactivity of the mismatched thymine was comparable to that in the wild-type structure (Fig. 4 B), supporting the notion the first base pair in the (+) U3 DNA sequence is significantly distorted. We next addressed features of the substrate underlying such a distortion. Because position +1 in (+) DNA-containing hybrids is located immediately at the RNA/DNA junction, we examined whether the chimeric nature of the substrate influenced this structural anomaly. We therefore substituted the U3 DNA sequence with its RNA counterpart (Fig. 4 A), mimicking the DNA/RNA hybrid formed during (−) strand synthesis that is selectively resolved by RNase H to generate the (+) strand primer. Fig. 4 B, lane 3 shows that reactivity of +1 thymine persisted, suggesting that the RNA/DNA junction is not a major determinant. We next examined the contributions to this distortion by different regions of the PPT duplex. The conserved (rG)6:(dC)6 and (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts were mutated separately, and their impact on (+1) distortion was evaluated by KMnO4modification. In the (rG)6:(dC)6 tract, two G:C base pairs were substituted with C:G. Despite this relatively mild mutation, a significant reduction in the reactivity at template thymine +1 occurred (Fig. 4 B, lane 4), whereas reactivity in the upstream A:T tract was unaffected, suggesting that this mutation only altered the structure locally around to the PPT/U3 junction, with the conformation of the (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts remaining unchanged. Another mutation included substitution of dT:rA base pairs with dC:rG at positions −9, −10, −14, and −15 to reduce breathing in this region that might have accounted for increased KMnO4sensitivity. Indeed, the reactivity of thymines −12 and −13 was significantly reduced. More importantly, however, was a dramatic reduction in the reactivity of template nucleotide +1 (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). The latter effect is striking because the closest of the A:T mutations is introduced 9 bp upstream of position +1, whereas the adjacent guanine tract remained intact. These data indicate that the mutations in the (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts significantly altered the entire hybrid structure, effectively yielding a distortion-free conventional RNA/DNA duplex. This notion is strongly supported by the RNase H activity studies of the following section. Whereas the reactivity of single-stranded thymines +6, +7, −22, and −26 serves as a control in the footprinting experiments (Fig. 3 B), the observation that thymines −12 and −13 exhibit very different reactivities in AT mutant hybrid and wild-type PPT structures (see lanes 2, 3, and 5 of Fig. 4 B) further supports the notion that KMnO4footprinting can be successfully employed for identification of the unstacked thymines in the context of an RNA/DNA hybrid. In view of reduced KMnO4 accessibility at position +1 as a function of PPT alterations, we investigated whether this was paralleled by altered cleavage specificity. The substrates of Fig. 5 B were incubated with HIV-1 RT, and their hydrolysis profiles are depicted in Fig. 5 A. Wild-type substrate was preferentially cleaved at the junction. However, this precision was lost when mutations were introduced into the (rG)6:(dC)6 tract. Additional hydrolysis at positions −1 and −2 was detected at approximately the same frequency as that at the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 5 B). Substitutions within the G:C stretch affected the accessibility of only template nucleotide +1 to KMnO4 oxidation, whereas the footprint pattern for the adenine stretch remained unchanged (Fig. 4 B), suggesting a local structural perturbation around the PPT/U3 junction. Consistently, the RNase H cleavage profile was changed only at the small segment adjacent to the junction, whereas the rest of the PPT retained its resistance to cleavage. The most dramatic alterations in RNase H cleavage were observed with substitutions in the two upstream (rA)4:(dT)4tracts. The preferential cleavage was detected at position −7 of the PPT primer. This could be explained by enzyme binding with its polymerase catalytic center over the primer 3′ OH and RNase H domain located 17 bp downstream at −7, i.e. in the manner expected from a conventional RNA/DNA hybrid. Again, this activity profile can be explained from the footprinting data of Fig. 4 B. Mutations in the (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts significantly diminished KMnO4 accessibility at both −12/−13 and the PPT/U3 junction, effectively eliminating distortions throughout the entire RNA/DNA hybrid. Consequently, resistance of the PPT to RNase H cleavage and the selective hydrolysis at the PPT/U3 junction were compromised. In particular, the observation that the guanine stretch became accessible to the RNase H cleavage upon mutations in the (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts is in strong agreement with the KMnO4 footprinting data indicating that this mutation altered the entire hybrid structure with RNase H hydrolyzing this species as a conventional RNA/DNA duplex. During (−) strand DNA synthesis, copying the (+) RNA template creates an extended RNA/DNA hybrid within which PPT sequences are embedded. The 3′ terminus of the PPT primer could be provided for (+) strand synthesis by stepwise trimming of the replication intermediate until the nonhydrolyzable PPT sequence is encountered or preferential recognition of the distorted base pair at position +1. The experiment of Fig. 6 suggests that the latter scenario operates. For this experiment, a 5′-end-labeled PPT was extended at its 3′ terminus by 10 ribonucleotides to offer several potential RNase H cleavage sites. Despite this, the time course of Fig. 6 A provides strong evidence that the PPT:(+) RNA junction is the preferred site of hydrolysis. Quantitation indicates this preference to be almost 6-fold over other positions of the (+) U3 RNA/(−) DNA hybrid (Fig. 6 B). To examine a role of the RT/3′ primer terminus contacts in the precise cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction, we have analyzed RNase H cleavage rates for PPT/(−) DNA hybrids containing 5-, 10-, 12-, and 15-nt extensions on the PPT 3′ end. The hydrolysis profiles of all these species were very similar to that presented in Figs. 6 and 8 for the 10-nt primer, except that the PPT/+ 5 nt U3 sequence was cleaved at about a 1.5-fold higher rate than other 3′ extensions tested (data not shown). Interestingly, the activity data agree well with that of chemical footprinting depicted in Fig 3 B, where slightly increased reactivity was also detected for thymine +1 in 5 DNA chimeric primer. These results reconcile well with those of Gotte et al. (25.Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which also indicated that the 3′ primer end/RT contacts are not critical for the precise cleavage. These authors have shown that during (+) strand DNA synthesis, RT pauses after addition of the 12 deoxynucleotides to the PPT, and at this stage, another molecule of the enzyme binds to the PPT in the reverse orientation, with polymerase domain located toward its 5′ terminus (25.Gotte M.

However, all the PPT primers examined by Gotte et al. contained 18-bp RNA (25.Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is impossible to conclude whether the specific cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction is a result of RT positioning at the 5′ primer end or whether other structural features of the PPT contribute to the selectivity. To address this question, we tested substrates that lacked the (U)5 sequence or contained a 10-ribonucleotide extension at the PPT 5′ terminus. The data in Fig7 conclusively show that the 5′ end does not have to be precisely 18–19 nt long for RNase H to preferentially cleave at the PPT/U3 junction. Thus, if the 18–19-nt length was critical, then RT positioned at the 5′ end of the shortened PPT RNA (15 nt) should yield enhanced hydrolysis rates at positions +3 or +4, which represent conventional RNase H cleavage sites (see Fig. 7). Instead, the primary cleavage was observed at the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 7,lane 2). The extension of the PPT primer by 10 RNAs on its 5′ terminus yielded at least two cleavage products (Fig. 7,lane 4). One is clearly within the PPT and is 18 nt removed from the RNA 5′ terminus. This is likely the result of the “polymerase-independent” mode of RNase H cleavage. However, the preferential cleavage is still detected at the PPT/U3 junction, 25 nt removed from the RNA 5′ terminus. Clearly, cleavage at this site cannot be explained solely by binding of RT to the RNA 3′ or 5′ terminus. Therefore, a plausible explanation for these (Fig. 7) and other similar results (Fig. 6) is that RT is recognizing some feature(s) of the PPT sequence itself that directs cleavage to the “appropriate” location. Interestingly, these results are in agreement with a previous study of longer transcripts (∼80 bp) containing PPT sequences that also indicated that the cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction is not created as a result of RT binding to the 5′ end of the PPT oligoribonucleotide (26.Fuentes G.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Figure 7Influence of the PPT 5′ end extensions on the selective RNase H cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction. The sequences of the PPT/(−) DNA substrates are depicted in the figure. Both PPT primers comprised 10 RNAs of U3 sequence at the 3′ terminus, whereas the length of the 5′ extension varied. i, the primer lacked (U)5 sequence at the PPT 5′ terminus; ii, the primer had a 10-RNA extension at the PPT 5′ end. RNase H cleavage profiles were analyzed before (lanes 1 and 3) and 10 s after the addition of 100 nm RT (lanes 2 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hydrolysis was evaluated in the context of single and double base pair mismatches at the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 8 A). Surprisingly, introducing a single mismatch at position +1enhances cleavage at this position (Fig. 8 B, ii). Similar data were reported for RT of Moloney murine leukemia virus on its cognate PPT. Whereas Pullen et al. (3.Pullen K.A. Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6221-6227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not provide a structural explanation for this observation, our chemical footprinting data indicate that the extent of base unstacking at position +1 in the T:C mismatch and the wild-type structure is similar (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, the base-pairing pattern at the +1 position in these two species may still differ. For example, the T:C mismatch implies a complete disruption of hydrogen bonding, whereas the A:T base pair in the wild-type species may only be subtly distorted. As a result, the two species yield different reactivities for RNase H. Introducing a two-base, +1/−1 mismatch had serious ramifications for PPT selection. Although mutant CA retains the T:C mismatch at position +1, there is a dramatic reduction in PPT cleavage efficiency when an additional A:G mismatch is introduced at position −1 (Fig. 8 B, iii). KMnO4 footprinting of the CA double mismatch indicated higher reactivity for the +1 thymine when compared with the wild-type or a single mismatch, consistent with more significant base unstacking (data not shown). Finally, a +1 G:A/−1 A:G mismatch eliminates cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 8 B, iv). Due to the absence of thymine base at the +1 position, KMnO4 modification did not allow us to probe the structure. However, the sequence would imply greater distortion at the PPT/U3 junction. As an internal control for activity (Fig. 8 B), low level cleavage was consistently observed at position −7 of the PPT. Quantitation (Fig. 8 C) shows that these effects range from a 2-fold increase in PPT cleavage for mutant MM, relative to the wild-type sequence, to a 20-fold decrease with the double +1 G:A/−1 A:G mismatch. In conclusion, our data indicate that HIV-1 RT/RNase H activity is sensitive to distortions in the nucleic acid structure. Presumably, a single base pair distortion at position +1 is important for selective RNase H cleavage. Larger nucleic acid abnormalities at the PPT/U3 junction or distortion of the upstream (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts segment of the PPT adversely affects hydrolysis, possibly influencing correct positioning of RT on the PPT or accurate placement of the scissile bond in the RNase H catalytic center. We show here that the nucleic acid conformation at the HIV-1 PPT/U3 junction is significantly distorted in the absence of trans-acting factors. In the recent co-crystal of HIV-I RT harboring a PPT RNA/(−) DNA hybrid, the structures of the (rG)6:(dC)6 tract at the 3′ end of PPT and the adjacent U3 sequence were not refined (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Therefore, our KMnO4 modification data provide novel structural information on the selectivity of RNase H hydrolysis adjacent to this site. In fact, we show a correlation between the structural deformation at base pair +1 and precise cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction. Previous biochemical studies indicated that primary RNase H cleavage occurs about 17–19 bp from the polymerase active site (27.Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas this holds true for ordinary RNA/DNA hybrids, our data indicate that a significant increase in the cleavage rate at the PPT/U3 junction does not necessarily coincide with this location of the enzyme but rather with the RNase H domain located over the structural deformation. A striking preference for hydrolysis at the distorted structure is validated by introducing mismatched bases at the +1 position of the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 8). Whereas retroviral polymerase insures the perfect complementarities in RNA/DNA hybrids during (−) and (+) strand DNA synthesis, tensions created by the unusual PPT sequence may induce base unstacking at the PPT/U3 junction. The conserved (rG)6:(dC)6 and (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts contribute to this distortion and selective hydrolysis at the PPT/U3 junction during reverse transcription. Our chemical footprinting experiments have revealed that the distal of two (rA)4:(dT)4 tracts upstream of the junction is also distorted in the absence of RT. Structural anomalies in the same region in the context of HIV-1 RT covalently linked to a PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid have been identified crystallographically (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Whereas many nucleases perturb base pairing locally at the scissile bond during catalysis (28.Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29.McClarin J.A. Frederick C.A. Wang B.C. Greene P. Boyer H.W. Grable J. Rosenberg J.M. Science. 1986; 234: 1526-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), the structure of the RT-PPT complex indicated an unusually long (7 bp) distortion. This observation raised a question as to what might cause such an anomaly. We find that in the absence of enzyme, several template thymines of the distal (rA)4:(dT)4 tract are readily susceptible to KMnO4 oxidation, consistent with their unstacking in the PPT-containing duplex. Crystallographic analysis has also shown that residues constituting the RNase H primer grip make extensive contacts with the nucleic acid (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, these contacts are mostly restricted to the phosphate backbone, and there are limited direct interactions with nucleotide bases to account for disruption over such a long stretch of the RNA/DNA hybrid. Taken together, our data reveal the origin of the structural distortion detected in the adenine-rich segment of the PPT, complementing the crystallographic analysis. We suggest that distortion in the (rA)4:(dT)4tract is induced by the unique PPT sequence. The crystal structure of the A-rich RNA/DNA hybrid r(caaagaaaag):d(CTTTTCTTTG) revealed A-like molecule (30.Han G.W. Acta Crystallogr. 2000; D57: 213-218Google Scholar), whereas the NMR structure of the G-rich hybrid r(gaggacug):d(CAGTCCTC) indicated that the dimensions of the major groove are reminiscent of B-type DNA duplexes (11.Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Combining these diverse PPT-based structures within one molecule may conceivably lead to the distortion we observe. A contribution by the neighboring (rU)5:(dA)5 region should also be considered because this segment is critical for retroviral replication (5.Ilyinskii P.O. Desrosiers R.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3766-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6.Bacharach E. Gonsky J. Lim D. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4755-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, upon binding of HIV-1 RT to the PPT, RNase H primer grip contacts may stabilize and/or further distort the structure to confer resistance to hydrolysis. The nucleic acid structural distortions fulfill two different tasks, namely: (a) they create an RNase H-selective cleavage site, and (b) they render the PPT primer resistant to hydrolysis. Distortion at the PPT/U3 junction may have very different structural characteristics from that of the upstream (rA)4:(dT)4 tract. The former may be a relatively local distortion, whereas the irregularities in the (rA)4:(dT)4 tract expand over a long stretch of RNA/DNA hybrid. Nevertheless, these two unique features appear to be directly connected within the overall PPT architecture. Thus, mutations in the (rA)4:(dT)4 tract not only diminish structural breathing in this segment but also affect the conformation of the PPT/U3 junction by probably altering the entire RNA/DNA hybrid structure (Fig. 4). These structural changes directly influence RNase H cleavage, impacting both the resistance of the whole PPT to hydrolysis and the selectivity of cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 5). Identification of amino acids in RT responsible for recognition of distorted structures in the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids is now an attractive challenge. Gotte et al. (25.Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that RT pauses after addition of the 12 deoxynucleotides to the PPT, and at this stage, another molecule of the enzyme binds to the PPT in the reverse orientation with the polymerase domain located toward its 5′ terminus. Using this location of RT over the PPT and the recently published crystal structure data of the PPT-RT complex (10.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), we modeled the enzyme with RNase H active site located at the PPT/U3 junction. We found that in this complex, the polymerase domain would make extensive contacts with the 7-bp distorted region of the adenine-rich segment. In particular, >10 amino acids of the p66 thumb subdomain could contact this structurally anomalous region of the PPT. Thus, both distortions may play a pivotal role in accurate positioning of RT for precise cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction. It is also noteworthy that the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT exhibits structural similarity with retroviral integrases and Holliday junction endonucleases (31.Esposito D. Craigie R. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 319-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These enzymes have been shown to introduce local distortions in the nucleic acid structure at the scissile bond (17.Declais A.C. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23.Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34213-34220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is therefore intriguing to explore whether the same mechanism is employed by the retroviral polymerase for nonspecific hydrolysis of RNA/DNA hybrids. Another unusual structure requiring a high degree of RNase H specificity is the (−) DNA-tRNA junction, at which cleavage is a prerequisite to second or (+) strand transfer (34.Smith C.M. Leon O. Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6805-6812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-161Google Scholar). Whether structural anomalies at this junction control tRNA release becomes an important issue. Finally, whereas PPT sequences are conserved among retroviral genomes, there is significant divergence among their counterparts from long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposons of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (36.Friant S. Heyman T. Wilhelm F.X. Wilhelm M. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Despite this, we demonstrated that Ty3 RT recognizes its PPT sequence (5′-GAGAGAGAGAAGA-3′) with a high degree of precision (37.Rausch J.W. Le Grice M.K. Nymark-McMahon H.M. Miller J.T.

During development and in response to homeostatic challenges, cells are selectively eliminated by a genetically regulated suicide mechanism known as apoptosis or programmed cell death. Activation of this intrinsic cell death apparatus leads to a series of dramatic nuclear events, including chromatin condensation, degradation of chromosomal DNA into internucleosomal fragments, and disassembly of the nuclear membrane (1.Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). Caspases are a conserved family of cysteine proteases that play a critical role in the execution of apoptosis by cleaving a subset of cellular proteins at aspartic acid residues and altering their function (2.Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Indeed, caspases have been directly linked to many of the nuclear (and other) manifestations of apoptosis. For instance, caspase-3 proteolyzes and activates acinus, a nuclear protein whose caspase cleavage product directly induces chromatin condensation (3.Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamota N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Caspases also activate caspase-activated DNase (CAD), 1The abbreviations used are: CADcaspase-activated DNaseICADinhibitor of CADTNFtumor necrosis factorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild-typePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase an endonuclease normally present in the nucleus as an inactive heterodimer bound to its inhibitor ICAD/DFF-45. Caspase-3 cleaves and displaces ICAD/DFF-45 from CAD, thereby enabling CAD to degrade chromosomal DNA (4.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

In addition, proteolytic cleavage of the nuclear lamins by caspase-6 promotes the dismantling of the nuclear envelope (7.Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H.

Importantly, caspase-9 proteolysis of yet to be identified proteins increases the permeability of nuclear pores, thereby allowing caspases to enter the nucleus and cleave these critical nuclear targets (10.Faleiro L.

More recently, RAD21 has been demonstrated to be a component of the conserved mitotic cohesin complex that holds sister chromatids together and ensures the faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells; defects in this process lead to aneuploidy (18.Nasmyth K. Peters J.M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19.Hirano T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). During mitosis, the separation of sister chromatids requires the removal of the cohesin “glue,” which holds sister chromatids together from S phase until the beginning of anaphase. In yeast, RAD21 is specifically cleaved during the onset of anaphase by Esp1/separase, a cysteine protease distantly related to caspases, thereby allowing sister chromatid separation and the segregation of chromosomes to opposite poles (20.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 21.Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.-A. Koonin E. Nasmyth K.

Interestingly, separase proteolysis of budding yeast RAD21 generates a short-lived carboxyl-terminal product that is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; stabilization of this cleavage product by a variety of methods leads to chromosome loss and is lethal (23.Rao H. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 2001; 410: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In metazoans, cohesin is removed from chromatin by two distinct processes. During prophase, the vast majority of cohesin is removed from chromosome arms by a cleavage-independent mechanism that likely contributes to the condensation of DNA into discrete chromatid arms, leaving only a small amount of cohesin bound to chromatids at the centromere (24.Losada A.

At the onset of anaphase, centromeric cohesin is cleaved by separase to trigger sister chromatid separation (25.Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M.

Science. 2001; 293: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In both yeast and metazoans, the introduction of a mutant RAD21 that is resistant to separase cleavage inhibits sister chromatid separation (20.Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 28.Hauf S. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Hence, the mitotic proteolysis of RAD21 by a caspase-like protease is essential for proper chromosome segregation in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. In contrast to its critical role in mitosis, RAD21 has not been implicated previously in apoptosis. In the present study, we report that RAD21 is specifically cleaved by caspases at Asp279 in vitro and in cells undergoing apoptosis in response to diverse stimuli. We also demonstrate that caspase proteolysis of RAD21 precedes apoptotic chromatin condensation and has important functional consequences, viz. the partial removal of RAD21 from chromatin and the production of a proapoptotic carboxyl-terminal cleavage product that amplifies the cell death signal. Overall, these findings point to an entirely novel function of RAD21 in the execution of apoptosis.

To identify the major caspase cleavage site of RAD21 in vitro, we selectively altered the Asp residue at a potential cleavage site to a Glu residue (D279E) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGCCTGATAGTCCTGAGTCAGTGGATCCCGTTG-3′ and 5′-CAACGGGATCCACTGACTCAGGACTATCAGGCC-3′. The resulting RAD21 D279E construct was verified by DNA sequencing.35S-labeled wild-type and mutant D279E RAD21 were then incubated with buffer or 10 or 25 ng of caspases-3 or -7 as above to determine whether the D279E RAD21 mutant was resistant to caspase proteolysis. In parallel experiments, 35S-labeled human REC8, a meiotic cohesin structurally related to RAD21, was incubated with buffer or 2.5 or 25 ng of caspases-3 or -7, and the reaction products were analyzed as above. HeLa cells were treated with 50 μm etoposide for 0–48 h. Whole cell lysates were then prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (29.Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J.

The percentage of cells in each treatment condition that had apoptotic (condensed or fragmented) nuclei was determined in parallel experiments by fixing cells grown on glass coverslips with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 2 min and staining nuclei with 10 μg/ml Hoescht No. 33258 (Sigma) for 30 min. Nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope, and the percentage of apoptotic nuclei was determined in three independent experiments (at least 200 nuclei/experiment were scored) as described previously (13.Byun Y.

In the caspase inhibitor experiments, HeLa cells were untreated or were preincubated with 100 μm zVAD-fmk (Enzymes Systems Products) for 1 h prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for 18 h. RAD21 was then analyzed by immunoblotting as above. Chromatin-enriched pellets and supernatant fractions were obtained by centrifugation of whole cell lysates at 15,000 × g as described elsewhere (25.Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged Rad21 cDNAs encoding full-length RAD21, the amino-terminal (N-RAD21), and carboxyl-terminal (C-RAD21) caspase cleavage products were constructed by PCR amplifying human wild-type Rad21 with the following primers: 5′-GGCCCTCGAGCCAGCCAGAACAATGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCCGCGGTATAATATGGAACCTTGG-3′ (full-length Rad21), 5′-GGCCCTCGAGCCAGCCAGAACAATGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCCGCGGTTAATCAGGACTATCAGGCCC-3′ (N-RAD21 encoding amino acids 1–279), 5′-GGCCCTCGAGATGTCAGTGGATCCCGTTGAA-3′ and 5′-GGCCCCGCGGTATAATATGGAACCTTGG-3′ (C-RAD21 encoding amino acids 280–631). The PCR products were then digested with XhoI andSacII and cloned into the corresponding sites in pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The sequence of each construct fused at its carboxyl terminus with GFP was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were plated at ∼50% confluence on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1.2 μg of pEGFP-N1 plasmid containing empty vector, full-length RAD21, the amino-terminal caspase cleavage product (N-RAD21), or the carboxyl-terminal caspase cleavage product (C-RAD21). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h later, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclei were then stained with 10 μg/ml Hoescht No. 33258 (Sigma) for 30 min. GFP-positive cells were scored for apoptotic (condensed/fragmented) nuclei by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (13.Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The percentage of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei was determined in three independent experiments (at least 200 nuclei/experiment were scored). In the co-transfection experiments, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of pEGFP-N1 plasmid containing C-RAD21 and 0.8 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid containing empty vector, p35, survivin, Bcl-xL, or wild-type RAD21. Twenty-four h later, GFP-positive cells were scored for apoptosis as above. In all experiments, the statistical significance of inter-group differences was assessed by a two-tailed paired Student's t test. HeLa cells were transiently transfected as above and subjected to a double thymidine block as follows. HeLa cells were plated at ∼50% confluence and treated overnight with 2 mm thymidine. On the next day, cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged constructs, returned to normal growth media for the duration of the day, and then subjected to a second overnight incubation with 2 mm thymidine. On the following day, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and returned to normal growth media for 16 h. Cells were then trypsinized and incubated with 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. Next, cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and resuspended in 70% ethanol for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Washed cells were then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting; the cell cycle distribution of GFP-fluorescent cells was determined by DNA content. We have recently described an expression cloning strategy to systematically identify cDNAs encoding caspase substrates (11.Lustig K.D. Stukenberg T. McGarry T. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P. Zon L.

In the present study, we prepared35S-labeled protein pools from small pools (48 cDNAs/pool) of a human heart cDNA library by coupled transcription and translation in vitro. These35S-labeled protein pools were then incubated with control buffer, caspase-3, or caspase-8, and the cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A, 35S-labeled protein pool 156 contained an ∼125-kDa protein (indicated by theasterisk) that was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 (C3) but not by caspase-8 (C8) into proteolytic products of ∼65 and 32 kDa (indicated by arrows). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the proteolytic activity of caspase-3 and -8 was confirmed by demonstrating their ability to cleave35S-labeled vimentin (a known caspase-3 substrate) (13.Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 31.Morishima N. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or 35S-labeled BID (a well characterized caspase-8 substrate) (32.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). cDNA pool 156 was then subdivided into smaller pools, and the 35S-labeled protein pools were retested for their sensitivity to caspase-3 cleavage until a single cDNA encoding the putative caspase substrate was isolated (Fig. 1 C). Sequencing of clone 156 revealed that it was a partial cDNA encoding the human mitotic cohesin component RAD21 (14.Birkenbihl R.P. Subramani S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6605-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15.McKay M.J. Troelstra C. van der Spek P. Kanaar R. Smit B. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.

Cell. 1997; 91: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by clone 156 lacked the amino-terminal 34 amino acids of the full-length human RAD21 protein. Because clone 156 was a partial Rad21 cDNA, we next examined the sensitivity of full-length human RAD21 to proteolysis in vitro by a panel of recombinant caspases. As shown in Fig. 2 A,35S-labeled full-length human RAD21 was preferentially cleaved by caspase-3 (C3) and to a lesser extent by caspase-7 (C7) into two abundant proteolytic products of ∼65 and 48 kDa and two fainter products of 32 and 22 kDa (indicated by arrows). Prolonged exposure also revealed a few additional faint products between 25 and 60 kDa (data not shown). In addition, caspases-6 (C6) and -8 (C8) weakly cleaved RAD21 to generate faint 65- and 48-kDa products. Importantly, the catalytic activity of each caspase was verified by incubation with a known substrate (data not shown). To identify the major caspase cleavage site in RAD21 responsible for producing the observed 65- and 48-kDa fragments, we examined its sequence for consensus caspase-3 cleavage (DXXD) motifs (34.Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol.

Each of the critical Asp residues (Asp279 and Asp282) at these potential cleavage sites was individually altered to a Glu residue by site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, 35S-labeled wild-type (WT) RAD21, but not mutant D279E RAD21, was cleaved into its signature 65- and 48-kDa products by caspases-3 and -7 in vitro (indicated by arrows). Instead, the D279E mutant was cleaved into a much larger size product (indicated by theasterisk) that was not observed when wild-type RAD21 was incubated with caspases-3 or -7. In contrast, 35S-labeled mutant D282E RAD21 was readily proteolyzed by caspases-3 and -7 into the expected size products (data not shown). Interestingly, as demonstrated in Fig. 2 C, 35S-labeled full-length human REC8, a meiotic cohesin structurally related to RAD21 that is also cleaved by separase (36.Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 37.Parisi S. McKay M.J. Molnar M. Thompson M.A. van der Spek P.J. van Drunen-Schoenmaker E. Kanaar R. Lehmann E.

Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), was not proteolyzed by caspases-3 (C3) or -7 (C7) in vitro. Although the identity of the minor cleavage site(s) of RAD21 in vitro has not been delineated, these findings indicate unambiguously that RAD21 is preferentially cleaved at Asp279 by caspases-3 and -7 in vitro. Having demonstrated that RAD21 is cleaved by caspasesin vitro, we wanted to determine whether it is also cleaved by caspases in cells undergoing apoptosis in vivo. To this end, HeLa cells were treated with 50 μm etoposide for varying time periods, and RAD21 was detected by immunoblotting with a carboxyl-terminal polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 A, RAD21 was rapidly proteolyzed into a 65-kDa fragment (indicated by arrows) within 12 h of treatment with etoposide. By 36 h, all of the full-length RAD21 had been cleaved into the 65-kDa product. Of note, the observed RAD21 apoptotic cleavage product was the same size as that generated by RAD21 proteolysis by caspase-3 in vitro, suggesting that the apoptotic proteolysis of RAD21 is also mediated by caspases. Interestingly, RAD21 was cleaved more rapidly during etoposide-induced apoptosis than the well characterized nuclear caspase-3 substrate PARP (38.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar); PARP proteolysis was detected only after 36 h of etoposide treatment. Instead, the time course of RAD21 proteolysis during apoptosis more closely resembled that of the cytosolic caspase-3 substrate protein kinase Cδ (39.Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Indeed, RAD21 proteolysis could be detected after 12 h of etoposide treatment when only 1% of HeLa cells had apoptotic nuclear morphology, and RAD21 was completely cleaved into its 65-kDa product after 36 h of treatment when only 25% of cells had apoptotic nuclei. Hence, the specific proteolysis of RAD21 into its signature 65-kDa product precedes apoptotic chromatin condensation/fragmentation. To determine whether the specific proteolysis of RAD21 during apoptosis is, indeed, mediated by caspases, HeLa cells were untreated or preincubated with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (100 μm) for 1 h, and the cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for 18 h. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the apoptotic cleavage of RAD21 induced by TNF-α (indicated by the arrow) was completely inhibited by zVAD-fmk, thereby indicating that caspases are responsible for the proteolysis of RAD21 during apoptosis in vivo. zVAD-fmk also inhibited RAD21 proteolysis induced by etoposide (data not shown). To determine whether caspase-3 was necessary for the apoptotic proteolysis of RAD21, we treated MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which lack caspase-3 (40.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), with 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3 C, RAD21 was proteolyzed into its characteristic 65-kDA cleavage product in MCF-7 undergoing TNF-α-induced apoptosis, indicating that caspase-3 is not essential for the apoptotic proteolysis of RAD21 and that other caspases (such as caspase-7) can cleave RAD21 in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate unequivocally that RAD21 is rapidly and specifically cleaved by caspases during the induction of apoptosis triggered by a broad spectrum of stimuli. We next examined whether caspase cleavage of RAD21 altered its association with chromatin. To this end, we prepared low speed chromatin-enriched pellet and supernatant fractions from untreated HeLa cells or HeLa cells incubated with TNF-α and cycloheximide for 48 h. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 D, full-length RAD21 bound to chromatin and was found exclusively in the chromatin-enriched pellet (P) in both untreated and TNF-α-treated HeLa cells. In contrast, the 65-kDa RAD21 caspase cleavage product (indicated by the arrow) partly dissociated from chromatin and was found in both the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions in TNF-α-treated cells. These findings were consistent with our observations that GFP-tagged full-length RAD21 was present in the nucleus of int"
https://openalex.org/W2110456176,"The macrophage capability to recognize bacterial DNA is mimicked by oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CG dinucleotides ('CpG' motifs) in specific sequence contexts (CpG ODN). CpG ODN stimulates NF-kappaB activation in murine macrophages. In light of the pivotal role played by NF-kappaB in osteoclast differentiation, we examined the ability of CpG ODN to modulate osteoclastogenesis. CpG ODN alone induced TRAP-positive cells in bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cultures, but not multinucleation or calcitonin receptor expression. CpG ODN inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis when present from the beginning of BMM culture, but strongly increased RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in RANKL-pretreated BMMs. CpG ODN enhanced the expression of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Antibodies to TNF-alpha and the TNF type 1 receptor, but not the addition of IL-1 receptor antagonist, blocked CpG ODN-induced osteoclastogenesis in RANKL-pretreated cultures. On the other hand, CpG ODN reduced expression of the M-CSF receptor, which is critical during the initiation of osteoclast differentiation. These results suggest that CpG ODN, via the induction of TNF-alpha, support osteoclastogenesis in cells that are committed to the osteoclast differentiation pathway but, due to down-modulation of M-CSF receptor, inhibit early steps of osteoclast differentiation. Thus, CpG ODN represents a potential therapeutic tool for treating bone diseases."

RGS binding stabilizes a Gα conformation that favors hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, which hastens the termination of active Gα (5.Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The second mechanism of G protein inhibition by RGS proteins is effector antagonism in which the RGS protein binds GTP-bound Gαq and prevents Gαq/effector interaction (6.Hepler J.R. Berman D.M.

In addition to the classical RGS family, an additional group of proteins exists termed the RhoGEF RGSs (rgRGS) (12.Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct.

These proteins, which contain a highly diverged RGS homology domain, act as GAPs specifically for Gα12/13 and also stimulate GTP binding by Rho family members.Although all RGS proteins contain the conserved RGS box, they display significant variability in sequences outside of this region.

Science. 2001; 294: 1939-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Unique motifs in certain RGSs may modify the G protein GTPase cycle or G protein effector stimulation in additional ways. RGS14, for example, contains a “GoLoco” motif that inhibits guanine nucleotide dissociation on Gαi (15.Siderovski D.P. Strockbine B. Behe C.I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most RGS proteins do not exhibit GAP activity toward Gαs; however, a short form of RGS3 (RGS3T) blocks calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced cAMP generation (16.Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that RGS2 directly inhibits some isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, independently of Gαs (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), suggesting that RGS proteins can affect signaling through interactions with proteins downstream of Gα.Here we report the characterization of RGS13, the smallest RGS found in mammalian tissues. Human RGS13 was cloned from lung cDNA and is expressed most prominently in immune tissues such as tonsil, thymus, lymph node, and spleen. As with other RGS proteins, recombinant RGS13 exhibits GAP activity toward Gαi family members and not Gαs. RGS13 binds Gαq in the presence of AMF, implying that it acts as a GAP for Gαq as well. Transfected RGS13 blunts MAPK activation evoked by either Gαq- or Gαi-coupled receptors. In addition, it blocks GαqQL-induced CRE-dependent transcription, consistent with a potential role for RGS13 as an effector antagonist of Gαq. RGS13 inhibits receptor-stimulated cAMP generation, suggesting that it regulates Gαs signaling despite its lack of Gαs GAP activity. Thus, RGS13 may regulate G protein-mediated processes in the lung and immune system.DISCUSSIONThis study represents the initial characterization of RGS13 expression and function. RGS13 is most abundant in human tonsil followed by thymus, lymph node, lung, and spleen with low levels or a lack of expression in various other tissues. Ectopically expressed GFP-RGS13 localizes in both membrane and nuclear fractions of 293T cells with a very small portion of RGS13 in the cytosol. Similar to other classical RGS proteins, RGS13 possesses GAP activity toward Gαi family members and inhibits signaling evoked by Gαi-coupled receptors. RGS13 binds to Gαqin the presence of AMF, suggesting that RGS13 is a GAP for Gαq. In addition to its GAP activity, RGS13 likely blocks Gαq signaling by effector antagonism as well because GTPase-deficient GαqQL-mediated CRE stimulation is attenuated by RGS13. RGS13 is not a GAP for Gαs, although it inhibits cAMP generation induced by stimulation of a Gαs-coupled receptor.The expression pattern of RGS family members is highly variable and may contribute to physiological specificity of RGS proteins that share similar biochemical properties. RGS16 is expressed predominantly in the retina, pituitary, and liver (22.Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RGS13 expression is highest in tonsil (about 6.8 × 106 times greater than CD4+ cells). There is 10-fold less RGS13 in thymus, lymph node, lung, and spleen, with much lower levels of RGS13 detected in other tissues such as brain, which is a reservoir for many of the RGS family members (28.Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29.Grafstein-Dunn E. Young K.H. Cockett M.I. Khawaja X.Z. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 88: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier reports describing RGS13 expression in brain (29.Grafstein-Dunn E. Young K.H. Cockett M.I. Khawaja X.Z. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 88: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30.Norlin E.M. Berghard A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we failed to detect any RGS13 in brain cDNA. This discrepancy could be explained by localization of RGS proteins within the brain; that is, certain areas of the brain enriched with RGS13 may be underrepresented in total brain cDNA.Using the RGS13 peptide antibodies, we evaluated endogenous RGS13 expression in human lung, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, heart, and brain (data not shown). We concluded that although the peptide antibodies were able to detect recombinant RGS13 protein and not other closely related RGS proteins of similar size, the sensitivity of the peptide antibodies was insufficient to identify endogenous protein in tissue lysates by immunoblotting. To address this issue, we have initiated generation of knockout mice in which a LacZreporter gene is placed under control of the RGS13 promoter, which should allow us to better define the anatomical and developmental expression of RGS13.Transfected RGS13 localizes in the cell membrane and the nucleus. Several RGS proteins have been localized to the cell membrane (31.Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and have undergone post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, which may assist in membrane anchorage (32.Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. Vries-Smits A.M. Qiu R.G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. de Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RGS13 lacks several of the N-terminal residues that adopt an α-helical conformation in closely related RGSs such as RGS4, 5, and 16 and facilitate direct interaction with anionic membrane phospholipids (34.Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35.Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether palmitoylation of RGS13 is required for its membrane localization or whether another mechanism of membrane targeting is responsible. It has been reported that RGS2 and RGS10 are localized in the nucleus (36.Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We show here that transfected RGS13 is also located in the nucleus, although the functional significance of nuclear RGS expression has yet to be determined.RGS13 functions similarly to many RGS proteins in that it bears GAP activity toward members of the Gαi family and likely has GAP activity toward Gαq as well. RGS13 may be an effector antagonist for Gαq as demonstrated by its ability to block GαqQL-mediated CRE activation. Although one could postulate that the capacity of RGS13 to block cAMP generation may have influenced the CRE-Luciferase reporter assay, the lack of significant decrease in either basal cAMP levels or basal CRE-Luciferase activity suggests that this mechanism would not account for the inhibition of GαqQL-stimulated CRE-Luciferase by RGS13.RGS13 blunted isoproterenol-evoked increases in cAMP but exhibited no GAP activity toward Gαs. There are several possible explanations for this result. An interaction between RGS9 and a phosphodiesterase has been reported (37.He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). RGS13 may enhance cAMP metabolism by stimulating a phosphodiesterase, resulting in a net decrease in cAMP concentration. In that case one would expect to see decreased basal levels of cAMP, which we failed to detect. A truncated form of RGS3 (RGS3T) was shown to decrease receptor-mediated cAMP generation without decreasing basal cAMP levels (16.Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that it was unlikely that RGS3T blocked adenylyl cyclase directly. Given the similarity in our results, RGS13 and RGS3T may be acting via the same uncharacterized mechanism. Another possibility is that like RGS2 (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) RGS13 may block adenylyl cyclase directly. It has been demonstrated that RGS1, RGS2, and RGS3 (but not RGS4 or RGS5) block GTPγS/odorant-mediated cAMP generation in olfactory epithelium membranes. In addition, RGS2 was shown to block forskolin-evoked increases in cAMP (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), indicating that some RGS proteins regulate certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclase directly. Interestingly, RGS2 failed to attenuate cAMP production induced by stimulation of endogenous adenylyl cyclase in HEK-293 cells (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast we found that RGS13 inhibited cAMP generation in these cells, suggesting that RGS2 and RGS13 may regulate different isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. Given that the only identified domain in RGS13 is the RGS box, it will be of interest to examine whether the RGS box is the region that confers the ability of RGS proteins to inhibit cAMP production. If so, why then do RGS4 and RGS5 lack the ability to regulate this process?Functional analysis of RGS13 reported here was derived from cells transfected with GFP-RGS13. We utilized GFP-RGS13 only after several failed attempts to express RGS13 in untagged or His-tagged forms. Although we used the GFP vector or other GFP-tagged RGS proteins as controls, the difficulty in expressing untagged RGS13 is of interest. Future experiments are required to determine whether the difficulty in detecting untagged RGS13 is a result of such anomalies as unstable transcription or translation. This explanation seems unlikely because we could easily detect in vitro-translated untagged RGS13 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (data not shown). Alternatively, RGS13 may require a binding partner or modification for stable expression in mammalian cells. An example of this type of protein instability is Gβ5, which requires expression of RGS9 in the brain (18.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These studies might also explain the difficulty in detecting endogenous levels of RGS13 by immunoblotting.Through the characterization of RGS13 we have added another piece to the puzzle of the RGS family. Unlike many RGS proteins RGS13 has no identified domain other than the RGS box, but because of its high expression in the immune system and lung and its ability to block Gαi, Gαq, and cAMP generation, the biological niche of RGS13 might be to regulate specific G protein-dependent signal transduction pathways in these regions. The physiological relevance of RGS13 and other RGS proteins is slowly being evaluated through the use of targeted gene disruption and expression of transgenes in mice. Through these lines of experimentation we hope to better understand the function of RGS13 and its relevance to health and disease. G protein signaling is an effective mechanism of cellular communication during both physiological and pathological conditions (1.Beadling C. Druey K.M. Richter G. Kehrl J.H. Smith K.A. J.

RGS binding stabilizes a Gα conformation that favors hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, which hastens the termination of active Gα (5.Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The second mechanism of G protein inhibition by RGS proteins is effector antagonism in which the RGS protein binds GTP-bound Gαq and prevents Gαq/effector interaction (6.Hepler J.R. Berman D.M.

This motif of 120 amino acids is highly conserved in all RGS family members and conveys the ability of RGSs to bind G proteins (7.De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev.

Lavoie C. Gill G.N. Insel P.A. Huang X.Y. Farquhar M.G. Science. 2001; 294: 1939-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical RGS family, an additional group of proteins exists termed the RhoGEF RGSs (rgRGS) (12.Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13.Longenecker K.L. Lewis M.E. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Derewenda Z.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These proteins, which contain a highly diverged RGS homology domain, act as GAPs specifically for Gα12/13 and also stimulate GTP binding by Rho family members. Although all RGS proteins contain the conserved RGS box, they display significant variability in sequences outside of this region. For example, a cysteine string found in RGS-GAIP and RGS20 is a site of palmitoylation, which may assist in membrane anchorage (14.De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Gαs GAP RGS-PX1 also contains a Phox domain that may be involved in intracellular trafficking (11.Zheng B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We show here that transfected RGS13 is also located in the nucleus, although the functional significance of nuclear RGS expression has yet to be determined.RGS13 functions similarly to many RGS proteins in that it bears GAP activity toward members of the Gαi family and likely has GAP activity toward Gαq as well. RGS13 may be an effector antagonist for Gαq as demonstrated by its ability to block GαqQL-mediated CRE activation. Although one could postulate that the capacity of RGS13 to block cAMP generation may have influenced the CRE-Luciferase reporter assay, the lack of significant decrease in either basal cAMP levels or basal CRE-Luciferase activity suggests that this mechanism would not account for the inhibition of GαqQL-stimulated CRE-Luciferase by RGS13.RGS13 blunted isoproterenol-evoked increases in cAMP but exhibited no GAP activity toward Gαs. There are several possible explanations for this result. An interaction between RGS9 and a phosphodiesterase has been reported (37.He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). RGS13 may enhance cAMP metabolism by stimulating a phosphodiesterase, resulting in a net decrease in cAMP concentration. In that case one would expect to see decreased basal levels of cAMP, which we failed to detect. A truncated form of RGS3 (RGS3T) was shown to decrease receptor-mediated cAMP generation without decreasing basal cAMP levels (16.Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that it was unlikely that RGS3T blocked adenylyl cyclase directly. Given the similarity in our results, RGS13 and RGS3T may be acting via the same uncharacterized mechanism. Another possibility is that like RGS2 (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) RGS13 may block adenylyl cyclase directly. It has been demonstrated that RGS1, RGS2, and RGS3 (but not RGS4 or RGS5) block GTPγS/odorant-mediated cAMP generation in olfactory epithelium membranes. In addition, RGS2 was shown to block forskolin-evoked increases in cAMP (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), indicating that some RGS proteins regulate certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclase directly. Interestingly, RGS2 failed to attenuate cAMP production induced by stimulation of endogenous adenylyl cyclase in HEK-293 cells (17.Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast we found that RGS13 inhibited cAMP generation in these cells, suggesting that RGS2 and RGS13 may regulate different isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. Given that the only identified domain in RGS13 is the RGS box, it will be of interest to examine whether the RGS box is the region that confers the ability of RGS proteins to inhibit cAMP production. If so, why then do RGS4 and RGS5 lack the ability to regulate this process?Functional analysis of RGS13 reported here was derived from cells transfected with GFP-RGS13. We utilized GFP-RGS13 only after several failed attempts to express RGS13 in untagged or His-tagged forms. Although we used the GFP vector or other GFP-tagged RGS proteins as controls, the difficulty in expressing untagged RGS13 is of interest. Future experiments are required to determine whether the difficulty in detecting untagged RGS13 is a result of such anomalies as unstable transcription or translation. This explanation seems unlikely because we could easily detect in vitro-translated untagged RGS13 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (data not shown). Alternatively, RGS13 may require a binding partner or modification for stable expression in mammalian cells. An example of this type of protein instability is Gβ5, which requires expression of RGS9 in the brain (18.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These studies might also explain the difficulty in detecting endogenous levels of RGS13 by immunoblotting.Through the characterization of RGS13 we have added another piece to the puzzle of the RGS family. Unlike many RGS proteins RGS13 has no identified domain other than the RGS box, but because of its high expression in the immune system and lung and its ability to block Gαi, Gαq, and cAMP generation, the biological niche of RGS13 might be to regulate specific G protein-dependent signal transduction pathways in these regions. The physiological relevance of RGS13 and other RGS proteins is slowly being evaluated through the use of targeted gene disruption and expression of transgenes in mice. Through these lines of experimentation we hope to better understand the function of RGS13 and its relevance to health and disease. This study represents the initial characterization of RGS13 expression and function. RGS13 is most abundant in human tonsil followed by thymus, lymph node, lung, and spleen with low levels or a lack of expression in various other tissues. Ectopically expressed GFP-RGS13 localizes in both membrane and nuclear fractions of 293T cells with a very small portion of RGS13 in the cytosol. Similar to other classical RGS proteins, RGS13 possesses GAP activity toward Gαi family members and inhibits signaling evoked by Gαi-coupled receptors. RGS13 binds to Gαqin the presence of AMF, suggesting that RGS13 is a GAP for Gαq. In addition to its GAP activity, RGS13 likely blocks Gαq signaling by effector antagonism as well because GTPase-deficient GαqQL-mediated CRE stimulation is attenuated by RGS13. RGS13 is not a GAP for Gαs, although it inhibits cAMP generation induced by stimulation of a Gαs-coupled receptor. The expression pattern of RGS family members is highly variable and may contribute to physiological specificity of RGS proteins that share similar biochemical properties. RGS16 is expressed predominantly in the retina, pituitary, and liver (22.Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23.Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RGS18 is expressed in hematopoietic tissues and lung (25.Park I.K. Klug C.A. Li K. Jerabek L. Li L. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. Hood L. Weissman I.L. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 915-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Yowe D. Weich N. Prabhudas M. Poisson L. Errada P. Kapeller R. Yu K. Faron L. Shen M. Cleary J. Wilkie T.M. Gutierrez-Ramos C. Hodge M.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas RGS2 and RGS3 are ubiquitously expressed (20.Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 27.Siderovski D.P. Heximer S.P. Forsdyke D.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RGS13 expression is highest in tonsil (about 6.8 × 106 times greater than CD4+ cells). There is 10-fold less RGS13 in thymus, lymph node, lung, and spleen, with much lower levels of RGS13 detected in other tissues such as brain, which is a reservoir for many of the RGS family members (28.Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29.Grafstein-Dunn E. Young K.H. Cockett M.I. Khawaja X.Z. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 88: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier reports describing RGS13 expression in brain (29.Grafstein-Dunn E. Young K.H. Cockett M.I. Khawaja X.Z. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 88: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30.Norlin E.M. Berghard A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we failed to detect any RGS13 in brain cDNA. This discrepancy could be explained by localization of RGS proteins within the brain; that is, certain areas of the brain enriched with RGS13 may be underrepresented in total brain cDNA. Using the RGS13 peptide antibodies, we evaluated endogenous RGS13 expression in human lung, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, heart, and brain (data not shown). We concluded that although the peptide antibodies were able to detect recombinant RGS13 protein and not other closely related RGS proteins of similar size, the sensitivity of the peptide antibodies was insufficient to identify endogenous protein in tissue lysates by immunoblotting. To address this issue, we have initiated generation of knockout mice in which a LacZreporter gene is placed under control of the RGS13 promoter, which should allow us to better define the anatomical and developmental expression of RGS13. Transfected RGS13 localizes in the cell membrane and the nucleus. Several RGS proteins have been localized to the cell membrane (31.Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and have undergone post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, which may assist in membrane anchorage (32.Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. Vries-Smits A.M. Qiu R.G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. de Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RGS13 lacks several of the N-terminal residues that adopt an α-helical conformation in closely related RGSs such as RGS4, 5, and 16 and facilitate direct interaction with anionic membrane phospholipids (34.Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35.Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1999087143,"The rotational mechanism of ATP synthase was investigated by fusing three proteins from Escherichia coli, the 12-kDa soluble cytochrome b 562, the 20-kDa flavodoxin, and the 28-kDa flavodoxin reductase, to the C terminus of the ε subunit of the enzyme. According to the concept of rotational catalysis, because ε is part of the rotor a large domain added at this site should sterically clash with the second stalk, blocking rotation and fully inhibiting the enzyme. E. colicells expressing the cytochrome b 562 fusion in place of wild-type ε grew using acetate as the energy source, indicating their capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. Cells expressing the larger flavodoxin or flavodoxin reductase fusions failed to grow on acetate. Immunoblot analysis showed that the fusion proteins were stable in the cells and that they had no effect on enzyme assembly. These results provide initial evidence supporting rotational catalysis in vivo. In membrane vesicles, the cytochromeb 562 fusion caused an increase in the apparent ATPase activity but a minor decrease in proton pumping. Vesicles bearing ATP synthase containing the larger fusion proteins showed reduced but significant levels of ATPase activity that was sensitive to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) but no proton pumping. Thus, all fusions to ε generated an uncoupled component of ATPase activity. These results imply that a function of the C terminus of ε in F1F0 is to increase the efficiency of the enzyme by specifically preventing the uncoupled hydrolysis of ATP. Given the sensitivity to DCCD, this uncoupled ATP hydrolysis may arise from rotational steps of γε in the inappropriate direction after ATP is bound at the catalytic site. It is proposed that the C-terminal domain of ε functions to ensure that rotation occurs only in the direction of ATP synthesis when ADP is bound and only in the direction of hydrolysis when ATP is bound.

It is proposed that the C-terminal domain of ε functions to ensure that rotation occurs only in the direction of ATP synthesis when ADP is bound and only in the direction of hydrolysis when ATP is bound. ATP synthase is the enzyme responsible for the production of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. It is found throughout all forms of life, from the membranes of bacteria to the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes. The enzyme can be easily dissociated into two components, a membrane integral F0 component that forms a proton-permeable pore through the membrane and a peripheral F1 component that houses the three catalytic sites responsible for the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. The F1portion of the Escherichia coli enzyme is composed of five subunits in the stoichiometry α3β3γδε, whereas the F0sector is made up of three subunits with stoichiometryab 2 c 10–14. The generally accepted mechanism of ATP synthase function is commonly referred to as “rotational catalysis.” In this mechanism proton translocation through F0 causes the rotation of thec 10–14γε complex with respect to the remainder of the enzyme. During the process of oxidative phosphorylation, movement of this “rotor” is believed to drive the sequential conformational changes in α3β3causing binding of the substrates, ADP and Pi, and the release of the product, ATP, as predicted by Paul Boyer's binding change mechanism. For the rotational mechanism to operate, a second, peripheral stalk composed of the two b subunits and δ must link the α3β3 hexamer of F1with the a subunit of F0, preventing rotation of either with c 10–14γε (for recent reviews see Refs. 1.Walker J.E.

Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The theory of rotational catalysis received substantial support when Walker and co-workers (5.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar) solved the high resolution structure of the α3β3γ complex from beef heart mitochondria. The structure revealed a hexamer of alternating α and β subunits surrounding a central γ subunit. The three active sites for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis are located in clefts between α and β subunits and are occupied by different nucleotides. Since then, ATP-dependent rotational motion of the γε complex in the isolated F1 sector has been demonstrated by a number of methods (6.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 7.Hasler K. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), culminating in the direct observation that filaments or beads attached to either γ or ε undergo continuing rotation when ATP is added (8.Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 9.Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita K.J. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). More recently, efforts have been directed toward demonstrating that this mechanism also functions in the holoenzyme,i.e. that ATP induces rotation of γεc 10–14 in ATP synthase (11.Panke O.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rotation of filaments linked to c was observed in these studies, but the interpretation is controversial because of concern that the F0 and F1 sectors were not fully coupled in these in vitro experimental systems. This concern was raised by the lack of sensitivity to F0-specific inhibitors (14.Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the tendency of the second stalk to dissociate from the purified yeast enzyme (15.Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In the absence of the proper interactions of thec oligomer with the a and b subunits, the enzyme would be uncoupled and rotation of the c ring would be expected, regardless of whether or not it occurred during coupled activity. In another approach to rotation in F1F0, specific sites on γ or ε could be linked through disulfide bonds to any of the three β subunits, provided ATP hydrolysis was allowed to proceed (16.Bulygin V.V. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31765-31769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17.Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although consistent with rotation, this result could also be satisfied if γ and ε were to swivel in a reciprocating fashion through 240°. Such motion would allow γ and ε to sit in each of the three different positions they have been shown to occupy, while not actually rotating in a repeated circular fashion.Thus, questions remain regarding the rotational mechanism in intact ATP synthase (18.McCarty R.E. Evron Y. Johnson E.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanism has never been testedin vivo. In this work we describe an approach that allows tests of rotation and function both in vivo and in vitro. During rotational catalysis, the γε rotor must pass theb 2 stator; the size of the rotor is therefore limited by the space available. Any matter added to the rotor must also rotate within this confined space, sweeping out a larger volume of revolution. One would expect that if the added material is too large, it will sterically clash with b 2, and rotation will be blocked. As a result, both ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and proton pumping should be strongly or completely inhibited. We selected the C terminus of ε as the site to make additions, because deletion or mutation of residues in this region has only minimal effects on function in vivo (19.Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, effects on expression of ATP synthase subunits should be minor becauseuncC, encoding ε, is the last gene of the uncoperon. By fusing a series of proteins of increasing size to this site, we have altered the effective size of the rotor, allowing us to test rotation in vivo and to establish limits for the maximal volume of revolution. In addition, our studies indicate a novel role for the ε subunit in the holoenzyme, to increase the efficiency of ATP synthase by specifically preventing the uncoupled hydrolysis of ATP. ATP synthase is the enzyme responsible for the production of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. It is found throughout all forms of life, from the membranes of bacteria to the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes. The enzyme can be easily dissociated into two components, a membrane integral F0 component that forms a proton-permeable pore through the membrane and a peripheral F1 component that houses the three catalytic sites responsible for the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. The F1portion of the Escherichia coli enzyme is composed of five subunits in the stoichiometry α3β3γδε, whereas the F0sector is made up of three subunits with stoichiometryab 2 c 10–14. The generally accepted mechanism of ATP synthase function is commonly referred to as “rotational catalysis.” In this mechanism proton translocation through F0 causes the rotation of thec 10–14γε complex with respect to the remainder of the enzyme. During the process of oxidative phosphorylation, movement of this “rotor” is believed to drive the sequential conformational changes in α3β3causing binding of the substrates, ADP and Pi, and the release of the product, ATP, as predicted by Paul Boyer's binding change mechanism. For the rotational mechanism to operate, a second, peripheral stalk composed of the two b subunits and δ must link the α3β3 hexamer of F1with the a subunit of F0, preventing rotation of either with c 10–14γε (for recent reviews see Refs. 1.Walker J.E.

Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The theory of rotational catalysis received substantial support when Walker and co-workers (5.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar) solved the high resolution structure of the α3β3γ complex from beef heart mitochondria. The structure revealed a hexamer of alternating α and β subunits surrounding a central γ subunit. The three active sites for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis are located in clefts between α and β subunits and are occupied by different nucleotides. Since then, ATP-dependent rotational motion of the γε complex in the isolated F1 sector has been demonstrated by a number of methods (6.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 7.Hasler K. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), culminating in the direct observation that filaments or beads attached to either γ or ε undergo continuing rotation when ATP is added (8.Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 9.Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita K.J. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). More recently, efforts have been directed toward demonstrating that this mechanism also functions in the holoenzyme,i.e. that ATP induces rotation of γεc 10–14 in ATP synthase (11.Panke O.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rotation of filaments linked to c was observed in these studies, but the interpretation is controversial because of concern that the F0 and F1 sectors were not fully coupled in these in vitro experimental systems. This concern was raised by the lack of sensitivity to F0-specific inhibitors (14.Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the tendency of the second stalk to dissociate from the purified yeast enzyme (15.Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In the absence of the proper interactions of thec oligomer with the a and b subunits, the enzyme would be uncoupled and rotation of the c ring would be expected, regardless of whether or not it occurred during coupled activity. In another approach to rotation in F1F0, specific sites on γ or ε could be linked through disulfide bonds to any of the three β subunits, provided ATP hydrolysis was allowed to proceed (16.Bulygin V.V. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31765-31769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17.Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although consistent with rotation, this result could also be satisfied if γ and ε were to swivel in a reciprocating fashion through 240°. Such motion would allow γ and ε to sit in each of the three different positions they have been shown to occupy, while not actually rotating in a repeated circular fashion. Thus, questions remain regarding the rotational mechanism in intact ATP synthase (18.McCarty R.E. Evron Y. Johnson E.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanism has never been testedin vivo. In this work we describe an approach that allows tests of rotation and function both in vivo and in vitro. During rotational catalysis, the γε rotor must pass theb 2 stator; the size of the rotor is therefore limited by the space available. Any matter added to the rotor must also rotate within this confined space, sweeping out a larger volume of revolution. One would expect that if the added material is too large, it will sterically clash with b 2, and rotation will be blocked. As a result, both ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and proton pumping should be strongly or completely inhibited. We selected the C terminus of ε as the site to make additions, because deletion or mutation of residues in this region has only minimal effects on function in vivo (19.Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, effects on expression of ATP synthase subunits should be minor becauseuncC, encoding ε, is the last gene of the uncoperon. By fusing a series of proteins of increasing size to this site, we have altered the effective size of the rotor, allowing us to test rotation in vivo and to establish limits for the maximal volume of revolution. In addition, our studies indicate a novel role for the ε subunit in the holoenzyme, to increase the efficiency of ATP synthase by specifically preventing the uncoupled hydrolysis of ATP.

https://openalex.org/W1971347092,"The chemokine and HIV receptor CXCR4 has been shown to play a role in chemotaxis and HIV-1 entry into T cells. Dibutyryl cAMP (DcAMP), an analog of cAMP, has been shown to increase CXCR4 cell surface expression and HIV-1 infectivity, but the molecular mechanism(s) responsible is unknown. Here we show that DcAMP treatment of purified human T lymphocytes increased transcription of CXCR4 mRNA as well as cell surface and intracellular CXCR4 protein expression. DcAMP-mediated stimulation of human PBL increased T-trophic HIV-1 (X4) fusion and viral replication as measured by syncytia formation and p24 levels, respectively. To determine the region(s) of the CXCR4 promoter required for cAMP responsiveness, truncations and point mutations of the CXCR4 promoter (nucleotides -1098 to +59) fused to luciferase were constructed and transiently transfected into human PBL. Deletional analysis demonstrated that the -1098 to -93 region of the CXCR4 promoter construct could be eliminated; the residual (-93 to +59) promoter retained cAMP responsiveness. Site-directed mutagenesis of a putative cAMP-responsive element (CRE) in the 5' UTR (+41 to +49) significantly and specifically attenuated the ability of DcAMP to drive the minimal CXCR4 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the formation of a complex between the CREB transcription factor and the putative CXCR4 CRE site. Our findings demonstrate a CRE element within the CXCR4 promoter that regulates CXCR4 transcription in response to changes in cAMP signaling. The cAMP-dependent up-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA results in increased CXCR4 intracellular and cell surface protein expression as well as increased HIV infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2171853790,"The utrophin gene codes for a large cytoskeletal protein closely related to dystrophin, the gene mutated in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Although utrophin could functionally substitute for dystrophin, in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy patients it did not compensate for the absence of dystrophin because in adult muscle utrophin was poorly expressed and limited to subsynaptic nuclei. However, increased levels of utrophin have been observed in regenerated muscles fibers suggesting that utrophin up-regulation in muscle is feasible. We observed that utrophin mRNA was transiently up-regulated at early time points after muscle injury with a peak already 24 h after muscle damage and utrophin induction in activated satellite cells before fusion into young regenerated fibers. Injection of utrophin lacZ constructs into regenerating muscle demonstrated that the utrophin upstream promoter under the control of its intronic enhancer activated the transcription that leads to the expression of the reporter gene in the newly formed fibers, which was not limited to neuromuscular junctions. Utrophin enhancer activity was dependent on an AP-1 site, and in satellite cells of regenerating muscle the AP-1 factors Fra1, Fra2, and JunD were strongly induced. These results establish that utrophin was induced in adult muscle independently from neuromuscular junctions and suggest that growth factors and cytokines that mediate the muscle repair up-regulate utrophin transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2049457762,"To define the structures within the insulin receptor (IR) that are required for high affinity ligand binding, we have used IR fragments consisting of four amino-terminal domains (L1, cysteine-rich, L2, first fibronectin type III domain) fused to sequences encoded by exon 10 (including the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit). The fragments contained one or both cysteine residues (amino acids 524 and 682) that form disulfides between α-subunits in native IR. A dimeric fragment designated IR593.CT (amino acids 1–593 and 704–719) bound 125I-insulin with high affinity comparable to detergent-solubilized wild type IR and mIR.Fn0/Ex10 (amino acids 1–601 and 650–719) and greater than that of dimeric mIR.Fn0 (amino acids 1–601 and 704–719) and monomeric IR473.CT (amino acids 1–473 and 704–719). However, neither IR593.CT nor mIR.Fn0 exhibited negative cooperativity (a feature characteristic of the native insulin receptor and mIR.Fn0/Ex10), as shown by failure of unlabeled insulin to accelerate dissociation of bound125I-insulin. Anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes in the first fibronectin type III domain (amino acids 471–593) and inhibit insulin binding to wild type IR inhibited insulin binding to mIR.Fn0/Ex10 but not IR593.CT or mIR.Fn0. We conclude the following: 1) precise positioning of the carboxyl-terminal sequence can be a critical determinant of binding affinity; 2) dimerization via the first fibronectin domain alone can contribute to high affinity ligand binding; and 3) the second dimerization domain encoded by exon 10 is required for ligand cooperativity and modulation by antibodies."

The viral-encoded integrase is responsible for site-specific integration of SSV1 into its host genome. The recombinant enzyme was expressed inEscherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and its biochemical properties investigated in vitro. We show that the SSV1 integrase belongs to the tyrosine recombinases family and that Tyr314 is involved in the formation of a 3′-phosphotyrosine intermediate. The integrase cleaves both strands of a synthetic substrate in a temperature-dependent reaction, the cleavage efficiency increasing with temperature. A discontinuity was observed in the Arrhenius plot above 50 °C, suggesting that a conformational transition may occur in the integrase at this temperature. Analysis of cleavage time course suggested that noncovalent binding of the integrase to its substrate is rate-limiting in the cleavage reaction. The cleavage positions were localized on each side of the anticodon loop of the tRNA gene where SSV1 integration takes place. Finally, the SSV1 integrase is able to cut substrates harboring mismatches in the binding site. For the cleavage step, the chemical nature of the base in position −1 of cleavage seems to be more important than its pairing to the opposite strand."
https://openalex.org/W2046017517,"TraM is a DNA binding protein required for conjugative transfer of the self-transmissible IncF group of plasmids, including F, R1, and R100. F TraM binds to three sites in ForiT: two high affinity binding sites, sbmA andsbmB, which are direct repeats of nearly identical sequence involved in the autoregulation of the traM gene; and a lower affinity site, sbmC, an inverted repeat important for transfer, which is situated nearest to the nic site where transfer originates. TraM bound cooperatively to its binding sites atoriT; the presence of sbmA and sbmBincreased the affinity for sbmC 10-fold. Bending oforiT DNA by TraM was minimal, suggesting that TraM, a tetramer, was able to loop the DNA when bound to sbmA andsbmB simultaneously. Hydroxyl radical footprinting of DNA of sbmA and sbmC revealed that TraM contacted the DNA within a region previously delineated by DNase I footprinting. TraM protected the CT bases within the sequence CTAG, which occurred at 12-base intervals on the top and bottom strand of sbmA, most consistently with other protected bases. The footprint onsbmC revealed that the predicted inverted repeats were protected by TraM with a pattern that began at the center of the repeats and radiated outward at 11–12 base intervals toward the 5′-ends of either strand. At high protein concentrations, this pattern extended beyond the footprint defined by DNase I, suggesting that the DNA was wrapped around the protein forming a nucleosome-like structure, which could aid in preparing the DNA for transfer.

The F plasmid is a 100-kbp circular plasmid 1The nucleotide sequence of the F plasmid is available in the GenBank™ database under accession number NC002483.1The nucleotide sequence of the F plasmid is available in the GenBank™ database under accession number NC002483. found inEscherichia coli and is a paradigm for pilus-mediated conjugation. Transfer proteins required for conjugation have been divided into five categories based on relaxosome formation and DNA transport, pilus assembly, mating pair stabilization, surface exclusion, and regulation (1.Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relaxosome is a nucleoprotein complex of TraI, TraY, and TraM bound to the origin of transfer (oriT), which interacts with the DNA transport protein TraD, located in the inner membrane. TraI is both a relaxase, which cleaves at the nic site within oriT in a strand- and sequence- specific manner, and a helicase, which is essential for transfer (2.Matson S.W. Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TraY facilitates TraI relaxase activity atnic (4.Nelson W.C. Howard M.T. Sherman J.A. Matson S.W. J.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas TraM is a DNA binding protein that binds to three sites in the oriT region (sbmA,-B, -C). TraM is not required for cleavage atoriT (5.Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although it is essential for conjugation (7.Achtman M. Willetts N. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TraM is thought to bind TraD (8.Disque-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it might function by linking the relaxosome to the transferosome, a multiprotein complex that spans the cell envelope and is responsible for pilus assembly and mating pair formation.The highest affinity binding sites for F TraM are sbmA and-B, which are involved in the autoregulation of thetraM gene (9.Penfold S.S. Simon J. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the lowest affinity site,sbmC, is located nearest to nic and appears to have an important role in DNA metabolism during transfer. Removal ofsbmA and -B from a cloned oriT segment decreases transfer by 100-fold, whereas removal of sbmCfurther decreases transfer another 100-fold (10.Fu Y.H. Tsai M.M. Luo Y.N. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second function ofsbmA and sbmB may be to assist binding of TraM tosbmC, the weakest binding site, which is also the most critical for conjugation. This is supported by a similar mutational analysis of R100 (an F-like plasmid), where mutagenesis of the proximal half of sbmC (closest to nic) decreased mating 120-fold, whereas mutagenesis of any of the other TraM binding sites decreased mating to a maximum of 7-fold (11.Abo T. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The multiple binding sites may function in a cooperative fashion (12.Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1982Google Scholar) whereby low concentrations of protein act synergistically to control DNA-related events. Cooperative binding of TraM to its binding sites was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) 2The abbreviations used are: EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMCSmultiple cloning siteIHFintegration host factor2The abbreviations used are: EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMCSmultiple cloning siteIHFintegration host factor (2.Matson S.W. Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TraM·DNA contacts within the sbmA and -C sites were mapped using hydroxyl radical footprinting. The results suggest that TraM contacts slightly different bases than predicted and that the pattern of contact by TraM on the DNA suggests the formation of a nucleosome-like structure, which might aid in readying the DNA for transfer.DISCUSSIONAn improved purification procedure for TraM has allowed better resolution of shifted bands in EMSA, resulting in the estimation ofK a values that reflect the affinity of TraM for its binding sites. Although TraM is predominately a tetramer upon purification (6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20.Penfold S.S. Transcriptional Regulation of the F Plasmid.Ph.D. thesis. University of Alberta, 1995Google Scholar, 21.Kupelweiser G. Schwab M. Hogenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), monomer and dimer forms are present as measured by gel exclusion and analytical ultracentrifugation. Resizing purified tetrameric TraM resulted in the reappearance of monomers and dimers, suggesting that the three forms of TraM exist in equilibrium (3.Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The cooperative nature of TraM binding, especially tosbmABC, was clearly evident and probably reflects the tetrameric nature of the protein. In binding to sbmAB, an initial complex (I) of TraM bound to sbmA could be converted to a single tetramer of TraM bound to both sbmA andsbmB simultaneously (complex II) upon increasing concentrations of TraM. Thus the small amounts of the monomeric or dimeric forms of TraM might initiate the binding process, followed by tetramerization of TraM during cooperative binding to these sites. Preliminary evidence on estimating the number of TraM molecules bound to sbmAB suggested that complex I contains less than a tetramer of TraM whereas complex II does indeed contain a tetramer. More complete studies are currently under way. The number and arrangement of TraM subunits within complex III of sbmABC is not obvious, because TraM is apparently binding up to six sites involving direct and inverted repeats simultaneously.Analysis of F TraM, bound to its individual binding sites (sbmA and sbmC), showed little bending of the DNA. This is in accord with results for TraM from the F-like plasmid pED208, which had no detectable effect on DNA bending as determined by electron microscopy (22.Di Laurenzio L. Scraba D.G. Paranchych W. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Instead, IHF, which has two binding sites inoriT bordering sbmC, has been implicated in construction of the relaxosome in F and pED208 (22.Di Laurenzio L. Scraba D.G. Paranchych W. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23.Tsai M.M. Fu Y.H. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4603-4609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence between sbmA and sbmB does not contain an IHF binding site (3.Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that TraM could bind sbmA and-B simultaneously, folding the DNA back on itself to form a hairpin. Thus, bending the DNA in the sbmABC region could involve a combination of IHF and looping by TraM.An interesting phenomenon involved the binding patterns of TraM tosbmA, sbmAB, and sbmABC versus sbmC and a half sbmA site. The binding pattern of the first three gave defined species suggesting the formation of distinct complexes that were composed of specified amounts of protein and DNA. However, binding to the latter two binding sites gave species that gradually increased in size as more TraM was added, a phenomenon that was also seen in all EMSAs at high protein concentrations. This suggests that, as more protein was added, the protein complex bound to the DNA increased proportionately in size, with the added TraM being distributed approximately evenly among all the complexes. The smearing of these species during EMSA also suggested that these complexes were not stable and dissociated during electrophoresis. The striking pattern of protection in the hydroxyl radical footprints occurred at approximately every 11–12 bp. This suggests a model whereby TraM could wrap the DNA around itself to form a large complex with the protein contacting 4–5 bases approximately every 11 bp. This would resemble the nucleosome-like structure proposed for TraK in the RP4 system (24.Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17279-17286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TraK bends the DNA and wraps it around a multimeric core of protein in a process that is independent of IHF.Competition assays demonstrated that complex I and II(III) forsbmA, sbmAB, and sbmABC, were found to be highly stable and resist dissociation in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of specific DNA competitor. At very high concentrations of competitor DNA, small amounts of dissociation were seen for complex II of sbmAB and sbmABC, which resulted in formation of complex I. Complex I resisted dissociation in all cases suggesting a very stable complex was formed. Binding to sbmC was not as strong, and dissociation was seen when competitor DNA reached a 100-fold excess. Clearly, the presence of sbmA andsbmB stabilizes TraM binding to sbmC. These experiments were conducted using linear DNA templates, however, supercoiling is predicted to have an effect on TraM activity and possibly increase the degree of cooperativity even further, an aspect of TraM function that is currently under study.Hydroxyl radical footprinting was also performed on TraM bound tosbmA and sbmC to define which bases were protected within the previously published DNase I footprint (6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Footprinting of sbmA showed that TraM had as many points of contact on the upper and lower strands in contrast to the results for DNase I footprinting, which indicated more contact with the upper, retained strand. Modeling TraM onto sbmA suggested that a dimer initially recognizes the sequence CTAG and binds to two adjacent major grooves 12 bp apart on the same face of the DNA (Fig. 8). This would agree with the tetrameric nature of TraM where each dimer within a tetramer would interact with two major grooves at two binding sites (sbmA and sbmB, for instance), in a cooperative fashion.Footprinting of sbmC showed that TraM made contact with the top and bottom strands in a symmetrical pattern, although there appeared to be no sequence conservation between the contacted sites. The footprints on the top and bottom strands were approximately equal in intensity and were centered at the ACAACA sequence in the center of the footprint. Interestingly the footprints extended from the central region toward the 5′-ends of the DNA fragment. Two dimers can be modeled onto the sbmC site with each dimer occupying two major grooves on the upper and lower strands, respectively. The dimers would overlap at the center of the inverted repeat giving protection on both strands (Fig. 8 B). The spacing of 11–12 bp is suggestive of a phase-dependent process with one face of the DNA repeatedly contacting the protein. A consensus sequence was previously generated from the DNase I footprints by compiling the sequences in all three TraM binding sites (6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the hydroxyl radical footprint for sbmA demonstrated that contact with the DNA was shifted slightly upstream toward the palindromic sequence CTAG and that all four CTAG sequences in sbmA were involved (Fig. 8). TraM contacted the DNA every 11–12 bases outside the original DNase I footprint when a high concentration of TraM was used (Fig. 7, A and B). This suggested that TraM aggregates, as seen at high concentrations of protein on EMSA gels, wrapping the DNA around the protein and contacting the same face of the DNA upon each turn.The importance of multiple binding sites was exemplified by the LacI repressor using a reporter gene containing various combinations of Lac operators (25.Oehler S. Eismann E.R. Kramer H. Muller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that O1 is required for repression, with repression increasing 38- and 24-fold when O2 or O3, respectively, were present. This effect was attributed to cooperativity of binding by Lac repressor tetramers to the DNA. A similar mechanism can be suggested for TraM atoriT. The weak binding sites, sbmC (10.Fu Y.H. Tsai M.M. Luo Y.N. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andsbmA in R100 (corresponding to the proximal half ofsbmC in F (11.Abo T. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), have been shown to be of critical importance in maximizing transfer efficiency. The increase in affinity of TraM for DNA fragments containing sbmABC versus sbmC alone (almost 10-fold) suggests thatsbmAB may assist with loading TraM onto sbmC, the weakest binding site, a step that might be critical for TraM function and efficient transfer.We have demonstrated that the intracellular concentration of TraM is critical for transfer (26.Frost L.S. Manchak J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2579-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As cells enter exponential growth, the transcription of traM diminishes and the levels of TraM in the cell are undetectable by late exponential phase. IfsbmC, the site nearest oriT, and ostensibly the most important for transfer, was bound by TraM in a manner that was sensitive to the intracellular concentrations of the protein, the F conjugation apparatus would have engineered a simple, sensitive mechanism for controlling conjugation ability. In wild type F-like plasmids, conjugation is repressed by the fertility inhibition system FinOP (27.Frost L. Lee S. Yanchar N. Paranchych W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). F is naturally derepressed and appears to control its fertility via a complex circuitry centered around control oftraM transcription by TraY (9.Penfold S.S. Simon J. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and other host proteins. F could modulate its readiness for transfer at oriT by controlling the amount of TraM in the cell which, in turn, would affect binding of TraM to sbmC, following binding tosmbA and sbmB, in a cooperative manner. This model would predict that binding of TraM to the oriT region, especially sbmC, would affect the local superhelical density of the DNA. This would cause unwinding near oriT, most probably in the AT-rich region upstream of sbmC insbyA, permitting entry of the TraI helicase and initiating large scale DNA unwinding and transport to the recipient cell. Because TraM has been suggested to bind TraD, the coupling protein (8.Disque-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Cabezon E. Sastre J.I. de la Cruz F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the ability to form a nucleosome-like structure at high intracellular concentrations plus its ability to move the DNA into position for transport by binding TraD suggest that TraM might indeed be the “signaling” protein proposed by Willetts and Wilkins in 1984 (29.Willetts N.S. Wilkins B.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 24-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The F plasmid is a 100-kbp circular plasmid 1The nucleotide sequence of the F plasmid is available in the GenBank™ database under accession number NC002483.1The nucleotide sequence of the F plasmid is available in the GenBank™ database under accession number NC002483. found inEscherichia coli and is a paradigm for pilus-mediated conjugation. Transfer proteins required for conjugation have been divided into five categories based on relaxosome formation and DNA transport, pilus assembly, mating pair stabilization, surface exclusion, and regulation (1.Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relaxosome is a nucleoprotein complex of TraI, TraY, and TraM bound to the origin of transfer (oriT), which interacts with the DNA transport protein TraD, located in the inner membrane. TraI is both a relaxase, which cleaves at the nic site within oriT in a strand- and sequence- specific manner, and a helicase, which is essential for transfer (2.Matson S.W. Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TraY facilitates TraI relaxase activity atnic (4.Nelson W.C. Howard M.T. Sherman J.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28374-28380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5.Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas TraM is a DNA binding protein that binds to three sites in the oriT region (sbmA,-B, -C). TraM is not required for cleavage atoriT (5.Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although it is essential for conjugation (7.Achtman M. Willetts N. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TraM is thought to bind TraD (8.Disque-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it might function by linking the relaxosome to the transferosome, a multiprotein complex that spans the cell envelope and is responsible for pilus assembly and mating pair formation. The highest affinity binding sites for F TraM are sbmA and-B, which are involved in the autoregulation of thetraM gene (9.Penfold S.S. Simon J. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the lowest affinity site,sbmC, is located nearest to nic and appears to have an important role in DNA metabolism during transfer. Removal ofsbmA and -B from a cloned oriT segment decreases transfer by 100-fold, whereas removal of sbmCfurther decreases transfer another 100-fold (10.Fu Y.H. Tsai M.M. Luo Y.N. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second function ofsbmA and sbmB may be to assist binding of TraM tosbmC, the weakest binding site, which is also the most critical for conjugation. This is supported by a similar mutational analysis of R100 (an F-like plasmid), where mutagenesis of the proximal half of sbmC (closest to nic) decreased mating 120-fold, whereas mutagenesis of any of the other TraM binding sites decreased mating to a maximum of 7-fold (11.Abo T. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple binding sites may function in a cooperative fashion (12.Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1982Google Scholar) whereby low concentrations of protein act synergistically to control DNA-related events. Cooperative binding of TraM to its binding sites was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) 2The abbreviations used are: EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMCSmultiple cloning siteIHFintegration host factor2The abbreviations used are: EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMCSmultiple cloning siteIHFintegration host factor (2.Matson S.W. Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TraM·DNA contacts within the sbmA and -C sites were mapped using hydroxyl radical footprinting. The results suggest that TraM contacts slightly different bases than predicted and that the pattern of contact by TraM on the DNA suggests the formation of a nucleosome-like structure, which might aid in readying the DNA for transfer. electrophoretic mobility shift assay multiple cloning site integration host factor electrophoretic mobility shift assay multiple cloning site integration host factor DISCUSSIONAn improved purification procedure for TraM has allowed better resolution of shifted bands in EMSA, resulting in the estimation ofK a values that reflect the affinity of TraM for its binding sites. Although TraM is predominately a tetramer upon purification (6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20.Penfold S.S. Transcriptional Regulation of the F Plasmid.Ph.D. thesis. University of Alberta, 1995Google Scholar, 21.Kupelweiser G. Schwab M. Hogenauer G. Koraimann G. Zechner E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), monomer and dimer forms are present as measured by gel exclusion and analytical ultracentrifugation. Resizing purified tetrameric TraM resulted in the reappearance of monomers and dimers, suggesting that the three forms of TraM exist in equilibrium (3.Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The cooperative nature of TraM binding, especially tosbmABC, was clearly evident and probably reflects the tetrameric nature of the protein. In binding to sbmAB, an initial complex (I) of TraM bound to sbmA could be converted to a single tetramer of TraM bound to both sbmA andsbmB simultaneously (complex II) upon increasing concentrations of TraM. Thus the small amounts of the monomeric or dimeric forms of TraM might initiate the binding process, followed by tetramerization of TraM during cooperative binding to these sites. Preliminary evidence on estimating the number of TraM molecules bound to sbmAB suggested that complex I contains less than a tetramer of TraM whereas complex II does indeed contain a tetramer. More complete studies are currently under way. The number and arrangement of TraM subunits within complex III of sbmABC is not obvious, because TraM is apparently binding up to six sites involving direct and inverted repeats simultaneously.Analysis of F TraM, bound to its individual binding sites (sbmA and sbmC), showed little bending of the DNA. This is in accord with results for TraM from the F-like plasmid pED208, which had no detectable effect on DNA bending as determined by electron microscopy (22.Di Laurenzio L. Scraba D.G. Paranchych W. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Instead, IHF, which has two binding sites inoriT bordering sbmC, has been implicated in construction of the relaxosome in F and pED208 (22.Di Laurenzio L. Scraba D.G. Paranchych W. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23.Tsai M.M. Fu Y.H. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4603-4609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence between sbmA and sbmB does not contain an IHF binding site (3.Matson S.W. Sampson J.K. Byrd D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2372-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that TraM could bind sbmA and-B simultaneously, folding the DNA back on itself to form a hairpin. Thus, bending the DNA in the sbmABC region could involve a combination of IHF and looping by TraM.An interesting phenomenon involved the binding patterns of TraM tosbmA, sbmAB, and sbmABC versus sbmC and a half sbmA site. The binding pattern of the first three gave defined species suggesting the formation of distinct complexes that were composed of specified amounts of protein and DNA. However, binding to the latter two binding sites gave species that gradually increased in size as more TraM was added, a phenomenon that was also seen in all EMSAs at high protein concentrations. This suggests that, as more protein was added, the protein complex bound to the DNA increased proportionately in size, with the added TraM being distributed approximately evenly among all the complexes. The smearing of these species during EMSA also suggested that these complexes were not stable and dissociated during electrophoresis. The striking pattern of protection in the hydroxyl radical footprints occurred at approximately every 11–12 bp. This suggests a model whereby TraM could wrap the DNA around itself to form a large complex with the protein contacting 4–5 bases approximately every 11 bp. This would resemble the nucleosome-like structure proposed for TraK in the RP4 system (24.Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17279-17286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TraK bends the DNA and wraps it around a multimeric core of protein in a process that is independent of IHF.Competition assays demonstrated that complex I and II(III) forsbmA, sbmAB, and sbmABC, were found to be highly stable and resist dissociation in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of specific DNA competitor. At very high concentrations of competitor DNA, small amounts of dissociation were seen for complex II of sbmAB and sbmABC, which resulted in formation of complex I. Complex I resisted dissociation in all cases suggesting a very stable complex was formed. Binding to sbmC was not as strong, and dissociation was seen when competitor DNA reached a 100-fold excess. Clearly, the presence of sbmA andsbmB stabilizes TraM binding to sbmC. These experiments were conducted using linear DNA templates, however, supercoiling is predicted to have an effect on TraM activity and possibly increase the degree of cooperativity even further, an aspect of TraM function that is currently under study.Hydroxyl radical footprinting was also performed on TraM bound tosbmA and sbmC to define which bases were protected within the previously published DNase I footprint (6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Footprinting of sbmA showed that TraM had as many points of contact on the upper and lower strands in contrast to the results for DNase I footprinting, which indicated more contact with the upper, retained strand. Modeling TraM onto sbmA suggested that a dimer initially recognizes the sequence CTAG and binds to two adjacent major grooves 12 bp apart on the same face of the DNA (Fig. 8). This would agree with the tetrameric nature of TraM where each dimer within a tetramer would interact with two major grooves at two binding sites (sbmA and sbmB, for instance), in a cooperative fashion.Footprinting of sbmC showed that TraM made contact with the top and bottom strands in a symmetrical pattern, although there appeared to be no sequence conservation between the contacted sites. The footprints on the top and bottom strands were approximately equal in intensity and were centered at the ACAACA sequence in the center of the footprint. Interestingly the footprints extended from the central region toward the 5′-ends of the DNA fragment. Two dimers can be modeled onto the sbmC site with each dimer occupying two major grooves on the upper and lower strands, respectively. The dimers would overlap at the center of the inverted repeat giving protection on both strands (Fig. 8 B). The spacing of 11–12 bp is suggestive of a phase-dependent process with one face of the DNA repeatedly contacting the protein. A consensus sequence was previously generated from the DNase I footprints by compiling the sequences in all three TraM binding sites (6.Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the hydroxyl radical footprint for sbmA demonstrated that contact with the DNA was shifted slightly upstream toward the palindromic sequence CTAG and that all four CTAG sequences in sbmA were involved (Fig. 8).

This suggested that TraM aggregates, as seen at high concentrations of protein on EMSA gels, wrapping the DNA around the protein and contacting the same face of the DNA upon each turn.The importance of multiple binding sites was exemplified by the LacI repressor using a reporter gene containing various combinations of Lac operators (25.Oehler S.

This effect was attributed to cooperativity of binding by Lac repressor tetramers to the DNA. A similar mechanism can be suggested for TraM atoriT. The weak binding sites, sbmC (10.Fu Y.H. Tsai M.M. Luo Y.N. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andsbmA in R100 (corresponding to the proximal half ofsbmC in F (11.Abo T. Ohtsubo E. J.

IfsbmC, the site nearest oriT, and ostensibly the most important for transfer, was bound by TraM in a manner that was sensitive to the intracellular concentrations of the protein, the F conjugation apparatus would have engineered a simple, sensitive mechanism for controlling conjugation ability. In wild type F-like plasmids, conjugation is repressed by the fertility inhibition system FinOP (27.Frost L. Lee S. Yanchar N. Paranchych W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). F is naturally derepressed and appears to control its fertility via a complex circuitry centered around control oftraM transcription by TraY (9.Penfold S.S. Simon J. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and other host proteins. F could modulate its readiness for transfer at oriT by controlling the amount of TraM in the cell which, in turn, would affect binding of TraM to sbmC, following binding tosmbA and sbmB, in a cooperative manner. This model would predict that binding of TraM to the oriT region, especially sbmC, would affect the local superhelical density of the DNA. This would cause unwinding near oriT, most probably in the AT-rich region upstream of sbmC insbyA, permitting entry of the TraI helicase and initiating large scale DNA unwinding and transport to the recipient cell. Because TraM has been suggested to bind TraD, the coupling protein (8.Disque-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Cabezon E. Sastre J.I. de la Cruz F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the ability to form a nucleosome-like structure at high intracellular concentrations plus its ability to move the DNA into position for transport by binding TraD suggest that TraM might indeed be the “signaling” protein proposed by Willetts and Wilkins in 1984 (29.Willetts N.S. Wilkins B.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 24-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2051326025,"Plasma membrane-associated redox systems play important roles in regulation of cell growth, internal pH, signal transduction, apoptosis, and defense against pathogens. Stimulation of cell growth and stimulation of the redox system of plasma membranes are correlated. When cell growth is inhibited by antitumor agents such as doxorubicin, capsaicin, and antitumor sulfonylureas, redox activities of the plasma membrane also are inhibited. A doxorubicin-inhibited NADH-quinone reductase was characterized and purified from plasma membranes of rat liver. First, an NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase, which was doxorubicin-insensitive, was removed from the plasma membranes by the lysosomal protease, cathepsin D. After removal of the NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase, the plasma membranes retained a doxorubicin-inhibited NADH-quinone reductase activity. The enzyme, with an apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa, was purified 200-fold over the cathepsin D-treated plasma membranes. The purified enzyme had also an NADH-coenzyme Q(0) reductase (NADH: external acceptor (quinone) reductase; EC 1.6.5.) activity. Partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed that it was unique with no sequence homology to any known protein. Antibody against the enzyme (peptide sequence) was produced and affinity-purified. The purified antibody immunoprecipitated both the NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity and NADH-coenzyme Q(0) reductase activity of plasma membranes and cross-reacted with human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and doxorubicin-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562R cells. Localization by fluorescence microscopy showed that the reaction was with the external surface of the plasma membranes. The doxorubicin-inhibited NADH-quinone reductase may provide a target for the anthracycline antitumor agents and a candidate ferricyanide reductase for plasma membrane electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W2142057607,"The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) on the plasma membrane is thought to be the main calcium extrusion system from the cytosol to the extracellular space in many mammalian excitable cells, including cardiac myocytes. However, the pathophysiological role of NCX in the heart is still unclear because of the lack of known specific inhibitors of NCX. To determine the role of NCX in cardiac contraction and the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we imposed pressure overload on the heart of heterozygous NCX knockout (KO) mice by constricting transverse aorta, and examined cardiac function and morphology 3 wk after operation. Although there was no difference in cardiac function between sham-operated KO mice and sham-operated wild-type (WT) mice, KO mice showed higher left ventricular pressure and better systolic function than WT mice in response to pressure overload. Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNA levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase were reduced by pressure overload in left ventricles of WT but not of KO mice. However, hypertrophic changes with interstitial fibrosis were more prominent in KO mice than WT mice. These results suggest that reduction of NCX results in supernormalized cardiac function and causes marked cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload."

In CLM containing a low free [Ca2+] (∼4 nm), 300 μm IP3 evoked45Ca2+ release after a latency of 66 ± 11 ms; this was reduced to 14 ± 3 ms when the [Ca2+] was 1 mm. Preincubation with CLM containing 100 μm Ca2+ caused a rapid (half-time = 33 ± 9 ms), complete, and fully reversible inhibition that could not be overcome by a high concentration of IP3 (300 μm). Hepatic (type 2) IP3 receptors were not inhibited by Ca2+ once they had bound IP3, but 100 μm Ca2+ rapidly inhibited type 3 IP3 receptors whether it was delivered before addition of IP3 or at any stage during a response to IP3. Ca2+ increases the affinity of IP3 for hepatic receptors by slowing IP3 dissociation, but Ca2+had no effect on IP3 binding to type 3 receptors. The rate of inhibition of type 3 IP3 receptors by Ca2+was faster than the rate of IP3 dissociation, and occurred at similar rates whether receptors had bound a high (adenophostin) or low affinity (3-deoxy-3-fluoro-IP3) agonist. Dissociation of agonist is not therefore required for Ca2+ to inhibit type 3 IP3 receptors. We conclude that type 2 and 3 IP3 receptors are each biphasically regulated by Ca2+, but by different mechanisms. For both, IP3 binding causes a stimulatory Ca2+-binding site to be exposed allowing Ca2+ to bind and open the channel. IP3 binding protects type 2 receptors from Ca2+ inhibition, but type 3 receptors are inhibited by Ca2+ whether or not they have IP3 bound. Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] will immediately inhibit type 3 receptors, but inhibit type 2 receptors only after IP3 has dissociated. In cytosol-like medium (CLM) with a free [Ca2+] of 200 nm, a supramaximal concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (30 μm) evoked 45Ca2+ release from type 3 IP3 receptors only after a latency of 48 ± 6 ms; this latency could not be reduced by increasing the IP3concentration.

Each subtype is predicted to form a similar structure with an N-terminal IP3-binding domain separated by some 1500 residues from a C-terminal region that includes six membrane-spanning domains, the last two of which together with the intervening loop line the pore of the channel (6Galvan D.L.

Within the functional receptor, however, the IP3-binding domain of one subunit appears to be intimately associated with the pore region of a neighboring subunit (8Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ion permeation properties of the channel are also similar for each receptor subtype (9Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A.

The effects of Ca2+ on type 3 IP3 receptors have aroused more controversy. In bilayer recordings from the type 3 IP3 receptors of RIN-5F cells, even very high concentrations of Ca2+ failed to inhibit channel activity (23Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 296: 81-84Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). IP3-evoked Ca2+ release from DT40 cells lacking types 1 and 2 IP3 receptors also appeared to be resistant to Ca2+ inhibition (24Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). But many other studies of both cells expressing predominantly type 3 IP3 receptors (25Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Sienaert I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have reported biphasic regulation of IP3 receptor behavior by cytosolic Ca2+. It seems likely, therefore, that biphasic regulation by cytosolic Ca2+ may be an ubiquitous feature of IP3 receptors, although it is far from clear that the underlying mechanisms are the same (28Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Cardy T.J.A. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The rapid kinetics of IP3 receptor regulation by IP3 and Ca2+ are likely to be significant in determining the contributions of different IP3 receptor subtypes to the complex regenerative Ca2+ signals in intact cells (30Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar, 31Adkins C.E. Taylor C.W. Curr.

Despite the importance of resolving the behavior of IP3 receptors on a time scale appropriate to understanding rapid Ca2+ release events in intact cells (30Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar), most studies of IP3 receptor gating have been limited to either steady-state measurements (15Mak D.-O. McBride S.

Nature. 1998; 296: 81-84Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or to examining rates of Ca2+ release with very limited temporal resolution. We previously used rapid superfusion of permeabilized rat hepatocytes loaded with 45Ca2+ to examine the kinetics of IP3-evoked Ca2+ release by type 2 IP3 receptors with a temporal resolution of 9 ms (31Adkins C.E. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1115-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 32Marchant J.S. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 510-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We concluded that IP3 binding determined whether Ca2+ stimulated or inhibited channel opening (31Adkins C.E. Taylor C.W. Curr.

Here, we apply similar methods to examine IP3-evoked Ca2+ release from permeabilized RINm5F cells, which both we (26Swatton J.E. Morris S.A. Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and others (33Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) have shown to express predominantly type 3 IP3 receptors. IP3 was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). 45Ca2+(238.5 Ci/mol) was from ICN (Thame, Oxfordshire, UK) and [3H]IP3 (37 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, UK). Ionomycin, synthetic adenophostin A, and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro IP3 were from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Thapsigargin was from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). All other materials were from suppliers listed earlier (26Swatton J.E. Morris S.A. Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RINm5F rat insulinoma cells (a gift from Dr. Peter Brown, University of Manchester, UK) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma, Poole, UK). Cells were passaged every 3–4 days when confluent. Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of male Wistar rates (200–300 g) by collagenase digestion (34Taylor C.W. Marchant J.S. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1999: 361-384Google Scholar) and kept for up to 6 h at 4 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 26 mm NaHCO3 and 2% bovine serum albumin. Confluent RINm5F cells (passages 90–100) were scraped from a flask, washed by centrifugation (650 × g, 2 min), and resuspended (1 × 106 cells/ml) in Ca2+-free cytosol-like medium (CLM: 140 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, at 37 °C). The cells were permeabilized by incubation with saponin (10 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C (26Swatton J.E. Morris S.A. Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), washed by centrifugation (650 × g, 2 min), and resuspended in CLM containing ∼200 nm free Ca2+ (300 μm total Ca2+), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (10 μm), and 45Ca2+ (10 μCi/ml). After addition of ATP (1.5 mm), creatine phosphate (5 mm), and creatine phosphokinase (5 units/ml), cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C during which their intracellular stores reached a steady-state Ca2+ content of 141 ± 14 pmol/106 cells (n = 3). Cells were rapidly removed from the loading medium by 8-fold dilution into CLM (200 nm free Ca2+, 20 °C) and a brief centrifugation (650 × g, 30 s), before resuspension (6 × 106 cells/ml) in CLM (200 nm free Ca2+, 20 °C). The effects of IP3 or its analogues on the 45Ca2+content of the stores were determined after 2-min incubations at 20 °C (to allow direct comparison with superfusion experiments) and in the presence of thapsigargin (1 μm) to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. The incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel receptor binding harvester (26Swatton J.E. Morris S.A. Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the45Ca2+ content of the stores determined by liquid scintillation counting. Active 45Ca2+accumulation was defined as the 45Ca2+ that could be released by ionomycin (10 μm). Permeabilized RINm5F cells loaded with45Ca2+ (30 μCi/ml) were immobilized on a nitrocellulose and glass fiber filter array held in the chamber of a rapid superfusion apparatus; the apparatus has been described elsewhere (34Taylor C.W. Marchant J.S. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1999: 361-384Google Scholar). Briefly it allows rates of 45Ca2+ release from the immobilized cells to be measured with a temporal resolution of up to 9 ms, as CLM flows (at 2 ml/s) from pressurized cylinders to the cells and then (with the 45Ca2+ released from the cells) into vials arranged around a circular fraction collector. Because the medium bathing the immobilized cells is continuously replaced during superfusion, unidirectional45Ca2+ efflux can be measured without the addition of thapsigargin used in the conventional45Ca2+ efflux experiments (see above). Inclusion of an inert marker ([3H]inulin) in the superfusing media allowed the arrival of a stimulus to be precisely related to changes in 45Ca2+ efflux. Under the conditions used for these experiments, the half-time (t1/2) for exchange of the media was 31 ± 1 ms (n = 3). All experiments were performed at 20 °C. The size of the intracellular 45Ca2+ pool was calculated for each experiment by summing all45Ca2+ released during the stimulation with that released at the end of the experiment by Triton X-100 (0.5%). In some experiments (Fig. 2) very rapid increases in free [Ca2+] were achieved using a pulsing protocol (31Adkins C.E. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1115-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar): a 50-ms pulse of CLM containing 1.65 mm Ca2+followed by continuous superfusion with CLM containing 1.1 mm Ca2+ allowed the free [Ca2+] to be increased from ∼200 nm to 100 μmwithin 50 ms. Permeabilized hepatocytes were prepared and loaded with45Ca2+ as reported previously (34Taylor C.W. Marchant J.S. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1999: 361-384Google Scholar), and rates of IP3-evoked 45Ca2+ release were then measured using rapid superfusion as described for RINm5F cells. Free [Ca2+] were predicted using the computer program WinMAXC version 2.05 (C. Patton, Stanford University, CA 93950), and then measured using either fura 2 or a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (19Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13214-13220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Swatton J.E. Morris S.A. Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Saponin-permeabilized RINm5F cells were washed by centrifugation (650 × g, 2 min), resuspended in TE medium (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, at 2 °C), and incubated (2.75 × 106 cells in 200 μl) with [3H]IP3 (3 nm) and competing ligands for 5 min at 2 °C. Bound and free ligand were separated by filtration (35Nerou E.P. Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and 3H activity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Specific [3H]IP3 binding (∼500 disintegrations/min) was typically ∼70% of total binding. Equilibrium binding data were analyzed to provide dissociation constants (Kd) for competing ligands as reported previously (35Nerou E.P. Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the 45Ca2+ content of the stores declines as a superfusion experiment progresses, we express many of the responses to IP3 as fractional release rates, where the amount of 45Ca2+ released by IP3 is expressed as a fraction of the45Ca2+ remaining within the IP3-sensitive stores at the beginning of that interval (34Taylor C.W. Marchant J.S. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1999: 361-384Google Scholar). By expressing rates of 45Ca2+ release relative to the amount of 45Ca2+ available for release, this form of analysis effectively isolates the activity of the IP3 receptor from changes in the45Ca2+ content of the stores. We thereby expect stable fractional release rates unless the IP3 receptor changes its behavior (36Marchant J.S. Taylor C.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11524-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IP3-evoked Ca2+ release was calculated by subtracting the basal rate of 45Ca2+ release from the 45Ca2+ detected in each fraction during stimulation with IP3. By measuring basal rates of45Ca2+ release over protracted times (not shown), we established the following empirical relationship between the fraction of the Ca2+ stores released (S), the fractional rate of unstimulated 45Ca2+ release at the beginning of the superfusion (I) and the fractional rate of unstimulated 45Ca2+ release from partially depleted stores (P). P=I (0.71e−8.8S+0.31)Equation 1 This equation was used to separately compute the basal rate of45Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive and IP3-insensitive Ca2+ stores throughout the experiment. Concentration-effect relationships were fitted to logistic equations using nonlinear curve fitting (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software, PA) (37Marchant J.S. Beecroft M.D. Riley A.M. Jenkins D.J.

In permeabilized RINm5F cells, IP3 caused a rapid increase in the rate of 45Ca2+ release, with the half-maximal rate occurring with an IP3 concentration of 4.96 ± 0.82 μm (n = 3) and the maximal rate of 45Ca2+ release occurring with 10 μm IP3. During stimulation with 30 μm IP3 in normal CLM, the cells were therefore exposed to a supramaximal concentration of IP3within about 15 ms, but the first detectable release of45Ca2+ occurred only after a delay of 48 ± 6 ms (n = 3) (Fig. 1A, i). This long absolute latency, which is similar to that observed previously for hepatic IP3 receptors (32Marchant J.S. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 510-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was not shortened by further increasing the IP3 concentration (Fig. 1A, ii): the latency was 43 ± 9 ms (n = 3) when cells were stimulated with 300 μm IP3 (Table I). In the latter experiments, cells would have been exposed to at least 7 times the maximally effective IP3 concentration (∼70 μm) within 10 ms.Table ICytosolic Ca2+ shortens the latency for IP3 receptor activation without affecting the peak rate of 45Ca2+releaseFree [Ca2+]30 μm IP3, Latency300 μm IP3LatencyTime to peakPeak ratemsmsms%/10 ms∼4 nm66 ± 1266 ± 11217 ± 70.35 ± 0.09200 nm48 ± 643 ± 9293 ± 30.50 ± 0.04100 μmND1-aND, not determined.35 ± 4170 ± 150.44 ± 0.071 mmND14 ± 3121 ± 130.46 ± 0.08Latencies, defined as the first of 3 successive rises in45Ca2+ release following detection of [3H]inulin (included with the IP3) in the superfusate, are shown for cells stimulated with 30 or 300 μm IP3.

Peak rates of 45Ca2+release evoked by 300 μm IP3 and the time to reach the peak rate are also shown. Mean ± S.E. of three to six independent determinations. While the latency could not be reduced by increasing the IP3 concentration, it was reduced and ultimately abolished by increasing the free [Ca2+] of the CLM. In nominally Ca2+-free CLM (free [Ca2+] ∼4 nm), the latency after stimulation with 300 μm IP3 was 66 ± 11 ms and this was reduced as the free [Ca2+] was increased (Table I), such that when the free [Ca2+] was 1 mm, the latency was only 14 ± 3 ms (Table I, Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that although increasing the free [Ca2+] shortened both the latency and the time taken for the rate of45Ca2+ release to reach its peak, it had no significant effect on the peak rate of 45Ca2+release (Table I). Although there was an immediate rise in the rate of45Ca2+ release when IP3 (300 μm) was delivered in the presence of 1 mmfree Ca2+, there was a lag of ∼40 ms before the response attained its fastest rate (Fig. 1B). We considered whether this slow take-off might simply result from a relatively slow increase in free [Ca2+] as Ca2+-free CLM (1 mm EGTA) was replaced by (t1/2 = 31 ± 1 ms) the high-Ca2+ CLM (2 mmCa2+, 1 mm EGTA) causing an abrupt increase in free [Ca2+] as the buffering capacity of the EGTA was exceeded. The simulation shown in Fig. 1D confirms that under the conditions used for these experiments, a switch to high-Ca2+ CLM caused the free [Ca2+] surrounding the cells to abruptly increase to several micromolar only after a delay of ∼25 ms. By reducing the EGTA concentration in the CLM used initially to 100 μmand then stepping to CLM containing 1 mm Ca2+without EGTA, the free [Ca2+] surrounding the cells was predicted to increase almost linearly to 1 mm and to exceed 100 μm within 8 ms (Fig. 1E). We used this Ca2+-delivery protocol to very rapidly expose cells to a high free [Ca2+] during the latent period of the response to a supramaximal concentration of IP3. Cells were first exposed to IP3 (300 μm) in nominally Ca2+-free CLM (100 μm EGTA) for 30 ms and then to high-Ca2+ in EGTA-free CLM (Fig. 1C). During the initial exposure to IP3, there was no stimulated release of 45Ca2+ because this interval lies within the latent period (∼66 ms in nominally Ca2+-free CLM). After rapidly increasing the free [Ca2+], there was an immediate increase in the rate of45Ca2+ release with no detectable latency (Fig. 1C). Stimulation of permeabilized RINm5F cells with a maximal concentration of IP3 (10 μm) caused a rapid increase in the rate of 45Ca2+ release to a peak, followed by a decay over several seconds (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of the cells for 1.2 s with CLM containing a free [Ca2+] of 100 μm completely abolished the subsequent response to IP3 (Fig. 2A). The increase in free [Ca2+] itself only minimally increased the rate of45Ca2+ release from 0.16 ± 0.01%/100 ms to 0.23 ± 0.01%/100 ms (n = 15) (Fig. 2D), indicating that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores could not account for the loss of response to IP3, and (see below) that increasing the free [Ca2+] does not itself significantly stimulate45Ca2+ release in the absence of IP3. The reversibility of the inhibition under conditions where the stores could not re-load with Ca2+ (see below) further confirms that the lack of response to IP3 results from inhibition of IP3 receptors rather than store depletion. The inhibition of IP3 receptors by high Ca2+could not be overcome by increasing the concentration of IP3 (Fig. 2B). The normal peak rate of45Ca2+ release evoked by 10 μmIP3 was 3.03 ± 0.15%/100 ms (n = 3). After preincubation with high Ca2+ for 1.2 s, the peak rate of Ca2+ release fell to 0.027 ± 0.008%/100 ms (n = 3) after stimulation with 10 μmIP3, and to 0.24 ± 0.07%/100 ms (n = 3) after stimulation with 300 μm IP3. Inhibition of IP3 receptors by Ca2+ has been proposed to be mediated by calmodulin (38Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Weidema A.F. Sipma H. Vanlingen S., De Smet P. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have not established the site through which Ca2+ inhibits type 3 IP3 receptors, although it is unlikely to be calmodulin because neither calmidazolium (20 μm) nor a peptide inhibitor derived from Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (10 μm) (13Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) prevented complete inhibition of the IP3 receptor by CLM containing 100 μmCa2+ (not shown). By varying the duration of the preincubation with high-Ca2+ CLM before stimulating with 10 μmIP3, the half-time for inhibition by cytosolic Ca2+ was established (39 ± 3 ms, n = 3) (Fig. 2C). We were concerned that with such rapid inhibition, the time taken for IP3 to reach its maximally effective concentration was likely to significantly affect our measurement of the kinetics of Ca2+ inhibition. To resolve the issue, the time course of Ca2+ inhibition was investigated by preincubating with high-Ca2+ CLM and then assessing IP3 receptor activity using 300 μmIP3, which allowed the IP3 concentration to exceed 70 μm within 10 ms. The half-time for Ca2+ inhibition determined using this method (33 ± 9 ms) was indistinguishable from that observed using 10 μmIP3 as the test pulse (39 ± 3 ms). To a"
https://openalex.org/W2017044764,"There is evidence that mild elevations of tHcy are associated with an increased risk for occlusive vascular disease, thrombosis, and stroke. It is hypothesized here that cellular toxicity could indirectly result from auto-oxidation of homocysteine to homocystine. Elevated levels of total plasma homocysteine could be the primary cause of increased vascular risk, causing endothelial damage through a mechanism similar to that of cystine precipitation, which is known to cause stone formation in cystinosis and cystinuria. In fact, only traces of homocysteine circulate in plasma as the free thiol; the remainder is present as oxidation products. Of these, the symmetric disulfide homocystine is scarcely soluble at neutral pH. Its saturation limit is so close to the concentration of homocysteine in normal plasma that a transient increase of homocysteine levels could lead to precipitation of homocystine microcrystals in the bloodstream. These could damage endothelial tissue, acting as a mechanic primer for subsequent prothrombotic blood vessel alterations."

The mechanism by which proteins fold into their unique native structures is still a central problem in structural biology. It is increasingly recognized that the structure of non-native states of proteins can provide significant insight into fundamental issues such as the relationship between protein sequences and three-dimensional structures, the nature of protein folding pathways, the stability of proteins and their turnover in the cell, and the transport of proteins across membranes (1Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Moreover, intermediate states experienced by proteins in vivo often play a major role in protein association and aggregation, leading to the “so-called” conformational diseases (2Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 3: 1441-1449Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In contrast to the large amount of structural information available on native folded proteins, however, too few partly folded intermediates have been characterized thoroughly enough to propose general models on how the native state is attained and which is the structure of transient folding states. Investigation of a wide range of non-native states would then be of considerable value. To meet this need, new analytical strategies able to characterize transient species and to define the molecular details through which diverse proteins fold are required. Recently, structural biologists have turned their attention to integrated strategies for the definition of the surface topology of proteins and protein complexes. Although these approaches provide low resolution data, they are amenable to the analysis of transient species and partly folded intermediates. Limited proteolysis and amide hydrogen exchange experiments in combination with mass spectrometry have been employed to investigate the surface topology and the conformational flexibility of proteins and protein complexes. Amide protons are exchanged with deuterium with kinetics mainly depending on both solvent accessibility and stabilization of the associated protein backbone region (3Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q.

The stable conformation of proteins then provides some stereochemical barriers to enzymatic attack, leaving the exposed and flexible regions accessible to proteases and preventing the occurrence of proteolytic cleavages within the highly structured core of the molecule. Consequently, when these experiments are performed using a series of proteases with different specificity under conditions that favors a single bond cleavage (complementary proteolysis), the pattern of preferred cleavage sites will depict the exposed regions in the protein molecule (14Zappacosta F.

This paper reports the application of these integrated strategies to the structural characterization of partly folded intermediates of wild type and a mutant form of Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (EcAspAT), in which the highly conserved cis-proline in position 138 had been replaced by a trans-alanine (P138A; Ref. 25Birolo L. Malashkevich V.N. Capitani G., De Luca F. Moretta A. Jansonius J.N. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EcAspAT is a homodimer with two identical and independent active sites located at the subunit interface. Each subunit consists of an N-terminal arm, a large cofactor-binding domain, and a small domain (26Jäger J. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Pro-138 is located in a loop region of the large domain close to the interface with the small domain (27McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Picot D. Jansonius J.N. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 197-213Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The replacement of a cis-proline by a trans-alanine did not significantly affect either the activity or the stability of the protein, as the catalytic efficiency of P138A is of the same order of magnitude of WT, and the thermal unfolding curves of the mutant and the WT are almost superimposable (25Birolo L. Malashkevich V.N. Capitani G., De Luca F. Moretta A. Jansonius J.N. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally, the GdmHCl-induced unfolding equilibrium of P138A mutant follows the same pathway as the wild type protein (25Birolo L. Malashkevich V.N. Capitani G., De Luca F. Moretta A. Jansonius J.N. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mutant enzyme shows interesting folding features, because, despite the replacement of a cis peptide bond with a trans one, the refolding process is slower than wild type (25Birolo L.

Recombinant wild type and P138A mutant EcAspATs were isolated from the overproducing E. coli strain TY103 (28Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Hiromi K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol.

Reverse phase-HPLC C4 columns (25 × 0.46 cm, 5 mm) were purchased from Vydac (The Separation Groups). All other reagents and solvents were HPLC-grade from Carlo Erba. Native EcAspAT holoenzymes (in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15 m NaCl) were incubated at 25 °C at the required protein and GdmHCl concentrations for 1 h (folding/unfolding equilibrium was attained within 30 min, as determined in preliminary experiments by following with time the enzymatic activity and fluorescence), and protein solutions were filtered just before the analysis on 0.22-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier thermostatic cell holder (Jasco model PTC-348), in a quartz cell (0.1-cm light path) at a protein concentration of 1.0 μm. Temperature was measured directly in the quartz cell, the solutions were filtered just before use on 0.22-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and data corrected by subtracting a control from which the protein was omitted. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C from 280 to 200 nm at 0.2-nm resolution, 16-s response, at a scan rate of 20 nm/min. All data are the averages of three measures, and the results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 θobs/lc, where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the concentration in residue moles/liter, and l is the length of the light path in centimeters. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a PerkinElmer LB50S fluorimeter, using an optical cuvette of 10-mm light path length with thermostatically controlled cell holder. Tryptophan emission spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of 1.0 μm using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, with excitation and emission bandwidths of 10 and 2.5 nm, respectively. Tryptophan emission spectra were recorded between 310 and 480 nm at a scan rate of 100 nm/min. Each spectrum is the average of three emission scans, and data were corrected by subtracting a blank from which the enzyme was omitted. ANS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on samples that had been incubated at determined GdmHCl concentration for 30 min at 25 °C at a protein concentration of 1.0 μm before adding ANS to a final concentration of 100 μm. ANS emission spectra were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 375 nm with excitation and emission bandwidths of 5 and 5 nm, respectively between 400 and 600 nm at a scan rate of 100 nm/min. Each spectrum is the average of three emission scans, and data were corrected by blank subtraction. Single-jump refolding experiments were carried out by concentration jumps of GdmHCl at 5 °C by rapid dilution of protein previously incubated at required higher denaturant concentrations to the desired one at a final protein concentrations of 0.39 μm, and the subsequent time-dependent changes in tryptophan or ANS fluorescence intensity were monitored, under continuos stirring, at 333 or 475 nm, respectively. Fluorescence quenching titrations with either acrylamide or iodide were performed at 25 °C by sequential addition of aliquots of concentrated acrylamide (8m) or potassium iodide (5.34 m) stock solution into the protein solution. For the native state, protein concentration was 3.9 μm in 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.15 m NaCl in a range of acrylamide concentration from 0 to 1.03 m. For the M* intermediate, iodide was added to the protein (0.39 μm previously incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15 m NaCl at 1.3 mGdmHCl for P138A-M*, and 1.5 m GdmHCl for WT-M*) to obtain final iodide concentration ranging from 0 to 0.2 m. Fluorescence was measured at 25 °C at the wavelength of the maximum in the fluorescence spectrum recorded in the absence of the quenching agent. Excitation was at 295 nm (10-nm excitation bandwidth, 2.5-nm emission bandwidth), corrected for the minor dilution caused by addition of the quenching agent and for the background fluorescence of both solvent and quenching agent. Correction for the inner filter effect that resulted from the absorption of acrylamide at 295 nm was applied by multiplying the fluorescence intensity by 10A/2, where A is the absorbance of the solution at 295 nm measured in a 1-cm path length cuvette. In the iodide experiments, 0.1 mmNa2S2O3 was included to prevent I3− ion formation. The fluorescence-quenching data in the presence of iodide quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Vollmer equation (Equation 1) (30Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Fo/F=1+KQ∗[Q]Equation 1 Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively.KQ is the Stern-Vollmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher. The plot of Fo/F versus [Q] is linear for an apparently homogeneous population of emitting fluorophores. Alternatively, a Stern-Vollmer-derived equation (Equation2) was used to calculate the fraction of accessible fluorescence, that is the fraction of tryptophans that are exposed and then accessible to the quenching agent. Fo/(Fo−F)=1/([Q]∗fa∗KQ)+1/faEquation 2 fa is the fraction of accessible fluorescence. The fluorescence-quenching data in the presence of acrylamide were analyzed according to the Stern-Vollmer equation (Equation 3), modified to take into account a static contribution to quenching (31Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Fo/F=(1+KQ∗[Q])exp(V∗[Q])Equation 3 V is the static constant. Gel filtration experiments were carried out as follows. 50 μl of the samples, 10 μm in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15m NaCl, equilibrated for 30 min at different concentrations of GdmHCl, were loaded on a Superose 12 PC (3.2 × 300 mm) gel filtration column installed on the Smart System (AmershamBiosciences), and isocratically eluted in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15 m NaCl at the same concentration of GdmHCl used in the equilibration. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The column was calibrated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmDTT, and 0.15 m NaCl in the absence of GdmHCl with the following proteins of known molecular mass: β-amylase (200,000 Da), cAspATp (92,000 Da), bovine hemoglobin (67,000 Da), cytochrome c (12,300 Da). The H/D reaction was conducted as follows; proteins were dissolved in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15m NaCl at 25 °C, in the presence of 1.4 mGdmHCl in the case of the two M* species, at a 8 μmprotein concentration, and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Deuterium exchange reactions were initiated by 10-fold dilution of the sample with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, D2O (containing 1.4m GdmHCl in the case of the two M* species). The exchange reaction was allowed to proceed for lengths of time ranging from 30 to 60 min, and, at each time point, 1 nmol of protein was removed from the labeling solution and rapidly injected into a 30 mm × 0.46 mm (inner diameter) perfusion column (POROS 10 R2 media, Applied Biosystems) on an HPLC equipped with two Series 200 LC isocratic pumps (Applied Biosystems) coupled to an API-100 single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient of 25–95% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 1.0 min. The HPLC step was performed with cold protiated solvents, thereby reducing the back-exchange kinetics and removing deuterium from side chains and N/C termini that exchange much faster than amide linkages (32Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in molecular mass provided a direct measurement of the deuteration at peptide amide linkages. Data were acquired and elaborated using the Biomultiviewer (Applied Biosystems) program. Non-deuterated and totally deuterated samples were used as control. The fully deuterated samples were prepared by incubation for 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.15 m NaCl, 5m GdmHCl in D2O at 8 μm protein concentration. LC/MS analysis was performed as above. Limited proteolysis experiments were carried out by incubating P138A-M*, WT-M*, P138A-N2, and WT-N2 with trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and endoprotease Lys C using enzyme to substrate ratios ranging from 1:1000 to 1:5 (w/w). Enzymatic digestions were all performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15 m NaCl at 25 °C, in the presence of the desired concentration of GdmHCl (1.3 m for P138A-M*, 1.5m for WT-M*), and without GdmHCl for the two native forms), at a 1 μm protein concentration. In the case of P138A-M* and WT-M*, each protein was incubated for 30 min in the reaction solution, before adding the selected enzyme. The extent of the reactions was monitored on a time-course basis by sampling the incubation mixture at different time intervals. Proteolytic fragments were analyzed by LC/MS performed on an API 100 single quadrupole electrospray (Applied Biosystems) equipped with two Series 200 LC isocratic pumps (Applied Biosystems). Chromatographic separation was obtained on a C4 column by the means of a 40-min linear gradient from 20 to 70% of acetonitrile in 2% formic acid and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired on a m/z interval ranging from 600 to 1800. Data were elaborated using the Biomultiviewer program, purchased from PE-Sciex. Mass calibration was performed by means of multiply charged ions from a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin (Sigma; average molecular mass: 16,951.5 Da); all masses are reported as average values. Previous studies suggested that GdmHCl-induced unfolding at equilibrium of EcAspAT at 20 °C is reversible and proceeds through the formation of at least two monomeric intermediates along the unfolding pathway (33Herold M. Kirshner K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). N2⇌2M⇌2M∗⇌2U REACTION 1N2 is the native dimer, M and M* are distinct “structured” monomers, and U is the unfolded state. As described by Herold and Kirschner (33Herold M. Kirshner K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the first intermediate M, the folded monomer of EcAspAT, is partially populated at ∼0.6 mGdmHCl and only at low protein concentrations. The second monomeric intermediate, M*, accumulates at 1 m GdmHCl and constitutes a “molten globule”-like species, which retains part of the tertiary and secondary structure of the native state. The unfolding process of both WT EcAspAT and the P138A mutant was investigated by fluorescence, gel filtration, and CD analysis and the corresponding M* species, identified according to the results reported by Herold and Kirschner (33Herold M. Kirshner K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and to size-exclusion chromatography data in GdmHCl at equilibrium (34Herold M. Leistler B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), were thoroughly characterized. Preliminary experiments (25Birolo L. Malashkevich V.N. Capitani G., De Luca F. Moretta A. Jansonius J.N. Marino G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed that folding/unfolding equilibrium was attained within 30 min and that, under the experimental conditions used, the folding intermediates were stable. No precipitation of protein was observed after incubation at the protein concentration used, and gel filtration analysis ruled out the presence of soluble aggregates (see below). Because the enzyme has five tryptophan residues located in various regions of its three-dimensional structure, with one positioned in the active site pocket, tryptophan fluorescence was used as a probe for global changes in tertiary structure of EcAspAT during protein unfolding and to distinguish between M and M* (33Herold M. Kirshner K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions, i.e. relatively high protein concentration (in the 1–10 μm range) and the presence of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, the N2 ⇌ 2M transition escaped fluorescence detection. This transition, indeed, is shifted toward higher denaturant concentrations by increasing the protein concentration and by the presence of the cofactor (33Herold M. Kirshner K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), thus overlapping with the M to M* transition. Fig. 1 shows the bathochromic shift of the fluorescence maximum for WT EcAspAT and the mutant as the concentration of GdmHCl increased. The unfolding process is clearly biphasic for both proteins, and a stable intermediate state, corresponding to the M* species, could be detected at given GdmHCl concentrations. Therefore, the first fluorescence-detected transition observed included both the dissociation of the dimer and the conversion to M*. Accordingly, the change in the fluorescence spectrum reflects both structural changes and the loss of the coenzyme (PLP) during unfolding. A clear difference in the emission spectra of the M* intermediates of the two proteins was observed. The fluorescence spectrum of the M* from P138A displayed a maximum at 337 nm, red-shifted by 5 nm as compared with the wild type enzyme (λmax at 342 nm). This change of the maximum wavelength is significant because no variation greater than ±0.5 nm was observed in several spectra recorded for each sample. On the contrary, in the native and in the unfolded states, the emission spectra of P138A and WT were nearly coincident. Gel filtration analysis of EcAspAT carried out at different GdmHCl concentrations (Fig. 2) showed that the elution volume of the enzyme increased to a broad maximum between 0.7 and 1.2 m GdmHCl and then gradually decreased at higher denaturant concentrations, according to previous reports (33Herold M. Kirshner K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,34Herold M. Leistler B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In all conditions, the protein eluted as a rather symmetric peak, consistent with homogeneous species. Moreover, no differences were detected in the elution volume of WT-M* and P138A-M* at 1.4m GdmHCl, indicating that no differences in the compactness of the intermediates could be inferred by these analyses. However, both M* forms showed an elution volume in between that of the native N2 and that expected for the folded monomer M, thus indicating that in these conditions the M* species are monomeric and have a compact structure, albeit not as structured as the folded monomeric protein. Therefore, all the experiments described below were carried out at equal or lower EcAspAT concentrations to ensure the mono"
