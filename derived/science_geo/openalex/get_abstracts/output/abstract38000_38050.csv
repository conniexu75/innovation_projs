https://openalex.org/W2008657400,"Segmentation genes control cell identities during early pattern formation in Drosophila. One of these genes, fushi tarazu (ftz), is now shown also to control cell fate during neurogenesis. Early in development, ftz is expressed in a striped pattern at the blastoderm stage. Later, it is transiently expressed in a specific subset of neuronal precursor cells, neurons (such as aCC, pCC, RP1, and RP2), and glia in the developing central nervous system (CNS). The function of ftz in the CNS was determined by creating ftz mutant embryos that express ftz in the blastoderm stripes but not in the CNS. In the absence of ftz CNS expression, some neurons appear normal (for example, the aCC, pCC, and RP1), whereas the RP2 neuron extends its growth cone along an abnormal pathway, mimicking its sibling (RP1), suggesting a transformation in neuronal identity."
https://openalex.org/W1531911812,"170-180-kDa membrane glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) associated with multidrug resistance is involved in drug transport mechanisms across the plasma membrane of resistant cells. From sequence analysis of cDNAs of the P-glycoprotein gene, it is postulated that the active drug-efflux pump function may be attributable to the protein. However, purification of the P-glycoprotein while preserving its enzymatic activity has not been reported. In this study, we have purified the P-glycoprotein from the human myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line resistant to adriamycin (K562/ADM) by means of one-step immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein. The procedure was simple and efficiently yielded an electrophoretically homogeneous P-glycoprotein sample. By solubilization with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, the purified P-glycoprotein was found to have ATPase activity. This ATP hydrolysis may be coupled with the active efflux of anticancer drugs across the plasma membrane of multidrug-resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1497498736,"Intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance is an important problem in cancer therapy. Multidrug resistance results from overexpression of the MDR 1 gene, which encodes a drug-efflux pump called P-glycoprotein. We have isolated a 1-kilobase genomic fragment containing the major transcription initiation sites for the human MDR 1 gene. Ribonuclease protection experiments using this fragment indicate that normal human adrenal, colon, and liver cells, the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and vinblastine-selected human KB multidrug-resistant cells initiate transcription of the MDR 1 gene at the same site within this fragment. The 0.43-kilobase region upstream from the major transcription initiation site linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene showed promoter activity in CV-1 monkey kidney cells and in human KB cells. The putative promoter region has a consensus CAAT box and two GC box-like sequences, but no TATA sequence. This identification and isolation of promoter sequences for the MDR 1 gene will permit studies on how expression of this gene is regulated in normal human tissues and cancers."

https://openalex.org/W1507509794,"The deletion of residues 239-272 from the hamster beta-adrenergic receptor resulted in a loss of the ability of the receptor, expressed in mouse L cells, to stimulate adenylate cyclase (Dixon, R. A. F., Sigal, I. S., Rands, E., Register, R. B., Candelore, M. R., Blake, A. D., and Strader, C. D. (1987) Nature 326, 73-77). This mutant receptor (D(239-272)beta AR) bound the agonist isoproterenol with a single class of binding sites, in contrast to the wild-type beta-adrenergic receptor, which exhibited two classes of agonist affinity sites. We now report that the affinity of D(239-272)beta AR for isoproterenol is relatively insensitive to detergent solubilization or to treatment with either GTP or NaF, indicating the absence of a receptor-Gs interaction. Whereas deletions within the region of amino acids 229-258 did not reduce the ability of the receptor to couple to Gs or to stimulate adenylate cyclase, the deletion of either of the regions 222-229 or 258-270 resulted in receptors which were unable to couple to Gs. The affinities of D(222-229)beta AR, D(239-272)beta AR, and D(258-270)beta AR toward isoproterenol were greater than that observed for the low affinity, uncoupled form of the wild-type receptor. These results suggest a role for the regions of the beta-adrenergic receptor encompassing amino acids 222-229 and 258-270, which are predicted to form amphiphilic helices, in the agonist-promoted activation of Gs."
https://openalex.org/W2063109997,"Immunocytochemical and electrophysiological evidence suggests that somatostatin may be a transmitter in the hippocampus. To characterize the ionic mechanisms underlying somatostatin effects, voltage-clamp and current-clamp studies on single CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal slice preparation were performed. Both somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 elicited a steady outward current and selectively augmented the noninactivating, voltage-dependent outward potassium current known as the M-current. Since the muscarinic cholinergic agonists carbachol and muscarine antagonized this current, these results suggest a reciprocal regulation of the M-current by somatostatin and acetylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1555092004,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase from bovine kidney was purified in one step by immunoprecipitation and immunoaffinity chromatography using an immobilized anti-H+ATPase monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody affinity matrix coprecipitated polypeptides with Mr of 70,000, a cluster at 56,000, 45,000, 42,000, 38,000, 33,000, 31,000, 15,000, 14,000, and 12,000 from solubilized bovine kidney microsomal membranes, a pattern that was unaffected by different detergent washing conditions. A nearly identical pattern of polypeptides was observed in H+ATPase partially purified by an entirely independent method. The immunoaffinity purified H+ATPase had reconstitutively active ATP-induced acidification and potential generation that was inhibited by N-ethylamaleimide. The purified enzyme had specific activities as high as 3.1 mumol/min/mg protein, dual pH optima at 6.5 and 7.2, and a Km for ATP of 150 microM. The substrate preference was ATP greater than ITP much greater than UTP greater than GTP greater than CTP. The affinity purified H+ATPase was stimulated by phosphatidyl glycerol greater than phosphatidyl inositol much greater than phosphatidyl choline greater than phosphatidyl serine. The immunoaffinity purified enzyme did not require monovalent anions or cations for activity, and the divalent cation preference for activity was Mn, Mg much greater than Ca greater than Co much greater than Sr, Ba. The enzyme was not inhibited by ouabain, azide, or vanadate, but had kappa 1/2 inhibitory concentrations of 22.2 microM for N-ethylmaleimide, 14.9 microM for NBD-Cl, 4.9 microM for N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 13.8 microM for 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, and 315 microM for Zn, values close to those for inhibition of proton transport in the native vesicles. The affinity purified kidney enzyme has similarities to but also significant differences in structural and enzymatic properties from those reported for other vacuolar H+ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1557449322,"Doxorubicin (adriamycin) is a highly effective cancer chemotherapeutic drug but its clinical utility is limited by its cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicinol, the major metabolite of doxorubicin, is up to 10 times more potent than doxorubicin at inhibiting isometric contraction of the papillary muscle isolated from the right ventricle of rabbit heart. Doxorubicinol also increases resting tension of isolated cardiac muscle indicative of incomplete relaxation between contractions, a characteristic of doxorubicinol but not of doxorubicin. This study assesses the effect(s) of doxorubicinol on a variety of ion pumps which may explain, in part, the action of the metabolite in the intact muscle. We find the doxorubicinol is a potent inhibitor (IC50 less than 5 micrograms/ml) of calcium-stimulated ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum from canine heart and rabbit skeletal muscle. At comparable levels, doxorubicinol is also a potent inhibitor of (Na + K)-ATPase of cardiac sarcolemma and the Mg-dependent ATPase activity referable to the F0F1 proton pump of mitochondria. For each of these ion pumps, doxorubicinol is at least 80 times more potent an inhibitor than doxorubicin. Doxorubicinol, between 10 and 50 micrograms/ml, increases resting tension up to 4-fold in isolated papillary muscles cyclically contracting at 30 times/min. Resting stress is relatively insensitive to doxorubicin. Thus, doxorubicinol is a potent inhibitor of several key cationic pumps that directly or indirectly regulate cell calcium and inhibits relaxation in the isolated fiber preparation. These observations add a new dimension to understanding the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin."

https://openalex.org/W2063396753,"Rat PC12 cells expressing elevated levels of transfected human Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) gene were generated. These transformants (designated PC12-hSOD) closely resembled the parental cells in their morphology, growth rate, and response to nerve growth factor, but showed impaired neurotransmitter uptake. The lesion was localized to the chromaffin granule transport mechanism. We found that the pH gradient (delta pH) across the membrane, which is the main driving force for amine transport, was diminished in PC12-hSOD granules. These results show that elevation of CuZnSOD activity interferes with the transport of biogenic amines into chromaffin granules. Since neurotransmitter uptake plays an important role in many processes of the central nervous system, CuZnSOD gene-dosage may contribute to the neurobiological abnormalities of Down's syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2026632681,"In a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates, long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission contributes to the storage of memory lasting one or more days. However, it has not been demonstrated directly whether this increase in synaptic transmission is caused by an enhancement of transmitter release or an increase in the sensitivity of the postsynaptic receptors. These possibilities can be distinguished by a quantal analysis in which the size of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential released spontaneously from the presynaptic terminal is used as a reference. By means of microcultures, in which single sensory and motor neurons of Aplysia were plated together, miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials attributable to the spontaneous release of single transmitter quanta from individual presynaptic neurons were recorded and used to analyze long-term facilitation induced by repeated applications of 5-hydroxytryptamine. The results indicate that the facilitation is caused by an increase in the number of transmitter quanta released by the presynaptic neuron."
https://openalex.org/W1486077694,"The neuropeptide somatostatin causes membrane hyperpolarization and reduces the intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) in GH pituitary cells. In this study, we have used the fluorescent dyes bisoxonol (bis,-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)-trimethineoxonol) and quin2 to elucidate the mechanisms by which these ionic effects are triggered. Addition of 100 nM somatostatin to GH4C1 cells caused a 3.4 mV hyperpolarization and a 26% decrease in [Ca2+]i within 30 s. These effects were not accompanied by changes in intracellular cAMP concentrations and occurred in cells containing either basal or maximally elevated cAMP levels. To determine which of the major permeant ions were involved in these actions of somatostatin, we examined its ability to elicit changes in the membrane potential and the [Ca2+]i when the transmembrane concentration gradients for Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, and K+ were individually altered. Substitution of impermeant organic ions for Na+ or Cl- did not block either the hyperpolarization or the decrease in [Ca2+]i induced by somatostatin. Decreasing extracellular Ca2+ from 1 mM to 250 nM abolished the reduction in [Ca2+]i but did not prevent the hyperpolarization response. These results show that hyperpolarization was not primarily due to changes in the conductances of Na+, Cl-, or Ca2+. Although the somatostatin-induced decrease in [Ca2+]i did require Ca2+ influx, it was independent of changes in Na+ or Cl- conductance. In contrast, elevating the extracellular [K+] from 4.6 to 50 mM completely blocked both the somatostatin-induced hyperpolarization and the reduction in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, hyperpolarization of the cells with gramicidin mimicked the effect of somatostatin to decrease the [Ca2+]i and prevented any additional effect by the hormone. These results indicate that somatostatin increases a K+ conductance, which hyperpolarizes GH4C1 cells, and thereby secondarily decreases Ca2+ influx. Since the somatostatin-induced decrease in [Ca2+]i is independent of changes in intracellular cAMP levels, it may be responsible for somatostatin inhibition of hormone secretion by its cAMP-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1978005749,"Cleavage of the peptide bonds of preprosomatostatin at basic residues near the carboxyl terminus yields somatostatin-14, somatostatin-28, and somatostatin-28 (1-12). However, little is known about the molecular forms derived from the amino terminal portion of the precursor, even though this part of the prohormone is highly conserved through evolution. By using an antibody against the amino terminus of prosomatostatin, a decapeptide with the structure Ala-Pro-Ser-Asp-Pro-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gln-Phe, corresponding to preprosomatostatin (25-34), was isolated from the endocrine portion of the rat stomach, the gastric antrum. The antral decapeptide may represent a bioactive product generated from prosomatostatin after a monobasic cleavage similar to that involved in the formation of somatostatin-28. In fact, a monobasic cleavage requires two basic residues and a domain containing nonpolar amino acids such as alanine or leucine, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1807722458,"The structural gene pma+1 for the H+-ATPase from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been isolated and sequenced. The intron-less gene encodes for a protein of Mr = 99,769 which is 75% homologous to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa. The S. pombe pma+1 gene complements not only S. pombe pma-1-1 but also S. cerevisiae pma-1-4 mutants selected for in vitro vanadate-resistant ATPase activity. The sequence of the S. pombe mutant pma-1-1 allele reveals that the glycine residue 268, which is perfectly conserved in the transduction domain of all animal and fungal transport ATPases sequenced so far, is modified into an aspartate residue by the mutation. Replacement of glycine 268 by aspartate has been monitored by the appearance of a new PvuI restriction site in the mutant DNA. Mitotic cosegregation has been observed between the PvuI site and vanadate-resistant ATPase activity in a growing population of S. pombe transformants."
https://openalex.org/W1575979011,"Receptor regulation of [Ca2+]i was monitored in individual BC3H-1 muscle cells with intracellularly trapped fura-2 using digital imaging analysis techniques. Activation of alpha 1-adrenergic or H1-histaminergic receptors resulted in multiple bursts, or oscillations, of elevated [Ca2+]i with an average interval frequency of approximately 1.8 min-1. The duration of oscillatory behavior was generally more prolonged in response to phenylephrine than in response to histamine. Additionally, a larger fraction of the cells responded with [Ca2+]i oscillations to phenylephrine (approximately 90%) than to histamine (approximately 60%), although the majority of cells produced oscillations in response to both agonists. In most cells, the receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations continued for several minutes in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, although the amplitude of the individual peaks gradually decreased. The activation of [Ca2+]i oscillations by H1-receptors was more dependent upon extracellular Ca2+ than those elicited by alpha 1-receptors, reflecting the greater dependency of the histaminergic response on Ca2+ influx. Readdition of Ca2+ to the incubation buffer resulted in the resumption of the [Ca2+]i oscillations. These results indicate that considerable cycling of Ca2+ between the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum must occur. Receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations were much more prevalent in subconfluent cells than in confluent cells, possibly due to increased coupling of the cells at higher densities. The cells were capable of responding independently of one another, since sister cells displayed unique temporal responses immediately following cell division. Thus, the linkage of receptor occupancy to [Ca2+]i elevation is a functionally unique property for each individual cell and can be influenced by epigenetic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1537924198,"The structure of a human serum amyloid A (SAA) genomic clone (SAAg9) has been analyzed and the nucleotide sequence of the coding regions is compared with that of the cDNA for apoSAA1. The leader and coding sequences of exons 2 and 3 are identical to SAA1. However, there are 10 nucleotide and 7 derived amino acid substitutions in exon 4. These changes are identical to the amino acid sequence of the amyloid protein associated with familial Mediterranean fever. In particular, the amino acid substitution (Thr to Phe) at residue 69 of SAA1 may have an important role in this type of hereditary amyloidosis. The genomic clone SAAg9 has been transfected into mouse L cells, and constitutive expression of human specific mRNA and protein were observed in stable transfected clones. The expression of both SAA mRNA and protein were increased by incubation of the transfected cells with purified human interleukin-1 (IL-1), both human and mouse recombinant IL-1, and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha. The induction of SAA is pretranslational and is likely to be mediated by protein factor(s) since incubation with cycloheximide diminished IL-1-dependent increase in SAA mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1546654565,"Abstract The rat transthyretin gene, 7.3 kilobase pairs (kb) long, with 14.5 kb of 5' flanking and 12.2 kb of 3' flanking region was cloned and characterized. The gene contained four exons. A TATA box sequence (5'-TATATAA-3') and a CAAT box sequence (5'-GTCAAT-3') were located 23 and 95 nucleotides upstream, respectively, from the major transcription start site. Nucleotides -51 to -189 were highly conserved (93% homology between rats and humans, 97% homology between rats and mice). Tandem repeats of sequences of 5'-AC-3' and 5'-ACACATGC-3' in the 5' flanking region, of 5'-GAAA-3' in the first intron, and of 5'-GT-3' in the third intron of the gene were observed. Using specific cDNA probes, tissue specificity and regulation of transthyretin mRNA biosynthesis during embryogenesis were analyzed. Transthyretin expression occurred first in the yolk sac, then decreased when expression increased in fetal liver. Presumptive choroid plexus cells in the inner lining of the neural tube expressed transthyretin early in gestation (11 days before birth) with a maximum immediately preceding the spurt of brain growth around birth. Partial hepatectomy of adult rats induced both an acute phase response and regenerative growth in liver. The decrease in transcription of the transthyretin gene in liver, which is characteristic for the acute phase response, was overridden by stimulation of gene expression after partial hepatectomy. This stimulation also affected transthyretin expression in choroid plexus."
https://openalex.org/W1557658741,"A lambda gt11 expression library constructed from human liver mRNA was screened with an antibody against human microsomal xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase. The clone pheh32 contains an insert of 1742 base pairs with an open reading frame coding for a protein of 455 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 52,956. The nucleotide sequence is 77% similar to the previously reported rat xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase cDNA sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human epoxide hydrolase is 80% similar to the previously reported rabbit and 84% similar to the deduced rat protein sequence. The NH2-terminal amino acids deduced from the human xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase cDNA are identical to the published 19 NH2-terminal amino acids of the purified human xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase protein. Northern blot analysis revealed a single mRNA band of 1.8 kilobases. Southern blot analysis indicated that there is only one gene copy/haploid genome. The human xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase gene was assigned to the long arm of human chromosome 1. Several restriction fragment length polymorphisms were observed with the human epoxide hydrolase cDNA. pheh32 was expressed as enzymatically active protein in cultured monkey kidney cells (COS-1)."
https://openalex.org/W149062220,"Previous studies have shown that the GDP-fucose:N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (alpha (1,3) fucosyltransferase (Fuc-T)) activities expressed by the Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants LEC11 (Fuc-TI) and LEC12 (Fuc-TII) are different enzymes and indicated that Fuc-TI might act on sialylated lactosamine sequences (Campbell, C., and Stanley, P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11208-11214). In this paper we show that CSLEX-1, a monoclonal antibody specific for NeuNac alpha (2,3)Gal beta (1,4)(Fuc alpha (1,3))GlcNAc beta 1 sequences, bound to LEC11 cells but not to LEC12 cells. Direct evidence that Fuc-TI could act on sialylated substrates was sought with a series of glycolipid acceptors. Optimal assay conditions in crude cell extracts were determined with nLc4, a glycolipid which accepted fucose with both Fuc-TI and Fuc-TII to generate the Lex antigenic determinant. The two enzymes differed in their detergent sensitivities, pH optima, Mn2+ requirements, and apparent Km values for nLc4. When sialylated glycolipids were examined as substrates, Fuc-TI added fucose to IV3NeuNAcnLc4 but not to IV6NeuNAcnLc4, whereas Fuc-TII was unable to utilize either glycolipid as a substrate. Further studies showed that Fuc-TI and Fuc-TII possess novel specificities for glycolipids containing two lactosamine sequences as potential fucose acceptors. Fuc-TI exhibited good activities with VI3NeuNAcnLc6 and VI6NeuNAcnLc6 whereas Fuc-TII had very low activity with both substrates. Glycosidase digestions of the labeled products showed that Fuc-TI added fucose primarily to the internal N-acetylglucosamine of both glycolipids. The same preference for the internal N-acetylglucosamine was shown by Fuc-TI when nLc6 was the acceptor. In contrast, Fuc-TII preferred to transfer fucose to the external acceptor site of nLc6, consistent with the low activities of Fuc-TII with sialylated nLc6 derivatives. Thus the two enzymes preferentially add fucose to different N-acetylglucosamines in the same substrate, nLc6. This indicates that the biosynthetic pathway for fucosylation of polylactosamine sequences in glycolipids and glycoproteins will vary depending upon the particular alpha (1,3)fucosyltransferase present."
https://openalex.org/W1531815379,"In the presence of ouabain, prostaglandin (PG) E2 stimulated a gradual secretion of catecholamines from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. PGE2 or ouabain alone evoked a marginal secretory response. The synergism of ouabain was also observed with muscarine. PGE2, like muscarine, induced a concentration-dependent formation of inositol phosphates: rapid rises in inositol trisphosphate and inositol bisphosphate followed by a slower accumulation of inositol monophosphate. This effect on phosphoinositide metabolism was accompanied by an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+. The potency of PGs (PGE2 greater than PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2) to stimulate catecholamine release was well correlated with that to affect phosphoinositide metabolism and that to increase the level of intracellular Ca2+. PGE2 did not stimulate cAMP generation significantly in bovine chromaffin cells. The effect of PGE2 on catecholamine release was mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and A23187, but not by the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP nor by forskolin. These results indicate that PGE2 may enhance catecholamine release from chromaffin cells by activating protein kinase C in concert with the increment of intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1626876687,"The function of structural domains of the beta-adrenergic receptor were probed by studying the ability of tryptic fragments of the receptor to catalyze the binding of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) to the GTP-binding regulatory protein, Gs. beta-Adrenergic receptor purified from turkey erythrocytes was treated with trypsin under nondenaturing conditions. Such treatment decreased beta-adrenergic ligand binding activity by only 15-25%. Active components of the limit digest were repurified by affinity chromatography on alprenolol-agarose and then reconstituted with purified Gs into unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. After reconstitution, the proteolyzed receptor was able to catalyze agonist-stimulated binding of GTP gamma S to Gs at a rate and extent equivalent to that of the nonproteolyzed receptor. The proteolyzed receptor was also partially activated upon reduction by dithiothreitol, as previously reported for the intact receptor (Pedersen, S.E., and Ross, E.M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14150-14157). The repurified, active tryptic digest contained two detectable peptides. One, of approximately 2 X 10(4) Da, contained either four or five of the amino-terminal membrane-spanning domains plus the intervening hydrophilic loops but not the amino-terminal extracellular, glycosylated peptide. The second, of 9,000-10,000 Da, was composed essentially of the two carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domains and the intervening extracellular, hydrophilic loop. These data indicate that most of the large intracellular hydrophilic loop and the hydrophilic, carboxyl-terminal region of the receptor are not necessary for the agonist-stimulated regulation of Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1594960037,"The GH4C1 pituitary cell line contains specific plasma membrane receptors for the inhibitory neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF). Unlike other peptides which bind to cell surface receptors on these cells, SRIF is not rapidly internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we examined the effects of chronic SRIF pretreatment on the subsequent ability of GH4C1 cells to bind and respond to this hormone. Treatment of cells with 100 nM SRIF increased [125I-Tyr1]SRIF binding to a maximum value of 220% of control after 20 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the number, but not the affinity, of the receptors was altered. The effect of SRIF was dose-dependent (ED50 = 2.3 +/- 0.4 nM), was not mimicked by an inactive analog, and was specific for the SRIF receptor. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with other agents, which mimic SRIF's action to decrease intracellular cAMP and free Ca2+ concentrations, did not mimic the SRIF-induced increase in receptor number. Thus, occupancy of the SRIF receptor was required for SRIF receptor up-regulation. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not prevent the SRIF-induced increase in receptors, consistent with an effect of SRIF to either reduce receptor degradation or cause slow redistribution of preexisting receptors to the plasma membrane. In contrast to the effects on receptor binding, pretreating cells with SRIF did not alter either basal cAMP levels or the potency of SRIF to inhibit cAMP accumulation (ED50 = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM). However, the maximum cAMP produced by stimulators of adenylyl cyclase was increased. The observation that chronic SRIF exposure did not cause homologous desensitization in GH4C1 cells and increased rather than decreased SRIF receptor number is consistent with the fact that this neuropeptide is not rapidly internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1498387589,"Effects of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine on insulin release, membrane potential, and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were investigated using pancreatic beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Addition of 2 microM clonidine promptly inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release, an effect accompanied by a lowering in both membrane potential and [Ca2+]i. Within minutes, the effect on Ca2+ was partly reversed, [Ca2+]i attaining a new level, although still significantly lower than in the absence of agonist. This late increase in [Ca2+]i was inhibited by 50 microM D-600, a blocker of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. The inhibitory effects of clonidine on membrane potential, [Ca2+]i, and insulin release were abolished by 5 microM of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. Depolarization with high K+ increased [Ca2+]i also in the presence of clonidine, conditions accompanied by only a minute release of insulin. Secretion was, however, partly restored by subsequent addition of 20 mM glucose. Addition of 5 mM Ca2+ transiently reversed the effects of clonidine on both membrane potential and [Ca2+]i. Although the clonidine-induced repolarization should be enough for closing the voltage-activated Ca2+ channels with a resulting decrease in [Ca2+]i, a direct interaction of the agonist with these channels cannot be excluded. The fact that it was possible to increase [Ca2+]i with only a minor effect on insulin release suggests that the inhibitory effect of clonidine not only is due to a reduction in [Ca2+]i, but also involves interference with some more distal step in the insulin secretory machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1501298175,"The neuropeptide somatostatin inhibits prolactin release from GH4C1 pituitary cells via two mechanisms, inhibition of stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and an undefined cAMP-independent process. Somatostatin also hyperpolarizes GH4C1 cells and reduces their intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a cAMP-independent manner. To determine whether these ionic changes were involved in the cAMP-independent mechanism by which somatostatin inhibited secretion, changes in cAMP levels were prevented from having any biological consequences by performing experiments in the presence of a maximal concentration of a cAMP analog. Under these conditions, inhibition of prolactin release by somatostatin required a transmembrane concentration gradient for K+ but not one for either Na+ or Cl-. However, elimination of the outward K+ gradient did not prevent somatostatin inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated hormone release. Therefore, somatostatin's cAMP-mediated mechanism does not require a K+ gradient, whereas its cAMP-independent inhibition of secretion appears to result from a change in K+ conductance. Consistent with this conclusion, membrane hyperpolarization with gramicidin (1 microgram/ml) mimicked somatostatin inhibition of prolactin release. In addition, the K+ channel blocker tetrabutylammonium prevented the effects of somatostatin on the membrane potential, the [Ca2+]i and hormone secretion. Nonetheless, a K+ gradient was not sufficient for somatostatin action. Even in the presence of a normal K+ gradient, somatostatin was only able to inhibit prolactin release when the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was at least twice the [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (10 microM), which prevents the action of somatostatin to reduce the [Ca2+]i, specifically blocked inhibition of prolactin release via somatostatin's cAMP-independent mechanisms. Therefore, a decrease in Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels produces both the fall in [Ca2+]i and inhibition of hormone secretion in response to somatostatin."

The coding region was assigned to the thioesterase I domain by identification of sequences coding for characterized peptide fragments, amino-terminal analysis of the isolated thioesterase I domain and the presence of the serine esterase active-site sequence motif. The thioesterase I domain is 306 amino acids long with a calculated molecular mass of 33,476 daltons; its DNA is flanked at the 5'-end by a region coding for the acyl carrier protein domain and at the 3'-end by a 1,537-base pairs-long noncoding sequence with a poly(A) tail. The thioesterase I domain exhibits a low, albeit discernible, homology with the discrete medium-chain S-acyl fatty acid synthetase thioester hydrolases (thioesterase II) from rat mammary gland and duck uropygial gland, suggesting a distant but common evolutionary ancestry for these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1542347014,"Tissue and secreted forms of rat prosomatostatin and its cleavage products were characterized immunochemically using high performance liquid chromatography and sequence-specific radioimmunoassays directed against somatostatin-14 (S-14), S-28-(1-12), and S-28-(1-14). Acetic or hydrochloric acid extracts of hypothalamus, pancreas, stomach, and jejunum contained seven molecular forms of Mr = 10,400 (corresponding to prosomatostatin (pro-S], Mr = 6,800 (7-kDa peptide, consisting of an NH2-terminally truncated form of pro-S), Mr = 7,600 (8-kDa peptide, corresponding to pro-S-(1-76), i.e. pro-S minus the COOH-terminal -Arg-Lys-S-14), Mr = 5,600 (5-kDa peptide, corresponding to pro-S-(33-76)) and three peptides co-chromatographing with synthetic S-14, S-28, and S-28-(1-12). Acid/ethanol extracts of these tissues contained pro-S, 8-kDa peptide, S-28, S-14, and S-28-(1-12) forms, but not the 7- and 5-kDa species. Pepstatin inhibited 7- and 5-kDa peptide formation in acetic acid extracts of tissues. The secreted forms consisted of the same five forms present in acid/ethanol or acetic acid plus pepstatin tissue extracts. The 7- and 5-kDa peptides were not secreted and appeared to be derived artifactually, presumably through the action of renin- and cathepsin D-like acid proteases. Accurate quantitation of the 8-kDa peptide by acid/ethanol extraction revealed a variable tissue distribution. Since the presence of the 8-kDa form provides evidence for direct processing of pro-S----S-14 + 8-kDa peptide, the present data suggest that pro-S----S-14 conversion is important for S-14 synthesis in the hypothalamus and pancreas, tissues rich in the 8-kDa form, but not in the stomach and jejunal mucosa, which contain low concentrations of this peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1531181017,"Guanylate cyclase is dephosphorylated in response to the interaction of egg peptides with a spermatozoan surface receptor (Suzuki, N., Shimomura, H., Radany, E. W., Ramarao, C. S., Ward, G. E., Bentley, J. K., and Garbers, D. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14874-14879). Here, the phosphorylated form of guanylate cyclase was purified to apparent homogeneity from detergent-solubilized spermatozoan membranes by the use of GTP-agarose, DEAE-Sephacel, and concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. To prevent dephosphorylation of the enzyme during purification, glycerol (35%) was required in all buffers. Following purification, a single protein-staining band of Mr 160,000 was obtained on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The final specific activity of the purified enzyme was 83 mumol of cyclic GMP formed/min/mg of protein at 30 degrees C, an activity 5-fold higher than that observed with the purified, dephosphorylated form of guanylate cyclase. A preparation containing protein phosphatase from spermatozoa, or highly purified alkaline phosphatase (from Escherichia coli), catalyzed the dephosphorylation of the enzyme; this resulted in a subsequent decrease in guanylate cyclase activity and a shift in the Mr from 160,000 to 150,000. The phosphate content of the high Mr form of the enzyme was 14.6 mol/mol protein whereas the phosphate content of the low Mr form was 1.6 mol/mol protein. All phosphate was localized on serine residues. The Mr 160,000 form of guanylate cyclase demonstrated positive cooperative kinetics with respect to MnGTP while the Mr 150,000 form displayed linear, Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. The phosphorylation state of the membrane form of guanylate cyclase, therefore, appears to dictate not only the absolute activity of the enzyme but also the degree of cooperative interaction between catalytic or GTP-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1504530468,"A 50-amino acid peptide predicted by chemical modification studies of F1 and by comparison with adenylate kinase to comprise part of an ATP-binding domain within the beta-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase has been synthesized and purified. In the numbering system used for bovine heart beta, the peptide consists of amino acid residues from aspartate 141 at the N-terminal end to threonine 190 at the carboxyl end. In Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, the peptide undergoes a dramatic reaction with ATP resulting in precipitate formation. Analysis of the precipitate shows it to contain both peptide and ATP. Similar to the ATPase activity of F1 and the binding of nucleotide to the enzyme, the capacity of ATP to induce precipitation of the peptide is decreased markedly by lowering pH. Interaction of the peptide with the fluorescent ATP analog, TNP-ATP (2'(3')-O-(2,4-6-trinitrophenyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate), can be demonstrated in solution at low concentrations. A 7-fold enhancement in fluorescence is observed when 2.5 microM TNP-ATP interacts with 2.5 microM peptide. Divalent cation is neither required for ATP-induced precipitation of the peptide nor for demonstrating interaction between TNP-ATP and peptide, just as Mg2+ is not required for nucleotide binding to F1. These results indicate that the beta-subunit peptide studied here comprises at least part of a nucleotide-binding domain within the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex."

The antibody, immobilized on beads, specifically immunoprecipitated both solubilized N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity and proton-transporting vesicles from renal microsomes; control experiments with an irrelevant monoclonal antibody showed no immunoprecipitated activity. By fluorescent immunocytochemistry, the antibody stained the membranes of intracellular vacuolar compartments in LLC-PK1 cells. Immunocytochemical staining showed that the monoclonal antibody colocalized partially with N-(3-[2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino)propyl)-N-(3-amino-propyl)methylamine, a probe for acidic compartments, with the endocytic markers dextran and transferrin, with the lysosomal probe alpha 2-macroglobulin, and with clathrin. The anti-vacuolar H+ATPase antibody showed no colocalization with staining for mitochondrial H+ATPase. The anti-vacuolar H+ATPase antibody should serve as a specific probe for examining the distribution and dynamics of the vacuolar proton pump in renal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W115121420,"An extracellular mucous glycoprotein has been isolated from the hard coral Acropora formosa. The glycoprotein contains sulfated oligosaccharide side chains attached through O-glycosidic linkages to serine and threonine, the principal amino acids (77%) in the polypeptide. The oligosaccharide side chains consist of D-arabinose, D-mannose, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with smaller amounts of D-galactose, L-fucose, and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, but no sialic or uronic acids. Alkaline borohydride reductive cleavage resulted in a mixture of oligosaccharide alditols. Six oligosaccharides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The structures of these oligosaccharides, which do not resemble those of any other glycoprotein so far examined, were determined by a combination of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of methylation products and NMR spectroscopy. All oligosaccharides contain a reducing terminal mannitol residue with N-acetylglucosamine linked to carbon 2, 4, or 6 of the mannitol. There is no evidence for linkage of N-acetylglucosamine to any other glycoses in the glycoprotein. Galactose was detected in two oligosaccharides linked to the 4-position of mannitol. Arabinose (Ara) was found in only one oligosaccharide. This was probably due to hydrolysis of the labile arabino-furanoside linkages. Evidence is presented which indicates the arabinose occurs primarily at the terminal position of oligosaccharide side chains. The structures of the oligosaccharides isolated from the glycoprotein were: (Formula: see text)."

Expression of liver arginase is developmentally and hormonally regulated in coordination with other urea cycle enzymes. The gene for the rat enzyme was cloned and the structure determined. This gene is 12 kilobases long and is split into eight exons. All of the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the GT/AG rule. The transcription initiation site was determined by nuclease S1 mapping and primer extension. A TATA box-like sequence and a CAAT box-like sequence are present 27 and 60 bases upstream from the cap site, respectively. Upstream and downstream from the cap site, there are several sets of direct repeats and inverted repeats and several sequences resembling the transcription factor Sp1 binding sites, the enhancer core sequences, the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive elements, and the putative elements for liver-specific expression of albumin genes. A 15-nucleotide sequence in the 5'-flanking region of the arginase gene is highly homologous with sequences in the 5'-flanking regions of the genes for rat ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) and for human argininosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.5), other two enzymes of the urea cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1607518825,"The inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) was used to probe the structure and function of the vacuolar H+-translocating ATPase from oat roots (Avena sativa var. Lang). The second-order rate constant for DCCD inhibition was inversely related to the concentration of membrane, indicating that DCCD reached the inhibitory site by concentrating in the hydrophobic environment. [14C]DCCD preferentially labeled a 16-kDa polypeptide of tonoplast vesicles, and the amount of [14C]DCCD bound to the 16-kDa peptide was directly proportional to inhibition of ATPase activity. A 16-kDa polypeptide had previously been shown to be part of the purified tonoplast ATPase. As predicted from the observed noncooperative inhibition, binding studies showed that 1 mol of DCCD was bound per mol of ATPase when the enzyme was completely inactivated. The DCCD-binding 16-kDa polypeptide was purified 12-fold by chloroform/methanol extraction. This protein was thus classified as a proteolipid, and its identity as part of the ATPase was confirmed by positive reaction with the antibody to the purified ATPase on immunoblots. From the purification studies, we estimated that the 16-kDa subunit was present in multiple (4-8) copies/holoenzyme. The purification of the proteolipid is a first step towards testing its proposed role in H+ translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1501869016,"Thy-1 glycoprotein is a member of a class of proteins which are anchored to the plasma membrane via a covalently bound glycophospholipid. The biosynthesis and anchoring of Thy-1 were investigated in a family of wild-type and mutant (complementation groups A, B, C, E, and F) T lymphomas. The mutants all synthesize Thy-1 but fail to express it on the cell surface. Analysis of the size of D-[2-3H]mannose-labeled dolichol-linked oligosaccharides showed that the class E mutant is the only cell line which does not synthesize dolichol-P-P-Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. Turnover and possible secretion of Thy-1 by mutant T lymphoma cells were documented in D-[2-3H]mannose pulse-chase experiments. The turnover of [3H]Thy-1 for all wild-type cells is considerably slower than for the mutant cells. Class B and E cells release appreciably more [3H]Thy-1 than wild-type cells. Additional experiments were performed to determine the electrophoretic mobility and hydrophobicity of cell-associated and released forms of Thy-1 labeled overnight with [3H]mannose. All wild-type and class A, C, E, and F mutant cells contain a major Triton X-114 binding species of cell-associated [3H]Thy-1. All extracellular [3H]Thy-1 was almost exclusively hydrophilic. The presence of two Thy-1 anchor components, ethanolamine and palmitate, was investigated. Biosynthetic labeling with [3H]palmitic acid showed that all of the wild-type cells but none of the mutants incorporated this anchor precursor into Thy-1. In [3H]ethanolamine-labeling experiments, incorporation was detected in the Thy-1 of all wild-type cells and in two mutants, S1A-b and T1M1-c. Based on the above studies, the phenotype of Thy-1 negative T lymphoma mutants can be re-evaluated. In classes A and F, dolichol-linked oligosaccharides appear normal and no anchor is detected. In class B, dolichol-linked oligosaccharides appear normal, a partial anchor may be present, and a substantial amount of Thy-1 is released. In class C, dolichol-linked oligosaccharides appear normal and a partial anchor may be present. In class E, truncated dolichol-linked oligosaccharides are formed, no anchor is detected, but a substantial amount of newly synthesized Thy-1 is released. These observations are discussed with reference to the possibility that the lesions which characterize the mutants pertain to the biosynthesis of the glycophospholipid moiety of Thy-1."
https://openalex.org/W1516929961,"Two clones containing inserts in pBR322 that together include the entire 1074-base open reading frame coding for the 358 amino acids of rat liver stearyl-CoA desaturase have been used to construct expression vectors for residues 3-358 and 27-358 fused to the first 6 residues of beta-galactosidase and several amino acids of the multiple cloning site of pUC8. Growth of transformed Escherichia coli under conditions for suppression of the lac promoter, followed by subsequent induction of these cultures results in the synthesis of higher levels of desaturase proteins than those found in induced rat liver. The proteins are almost completely associated with the membrane fraction of cell homogenates. Posttranslational iron insertion into the apoproteins, either in vitro with membrane preparations or by iron addition during induction, results in the formation of active holoenzyme which can be reconstituted with NADH cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5 to form an active stearyl-CoA desaturase system. The deletion of the first 26 amino-terminal amino acid residues does not affect either enzyme activity or membrane binding. Therefore, the unusual sequence of 11 residues containing 10 amino acids with hydroxyl groups plays no apparent significant role in either protein insertion into membranes or iron chelation. Since the protein product for residues 3-358 is processed even further to delete the initial 33 amino-terminal residues, the limiting polypeptide primary structure required for an active membrane-bound catalyst is even smaller than this initial deletion mutation indicates."
https://openalex.org/W1532126794,"The yeast HOM3 gene has been cloned molecularly by complementation of a HOM3 mutant. The gene is located about 8 kilobase pairs from HIS1 and is present as a single copy in the yeast genome. Mutations in HOM3 result in a requirement for threonine and methionine (or homoserine) for growth and a lack of detectable aspartokinase activity. The nucleotide sequence of HOM3 predicts an enzyme 414 amino acids long that shows homology to the three Escherichia coli aspartokinases, indicating that it is the structural gene for yeast aspartokinase. An approximately 1800-base pair mRNA is transcribed from the HOM3 gene, initiating at several start sites, 80 and 70 base pairs downstream, respectively, from two TATA boxes. Upstream of the TATA boxes is a single TGACTC sequence. This sequence has been shown to be essential for regulation of several genes that encode amino acid biosynthetic enzymes by the general control system. However, no increase in aspartokinase mRNA is observed under general control derepressing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1640558279,"Maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by F1-ATPase enzymes are known to involve strong positive catalytic site cooperativity. There are three potential catalytic nucleotide-binding sites on F1. Two important and unanswered questions are (i) whether all three potential catalytic sites must interact cooperatively to yield maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis and (ii) whether a cyclical three-site mechanism operates as suggested by several authors. We have studied these two questions here by measuring the ATPase activities of hybrid enzymes containing normal beta-, gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-subunits together with different combinations of mutant and normal alpha-subunits. The mutant alpha-subunits were derived from uncA401, uncA447, and uncA453 mutant E. coli F1-ATPase, in which positive cooperativity between catalytic sites is strongly attenuated by defined mis-sense mutations. Our data show that three normal catalytic sites are required to interact in order to achieve maximal ATPase rates and suggest that a cyclical mechanism does operate. Hybrid enzyme containing one-third mutant alpha-subunit and two-thirds normal alpha-subunits had substantial but submaximal activity, showing that cooperativity between three sites in a noncyclical fashion, or between pairs of sites, can achieve effective catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1500957832,"Subunit alpha (Mr 89,000) from vacuolar membrane H+-translocating adenosine triphosphatase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to bind 8-azido[alpha-32P]adenosine triphosphate. Labeling by this photosensitive ATP derivative was saturable with an apparent dissociation constant of 10(-6) to 10(-5) M and decreased in the presence of ATP and ADP. The enzyme was inactivated by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl), with about 1 microM causing half-maximal inactivation in the neutral pH range. This inactivation was prevented by the presence of ATP, ADP, or adenosyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). The original activity was restored by treating the inactivated enzyme with 2-mercaptoethanol. Kinetic and chemical studies of the inactivation showed that the activity was lost on chemical modification of a single tyrosine residue per molecule of the enzyme. When the enzyme was inactivated with [14C]NBD-Cl, subunit alpha was specifically labeled, and this labeling was completely prevented by the presence of ATP, GTP, ADP, or AMP-PNP. From these results, it was concluded that subunit alpha of yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase has a catalytic site that contains a single, essential tyrosine residue. The kinetics of single site hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]ATP (Grubmeyer, C., Cross, R. L., and Penefsky, H. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12092-12100) indicated the formation of an enzyme-ATP complex and subsequent hydrolysis of bound ATP to ADP and Pi at the NBD-Cl-sensitive catalytic site. NBD-Cl inactivated the single site hydrolysis and inhibited the formation of an enzyme-ATP complex. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not affect the single site hydrolysis, but inhibited the enzyme activity under steady-state conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2101514972,"Thylakoid membranes contain sequestered domains in which protons are held in a metastable state out of equilibrium with those in the inner (lumen) or the outer aqueous bulk phases unless the membranes are made leaky by, for instance, the addition of uncouplers. Previously, it has not been clear whether such sequestered domain protons are: 1) directly on a localized pathway into the CF0-CF1; 2) on an ultimately delocalized pathway comprising domains—-lumen—-CF0-CF1; or 3) perhaps not importantly involved in any way with proton gradient-linked ATP formation. Recent developments now permit a test of the above possibilities. The test for the possible mode of involvement of domain protons in energy coupling utilized single turnover flashes to energize electric field-driven ATP formation, as influenced by both the proton depletion level of the sequestered domains and whether the thylakoids were prepared in a way to show either a localized or delocalized proton gradient response in ATP formation (this response is reversibly controlled by incubation in low (localized coupling mode) or high KCl (delocalized mode) incubations (Beard, W. A., and Dilley, R. A. (1986) FEBS Lett. 201, 57-62; Chiang, G. and Dilley, R. A. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4911-1916). Using thylakoids showing delocalized coupling responses, there was no influence of the reversible depletion of the sequestered domain buffering pool on the delta psi-driven ATP formation onset lag. Lumenal protons rather than domain protons in that case appear to be the first to be driven through the CF0-CF1 complex by the delta psi field. However, using thylakoids prepared to be in the localized gradient coupling mode, protons in the domains, rather than those in the lumen, are the first to pass through the CF0-CF1 complex in the onset of energization. We conclude that the sequestered domain protons, in the latter case only, are obligatorily in the main proton diffusion pathway for energization of ATP formation and are the first protons (rather than lumen protons) driven through the CF1-CF0 complex by a delta psi field."
https://openalex.org/W1604012946,"The early effects (0-120 s) of the beta-adrenergic secretagogue isoproterenol (2.10(-5) M) and the muscarinic secretagogue carbamoylcholine (2.10(-6) M) on various parameters of lipid and phospholipid metabolism were studied in isolated guinea pig parotid acinar cells. Both agonists enhanced within 10-20 s the incorporation of radioactive palmitate into the diacylglycerol, the triglyceride, and the phosphatidylinositol fractions but significantly diminished radioactive palmitate recovered in the acyl-CoA fraction. Carbamoylcholine decreased and isoproterenol increased the recovery of radioactive palmitate in the free fatty acid fraction. All changes had returned almost to control levels after 120 s. In cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate, carbamoylcholine exerted similar effects, whereas isoproterenol was almost ineffective. Both agonists stimulated the incorporation of radioactive glycerol into diacylglycerols 2-3-fold, while only carbamoylcholine stimulated the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidate. Both agonists induced an increase in total diacylglycerols, carbamoylcholine being about twice as effective as isoproterenol. A lower concentration of carbamoylcholine (6.5.10(-7) M) had the same quantitative effect as 2.10(-5) M isoproterenol on the increase of total diacylglycerols. Even under these conditions carbamoylcholine, but not isoproterenol led to a significant translocation of protein kinase C from the soluble to the particulate fraction. Isoproterenol remained ineffective in this respect also when intracellular free calcium was increased with a calcium ionophore. This is explained by the finding that isoproterenol stimulates preferentially the formation of 2,3-sn-diacylglycerol, and carbamoylcholine preferentially stimulates the formation of 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol. The results indicate that in the guinea pig parotid acinar cell the two agonists do not only lead to activation of a triglyceride lipase (isoproterenol) or phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase(s) (carbamoylcholine), but also to a rapid change of flux through a number of other enzyme-catalyzed reactions involved in diacylglycerol turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1602309201,"These studies are the first to report egg peptide-mediated stimulation of protein phosphorylation in spermatozoa. Speract (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly) or resact (Cys-Val-Thr-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly-Cys-Val-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH2) stimulated the incorporation of 32P into various proteins of isolated spermatozoan membranes in the presence, but not absence, of GTP. The Mr of three of the phosphorylated proteins were 52,000, 75,000, and 100,000. GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate] but not GDP beta S (guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate] or GMP-PNP (guanylyl imidodiphosphate) also supported the peptide-mediated stimulation of protein phosphorylation. The peptides markedly stimulated guanylate cyclase activity, and GTP gamma S or GTP but not GMP-PNP served as effective substrates for the enzyme. The accumulation of cyclic AMP was not stimulated by the peptides. Subsequently, it was shown that added cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP increased 32P incorporation into the same membrane proteins as those observed in the presence of peptide and GTP. The amount of cyclic GMP (up to 3 microM) formed by membranes in the presence of peptide and 100 microM GTP equated with the amount of added cyclic GMP required to increase the 32P content of a Mr 75,000 protein selected for further study. 32P-Peptide maps of the Mr 75,000 protein indicated that the same domains were phosphorylated in response to cyclic nucleotides or to egg peptide and GTP. Intact cells were subsequently incubated with 32P to determine if the radiolabeled proteins observed in isolated membranes also would be obtained in intact cells. The 32P contents of proteins of Mr 52,000, 75,000, and 100,000 were significantly increased by the addition of resact. Peptide maps confirmed that the increased 32P incorporation obtained in a Mr 75,000 protein of isolated membranes occurred on the same protein domains as the 32P found on the Mr 75,000 protein of intact cells. These results suggest that a GTP or GTP gamma S requirement for peptide-mediated protein phosphorylation in spermatozoan membranes is mainly due to the enhanced formation of cyclic GMP, and it therefore is likely that peptide-induced elevations of cyclic nucleotide concentrations in spermatozoa are responsible for the specific increases in 32P associated with at least three sperm proteins, all apparently localized on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1978677216,"Abstract Integration of papillomavirus in the genome of the host cell has been found associated with malignant cases of cervical carcinoma. To determine what role viral integration plays as part of the pathogenic mechanism resulting in a cancer cell, the structure of integrated papillomavirus DNA (human papillomavirus DNA 18) segments and its cellular flanking sequences in HeLa cells as well as the corresponding normal human allele have been characterized. All integrated viral DNA segments have the same human DNA sequences in their 5' flank. The use of human sequence flanking the viral DNA as a probe detected the presence of four different forms of this human DNA region based on restriction fragment length polymorphism. Three of these forms can be linked to integrated viral DNA from human papillomavirus 18. The remaining form could not be linked to viral DNA and did not have a germline pattern in its 5'-end suggesting that it was also structurally altered. None of the forms of the human sequence present in HeLa cells has the complete structure of the germline normal allele characterized in DNA from placenta and human fibroblasts IMR-90. This observation suggests that HeLa cells carry a structural alteration in both alleles of the same locus, one of which was caused by integration of papillomavirus DNA. This locus is located on a chromosome fragile site. These rearrangements will result in a homozygous situation which is interpreted as affecting a recessive phenotype which might be involved in some aspect of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515966128,"Rat liver plasma membranes contain transglutaminase activity and a large molecular weight protein complex which serves as a substrate for this enzyme. When plasma membranes were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and disulfide-reducing agents the transglutaminase substrate was recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction. The insolubility of the complex suggested that it might be further studied by adsorbing membranes onto glass slides, then extracting with the detergent and reducing agent. After extraction, dark field light microscopy revealed numerous flattened sheets which varied in size from 4 to 12 micrometers. To confirm that these structures were the large molecular weight transglutaminase substrate, the plasma membranes were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol and sedimented through a sucrose gradient containing the agent. The large molecular weight substrate was the only material found at the 1.11/1.23 g/cm3 interface. Microscopic examination showed the same structures previously observed on the glass slides. We conclude that the large molecular weight transglutaminase substrate is a sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble, morphologically distinct, protein complex. Due to its considerable size, nondissociable nature, and association with the lateral membrane, the sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble transglutaminase substrate may serve as a type of skeleton or scaffolding for this plasma membrane domain."

The enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 135,000 and seems to be a tetramer of equivalent subunits of molecular weight 35,000. The enzyme shows strictly hyperbolic kinetics with both the substrates under a variety of conditions and is not inhibited by nucleotide phosphates. Km for carbamyl phosphate is 3.1 x 10(-4) M and for aspartate is 7.6 x 10(-3) M. Apparently, the enzyme has no regulatory role in pyrimidine biosynthesis. N-(Phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartic acid is a powerful competitive inhibitor (Ki = 5 x 10(-7) M) for this enzyme with carbamyl phosphate as substrate. This inhibitor completely inhibits the growth of the vector form of organism at 60 microM and significantly affects the growth of the pathogenic form in a macrophage assay system.

We investigated the possibility that S-sulfocysteine and S-sulfohomocysteine might act as analogs of gamma-glutamyl phosphate or of the associated putative tetrahedral intermediates. The D- and L-enantiomers of S-sulfocysteine and S-sulfohomocysteine were found to rapidly inactivate rat kidney gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase but to be reversible inhibitors of sheep brain glutamine synthetase. Inactivation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase does not require ATP and is associated with noncovalent binding of close to 1 mol of inactivator/mol of enzyme. The findings indicate that the S-sulfo amino acids are transition-state analogs, and that binding of S-sulfo amino acid to the enzyme induces formation of a very stable enzyme-inactivator complex. The data suggest that stabilization of the enzyme-inactivator complex results from interactions involving the sulfenyl sulfur atom of the S-sulfo amino acid and the active site thiol group of the enzyme."

The activation could not be reversed by dilution. On Sephadex G-200, the enzyme was found to consist of two major forms with molecular masses of 420 and 100 kDa. In contrast to the activation of liver phosphatases by freezing with beta-mercaptoethanol, activation by tetrahydrobiopterin was not associated with a shift in the molecular weight of the phosphatase to lower molecular weight forms. Other reduced pterins, including tetrahydroneopterin, 6-methyltetrahydropterin, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, also activated the enzyme, while oxidized pterins had no effect. GTP, the metabolic precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, was a potent inhibitor of the phosphatase reaction, inhibiting by 65% at a concentration of 1 microM. These findings suggest a close regulatory interrelationship between the tetrahydrobiopterin synthetic pathway and catecholamine biosynthesis."

The F1 was first labeled with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitro-[14C]benzene, subsequently reduced with sodium hydrosulfite, and finally cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Gel electrophoresis in the chemically modified protein in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol showed the existence of a 105-115-kilodalton molecular species in addition to the five monomeric subunits of F1. This cross-linked species could be alpha 2, alpha beta, or beta 2. Isolation of the cross-linked species and titration with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) showed the absence of sulfhydryl group. Therefore, the cross-linked species must be the dimer beta 2. After digestion of the purified beta 2 with pepsin, a single radioactive peptide was isolated. Determination of the amino acid sequence of this peptide and comparison of its radioactivity with the total radioactivity on beta-subunits show that it was formed exclusively by cross-linking Lys162 of one beta-subunit with Glu199 of another beta-subunit. The observation that two beta-subunits can be cross-linked by a rigid phenylenediamine bridge of 5.7- or 4.3-A length is difficult to reconcile with the widely assumed structure of F1 with the alpha- and beta-subunits occupying alternate corners of a planar hexagon, but is consistent with the structure in which a triangular set of three beta-subunits sits above a triangular set of three alpha-subunits in a staggered conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2013471311,"The traditional view that quantal release of neurotransmitter results from the fusion of transmitter-containing vesicles with the neuronal membrane has been recently challenged. Although various alternative mechanisms have been proposed, a common element among them is the release of cytoplasmic transmitter, which, in one view, could occur through large conductance channels on the presynaptic membrane. Six nerve-muscle cell pairs were examined with a whole-cell patch clamp for the presence of such channels that are associated with the production of miniature end-plate potentials. Examination of the neuronal membrane current during the occurrence of 822 miniature end-plate potentials produced no evidence of large channels. Thus it is unlikely that quantal release is mediated by such channels in the neuromuscular junction."
