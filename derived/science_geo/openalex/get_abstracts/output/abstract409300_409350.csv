https://openalex.org/W2072380646,"Meta-analyses including a limited number of patients and events are prone to yield overestimated intervention effect estimates. While many assume bias is the cause of overestimation, theoretical considerations suggest that random error may be an equal or more frequent cause. The independent impact of random error on meta-analyzed intervention effects has not previously been explored. It has been suggested that surpassing the optimal information size (i.e., the required meta-analysis sample size) provides sufficient protection against overestimation due to random error, but this claim has not yet been validated.We simulated a comprehensive array of meta-analysis scenarios where no intervention effect existed (i.e., relative risk reduction (RRR) = 0%) or where a small but possibly unimportant effect existed (RRR = 10%). We constructed different scenarios by varying the control group risk, the degree of heterogeneity, and the distribution of trial sample sizes. For each scenario, we calculated the probability of observing overestimates of RRR>20% and RRR>30% for each cumulative 500 patients and 50 events. We calculated the cumulative number of patients and events required to reduce the probability of overestimation of intervention effect to 10%, 5%, and 1%. We calculated the optimal information size for each of the simulated scenarios and explored whether meta-analyses that surpassed their optimal information size had sufficient protection against overestimation of intervention effects due to random error.The risk of overestimation of intervention effects was usually high when the number of patients and events was small and this risk decreased exponentially over time as the number of patients and events increased. The number of patients and events required to limit the risk of overestimation depended considerably on the underlying simulation settings. Surpassing the optimal information size generally provided sufficient protection against overestimation.Random errors are a frequent cause of overestimation of intervention effects in meta-analyses. Surpassing the optimal information size will provide sufficient protection against overestimation."
https://openalex.org/W1975312371,"Resting state networks (RSNs) have been studied extensively with functional MRI in humans in health and disease to reflect brain function in the un-stimulated state as well as reveal how the brain is altered with disease. Rodent models of disease have been used comprehensively to understand the biology of the disease as well as in the development of new therapies. RSN reported studies in rodents, however, are few, and most studies are performed with anesthetized rodents that might alter networks and differ from their non-anesthetized state. Acquiring RSN data in the awake rodent avoids the issues of anesthesia effects on brain function. Using high field fMRI we determined RSNs in awake rats using an independent component analysis (ICA) approach, however, ICA analysis can produce a large number of components, some with biological relevance (networks). We further have applied a novel method to determine networks that are robust and reproducible among all the components found with ICA. This analysis indicates that 7 networks are robust and reproducible in the rat and their putative role is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2072858355,"During repair of multiple chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs), matching the correct DSB ends is essential to limit rearrangements. To investigate the maintenance of correct end use, we examined repair of two tandem noncohesive DSBs generated by endonuclease I-SceI and the 3′ nonprocessive exonuclease Trex2, which can be expressed as an I-SceI-Trex2 fusion. We examined end joining (EJ) repair that maintains correct ends (proximal-EJ) versus using incorrect ends (distal-EJ), which provides a relative measure of incorrect end use (distal end use). Previous studies showed that ATM is important to limit distal end use. Here we show that DNA-PKcs kinase activity and RAD50 are also important to limit distal end use, but that H2AX is dispensable. In contrast, we find that ATM, DNA-PKcs, and RAD50 have distinct effects on repair events requiring end processing. Furthermore, we developed reporters to examine the effects of the transcription context on DSB repair, using an inducible promoter. We find that a DSB downstream from an active promoter shows a higher frequency of distal end use, and a greater reliance on ATM for limiting incorrect end use. Conversely, DSB transcription context does not affect end processing during EJ, the frequency of homology-directed repair, or the role of RAD50 and DNA-PKcs in limiting distal end use. We suggest that RAD50, DNA-PKcs kinase activity, and transcription context are each important to limit incorrect end use during EJ repair of multiple DSBs, but that these factors and conditions have distinct roles during repair events requiring end processing.

Recent sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed an abundance of chromosomal rearrangements in a variety of tumor types (1Stratton M.R. Science. 2011; 331: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Such rearrangements include abnormalities that could be observed cytogenetically, but notably the majority of intrachromosomal rearrangements involve breakpoints that are within 2 Mb (2Stephens P.J.

In addition, some cancer-associated chromosome rearrangements may involve DSB end processing to reveal short stretches of homology (microhomology) that are often observed at rearrangement junctions (2Stephens P.J.

Recent evidence indicates that DNA damage response factors are important for maintaining correct end use and regulating DSB end processing during EJ. For example, during programmed rearrangements in developing lymphocytes, the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM), and members of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, are important to limit aberrant rearrangements (coding-signal hybrid junctions) of certain V(D)J recombination substrates (4Bredemeyer A.L.

As well, during EJ repair of two tandem chromosomal DSBs, ATM and NBS1, are important to limit incorrect (distal) end use (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, ATM and NBS1 appear to show opposite effects on the degree of end processing during EJ (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M.

Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2866-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which raises the notion that maintenance of correct end use and regulation of DSB end processing may be distinct aspects of repair. In addition to ATM and NBS1, the DNA damage response factors RAD50 and DNA-PKcs are also important for chromosomal stability (9Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev.

RAD50 is part of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex that is recruited early to chromosomal DSBs (15Stracker T.H. Petrini J.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar); whereas DNA-PKcs is important for classical nonhomologous end joining (c-NHEJ) and V(D)J recombination (13Lieber M.R. Annu.

Both factors are important for radioresistance, and hence are being examined as potential targets for causing radiosensitization during cancer therapy (16Abuzeid W.M. Jiang X. Shi G. Wang H.

Furthermore, the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex promotes end resection, which is important for EJ events involving microhomology (alt-EJ), as well as homologous recombination (15Stracker T.H. Petrini J.H.

In contrast, DNA-PKcs is important to limit homologous recombination (24Neal J.A. Dang V. Douglas P. Wold M.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell.

Further characterizing the roles of DNA-PKcs and RAD50 during DSB repair will provide insight into the maintenance of genome stability and cellular radiation response. Apart from individual DNA damage response factors, the chromosomal context of DNA damage may also influence genome stability. Namely, chromosomal regions with elevated levels of transcription have been shown to be prone to rearrangements (27Mathas S. Misteli T.

Tomlins S.A. Callahan K. Ghosh A. Nyati M.K. Varambally S. Palanisamy N. Chinnaiyan A.M. Science. 2009; 3261230Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In contrast, previous studies have shown that the chromosomal break transcription context does not obviously affect the frequency of homology-directed repair (HDR), or the degree of end processing during EJ (31Allen C. Miller C.A. Nickoloff J.A. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Gottipati P. Cassel T.N. Savolainen L. Helleday T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the role of individual DNA damage response factors and chromosomal break transcription context on the frequency of incorrect end use during EJ of two tandem DSBs, as well as the frequency of repair events requiring end processing. We present evidence that inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity, or depletion of RAD50, each cause an elevated frequency of incorrect (distal) end use during repair of tandem DSBs. In contrast, we find that these factors have opposing effects on a homologous repair event that involves extensive DSB end processing (single strand annealing, SSA), in that DNA-PKcs inhibits SSA, whereas RAD50 promotes this repair event. Furthermore, we find that the histone variant, H2AX, which is important for limiting end processing during EJ as well as SSA (33Xie A. Puget N. Shim I. Odate S. Jarzyna I. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W.

Cell. 2011; 42: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), is dispensable for maintenance of correct end use during EJ. Additionally, we find that EJ repair of a DSB downstream from an active promoter, compared with an uninduced promoter, shows a greater frequency of incorrect end use and a greater reliance on ATM to limit such EJ events. In contrast, DSB transcription context did not obviously affect the frequency of repair events requiring end processing. In summary, we suggest that the roles of factors or conditions in maintaining correct end use during EJ cannot be predicted by their influence on repair that requires DSB end processing, such that these may be distinct aspects of repair. The I-SceI-Trex2 fusion expression vectors (pCAGGS-I-SceI-Trex2 WT or H188A) were generated by mutating the stop codon of the I-SceI expression vector (pCBASce) into a BglII site (36Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and subsequently inserting an amplification product from pCAGGS-Trex2 (WT or H188A) (37Bennardo N. Gunn A. Cheng A. Hasty P. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) downstream into BglII/XhoI sites. In this plasmid, the last three codons of I-SceI (uppercase) and the first three codons of Trex2 (uppercase) are separated by a linker sequence (lowercase): 5′-TTCCTGAAAagatcttgttcctgtgagaacatcagcATGTCTCAG. The reporter g4DRGFP was generated by inserting an amplified SceGFP gene (38Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) downstream of the g4 promoter in the pNEBR-X1 plasmid (New England Biolabs). The iGFP gene (38Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) was inserted downstream, and the two GFP genes were separated by 1.4 kb using a fragment of mouse Rb locus genomic DNA (39Stark J.M. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also, the lox-HYG-lox expression cassette (39Stark J.M. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was inserted downstream of iGFP. The reporter g4EJ5GFP was generated by inserting a fragment of pim-EJ5GFP (EcoRI/NotI), containing the 5′ I-SceI site through the end of the GFP expression cassette, into pNEBR-X1. A number of reporters were integrated into U2OS cells to generate a series of cell lines: pimDRGFP linearized with XhoI, hprtSA-GFP linearized with KpnI/SacI, EJ2-GFPpuro linearized with HpaI, and pimEJ5-GFP linearized with XhoI (36Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression cassettes for the regulator proteins (Gal4-DBD-EcR and RxR-vp16) (40Palli S.R. Kapitskaya M.Z. Kumar M.B. Cress D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were integrated into U2OS cells using the pNEBR-R1 plasmid (New England Biolabs) linearized with ScaI, to generate the U2OS-R1 cell line. The g4DRGFP reporter linearized with NotI and the g4EJ5-GFP reporter linearized with NheI were each integrated into U2OS-R1 and HEK293-A7 cells (HEK293 cells with pNEBR-R1, New England Biolabs). Linearized plasmids were introduced into cells by electroporation (0.8 ml, 710–730 V, 10 microfarads), followed by the relevant drug selection to generate individual clones (600 μg/ml of G418, 100–200 μg/ml of hygromycin B, and 1–2 μg/ml of puromycin). Intact reporters were confirmed by Southern blotting using the iGFP fragment as a probe (36Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pimEJ5-GFP linearized with XhoI was introduced into WT (H2AXf/f) and H2AX−/− mouse ES cells (41Bassing C.H. Chua K.F. Sekiguchi J. Suh H. Whitlow S.R. Fleming J.C. Monroe B.C. Ciccone D.N. Yan C. Vlasakova K. Livingston D.M. Ferguson D.O. Scully R. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8173-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Drs. Frederick Alt and Maria Jasin) by electroporation as described above, followed by selection in 120–150 μg/ml of hygromycin B. Targeting of the reporter within individual clones to the pim1 locus was confirmed by PCR analysis, as described previously (36Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Transfection complexes were formed by mixing 3.6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 200 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) with 0.8 μg of expression vectors for I-SceI (pCBASce) or I-Sce-Trex2 (pCAGGS-I-SceI-Trex2). For co-expression of I-SceI and Trex2 as separate proteins, 0.4 μg of a Trex2 expression vector (pCAGGS-Trex2) was included. The day prior to transfection, 105 cells were plated onto one well of a 12-well dish, and 3 h prior to adding transfection complexes, cells were incubated in 1 ml of medium without antibiotics. Three hours after transfection complexes were added, the medium was removed and replaced with medium containing antibiotics. Except for the TxON/OFF conditions described below, samples were analyzed 3 days after transfection. The frequency of GFP+ cells was determined from a portion of the sample by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (CyAN ADP, Dako). For EJ5-GFP experiments, at the same time as the FACS analysis, a portion of the sample was used for genomic DNA purification and proximal-EJ analysis, as described previously (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the region flanking an I-SceI site was amplified, the product was purified (GFX column, GE), and then digested completely with I-SceI (New England Biolabs), prior to separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples from untransfected cells were analyzed in parallel to ensure complete digestion. Proximal-EJ analysis of EJ5-GFP used primers flanking the 3′ DSB: p1-EJ5PurF, 5′-agcggatcgaaattgatgat, p2-KNDRR, 5′-aagtcgtgctgcttcatgtg. For proximal-EJ analysis using g4EJGFP, the region flanking the 5′ DSB was amplified, because this DSB is adjacent to the g4 promoter: p4-KNDRF5xRE, 5′-gggccgtcagctactaccag, p5-EJ5PurR, 5′-cttttgaagcgtgcagaatg. Subsequently, distal end use was calculated for each sample by dividing the frequency of distal EJ (%GFP) by the frequency of proximal EJ (% I-SceI-resistant amplification product). These individual distal end use values were then normalized to the mean value for parallel control samples to provide a measure of relative distal end use for each experiment. The above amplification and digestion procedures were also used to examine the I-SceI site restoration from GFP+ sorted distal EJ products following I-SceI expression in cells with the g4EJ5GFP reporter, using primers p4-KNDRF5xRE and p2-KNDRR. To examine the repair junctions of proximal EJ products, I-SceI-resistant amplification products were purified (GFX column, GE Healthcare) and cloned into TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen). Individual clones were sequenced with the M13R primer. For the drug treatments, ATMi (KU55933, EMD Biosciences 118500) (42Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I.

For depletion of RAD50, 105 cells were plated onto wells containing 16 nm siRNA (siRAD50 genone smartpool or siCTRL, Thermo Scientific M-005232-01-0005 and D-001810-01-20, respectively) that had been incubated with 1.8 μl of RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for 25 min. Subsequently (48 h), cells were transfected with expression vectors for I-SceI or I-SceI-Trex2 as described above, but also including 8 nm of the relevant siRNA in the transfection complexes. For the reporters with the inducible g4 promoter, transcription was induced by treatment with 500 nm l-(N-(2-ethyl-3-methoxybenzolyl)-N′-3,5-dimethylbenzoyl-tert-butylhydrazine, a synthetic ecdysone receptor ligand, commercially known as RSL1 (New England Biolabs) or Genostat Ligand (Millipore) (40Palli S.R. Kapitskaya M.Z. Kumar M.B. Cress D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For the TxON condition, L was added to medium 3 h prior to addition of the transfection complexes, and also to the medium change 3 h after the transfection reagent was removed. In contrast, at these medium changes for the TxOFF condition, vehicle (DMSO) was added instead of L. Subsequently, 3 days after transfection, L was added to both TxON and TxOFF conditions for 3 days prior to analysis of EJ frequencies as described above. Accordingly, all analysis of Tx samples was performed 6 days after transfection. To examine RAD50, 48 h after siRNA transfections as described above cells were lysed with NETN (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL, 1 mm DTT, and Roche Protease Inhibitor Mixture) in eight freeze/thaw cycles. Immunoblots of protein extracts were probed with anti-RAD50 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-74460, 1:100) and developed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2005, 1:750), or probed with HRP-conjugated anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam ab9482, 1:1500). To examine H2AX, cells were lysed in NETN for two freeze/thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. Histones were extracted from the pellet using 0.2 n HCl for 40 min at 4 °C. Total histones on the immunoblot were visualized with Ponceau S (Sigma P7170) followed by probing with the anti-H2AX antibody (Millipore 07–627, 1:1000), which was developed with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2004). HRP signals were visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Relative RNA abundance was examined for HEK293-A7 g4DRGFP cells treated with +L for 3 h or left untreated, by isolating RNA (RNAeasy Plus, Qiagen) for reverse transcription using random primers and MMLV-RT (Promega), which was then amplified with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), each according to the manufacturer's protocols. Transcripts downstream of the g4 promoter were amplified with 5′-cgccactatgggatcaaga and 5′-gctgaacttgtggccgttta, and normalized to parallel amplification of actin transcripts with 5′-actgggacgacatggagaag and 5′-aggaaggaaggctggaagag. Repair values reflect a minimum of three independent transfections. Error bars represent the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t test. Chromosomal rearrangements can arise when incorrect ends are matched during repair of multiple DSBs. To examine this key aspect of genome maintenance, we used the EJ5-GFP reporter that contains two tandem I-SceI sites (Fig. 1A) (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Bennardo N. Gunn A. Cheng A. Hasty P. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following I-SceI expression, distal EJ places a promoter adjacent to the rest of the GFP cassette, such that the distal EJ can be quantified as the percentage of GFP+ cells. Proximal EJ is difficult to measure with I-SceI expression alone, because proximal EJ that restores the I-SceI site cannot be differentiated from the uncut reporter. For this, we used co-expression of I-SceI with the 3′-exonuclease Trex2, which has been shown to cause a high level of I-SceI-resistant proximal EJ products, as quantified by PCR amplification across the 3′ I-SceI site, and subsequent I-SceI digestion analysis (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Bennardo N. Gunn A. Cheng A. Hasty P. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Notably, co-expression of I-SceI and Trex2 leads to distal EJ products that are completely I-SceI resistant (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Bennardo N. Gunn A. Cheng A. Hasty P. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The repair junctions following I-SceI/Trex2 co-expression mostly show very short deletions of the I-SceI 3′ overhang region, which is consistent with the low processivity of Trex2 (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Bennardo N. Gunn A. Cheng A. Hasty P. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also observed a minor class of larger deletions, but importantly none of these deletions disrupt GFP expression (7Bennardo N. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6e1001194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Bennardo N. Gunn A. Cheng A. Hasty P. Stark J.M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000683Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, using this reporter system, we can quantify two I-SceI-resistant EJ products from the same sample: proximal EJ by PCR amplification and I-SceI digestion analysis, and distal EJ by FACS analysis of the percentage of GFP+ cells. Accordingly, the ratio of distal EJ and proximal EJ can provide a relative measure of incorrect end use (distal end use). In considering the interpretation of these experiments, it is important to note that distal end use could arise via at least two mechanisms. For one, delayed repair could cause persistent DSBs, which would increase the probability of simultaneous tandem DSBs, which could cause an increase in distal end use. Alternatively, defects in end tethering across each DSB could lead to loss of the intervening segment, and hence distal end use. Accordingly, this reporter system does not enable a distinction between these mechanisms, which furthermore, may be interrelated. Rather, these experiments provide the relative frequency of distal end use, which can be used to define the factors and pathways important to limit incorrect end use during EJ. To simplify this experimental approach for our current study, we developed an expression vector for a fusion protein between I-SceI and Trex2 (I-SceI-Trex2), which we then evaluated using the EJ5-GFP reporter integrated into a human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS). We found that transfection of the I-SceI-Trex2 expression vector caused a significant increase in I-SceI-resistant proximal EJ products (Fig. 1B). In contrast, we found that transfecting an expression vector for a fusion between I-SceI and an exonuclease-deficient mutant of Trex2 (H188A) (43Chen M.J. Ma S.M. Dumitrache L.C. Hasty P.

https://openalex.org/W2009854430,"Background Mutations of the NR5A1 gene encoding steroidogenic factor-1 have been reported in association with a wide spectrum of 46,XY DSD (Disorder of Sex Development) phenotypes including severe forms of hypospadias. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the frequency of NR5A1 gene mutations in a large series of patients presenting with 46,XY DSD and hypospadias. Based on their clinical presentation 77 patients were classified either as complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis (uterus seen at genitography and/or surgery, n = 11), ambiguous external genitalia without uterus (n = 33) or hypospadias (n = 33). We identified heterozygous NR5A1 mutations in 4 cases of ambiguous external genitalia without uterus (12.1%; p.Trp279Arg, pArg39Pro, c.390delG, c140_141insCACG) and a de novo missense mutation in one case with distal hypospadias (3%; p.Arg313Cys). Mutant proteins showed reduced transactivation activity and mutants p.Arg39Pro and p.Arg313Cys did not synergize with the GATA4 cofactor to stimulate reporter gene activity, although they retained their ability to physically interact with the GATA4 protein. Conclusions/Significance Mutations in NR5A1 were observed in 5/77 (6.5%) cases of 46,XY DSD including hypospadias. Excluding the cases of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis the incidence of NR5A1 mutations was 5/66 (7.6%). An individual with isolated distal hypopadias carried a de novo heterozygous missense mutation, thus extending the range of phenotypes associated with NR5A1 mutations and suggesting that this group of patients should be screened for NR5A1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1980151620,"Background Much research has been devoted to the development of new breast cancer diagnostic measures, including those involving high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic techniques. Previous HR-MAS MR results have been obtained from post-surgery samples, which limits their direct clinical applicability. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we performed HR-MAS MR spectroscopic studies on 31 breast tissue samples (13 cancer and 18 non-cancer) obtained by percutaneous core needle biopsy. We showed that cancer and non-cancer samples can be discriminated very well with Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structure-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) multivariate model on the MR spectra. A subsequent blind test showed 69% sensitivity and 94% specificity in the prediction of the cancer status. A spectral analysis showed that in cancer cells, taurine- and choline-containing compounds are elevated. Our approach, additionally, could predict the progesterone receptor statuses of the cancer patients. Conclusions/Significance HR-MAS MR metabolomics on intact breast tissues obtained by core needle biopsy may have a potential to be used as a complement to the current diagnostic and prognostic measures for breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1965021089,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The three branches (ATF6, IRE1 and PERK) of the unfolded protein response (UPR) have different roles and are not necessarily activated simultaneously.Expression of UPR-related genes was investigated in colonic and ileal biopsies of 23 controls, 15 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 54 Crohn's disease (CD) patients. This expression was confirmed at protein level in colonic and ileal samples of five controls, UC and CD patients. HSPA5, PDIA4 and XBP1s were significantly increased in colonic IBD at mRNA and/or protein levels, indicating activation of the ATF6 and IRE1 branch. Colonic IBD was associated with increased phosphorylation of EIF2A suggesting the activation of the PERK branch, but subsequent induction of GADD34 was not observed. In ileal CD, no differential expression of the UPR-related genes was observed, but our data suggested a higher basal activation of the UPR in the ileal mucosa of controls. This was confirmed by the increased expression of 16 UPR-related genes as 12 of them were significantly more expressed in ileal controls compared to colonic controls. Tunicamycin stimulation of colonic and ileal samples of healthy individuals revealed that although the ileal mucosa is exhibiting this higher basal UPR activation, it is still responsive to ER stress, even more than colonic mucosa.Activation of the three UPR-related arms is seen in colonic IBD-associated inflammation. However, despite EIF2A activation, inflamed colonic tissue did not increase GADD34 expression, which is usually involved in re-establishment of ER homeostasis. This study also implies the presence of a constitutive UPR activation in healthy ileal mucosa, with no further activation during inflammation. Therefore, engagement of the UPR differs between colon and ileum and this could be a factor in the development of ileal or colonic disease."

T4P mediate multiple diverse functions, including adhesion, microcolony formation, twitching motility, and natural transformation. They are assembled from thousands of copies of the major pilin subunit, which exist as inner membrane-anchored proteins prior to pilus assembly (3Craig L. Pique M.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Rev.

Atomic resolution Type IV pilin structures have proved invaluable for understanding pilus functions, with full-length pilin structures providing key insights into pilus assembly and architecture. However, full-length pilin crystal structures are extremely challenging to obtain as they are both membrane proteins and fiber-forming proteins; hence, they are insoluble in aqueous solution, and their natural quaternary assemblies do not typically support ordered three-dimensional crystal growth. To date, only two full-length Type IV pilin structures have been solved: GC pilin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and PAK pilin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D.

Both pilins are ladle-shaped proteins with a curved, extended ∼53-residue N-terminal α-helix, α1, that is completely exposed for its first half but embedded in a C-terminal globular domain for its second half. The protruding and hydrophobic N-terminal half of α1, α1N, anchors the pilin in the inner membrane prior to pilus assembly and associates with other pilin subunits in the assembled filament.

T4P are flexible filaments, several μm in length but less than 100 Å wide, displayed on many Gram-negative bacterial surfaces as well some Gram-positive Clostridial species (9Ayers M. Howell P.L.

N. gonorrhoeae GC pili are perhaps the best characterized of the T4P in terms of their structure, mechanical properties, and biological functions. GC pili self-associate to hold bacteria in protective microcolonies at the infection site, and they adhere specifically to host receptors (11Källström H. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Jonsson A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). They are among a subclass of T4P that are retractile, a feature that facilitates their functions in twitching motility, natural transformation, and intimate adhesion, which precedes invasion of host cells (12Merz A.J.

In GC pili, the conserved N-terminal α-helices are arranged in a helical array in the core of the filament with the globular domains lining the pilus surface.

D. nodosus T4P are immunogenic and protective when injected into sheep in a purified form, but protection is serogroup-specific due to antigenic variability in the FimA pilin (24Claxton P.D. Ribeiro L.A. Egerton J.R. Aust. Vet. J. 1983; 60: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The FimA proteins from each serogroups are divided into two classes; the class I FimA pilins have a ∼40–45-amino acid segment between two atypical centrally located cysteines, whereas the class II FimAs have only a 9-residue segment as well as a C-terminal cysteine pair conserved in most Type IV pilins (25Mattick J.S. Anderson B.J. Cox P.T. Dalrymple B.P. Bills M.M. Hobbs M. Egerton J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Three hypervariable regions are distributed throughout the FimA sequence: two discrete segments between the central cysteine pair and one in the C-terminal segment, which includes the C-terminal cysteines of the class II FimA proteins. A detailed characterization of FimA pilin in the context of the pilus filament would provide insights into pilus functions in D. nodosus pathogenesis and facilitate design of effective and broadly neutralizing footrot vaccines. The identification of Type IV pilin genes in the deadly human pathogen F. tularensis (7Gil H. Benach J.L. Thanassi D.G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3042-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reinforces the importance and timeliness of characterizing pilin structures, which contribute to our understanding or their roles in virulence and potential as vaccines. F. tularensis causes the frequently fatal disease tularemia (26Sjöstedt A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1105: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This organism is widespread in wildlife, and transmission to humans occurs via small mammals, such as rabbits, and insect vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, and deer flies (27Ellis J. Oyston P.C.

F. tularensis is classified as a United States government Class A agent and a potential biological weapon because of its extreme infectivity, ease of dissemination via aerosols, and capacity to cause illness and death (26Sjöstedt A.

The mechanism by which F. tularensis colonizes multiple tissue types is enigmatic but may relate to its multiple pilin genes because other T4P act as cell-specific adhesins (3Craig L. Pique M.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). F. tularensis subspecies fall into two classes: the highly virulent Type A strains (subsp. tularensis) and the less virulent Type B strains (subsp. holarctica). An attenuated F. holarctica live vaccine strain and the mouse pathogen F. novidica are often used in laboratory studies. The highly virulent F. tularensis Schu S4 genome contains six open reading frames encoding PilA, PilE (PilE2), PilV (PilE3), PilE4, PilE5, and PilE6 (7Gil H. Benach J.L. Thanassi D.G. Infect.

Genes encoding putative pilus assembly proteins have also been identified in the F. tularensis genome. The genes for PilE, PilV, and PilE4 are disrupted in less virulent type B strains (32Forslund A.L. Kuoppa K. Svensson K. Salomonsson E. Johansson A. Byström M. Oyston P.C. Michell S.L. Titball R.W. Noppa L. Frithz-Lindsten E. Forsman M. Forsberg A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1818-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), implying that these pilins may contribute to the extreme virulence of Type A strains. Alterations in PilA, PilE5, and PilE6 attenuate infectivity for the Type B strains but have reduced impact on the highly virulent Schu S4 strain (32Forslund A.L. Kuoppa K. Svensson K. Salomonsson E. Johansson A. Byström M. Oyston P.C. Michell S.L. Titball R.W. Noppa L. Frithz-Lindsten E. Forsman M. Forsberg A. Mol.

This implies redundancy in the type A strains, with PilE and/or PilV compensating for loss of PilA. Although some putative F. tularensis pilins are associated with virulence, it is not clear whether they form T4P. T4P-like filaments were observed on the surfaces of Schu S4 and live vaccine strain, but disruption of only one of the putative pilin genes, pilE4, affected pilus expression (33Ark N.M. Mann B.J. Microb. Pathog. 2011; 51: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Zogaj X. Chakraborty S. Liu J. Thanassi D.G. Klose K.E. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2139-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, heterologous expression of PilA in an N. gonorrhoeae strain lacking its endogenous pilin gene restored pilus expression and DNA uptake, suggesting that PilA forms functional pili (37Salomonsson E. Forsberg A. Roos N. Holz C. Maier B. Koomey M. Winther-Larsen H.C. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2546-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In F. novicida, PilA is involved in secretion of the PepO protease, but this does not explain its role in the human F. tularensis pathogens, which do not produce PepO (36Zogaj X. Chakraborty S. Liu J. Thanassi D.G. Klose K.E. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2139-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Hager A.J. Bolton D.L. Pelletier M.R. Brittnacher M.J. Gallagher L.A. Kaul R.

Further characterization of these gene products is required to establish them as bona fide Type IV pilins and to help define their roles in F. tularensis pathogenesis. Here we present two new Type IV pilin crystal structures: the full-length FimA pilin from D. nodosus (DnFimA) and an ultrahigh resolution F. tularensis PilE (FtPilE) structure. Both pilins belong to the Type IVa pilin subclass, members of which are present on a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including N. gonorrhoeae and P. aeruginosa. Type IVa pilins differ from the Type IVb pilins, which are found almost exclusively on enteric pathogens, in their length and amino acid sequences as well as their protein fold (10Craig L. Li J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These structures provide important insights regarding T4P assembly and function, including the nature and role of the N-terminal segment in filament assembly, the distribution of hypervariable regions in DnFimA, and the authenticity of the F. tularensis Type IV pilins. Full-length DnFimA was isolated from P. aeruginosa strain PAK/2Pfs (39Bradley D.E. Virology. 1974; 58: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) carrying plasmid pJSM202, which expresses full-length DnFimA (a gift from John Mattick, University of Queensland) (40Mattick J.S. Bills M.M. Anderson B.J. Dalrymple B. Mott M.R. Egerton J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DnFimA was purified as described (4Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E. Adair B.D. Arvai A.S. Singh M. Lloyd S.J. Shin D.S. Getzoff E.D. Yeager M. Forest K.T. Tainer J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown overnight on tryptic soy broth plates, harvested by scraping, and resuspended in 150 mm CHES, pH 9.5. Pili were sheared from the cells by vortexing for three 1-min intervals. Cellular debris were removed from the pilus solution by centrifugation, and pili were precipitated by exhaustive dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The pili were dissociated into DnFimA subunits by extensive filtration using an Amicon stirred cell concentrator (Millipore) with a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (w/v). DnFimA was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and crystallized in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, 5% saturated NaCl (w/v), 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.6, and 50 mm NaPO4, pH 9.2. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction data were collected at SSRL beamline 11-1 and processed with HKL2000 (Table 1). The DnFimA structure was solved using molecular replacement with the program Phaser (41McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl.

The structure was refined using PHENIX (42Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R.

Open table in a new tab F. tularensis SCHU S4 genomic DNA was obtained from Jeannine Peterson at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The gene fragment encoding residues 28–148 of FtPilE (FTT0889c) was cloned into the pET-28b expression vector (Novagen), which encodes an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Cells with overexpressed FtPilE were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 500 mm NaCl and then lysed by sonication. FtPilE was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare). FtPilE was eluted in 50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole; dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol; and loaded on a size exclusion column. Fractions containing FtPilE were concentrated to 15 mg/ml. FtPilE was crystallized in 38% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 5% saturated LiSO4, 25 mm BIS-Tris propane, pH 7, 20 mm xylitol, and 10 mm DTT. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and a 1 Å resolution diffraction data set was collected at SSRL beamline 9-1 and processed with HKL2000 (Table 1). For phase determination, selenomethionine-substituted FtPilE (SeMet-PilE) was produced. SeMet-PilE crystallized in the same space group as FtPilE, and a 1.9 Å data set was collected (Table 1). We located six of the eight seleniums in the asymmetric unit using SOLVE (44Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which allowed initial phases to be determined. RESOLVE (45Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to build a model, which was used to solve the 1.0 Å structure by molecular replacement with AMoRe (46Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). After manual fitting with COOT (43Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and refinement with CNS (47Brunger A.T. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), ACORN was used to refine the phases with dynamic density modification (48Jia-xing Y. Woolfson M.M. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These phases were then used in ARP/wARP (with the 1.0 Å data), which automatically fit over 90% of the model, including side chains. Fitting was completed manually. Due to the ultrahigh resolution, hydrogen atoms and anisotropic B-factor parameters were included in the refinement. In addition, alternate conformations, which are visible for more than 25% of the protein, were included, and the occupancy was refined in PHENIX (42Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16817) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The DnFimA structure was superimposed onto a single GC pilin subunit, optimizing the fit between the N-terminal α-helices, using the model building program in COOT (43Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). DnFimA and GC pilin share 47% identity over the first 50 amino acids. The filament was generated by applying the symmetry operators for the GC pilus filament (PDB entry 2HIL): an axial rise per subunit of 10.5 Å and an azimuthal rotation of 100.8° using PDBSET in COOT. The F. tularensis pilus model was built using the same method; however, the x-ray coordinates for the N-terminal 27 residues were obtained from the GC pilin structure (PDB entry 2HI2). FtPilE and GC pilin share 67% sequence identity over the first 28 amino acids and 41% identity over the first 50. Figures were prepared using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC) and Chimera (49Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29004) Google Scholar). To examine the relationships between pilin structure and function for D. nodosus fimbriae, we sought to determine the crystal structure of full-length DnFimA. Pure protein was obtained by expressing DnFimA from D. nodosus VCS1001 (serogroup A, class I) heterologously in P. aeruginosa PAK/2Pfs (40Mattick J.S. Bills M.M. Anderson B.J. Dalrymple B. Mott M.R. Egerton J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pilin subunits were dissociated from sheared surface pili using high pH and n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside to solubilize the pilin subunits. Previous full-length pilin crystallizations required polyethylene glycol and organic alcohols that can potentially influence the structure of the N terminus (4Craig L. Taylor R.K. Pique M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2133849172,"Background The uptake and trans-placental trafficking of fatty acids from the maternal blood into the fetal circulation are essential for embryonic development, and involve several families of proteins. Fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) uniquely transport fatty acids into cells. We surmised that placental FATPs are germane for fetal growth, and are regulated during hypoxic stress, which is associated with reduced fat supply to the fetus. Methodology/Principal Findings Using cultured primary term human trophoblasts we found that FATP2, FATP4 and FATP6 were highly expressed in trophoblasts. Hypoxia enhanced the expression of trophoblastic FATP2 and reduced the expression of FATP4, with no change in FATP6. We also found that Fatp2 and Fatp4 are expressed in the mouse amnion and placenta, respectively. Mice deficient in Fatp2 or Fatp4 did not deviate from normal Mendelian distribution, with both embryos and placentas exhibiting normal weight and morphology, triglyceride content, and expression of genes related to fatty acid mobilization. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that even though hypoxia regulates the expression of FATP2 and FATP4 in human trophoblasts, mouse Fatp2 and Fatp4 are not essential for intrauterine fetal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2030944887,"The actions of cell adhesion molecules, in particular, cadherins during embryonic development and morphogenesis more generally, regulate many aspects of cellular interactions, regulation and signaling. Often, a gradient of cadherin expression levels drives collective and relative cell motions generating macroscopic cell sorting. Computer simulations of cell sorting have focused on the interactions of cells with only a few discrete adhesion levels between cells, ignoring biologically observed continuous variations in expression levels and possible nonlinearities in molecular binding. In this paper, we present three models relating the surface density of cadherins to the net intercellular adhesion and interfacial tension for both discrete and continuous levels of cadherin expression. We then use then the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg (GGH) model to investigate how variations in the distribution of the number of cadherins per cell and in the choice of binding model affect cell sorting. We find that an aggregate with a continuous variation in the level of a single type of cadherin molecule sorts more slowly than one with two levels. The rate of sorting increases strongly with the interfacial tension, which depends both on the maximum difference in number of cadherins per cell and on the binding model. Our approach helps connect signaling at the molecular level to tissue-level morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2025617630,"Objective To determine whether the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) sensors (PERK, ATF6 and IRE-1) can be targeted to promote death of Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells. Methods We have knocked-down separately each UPR stress sensor in human MM cell lines using RNA interference and followed MM cell death by monitoring the membrane, mitochondrial and nuclear alterations. Involvement of caspases in MM cell death consecutive to UPR sensor knock-down was analyzed by western blotting, measurement of their enzymatic activity using fluorigenic substrates and susceptibility to a pan-caspase inhibitor. Activation of the autophagic process was measured directly by detection of autophagosomes (electronic microscopy), monodansylcadaverine staining, production of the cleaved form of the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) and indirectly by analyzing the impact of pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy such as 3MA and bafilomycin A1. Results We show that extinction of a single UPR stress sensor (PERK) induces a non-apoptotic form of cell death in MM cells that requires autophagy for its execution. We also show that this cytotoxic autophagic process represses the apoptosis program by reducing the cytosolic release of the apoptogenic factors Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c. Interpretation Altogether our findings suggest that autophagy can contribute to execution of death in mammalian cells that are exposed to mild ER stress. They also suggest that the autophagic process can regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by inhibiting production of death effectors by the mitochondria, thus preventing formation of a functional apoptosome. Altogether these findings give credit to the idea that UPR sensors can be envisaged as therapeutic targets for the treatment of MM."
https://openalex.org/W2076492225,"We previously reported that Candida albicans cell surface protein Hyr1 encodes a phagocyte killing resistance factor and active vaccination with a recombinant N-terminus of Hyr1 protein (rHyr1p-N), significantly protects immunocompetent mice from disseminated candidiasis. Here we report the marked efficacy of rHyr1p-N vaccine on improving the survival and reducing the fungal burden of disseminated candidiasis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice using the FDA-approved adjuvant, alum. Importantly, we also show that pooled rabbit anti-Hyr1p polyclonal antibodies raised against 8 different peptide regions of rHyr1p-N protected mice in a hematogenously disseminated candidiasis model, raising the possibility of developing a successful passive immunotherapy strategy to treat this disease. Our data suggest that the rabbit anti-Hyr1p antibodies directly neutralized the Hyr1p virulence function, rather than enhanced opsonophagocytosis for subsequent killing by neutrophil in vitro. Finally, the rHyr1p-N vaccine was protective against non-albicans Candida spp. These preclinical data demonstrate that rHyr1p-N is likely to be a novel target for developing both active and passive immunization strategies against Candida infections."
https://openalex.org/W2087151519,"Several transmitter candidates including serotonin (5-HT), ATP, and norepinephrine (NE) have been identified in taste buds. Recently, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as well as the associated synthetic enzymes and receptors have also been identified in taste cells. GABA reduces taste-evoked ATP secretion from Receptor cells and is considered to be an inhibitory transmitter in taste buds. However, to date, the identity of GABAergic taste cells and the specific stimulus for GABA release are not well understood. In the present study, we used genetically-engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably co-expressing GABA(B) receptors and Gαqo5 proteins to measure GABA release from isolated taste buds. We recorded robust responses from GABA biosensors when they were positioned against taste buds isolated from mouse circumvallate papillae and the buds were depolarized with KCl or a stimulated with an acid (sour) taste. In contrast, a mixture of sweet and bitter taste stimuli did not trigger GABA release. KCl- or acid-evoked GABA secretion from taste buds was Ca(2+)-dependent; removing Ca(2+) from the bathing medium eliminated GABA secretion. Finally, we isolated individual taste cells to identify the origin of GABA secretion. GABA was released only from Presynaptic (Type III) cells and not from Receptor (Type II) cells. Previously, we reported that 5-HT released from Presynaptic cells inhibits taste-evoked ATP secretion. Combined with the recent findings that GABA depresses taste-evoked ATP secretion, the present results indicate that GABA and 5-HT are inhibitory transmitters in mouse taste buds and both likely play an important role in modulating taste responses."
https://openalex.org/W1997839536,"The majority of previous heroin cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies focused on local function impairments, such as inhibitory control, decision-making and stress regulation. Our previous studies have demonstrated that these brain circuits also presented dysfunctional connectivity during the resting state. Yet few studies considered the relevance of resting state dysfunctional connectivity to task-related neural activity in the same chronic heroin user (CHU).We employed the method of graph theory analysis, which detected the abnormality of brain regions and dysregulation of brain connections at rest between 16 male abstinent chronic heroin users (CHUs) and 16 non-drug users (NDUs). Using a cue-reactivity task, we assessed the relationship between drug-related cue-induced craving activity and the abnormal topological properties of the CHUs' resting networks. Comparing NDUs' brain activity to that of CHUs, the intensity of functional connectivity of the medial frontal gyrus (meFG) in patients' resting state networks was prominently greater and positively correlated with the same region's neural activity in the heroin-related task; decreased functional connectivity intensity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in CHUs at rest was associated with more drug-related cue-induced craving activities.These results may indicate that there exist two brain systems interacting simultaneously in the heroin-addicted brain with regards to a cue-reactivity task. The current study may shed further light on the neural architecture that supports craving responses in heroin dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2088877575,"The thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC, SLC12A3) mediates salt reabsorption in the distal nephron of the kidney and is the target of thiazide diuretics, which are commonly prescribed to treat hypertension. Mutations in NCC also give rise to Gitelman syndrome, a hereditary salt-wasting disorder thought in most cases to arise from impaired NCC biogenesis through enhanced endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Because the machinery that mediates NCC quality control is completely undefined, we employed yeast as a model heterologous expression system to identify factors involved in NCC degradation. We confirmed that NCC was a bona fide ERAD substrate in yeast, as the majority of NCC polypeptide was integrated into ER membranes, and its turnover rate was sensitive to proteasome inhibition. NCC degradation was primarily dependent on the ER membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. Whereas several ER luminal chaperones were dispensable for NCC ERAD, NCC ubiquitination and degradation required the activity of Ssa1, a cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperone. Compatible findings were observed when NCC was expressed in mammalian kidney cells, as the cotransporter was polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, and mammalian cytoplasmic Hsp70 (Hsp72) coexpression stimulated the degradation of newly synthesized NCC. Hsp70 also preferentially associated with the ER-localized NCC glycosylated species, indicating that cytoplasmic Hsp70 plays a critical role in selecting immature forms of NCC for ERAD. Together, these results provide the first survey of components involved in the ERAD of a mammalian SLC12 cation chloride cotransporter and provide a framework for future studies on NCC ER quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2120070648,"The α2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase plays a crucial role in Ca(2+) handling, muscle contraction, and inotropic effects of cardiac glycosides. Thus, structural, functional, and pharmacological comparisons of α1, α2, and α3 are of great interest. In Pichia pastoris membranes expressing human α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 isoforms, or using the purified isoform proteins, α2 is most easily inactivated by heating and detergent (α2 ≫ α3 > α1). We have examined an hypothesis that instability of α2 is caused by weak interactions with phosphatidylserine, which stabilizes the protein. Three residues, unique to α2, in trans-membrane segments M8 (Ala-920), M9 (Leu-955), and M10 (Val-981) were replaced by equivalent residues in α1, singly or together. Judged by the sensitivity of the purified proteins to heat, detergent, ""affinity"" for phosphatidylserine, and stabilization by FXYD1, the triple mutant (A920V/L955F/V981P, called α2VFP) has stability properties close to α1, although single mutants have only modest or insignificant effects. Functional differences between α1 and α2 are unaffected in α2VFP. A compound, 6-pentyl-2-pyrone, isolated from the marine fungus Trichoderma gamsii is a novel probe of specific phospholipid-protein interactions. 6-Pentyl-2-pyrone inactivates the isoforms in the order α2 ≫ α3 > α1, and α2VFP and FXYD1 protect the isoforms. In native rat heart sarcolemma membranes, which contain α1, α2, and α3 isoforms, a component attributable to α2 is the least stable. The data provide clear evidence for a specific phosphatidylserine binding pocket between M8, M9, and M10 and confirm that the instability of α2 is due to suboptimal interactions with phosphatidylserine. In physiological conditions, the instability of α2 may be important for its cellular regulatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W1967751161,"The P2Y12 receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of platelet activation by several agonists, which is irreversibly antagonized by the active metabolite of clopidogrel, a widely used anti-thrombotic drug. In this study, we investigated whether reduction of platelet reactivity leads to reduced inflammatory responses using a rat model of erosive arthritis. We evaluated the effect of clopidogrel on inflammation in Lewis rats in a peptidoglycan polysaccharide (PG-PS)-induced arthritis model with four groups of rats: 1) untreated, 2) clopidogrel-treated, 3) PG-PS-induced, and 4) PG-PS-induced and clopidogrel-treated. There were significant differences between the PG-PS+clopidogrel group when compared to the PG-PS group including: increased joint diameter and clinical manifestations of inflammation, elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, interferon (IFN) gamma, and IL-6), an elevated neutrophil blood count and an increased circulating platelet count. Plasma levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in the PG-PS+clopidogrel group compared to the PG-PS group. Plasma levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4) were elevated in both the PG-PS and the PG-PS+clopidogrel groups, however PF4 levels showed no difference upon clopidogrel treatment, suggesting that the pro- inflammatory effect of clopidogrel may be due to its action on cells other than platelets. Histology indicated an increase in leukocyte infiltration at the inflammatory area of the joint, increased pannus formation, blood vessel proliferation, subsynovial fibrosis and cartilage erosion upon treatment with clopidogrel in PG-PS-induced arthritis animals. In summary, animals treated with clopidogrel showed a pro-inflammatory effect in the PG-PS-induced arthritis animal model, which might not be mediated by platelets. Elucidation of the mechanism of clopidogrel-induced cell responses is important to understand the role of the P2Y12 receptor in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1982674195,"Many amateur athletes believe that using a professional athlete's equipment can improve their performance. Such equipment can be said to be affected with positive contagion, which refers to the belief of transference of beneficial properties between animate persons/objects to previously neutral objects. In this experiment, positive contagion was induced by telling participants in one group that a putter previously belonged to a professional golfer. The effect of positive contagion was examined for perception and performance in a golf putting task. Individuals who believed they were using the professional golfer's putter perceived the size of the golf hole to be larger than golfers without such a belief and also had better performance, sinking more putts. These results provide empirical support for anecdotes, which allege that using objects with positive contagion can improve performance, and further suggest perception can be modulated by positive contagion."
https://openalex.org/W1979628919,"Homologous recombination is a conserved molecular process that has primarily evolved for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and stalled replication forks. However, the recombination machinery in mitochondria is poorly understood. Here, we show that the yeast mitochondrial nucleoid protein, Mgm101, is related to the Rad52-type recombination proteins that are widespread in organisms from bacteriophage to humans. Mgm101 is required for repeat-mediated recombination and suppression of mtDNA fragmentation in vivo. It preferentially binds to single-stranded DNA and catalyzes the annealing of ssDNA precomplexed with the mitochondrial ssDNA-binding protein, Rim1. Transmission electron microscopy showed that Mgm101 forms large oligomeric rings of ∼14-fold symmetry and highly compressed helical filaments. Specific mutations affecting ring formation reduce protein stability in vitro. The data suggest that the ring structure may provide a scaffold for stabilization of Mgm101 by preventing the aggregation of the otherwise unstable monomeric conformation. Upon binding to ssDNA, Mgm101 is remobilized from the rings to form distinct nucleoprotein filaments. These studies reveal a recombination protein of likely bacteriophage origin in mitochondria and support the notion that recombination is indispensable for mtDNA integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2017338209,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through binding to TRAIL receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4), and DR5. TRAIL has potential therapeutic value against cancer because of its selective cytotoxic effects on several transformed cell types. Fucosylation of proteins and lipids on the cell surface is a very important posttranslational modification that is involved in many cellular events. Recently, we found that a deficiency in GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) rendered colon cancer cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, resulting in tumor development and metastasis by escape from tumor immune surveillance. GMDS is an indispensable regulator of cellular fucosylation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of TRAIL signaling by GMDS deficiency. DR4, but not DR5, was found to be fucosylated; however, GMDS deficiency inhibited both DR4- and DR5-mediated apoptosis despite the absence of fucosylation on DR5. In addition, GMDS deficiency also inhibited CD95-mediated apoptosis but not the intrinsic apoptosis pathway induced by anti-cancer drugs. Binding of TRAIL and CD95 ligand to their cognate receptors primarily leads to formation of a complex comprising the receptor, FADD, and caspase-8, referred to as the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). GMDS deficiency did not affect formation of the primary DISC or recruitment to and activation of caspase-8 on the DISC. However, formation of secondary FADD-dependent complex II, comprising caspase-8 and cFLIP, was significantly inhibited by GMDS deficiency. These results indicate that GMDS regulates the formation of secondary complex II from the primary DISC independent of direct fucosylation of death receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2093853721,"Magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) secrete oxytocin and vasopressin from axon terminals in the neurohypophysis, but they also release large amounts of peptide from their somata and dendrites, and this can be regulated both by activity-dependent Ca2+ influx and by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. This somato-dendritic release can also be primed by agents that mobilise intracellular Ca2+, meaning that the extent to which it is activity-dependent, is physiologically labile. We investigated the role of different Ca2+ channels in somato-dendritic release; blocking N-type channels reduced depolarisation-induced oxytocin release from SONs in vitro from adult and post-natal day 8 (PND-8) rats, blocking L-type only had effect in PND-8 rats, while blocking other channel types had no significant effect. When oxytocin release was primed by prior exposure to thapsigargin, both N- and L-type channel blockers reduced release, while P/Q and R-type blockers were ineffective. Using confocal microscopy, we found immunoreactivity for Cav1.2 and 1.3 channel subunits (which both form L-type channels), 2.1 (P/Q type), 2.2 (N-type) and 2.3 (R-type) in the somata and dendrites of both oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, and the intensity of the immunofluorescence signal for different subunits differed between PND-8, adult and lactating rats. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, the N-type Ca2+ current density increased after thapsigargin treatment, but did not alter the voltage sensitivity of the channel. These results suggest that the expression, location or availability of N-type Ca2+ channels is altered when required for high rates of somato-dendritic peptide release."
https://openalex.org/W2123920564,"Although, generally, the origin of sex-limited traits remains elusive, the sensory exploitation hypothesis provides an explanation for the evolution of male sexual signals. Anal fin egg-spots are such a male sexual signal and a key characteristic of the most species-rich group of cichlid fishes, the haplochromines. Males of about 1500 mouth-brooding species utilize these conspicuous egg-dummies during courtship – apparently to attract females and to maximize fertilization success. Here we test the hypothesis that the evolution of haplochromine egg-spots was triggered by a pre-existing bias for eggs or egg-like coloration. To this end, we performed mate-choice experiments in the basal haplochromine Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor, which manifests the plesiomorphic character-state of an egg-spot-less anal fin. Experiments using computer-animated photographs of males indeed revealed that females prefer images of males with virtual (‘in-silico’) egg-spots over images showing unaltered males. In addition, we tested for color preferences (outside a mating context) in a phylogenetically representative set of East African cichlids. We uncovered a strong preference for yellow, orange or reddish spots in all haplochromines tested and, importantly, also in most other species representing more basal lines. This pre-existing female sensory bias points towards high-quality (carotenoids-enriched) food suggesting that it is adaptive."
https://openalex.org/W1991227314,"Single amino acid substitutions in the globin chain are the most common forms of genetic variations that produce hemoglobinopathies--the most widespread inherited disorders worldwide. Several hemoglobinopathies result from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity to beta-globin (HBB) gene mutations, such as that producing sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS), HbC, HbD and HbE. Several of these mutations are deleterious and result in moderate to severe hemolytic anemia, with associated complications, requiring lifelong care and management. Even though many hemoglobinopathies result from single amino acid changes producing similar structural abnormalities, there are functional differences in the generated variants. Using in silico methods, we examined the genetic variations that can alter the expression and function of the HBB gene. Using a sequence homology-based Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) server we have searched for the SNPs, which showed that 200 (80%) non-synonymous polymorphism were found to be deleterious. The structure-based method via PolyPhen server indicated that 135 (40%) non-synonymous polymorphism may modify protein function and structure. The Pupa Suite software showed that the SNPs will have a phenotypic consequence on the structure and function of the altered protein. Structure analysis was performed on the key mutations that occur in the native protein coded by the HBB gene that causes hemoglobinopathies such as: HbC (E→K), HbD (E→Q), HbE (E→K) and HbS (E→V). Atomic Non-Local Environment Assessment (ANOLEA), Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application (YASARA), CHARMM-GUI webserver for macromolecular dynamics and mechanics, and Normal Mode Analysis, Deformation and Refinement (NOMAD-Ref) of Gromacs server were used to perform molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization calculations on β-Chain residue of the HBB gene before and after mutation. Furthermore, in the native and altered protein models, amino acid residues were determined and secondary structures were observed for solvent accessibility to confirm the protein stability. The functional study in this investigation may be a good model for additional future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2059985282,"The glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPr) has been implicated in high fat diet-induced obesity and is proposed as an anti-obesity target despite an uncertainty regarding the mechanism of action. To independently investigate the contribution of the insulinotropic effects and the direct effects on adipose tissue, we generated transgenic mice with targeted expression of the human GIPr to white adipose tissue or beta-cells, respectively. These mice were then cross-bred with the GIPr knock-out strain. The central findings of the study are that mice with GIPr expression targeted to adipose tissue have a similar high fat diet -induced body weight gain as control mice, significantly greater than the weight gain in mice with a general ablation of the receptor. Surprisingly, this difference was due to an increase in total lean body mass rather than a gain in total fat mass that was similar between the groups. In contrast, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-mediated insulin secretion does not seem to be important for regulation of body weight after high fat feeding. The study supports a role of the adipocyte GIPr in nutrient-dependent regulation of body weight and lean mass, but it does not support a direct and independent role for the adipocyte or beta-cell GIPr in promoting adipogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2024756682,"T4 DNA ligase catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation between juxtaposed 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini in duplex DNA in three steps: 1) enzyme-adenylylate formation by reaction with ATP; 2) adenylyl transfer to a 5'-phosphorylated polynucleotide to generate adenylylated DNA; and 3) phosphodiester bond formation with release of AMP. This investigation used synthetic, nicked DNA substrates possessing either a 5'-phosphate or a 5'-adenylyl phosphate. Steady state experiments with a nicked substrate containing juxtaposed dC and 5'-phosphorylated dT deoxynucleotides (substrate 1) yielded kcat and kcat/Km values of 0.4±0.1 s(-1) and 150±50 μm(-1) s(-1), respectively. Under identical reaction conditions, turnover of an adenylylated version of this substrate (substrate 1A) yielded kcat and kcat/Km values of 0.64±0.08 s(-1) and 240±40 μm(-1) s(-1). Single turnover experiments utilizing substrate 1 gave fits for the forward rates of Step 2 (k2) and Step 3 (k3) of 5.3 and 38 s(-1), respectively, with the slowest step ∼10-fold faster than the rate of turnover seen under steady state conditions. Single turnover experiments with substrate 1A produced a Step 3 forward rate constant of 4.3 s(-1), also faster than the turnover rate of 1A. Enzyme self-adenylylation was confirmed to also occur on a fast time scale (∼6 s(-1)), indicating that the rate-limiting step for T4 DNA ligase nick sealing is not a chemical step but rather is most likely product release. Pre-steady state reactions displayed a clear burst phase, consistent with this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2078095955,"The Arsenic (As) concentration in different tissues of maize was analyzed using a set of RIL populations derived from an elite hybrid, Nongda108. The results showed that the trend of As concentration in the four measured tissues was leaves>stems>bracts>kernels. Eleven QTLs for As concentration were detected in the four tissues. Three QTLs for As concentration in leaves were mapped on chromosomes 1, 5, and 8, respectively. For As concentration in the bracts, two QTLs were identified, with 9.61% and 10.03% phenotypic variance. For As concentration in the stems, three QTLs were detected with 8.24%, 14.86%, and 15.23% phenotypic variance. Three QTLs were identified for kernels on chromosomes 3, 5, and 7, respectively, with 10.73%, 8.52%, and 9.10% phenotypic variance. Only one common chromosomal region between SSR marker bnlg1811 and umc1243 was detected for QTLs qLAV1 and qSAC1. The results implied that the As accumulation in different tissues in maize was controlled by different molecular mechanism. The study demonstrated that maize could be a useful plant for phytoremediation of As-contaminated paddy soil, and the QTLs will be useful for selecting inbred lines and hybrids with low As concentration in their kernels."
https://openalex.org/W2133755633,"NRP-2 is a high-affinity kinase-deficient receptor for ligands belonging to the class 3 semaphorin and vascular endothelial growth factor families. NRP-2 has been detected on the surface of several types of human cancer cells, but its expression and function in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells remains to be determined. We sought to determine the function of NRP-2 in mediating downstream signals regulating the growth and survival of human gastrointestinal cancer cells. In human gastric cancer specimens, NRP-2 expression was detected in tumor tissues but not in adjacent normal mucosa. In CNDT 2.5 cells, shRNA mediated knockdown NRP-2 expression led to decreased migration and invasion in vitro (p<0.01). Focused gene-array analysis demonstrated that loss of NRP-2 reduced the expression of a critical metastasis mediator gene, S100A4. Steady-state levels and function of β-catenin, a known regulator of S100A4, were also decreased in the shNRP-2 clones. Furthermore, knockdown of NRP-2 sensitized CNDT 2.5 cells in vitro to 5FU toxicity. This effect was associated with activation of caspases 3 and 7, cleavage of PARP, and downregulation of Bcl-2. In vivo growth of CNDT 2.5 cells in the livers of nude mice was significantly decreased in the shNRP-2 group (p<0.05). Intraperitoneal administration of NRP-2 siRNA-DOPC decreased the tumor burden in mice (p = 0.01). Collectively, our results demonstrate that tumor cell-derived NRP-2 mediates critical survival signaling in gastrointestinal cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084770810,"In mammals, hair cells do not undergo spontaneous regeneration when they are damaged and result in permanent hearing loss. Previous studies in cultured Organ of Corti dissected from neonatal animals have shown that both DAPT (r-secretase inhibitor in the Notch signal pathway) treatment and Atoh1 overexpression can induce supernumerary hair cells. The effects of simultaneous DAPT treatment and Atoh1 over expression in the cells of cultured Organ of Corti from neonatal rats are still obscure.In this study, we set out to investigate the interaction of DAPT treatment and Atoh1 overexpression as well as culture time and the location of basilar fragment isolated form neonatal rat inner ear. Our results showed that DAPT treatment induced more hair cells in the apical turn, while Atoh1 overexpression induced more extra hair cells in the middle turn of the cultured Organ of Corti. When used together, their effects are additive but not synergistic. In addition, the induction of supernumerary hair cells by both DAPT and Atoh1 overexpression is dependent on the treatment time and the location of the cochlear tissue. Moreover, DAPT treatment causes dramatic changes in the orientation of the stereociliary bundles of hair cells, whereas Atoh1 overexpression didn't induce drastic change of the polarity of stereociliary bundles.Taken together, these results suggest that DAPT treatment are much more potent in inducing supernumerary hair cells than Atoh1 overexpression and that the new hair cells mainly come from the trans-differentiation of supporting cells around hair cells. The orientation change of stereociliary bundle of hair cells may be attributed to the insertion of the newly formed hair cells. The immature hair bundles on the newly formed hair cells may also contribute to the overall chaos of the stereociliary bundle of the sensory epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2104602213,"Reliable behavioural tests in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases allow us to study the natural history of disease and evaluate the efficacy of novel therapies. Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA (MPS IIIA or Sanfilippo A), is a severe, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the heparan sulphate catabolising enzyme, sulfamidase. Undegraded heparan sulphate accumulates, resulting in lysosomal enlargement and cellular dysfunction. Patients suffer a progressive loss of motor and cognitive function with severe behavioural manifestations and premature death. There is currently no treatment. A spontaneously occurring mouse model of the disease has been described, that has approximately 3% of normal enzyme activity levels. Behavioural phenotyping of the MPS IIIA mouse has been previously reported, but the results are conflicting and variable, even after full backcrossing to the C57BL/6 background. Therefore we have independently backcrossed the MPS IIIA model onto the C57BL/6J background and evaluated the behaviour of male and female MPS IIIA mice at 4, 6 and 8 months of age using the open field test, elevated plus maze, inverted screen and horizontal bar crossing at the same circadian time point. Using a 60 minute open field, we have demonstrated that female MPS IIIA mice are hyperactive, have a longer path length, display rapid exploratory behaviour and spend less time immobile than WT mice. Female MPS IIIA mice also display a reduced sense of danger and spend more time in the centre of the open field. There were no significant differences found between male WT and MPS IIIA mice and no differences in neuromuscular strength were seen with either sex. The altered natural history of behaviour that we observe in the MPS IIIA mouse will allow more accurate evaluation of novel therapeutics for MPS IIIA and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2043808306,"Human influenza A viruses undergo antigenic changes with gradual accumulation of amino acid substitutions on the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule. A strong antigenic mismatch between vaccine and epidemic strains often requires the replacement of influenza vaccines worldwide. To establish a practical model enabling us to predict the future direction of the influenza virus evolution, relative distances of amino acid sequences among past epidemic strains were analyzed by multidimensional scaling (MDS). We found that human influenza viruses have evolved along a gnarled evolutionary pathway with an approximately constant curvature in the MDS-constructed 3D space. The gnarled pathway indicated that evolution on the trunk favored multiple substitutions at the same amino acid positions on HA. The constant curvature was reasonably explained by assuming that the rate of amino acid substitutions varied from one position to another according to a gamma distribution. Furthermore, we utilized the estimated parameters of the gamma distribution to predict the amino acid substitutions on HA in subsequent years. Retrospective prediction tests for 12 years from 1997 to 2009 showed that 70% of actual amino acid substitutions were correctly predicted, and that 45% of predicted amino acid substitutions have been actually observed. Although it remains unsolved how to predict the exact timing of antigenic changes, the present results suggest that our model may have the potential to recognize emerging epidemic strains."

The function of certain RGS proteins is negatively regulated by 14-3-3 proteins, a family of highly conserved regulatory molecules expressed in all eukaryotes. In this study, we provide a structural mechanism for 14-3-3-dependent inhibition of RGS3-Gα interaction. We have used small angle x-ray scattering, hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics, and Förster resonance energy transfer measurements to determine the low-resolution solution structure of the 14-3-3ζ·RGS3 complex. The structure shows the RGS domain of RGS3 bound to the 14-3-3ζ dimer in an as-yet-unrecognized manner interacting with less conserved regions on the outer surface of the 14-3-3 dimer outside its central channel. Our results suggest that the 14-3-3 protein binding affects the structure of the Gα interaction portion of RGS3 as well as sterically blocks the interaction between the RGS domain and the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins."

Using Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) in combination with a custom DMH array containing 51,243 features covering more than 16,000 murine genes, we carried out a genome-wide screen for cell- and tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in in-vitro induced neural stem cells (NSCs) and 8 differentiated embryonic and adult tissues. Unsupervised clustering of the generated data showed distinct cell- and tissue-specific DNA methylation profiles, revealing 202 significant tDMRs (p<0.005) between ESCs and NSCs and a further 380 tDMRs (p<0.05) between NSCs/ESCs and embryonic brain tissue. We validated these tDMRs using direct bisulfite sequencing (DBS) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on chip (MeDIP-chip). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the genes associated with these tDMRs showed significant (absolute Z score>1.96) enrichment for genes involved in neural differentiation, including, for example, Jag1 and Tcf4.

T-DNA mutants in the poorly annotated Arabidopsis thaliana gene At1g08640 were identified as containing moderately high levels (50–100%) of 16∶1Δ7 and 18∶1Δ9 leaf fatty acids and subtle decreases (5–30%) of 16∶3 and 18∶3 (http://www.plastid.msu.edu/). TLC separation of fatty acids in the leaf polar lipids revealed that the chloroplastic galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) were the main lipid types affected by this mutation. Analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence of At1g08640 predicted the presence of a transit peptide, three transmembrane domains and an N-terminal J-like domain, and the gene was named CJD1 for Chloroplast J-like Domain 1. GFP reporter experiments and in vitro chloroplast import assays demonstrated CJD1 is a chloroplast membrane protein. Screening of an Arabidopsis cDNA library by yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) using the J-like domain of CJD1 as bait identified a plastidial inner envelope protein (Accumulation and Replication of Chloroplasts 6, ARC6) as the primary interacting partner in the Y2H assay. ARC6 plays a central role in chloroplast division and binds CJD1 via its own J-like domain along with an adjacent conserved region whose function is not fully known. These results provide a starting point for future investigations of how mutations in CJD1 affect lipid composition."

Variations in the lengths, sequences, and conformations of the many loops that cover the surface of the protein define the specificity of the interaction. Given the high variability of the loop regions, these proteins have a wide variety of targets and could in principle engage multiple binders at the same time (5Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J.

Papaya protease inhibitor (PPI) is a double-headed Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor isolated from the latex of Carica papaya. It has a high stability and is particularly resistant to proteolysis by proteases from different families (15Azarkan M. Dibiani R. Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Baeyens-Volant D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It likely serves as defense protein as it is induced by wounding and is inactive against endogenous proteases from C. papaya (15Azarkan M. Dibiani R. Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Baeyens-Volant D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of PPI in two crystal forms, together with the solution structure of its complexes with one and two trypsin units, as determined by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and perform a detailed kinetic study of the protease-inhibitor interaction probing the serine protease superfamily in a systematic manner. We also discuss how the potential of the β-trefoil fold to accept surface mutations influences protein evolution toward multiple function and multiple target recognition. PPI was purified from commercially available papaya latex, as a spray-dried powder, kindly provided by Enzymase International S.A. as described before (15Azarkan M. Dibiani R. Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Baeyens-Volant D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For details on the different proteases used in this work, see the supplemental material. For the preparation of the 1:1 (PPI:protease) complexes, equimolar amounts of PPI and the corresponding protease were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 20 mm Ca2+, pH 8.0, for trypsin or in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm Ca2+, pH 8.0, for α-chymotrypsin. The 1:2 (PPI:protease) complexes were prepared under the same experimental conditions as for the 1:1 complexes by mixing 2 moles of protease per mole of PPI. The four resulting complexes were concentrated on a 5000 molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin 15R concentrator (Sartorius) to a volume of 3 ml and loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column (40 × 2.6-cm inner diameter) pre-equilibrated with the same degassed buffer. Fractions of 4.2 ml were collected at a flow rate of 63 ml/h. The fractions corresponding to each complex were pooled, concentrated to a volume of 3 ml, and reloaded onto the same column under the same conditions. Finally, the fractions corresponding to the respective complexes were pooled and concentrated up to 30 mg/ml. Bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), hen egg white ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (31.0 kDa), and horse heart cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used as protein molecular mass standards. The crystallization of PPI in two crystal forms has been described before (15Azarkan M. Dibiani R. Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Baeyens-Volant D. Biochim. Biophys.

Crystals of form I were flash-cooled directly in the x-ray beam after soaking for ∼1 min in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 1.4 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m MES, 0.01 m CoCl2, pH 6.5, and 20% glycerol. Data for crystal form II were collected after the addition of a suitable cryoprotectant or mounted in glass capillaries for data collection at room temperature. X-ray data were collected at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) stations BW7A and X13 of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) using an MAR CCD detector and at station ID14-1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) synchrotron (Grenoble, France) using an Area Detector Systems Corp. Quantum Q4 CCD detector. All data were indexed and processed with the HKL2000 suite (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes using the CCP4 program TRUNCATE (30Collaborative Computational Project Number 4TRUNCATE. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, Warrington, UK1994Google Scholar). The structure of crystal form I was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of STI (Protein Data Bank (PDB) number 1avx:B) as a search model. The initial molecular replacement model resulting from PHASER was used as starting model in Arp/wArp, which was able to automatically build around 90% of the structure. The final model was obtained after alternating cycles of refinement with phenix.refine and manual build using Coot and has an Rfree of 19.7% and Rwork of 18.3% with excellent statistics (see Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCrystal form ICrystal form IIData collection DetectorMAR CCDMAR CCD BeamlineID14–1BW7A Data collection temperature (K)100100 Wavelength (̊)0.80730.9150 Unit cell parameters (̊)a = 44.26, b = 81.99, c = 140.89a = b = 74.70, c = 78.97 Space groupP212121P31 Resolution range (̊)20–1.7 (1.76–1.7)15.0–2.6 (2.69–2.6) No. of observed reflections318,867 (22,384)178,588 (20,260) No. of unique reflections51,816 (5596)15,065 (1809) Rmerge0.065 (0.165)0.110 (0.763) Completeness90.4 (82.2)100 (100) I/σ(I)17.3 (6.1)24.4 (2.3) Redundancy6.15 (4.00)11.88 (11.20)Refinement Resolution (̊)1.72.6 Rwork/Rfree18.3/19.717.3/22.8 Bond lengths (̊)0.0170.007 Bond angles (°)1.931.08 Ramachandran profile Core (%)97.494.1 Allowed regions (%)2.65.9 Outliers (%)0.00.0 Open table in a new tab The structure of crystal form II was determined by molecular replacement with PHASER. The coordinates from the refined form I were used as search model. These PPI crystals are typically merohedral twins. For structure determination and refinement, we selected the dataset with the lowest twining fraction (0.26). Accordingly, the structure was refined against the twined data as implemented in phenix.refine, using the twin operator h,-h-k,-l. The final model (Rwork = 17.7%, Rfree = 22.8%) was validated with MolProbity (18Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). The statistics of the refinement are shown in Table 1. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were carried out on a Biacore3000 system (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Tween 20 and with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. To qualitatively test the specificity of binding of PPI for proteases of different families, the inhibitor was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and different serine proteases were passed over the chip. In a second series of experiments, we used a sandwich arrangement to validate the presence of multiple binding sites in PPI. In our design, the protease was coupled to a CM5 chip, and then PPI was passed over. Taking advantage of the slow dissociation rate of PPI, we could probe other reaction sites by injecting a new protease. We selected bovine trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (the tight binders) for kinetic experiments. In every case, a short pulse of guanidinium hydrochloride (6 m) was used to regenerate the chip. All the binding data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation 4.1 software. (Please refer to the supplemental material for further details on the methods and data analysis.) SAXS data for characterizing the different PPI-trypsin complexes and examine their shapes and dimensions were collected at the synchrotron beamlines X33 (DESY Hamburg, Germany) and SWING (Soleil Paris, France). The radius of gyration (RG) of the different particles calculated from the Guinier analysis, together with other SAXS-derived parameters, are shown in the supplemental Table S2. For all samples, PPI, trypsin, PPI:trypsin, and trypsin:PPI:trypsin, Guinier plots of the data show a very good fit to linearity, indicating the absence of aggregation. The indirect Fourier transform package GNOM (19Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Volkovb V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 277-286Crossref Scopus (524) Google Scholar) was used to compute the distance distribution P(r) functions from the scattering curve and calculate the maximum dimension of the particles (Dmax). CRYSOL (20Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) was used to compare the experimental data with the scattering curve computed from all the different models derived from the crystal structures of PPI and trypsin. For rigid body modeling of the different PPI-trypsin complexes, we used SASREF (21Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1237-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) combined with distance restrains obtained from the docking experiments. The inhibitory potential of all PPI surface loops was tested by docking a PPI monomer into the trypsin active site, using the docking program HADDOCK 2.0. In each docking run, the active site of trypsin was targeted by defining residues 40, 171, 172, 175, 192, 204, and 206 as active residues and residues 42, 43, 140, 174, 194, and 196 as passive residues. Additionally, the surface loops 20–25, 40–45, 76–82, 124–132, and 190–198 were defined as fully flexible segments to enable the optimization of additional trypsin-PPI contacts in the wider region surrounding the active site. With this receptor definition, distinct docking runs were set up by defining different regions of the inhibitors STI and PPI as the interaction partners of the constant target region. In each run, surface loops surrounding the prospective binding loop were defined as flexible regions to optimize secondary interactions between the proteins. Solutions were scored based on the final energy of the docked complex, the total buried surface area in the complex, and the predicted interactions with the active site and specificity pocket of trypsin. A BLAST search shows that PPI is a member of the miraculin family of taste-modifying proteins, which are active against serine proteases. The structure of PPI was determined in two crystal forms at high resolution (Table 1). Both forms contain two monomers in their asymmetric unit. All four monomers have well defined electron density for residues 2–183 and show visible electron density for the GlcNAcβ[(1-4)GlcNAcβ(1-4)Manβ(1-3)Man]β(1-3)Fuc attached to Asn-84 and the first GlcNAc residue attached to Asn-90. The molecule is exceptionally rigid, with root mean square deviation values between the four independently determined molecules ranging between 0.20 and 0.45 Å for all Cα atoms and between 0.27 and 0.63 Å for all heavy (nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur) atoms (Fig. 1A). This structural rigidity is confirmed by the small angle x-ray scattering profile of PPI with a Kratky plot typical of a compact globular protein (supplemental Fig. S1) and likely reflects its resistance toward proteolysis and the harshness of its natural environment, the papaya latex (15Azarkan M. Dibiani R. Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Baeyens-Volant D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The overall structure consists of six two-stranded hairpins that adopt the β-trefoil fold typical of the Kunitz-STI family (13Song H.K. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Three of these hairpins form a barrel structure, and the other three are in a triangular array that caps the barrel and gives the molecule a pseudo-three-fold axis (Fig. 1, B and C). PPI and STI (the canonical representative of this family of protease inhibitors) share 26% sequence identity, and their structures superpose with an overall root mean square deviation of 1.45 Å for 144 common Cα atoms (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of PPI does not lead directly to insights into its mechanism of action. The canonical loop located between strands β4 and β5 (residues 64–71) contains a 2-amino acid insertion, which makes it very unlikely to fit into the active site of trypsin in the same manner as the corresponding loop in STI. Also, other loop conformations from related inhibitors such as BASI and API-1 (7Bao R. Zhou C.Z. Jiang C. Lin S.X. Chi C.W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26676-26684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Micheelsen P.O. Vévodová J. De Maria L. Ostergaard P.R. Friis E.P. Wilson K. Skjøt M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that have been observed to bind to the active site of trypsin are not observed in PPI, leaving its mode of inhibition unexplained. Previous measurements indicated that PPI inhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin (15Azarkan M. Dibiani R. Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Baeyens-Volant D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration experiments show that a single, monomeric PPI molecule is able to interact simultaneously with two trypsin molecules to form a hetero-trimeric complex. PPI elutes at an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa, in close agreement with its theoretical monomeric mass of 23,490 Da. Upon the addition of substoichiometric amounts of trypsin, a new species appears with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa suggestive of a hetero-dimeric PPI:trypsin complex. At a 1:1 ratio of PPI to trypsin, only this complex is observed, indicating a tight interaction between both proteins. Further addition of trypsin leads to the appearance of a novel, faster migrating species at the expense of the hetero-dimeric complex. This novel species has an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa and likely consists of one PPI sandwiched between two trypsin molecules (Fig. 2A). The total absence of the hetero-trimeric complex at a 1:1 ratio indicates that the two binding sites on PPI differ significantly in their affinities for trypsin. Indeed, if two sites of equal affinity would be present, at a 1:1 ratio, one would observe an equilibrium between free PPI, PPI:trypsin, and trypsin:PPI:trypsin in a 1:2:1 ratio. Similar observations were made for the interaction of PPI with chymotrypsin, where a hetero-dimeric and a hetero-trimeric species are also observed (data not shown). To further investigate the specificity and stoichiometry of the interaction between PPI and proteases, we used SPR to probe a set of 11 commercially available serine proteases, three cysteine proteases purified from papaya latex, and one commercially available metalloprotease (supplemental Table S1). Using PPI immobilized onto the flow cell surface, the binding constants and kinetics of association (kon) and dissociation (koff) were determined (Table 2). The typical tight-binding interaction described for other members of the Kunitz-STI family was detected only for members of the S1 family of serine proteases, especially for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (Fig. 2, B and C, supplemental Table S1). Additionally, PPI was also capable of binding to subtilisin and proteinase K, which are members of the S8B family. The rest of the proteases showed no appreciable binding to PPI.TABLE 2PPI/protease binding statisticsSpecieskon1koff1kon2koff2KD1KD2χ21/m1/s1/m1/snmnmPPI-trypsin5.9 1052.0 10−76.2 1055.1 10−20.0003482.21.9PPI-chymotrypsin2.6 1051.3 10−30.6 1054.3 10−25.0716.72.6PPI-elastase5.4 1034.4 10−482.70.9 Open table in a new tab The observed association rates (kon) showed that PPI responded slightly faster to trypsin than chymotrypsin (by a factor of ∼2 for site H and a factor of ∼10 for site L, Table 2), which suggests that indeed trypsin-like proteases are the preferred interaction partners of PPI. This is also in agreement with the measured koff values, which are significantly slower for trypsin, reflecting the fact that breaking specific short range interactions between the two proteins required for the dissociation is more difficult in the case of trypsin. Trypsin and chymotrypsin bind to PPI with a 2:1 stoichiometry in contrast to elastase or subtilisin. The dissociation constants from each binding site differ by several orders of magnitude. To relate the two binding sites for trypsin to those for chymotrypsin, we designed a sandwich-SPR experiment where we coupled the protease to a CM5 chip via amine coupling, and then a saturating amount of PPI was injected. Given the strength of the interaction between PPI and the trypsin/chymotrypsin, the off-rate of this complex is sufficiently slow to allow accurate measurements of a second binding event on the exposed second site (supplemental Fig. S2). This experiment allowed the independent determination of the kinetic parameters of a second binding site for trypsin and chymotrypsin. This alternative interaction turns out to be slightly weaker for both enzymes, suggesting that PPI contains a high affinity (site H) site and a low affinity (site L) site for trypsin and chymotrypsin. As attempts to crystallize the complexes of PPI with trypsin or chymotrypsin were unsuccessful, we looked for alternative methods to obtain structural information of the interaction between PPI and trypsin. Initially, we focused on flexible in silico docking using each of 11 loops present in PPI. As a positive control, the β4-β5 loop (residues 60–66) of the STI was targeted to the trypsin active site, resulting in a top solution with energy of −161 kcal/mol and a buried surface area of 2088 Å2 (supplemental Fig. S3). The position and conformation of the STI loop in the docked trypsin complex are a close match to those in the known crystal structure of this complex (PDB entry 1AVW). The detailed conformation of the STI side chains near the trypsin active site also correspond very well to the known structure (supplemental Fig. S3), with Arg-63 occupying the specificity pocket (S1) and Tyr-62 covering the side chain of the catalytic Ser-192. The docking runs equally target loop β4-β5 (residues 64–71) of PPI into the active site of trypsin. The top cluster has an energy of −126 kcal/mol and a buried surface area of 1829 Å2. In this cluster, the orientation of the β4-β5 loop differs from what is seen in the crystal structure between trypsin and STI, which is not unexpected given its insertion of two amino acids, which precludes the classic interaction mode. In our model, the side chain of Asn-67 occupies the S1 pocket of trypsin, and the catalytic Ser-195 is covered by residue Val-68 of PPI (Fig. 3A). This is a recurrent theme in most miraculin-like Kunitz-STI trypsin inhibitors (22Gahloth D. Selvakumar P. Shee C. Kumar P. Sharma A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 494: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and suggests that the S1 Lys/Asn substitution involves additional changes in the inhibitory mechanism. In the PPI-trypsin complex, the residues expected to enter the active site, loop away from the protease. This model suggests that PPI works by occluding the active site of the protease rather than using the more traditional “Laskowski-like” mechanism (6Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). The docking run for PPI loop β2-β3 (residues Pro-39 to Pro-46 of PPI) also resulted in a top cluster targeted to the active site. The corresponding interaction energy of −113 kcal/mol together with the buried surface area of 1712 Å2 suggest a lower affinity interaction when compared with the canonical loop. In all solutions, Lys-43 occupies the specificity pocket in a manner that is very similar to the mode of binding of Arg-63 in the STI complex, whereas Lys-42 very effectively covers the catalytic serine (Fig. 3B). The remaining loops dock in a more scattered fashion without systematically recurring interactions to trypsin in their conformational ensemble. Although several of them show significant interaction energies, the specificity pocket of trypsin remains unoccupied or clearly suboptimal interactions are observed for the lowest energy solution. Loop β5-β6 is glycosylated, and the attached glycans would likely hamper this loop in its interaction with a protease. In addition, PPI contains several Lys and Arg residues that could potentially interact with the active site of trypsin. Lys-82 from loop β5-β6 is too close to one of the glycosylation sites, and Lys-114 from loop β7-β8 and Arg-149 from β9-β10 are located close to β4-β5, making it unlikely that trypsin or chymotrypsin would be able to bind to them without severe steric clashes with a trypsin bound to β4-β5. Arg-146 is in a scaffolding role that shapes loop β9-β10. The rest of the Lys/Arg residues are located in loops β2-β3 and β4-β5 or in β-strands. The docking results are a strong indication that loops β2-β3 and β4-β5 are the reactive centers of PPI toward serine proteases. Therefore we based the modeling of the PPI-serine protease interactions on these results and used this information for the SAXS shape reconstruction of the complexes. We tried to crystallize the different trypsin-PPI complexes to obtain a molecular description of their structure. We obtained good quality crystals under several different conditions, but they invariably contained only trypsin. We resorted to a different strategy based on SAXS measurements to obtain the overall shapes of the complexes and determine the relative orientations of both trypsin-binding sites on the surface of PPI. The structural parameters of PPI and the PPI-trypsin complexes calculated from the experimental scattering curves (Fig. 4A) are shown in supplemental Table S2. The estimated molecular weight of all particles agrees well with those predicted from the sequence and observed by gel filtration. Kratky plots are consistent in every case with a properly folded, homogeneous, and well structured species (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). The distance distributions P(r) computed from the experimental data of free PPI and of the binary complex show a bell-shaped curve typical"
https://openalex.org/W2077453263,"VirB5 is a type 4 secretion system protein of Agrobacterium located on the surface of the bacterial cell. This localization pattern suggests a function for VirB5 which is beyond its known role in biogenesis and/or stabilization of the T-pilus and which may involve early interactions between Agrobacterium and the host cell. Here, we identify VirB5 as the first Agrobacterium virulence protein that can enhance infectivity extracellularly. Specifically, we show that elevating the amounts of the extracellular VirB5—by exogenous addition of the purified protein, its overexpression in the bacterium, or transgenic expression in and secretion out of the host cell—enhances the efficiency the Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transfer, as measured by transient expression of genes contained on the transferred T-DNA molecule. Importantly, the exogenous VirB5 enhanced transient T-DNA expression in sugar beet, a major crop recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. Increasing the pool of the extracellular VirB5 did not complement an Agrobacterium virB5 mutant, suggesting a dual function for VirB5: in the bacterium and at the bacterium-host cell interface. Consistent with this idea, VirB5 expressed in the host cell, but not secreted, had no effect on the transformation efficiency. That the increase in T-DNA expression promoted by the exogenous VirB5 was not due to its effects on bacterial growth, virulence gene induction, bacterial attachment to plant tissue, or host cell defense response suggests that VirB5 participates in the early steps of the T-DNA transfer to the plant cell."
https://openalex.org/W2081328907,"Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification that regulates many biological conditions [1], [2], [3], [4]. Trip12 is a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates ARF and APP-BP1 [5], [6]. However, the significance of Trip12 in vivo is largely unknown. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Trip12 is indispensable for mouse embryogenesis. A homozygous mutation in Trip12 (Trip12mt/mt) that disrupts the ubiquitin ligase activity resulted in embryonic lethality in the middle stage of development. Trip12mt/mt embryos exhibited growth arrest and increased expression of the negative cell cycle regulator p16 [7], [8], [9], [10]. In contrast, Trip12mt/mt ES cells were viable. They had decreased proliferation, but maintained both the undifferentiated state and the ability to differentiate. Trip12mt/mt ES cells had increased levels of the BAF57 protein (a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) and altered gene expression patterns. These data suggest that Trip12 is involved in global gene expression and plays an important role in mouse development."

Although numerous studies have been conducted to reveal the mechanism of cell movement, the full picture has yet to be depicted, likely due to the complex features of cell movement. We show here that the scaffold protein afadin dilute domain-interacting protein (ADIP), an afadin-binding protein, is involved in the regulation of cell movement. ADIP localized at the leading edge of moving cells in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and was required for the formation of the leading edge and the promotion of cell movement. Impaired cell movement observed in ADIP knockdown cells was not rescued by expression of an ADIP mutant that is incapable of binding to afadin, leading to the notion that the function of ADIP in moving cells depends on its interaction with afadin. Knockdown of ADIP as well as knockdown of afadin inhibited the activation of the small G protein Rac, which is important for the formation of the leading edge and the promotion of cell movement. Furthermore, ADIP interacted with Vav2, a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rac, in a Src phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that ADIP mediates the activation of Rac through Vav2.

The purpose of this study is to obtain the mass action elementary rate constants for P-gp's transport and to functionally characterize members of P-gp's network, i.e., other transporters that transport P-gp substrates in hMDR1-MDCKII confluent cell monolayers and are essential to the net substrate flux. Transport of a range of concentrations of amprenavir, loperamide, quinidine and digoxin across the confluent monolayer of cells was measured in both directions, apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical. We developed a global optimization algorithm using the Particle Swarm method that can simultaneously fit all datasets to yield accurate and exhaustive fits of these elementary rate constants. The statistical sensitivity of the fitted values was determined by using 24 identical replicate fits, yielding simple averages and standard deviations for all of the kinetic parameters, including the efflux active P-gp surface density. Digoxin required additional basolateral and apical transporters, while loperamide required just a basolateral tranporter. The data were better fit by assuming bidirectional transporters, rather than active importers, suggesting that they are not MRP or active OATP transporters. The P-gp efflux rate constants for quinidine and digoxin were about 3-fold smaller than reported ATP hydrolysis rate constants from P-gp proteoliposomes. This suggests a roughly 3∶1 stoichiometry between ATP hydrolysis and P-gp transport for these two drugs. The fitted values of the elementary rate constants for these P-gp substrates support the hypotheses that the selective pressures on P-gp are to maintain a broad substrate range and to keep xenobiotics out of the cytosol, but not out of the apical membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2074990743,"Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1 or M-CSF) is the major physiological regulator of the proliferation, differentiation and survival of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. CSF-1 binds to a receptor tyrosine kinase, the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Multiple pathways are activated downstream of the CSF-1R; however, it is not clear which pathways regulate proliferation and survival. Here, we investigated the role of atypical protein kinase Cs (PKCζ) in a myeloid progenitor cell line that expressed CSF-1R (32D.R) and in primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs). In 32D.R cells, CSF-1 induced the phosphorylation of PKCζ and increased its kinase activity. PKC inhibitors and transfections with mutant PKCs showed that optimal CSF-1-dependent Erk activation and proliferation depended on the activity of PKCζ. We previously reported that CSF-1 activated the Erk pathway through an A-Raf-dependent and an A-Raf independent pathway (Lee and States, Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 6779). PKC inhibitors did not affect CSF-1 induced Ras and A-Raf activity but markedly reduced MEK and Erk activity, implying that PKCζ regulated the CSF-1-Erk pathway at the level of MEK. PKCζ has been implicated in activating the NF-κB pathway. However, CSF-1 promoted proliferation in an NF-κB independent manner. We established stable 32D.R cell lines that overexpressed PKCζ. Overexpression of PKCζ increased the intensity and duration of CSF-1 induced Erk activity and rendered cells more responsive to CSF-1 mediated proliferation. In contrast to 32D.R cells, PKCζ inhibition in BMMs had only a modest effect on proliferation. Moreover, PKCζ -specific and pan-PKC inhibitors induced a paradoxical increase in MEK-Erk phosphorylation suggesting that PKCs targeted a common negative regulatory step upstream of MEK. Our results demonstrated that CSF-1 dependent Erk activation and proliferation are regulated differentially in progenitors and differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023006742,"Vibrio vulnificus secretes a hemolysin/cytolysin (VVH) that induces cytolysis in target cells. A detergent resistant membrane domain (DRM) fraction of the cells after sucrose gradient centrifugation includes cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains which have been called ""lipid rafts"". It was reported that some pore-forming toxins require association with DRM and/or lipid rafts to exert their cytotoxicity. It has also been thought that cellular cholesterol is involved in VVH cytotoxicity because VVH cytotoxicity was inhibited by pre-incubation with cholesterol. However, both cellular localization and mode of action of VVH cytotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between VVH localization on the cellular membrane and its cytotoxicity. Oligomers of VVH were detected from DRM fractions by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation but all of these oligomers shifted from DRM fractions to non-DRM fractions after treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a cholesterol sequestering agent. On the other hand, immunofluorescence analysis showed that VVH did not co-localize with major lipid raft markers on cellular membrane of CHO cells. These data suggested that VVH localized at membrane regions which are relatively abundant in cholesterol but which are not identical with lipid rafts. To determine the linkage between localization and cytotoxicity of VVH, cytotoxicity was evaluated in MβCD-treated CHO cells. The cytotoxicity of VVH was not decreased by the MβCD treatment. In addition, the amount of VVH oligomer did not decrease in MβCD-treated CHO cells. Thus, we found that the amount of oligomer on cellular membrane is important for induction of cytotoxicity, whereas localization to lipid rafts on the cellular membrane was not essential to cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1980063107,"Human Tubulin Binding Cofactor C (TBCC) is a post-chaperonin involved in the folding and assembly of α- and β-tubulin monomers leading to the release of productive tubulin heterodimers ready to polymerize into microtubules. In this process it collaborates with other cofactors (TBC's A, B, D, and E) and forms a supercomplex with TBCD, β-tubulin, TBCE and α-tubulin. Here, we demonstrate that TBCC depletion results in multipolar spindles and mitotic failure. Accordingly, TBCC is found at the centrosome and is implicated in bipolar spindle formation. We also determine by NMR the structure of the N-terminal domain of TBCC. The TBCC N-terminal domain adopts a spectrin-like fold topology composed of a left-handed 3-stranded α-helix bundle. Remarkably, the 30-residue N-terminal segment of the TBCC N-terminal domain is flexible and disordered in solution. This unstructured region is involved in the interaction with tubulin. Our data lead us to propose a testable model for TBCC N-terminal domain/tubulin recognition in which the highly charged N-terminus as well as residues from the three helices and the loops interact with the acidic hypervariable regions of tubulin monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1985242794,"Hypoxia is a severe stressful condition and induces cell death leading to neuronal loss both to the developing and adult nervous system. Central theme to cellular death is the activation of different classes of proteases such as caspases calpains and cathepsins. In the present study we investigated the involvement of these proteases, in the hypoxia-induced PC12 cell death. Rat PC12 is a model cell line for experimentation relevant to the nervous system and several protocols have been developed for either lethal hypoxia (oxygen and glucose deprivation OGD) or ischemic preconditioning (IPS). Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) treated PC12 differentiate to a sympathetic phenotype, expressing neurites and excitability. Lethal hypoxia was established by exposing undifferentiated and NGF-treated PC12 cells to a mixture of N2/CO2 (93:5%) in DMEM depleted of glucose and sodium pyruvate for 16 h. The involvement of caspases, calpains and lysosomal cathepsins D and E to the cell death induced by lethal OGD was investigated employing protease specific inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk for the caspases, MDL28170 for the calpains and pepstatin A for the cathepsins D and E. Our findings show that pepstatin A provides statistically significant protection from cell death of both naive and NGF treated PC12 cells exposed to lethal OGD. We propose that apart from the established processes of apoptosis and necrosis that are integral components of lethal OGD, the activation of cathepsins D and E launches additional cell death pathways in which these proteases are key partners."
https://openalex.org/W2059782152,"African horse sickness is a devastating, transboundary animal disease, that is ‘listed’ by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Although attenuated, inactivated and subunit vaccines have been developed for African horse sickness virus (AHSV), these are serotype-specific and their effective deployment therefore relies on rapid and reliable identification of virus type. AHSV serotype is controlled by the specificity of interactions between neutralising antibodies, and components of the outer-capsid, particularly protein VP2 (encoded by AHSV genome segment 2 (Seg-2)). We report the development and evaluation of novel gel based reverse transcription-PCR (RT–PCR) assays targeting AHSV Seg-2, which can be used to very significantly increase the speed and reliability of detection and identification (compared to virus neutralisation tests) of the nine serotypes of AHSV. Primer sets were designed targeting regions of Seg-2 that are conserved between strains within each of the AHSV serotype (types 1 to 9). These assays were evaluated using multiple AHSV strains from the orbivirus reference collection at IAH (www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/AHSV-isolates.htm). In each case the Seg-2 primers showed a high level of specificity and failed to cross-amplify the most closely related heterologous AHSV types, or other related orbiviruses (such as bluetongue virus (BTV), or equine encephalosis virus (EEV)). The assays are rapid and sensitive, and can be used to detect and type viral RNA in blood, tissue samples, or cultivated viral suspensions within 24 h. They were used to identify AHSV strains from recent outbreaks in sub-Saharan African countries. These methods also generate cDNAs suitable for sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of Seg-2, identifying distinct virus lineages within each virus-type and helping to identify strain movements/origins. The RT-PCR methods described here provide a robust and versatile tool for rapid and specific detection and identification of AHSV serotypes 1 to 9."
https://openalex.org/W2076871950,"Adenocarcinomas located near the gastroesophageal junction have unclear etiology and are difficult to classify. We used DNA methylation analysis to identify subtype-specific markers and new subgroups of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, and studied their association with epidemiological risk factors and clinical outcomes.We used logistic regression models and unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of 74 DNA methylation markers on 45 tumor samples (44 patients) of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas obtained from a population-based case-control study to uncover epigenetic markers and cluster groups of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas. No distinct epigenetic differences were evident between subtypes of gastric and esophageal cancers. However, we identified two gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma subclusters based on DNA methylation profiles. Group membership was best predicted by GATA5 DNA methylation status. We analyzed the associations between these two epigenetic groups and exposure using logistic regression, and the associations with survival time using Cox regression in a larger set of 317 tumor samples (278 patients). There were more males with esophageal and gastric cardia cancers in Cluster Group 1 characterized by higher GATA5 DNA methylation values (all p<0.05). This group also showed associations of borderline statistical significance with having ever smoked (p-value = 0.07), high body mass index (p-value = 0.06), and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (p-value = 0.07). Subjects in cluster Group 1 showed better survival than those in Group 2 after adjusting for tumor differentiation grade, but this was not found to be independent of tumor stage.DNA methylation profiling can be used in population-based studies to identify epigenetic subclasses of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas and class-specific DNA methylation markers that can be linked to epidemiological data and clinical outcome. Two new epigenetic subgroups of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas were identified that differ to some extent in their survival rates, risk factors of exposure, and GATA5 DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1971401023,"Background The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) coding polymorphism modifies the risks of Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Aside from the coding variants, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the APOE promoter has also been shown to modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we investigate the genotype-function relationship of APOE promoter polymorphism at molecular level and at physiological level: i.e., in transcription control of the gene and in the risk of type 2 diabetes. In molecular studies, the effect of the APOE −491A/T (rs449647) polymorphism on gene transcription was accessed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. The −491 A to T substitution decreased the activity (p<0.05) of the cloned APOE promoter (−1017 to +406). Using the −501 to −481 nucleotide sequence of the APOE promoter as a ‘bait’ to screen the human brain cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid system yielded ATF4, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response gene, as one of the interacting factors. Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) analyses further substantiated the physical interaction between ATF4 and the APOE promoter. Over-expression of ATF4 stimulated APOE expression whereas siRNA against ATF4 suppressed the expression of the gene. However, interaction between APOE promoter and ATF4 was not −491A/T-specific. At physiological level, the genotype-function relationship of APOE promoter polymorphism was studied in type 2 diabetes. In 630 cases and 595 controls, three APOE promoter SNPs −491A/T, −219G/T (rs405509), and +113G/C (rs440446) were genotyped and tested for association with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. No SNP or haplotype association with type 2 diabetes was detected. Conclusions/Significance At molecular level, polymorphism −491A/T and ATF4 elicit independent control of APOE gene expression. At physiological level, no genotype-risk association was detected between the studied APOE promoter SNPs and type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2070575765,"Di-methyl phthalate (DMP), a typical endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), is ubiquitously distributed in aquatic environments; yet studies regarding its impact on gametes and the resulting effects on embryogenesis in marine gastropods are relatively scarce. In this study, the influences of DMP on the gametes and subsequent developmental process of abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, a representative marine benthic gastropod) were assessed. Newborn abalone eggs and sperm were exposed separately to different DMP concentrations (1, 10 or 100 ppb) for 60 min. At the end-point of exposure, the DMP-treated eggs and sperm were collected for analysis of their ultra-structures, ATPase activities and total lipid levels, and the fertilized gametes (embryos) were collected to monitor related reproductive parameters (fertilization rate, abnormal development rate and hatching success rate). Treatment with DMP did not significantly alter the structure or total lipid content of eggs at any of the doses tested. Hatching failures and morphological abnormalities were only observed with the highest dose of DMP (100 ppb). However, DMP exposure did suppress sperm ATPase activities and affect the morphological character of their mitochondria. DMP-treated sperm exhibited dose-dependent decreases in fertilization efficiency, morphogenesis and hatchability. Relatively obvious toxicological effects were observed when both sperm and eggs were exposed to DMP. Furthermore, RT-PCR results indicate that treatment of gametes with DMP changed the expression patterns of physiologically-regulated genes (cyp3a, 17β-HSD-11 and 17β-HSD-12) in subsequent embryogenesis. Taken together, this study proofed that pre-fertilization exposure of abalone eggs, sperm or both to DMP adversely affects the fertilization process and subsequent embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042601371,"In preterm infants, exfoliated gastric epithelial cells can be retrieved from aspirates sampled through the naso-gastric feeding tube. Our aims were to determine (1) whether the recovery of exfoliated cells is feasible at any time from birth through the removal of the nasogastric tube, (2) whether they can be grown in culture in vitro, and (3) whether the physiological state of exfoliated cells expressing H+/K+ -ATPases reflects that of their counterparts remaining in situ at the surface of the gastric epithelium in neonatal rat pups.In infants, gastric fluid aspirates were collected weekly after birth or every 3 hours over 24-h periods, and related to clinical parameters (Biocollection PROG/09/18). In rat pups submitted to a single fasting/refeeding cycle, we explored circadian exfoliation with the cellular counter-parts in the gland. All samples were analyzed by confocal imaging and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay.Epithelial cells were identified by microscopy using membrane-bound anti-H+/K+ ATPases antibody, assessed for nucleus integrity, and the expression of selected proteins (autophagy, circadian clock). On 34 infants, the H+/K+-ATPase-positive cells were consistently found quiescent, regardless of gestational age and feeding schedule from day-5 of life to the day of removal of the naso-gastric tube. By logistic regression analysis, we did find a positive correlation between the intensity of exfoliation (cellular loss per sample) and the postnatal age (p<0.001). The H+/K+ ATPase-positive cells established in culture retained the expression of a biomarker of progenitor status (Pouf5F1-Oct4). In rat pups, the expression pattern of Survivin in H+/K+ ATPase-positive exfoliated cells paralleled that observed in cells remaining at the surface of the gastric gland.Tracking parietal cells can improve clinical monitoring and understanding of the autophagic death via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/survivin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2031506895,"Regenerative strategies that facilitate the regrowth and reconnection of neurons are some of the most promising methods in spinal cord injury research. An essential part of these strategies is an increased understanding of the mechanisms by which growing neurites seek out and synapse with viable targets. In this paper, we use computational and theoretical tools to examine the targeting efficiency of growing neurites subject to limited resources, such as maximum total neural tree length. We find that in order to efficiently reach a particular target, growing neurites must achieve balance between pruning and branching: rapidly growing neurites that do not prune will exhaust their resources, and frequently pruning neurites will fail to explore space effectively. We also find that the optimal branching/pruning balance must shift as the target distance changes: different strategies are called for to reach nearby vs. distant targets. This suggests the existence of a currently unidentified higher-level regulatory factor to control arborization dynamics. We propose that these findings may be useful in future therapies seeking to improve targeting rates through manipulation of arborization behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2049484177,"Aim Neurotransmitter release is elicited by an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The action potential triggers Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels which causes local changes of [Ca2+]i for vesicle release. However, any direct role of extracellular Ca2+ (besides Ca2+ influx) on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis remains elusive. Here we set out to investigate this possibility on rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and chromaffin cells, widely used models for studying vesicle exocytosis. Results Using photolysis of caged Ca2+ and caffeine-induced release of stored Ca2+, we found that extracellular Ca2+ inhibited exocytosis following moderate [Ca2+]i rises (2–3 µM). The IC50 for extracellular Ca2+ inhibition of exocytosis (ECIE) was 1.38 mM and a physiological reduction (∼30%) of extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) significantly increased the evoked exocytosis. At the single vesicle level, quantal size and release frequency were also altered by physiological [Ca2+]o. The calcimimetics Mg2+, Cd2+, G418, and neomycin all inhibited exocytosis. The extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) was not involved because specific drugs and knockdown of CaSR in DRG neurons did not affect ECIE. Conclusion/Significance As an extension of the classic Ca2+ hypothesis of synaptic release, physiological levels of extracellular Ca2+ play dual roles in evoked exocytosis by providing a source of Ca2+ influx, and by directly regulating quantal size and release probability in neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120413119,"Background Atrial fibrillation and delayed gastric emptying (DGE) are common after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Our aim was to investigate a potential relationship between atrial fibrillation and DGE, which we defined as failure to tolerate a regular diet by the 7th postoperative day. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of 249 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution between 2000 and 2009. Data was analyzed with Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U or unpaired T-test for continuous variables. Results Approximately 5% of the 249 patients included in the analysis experienced at least one episode of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Median age of patients with atrial fibrillation was 74 years, compared with 66 years in patients without atrial fibrillation (p = 0.0005). Patients with atrial fibrillation were more likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.03). 92% of the patients with atrial fibrillation suffered from DGE, compared to 46% of patients without atrial fibrillation (p = 0.0007). This association held true when controlling for age. Conclusion Patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation are more likely to experience delayed gastric emptying. Interventions to manage delayed gastric function might be prudent in patients at high risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2020400444,"HLA-DRB1 is the most polymorphic MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II gene in human, and plays a crucial role in the development and function of the immune system. Extensive polymorphisms exist in the promoter and 3′-UTR of HLA-DRB1, especially a LTR (Long terminal repeat) element in the promoter, which may be involved in the expression regulation. However, it remains unknown how the polymorphisms in the whole promoter region and 3′-UTR to regulate the gene expression. In this study, we investigated the extensive polymorphisms in the HLA-DRB1 promoter and 3′-UTR, and how these polymorphisms affect the gene expression in both independent and jointly manners. It was observed that most of the haplotypes in the DRB1 promoter and 3′-UTR were clustered into 4 conserved lineages (H1, H2, H3 and H4), and showed high linkage disequilibrium. Compared with H1 and H2 lineage, a LTR element in the promoter of H3 and H4 lineage significantly suppressed the promoter activity, whereas the activity of the linked 3′-UTR increased, leading to no apparent difference in the final expression product between H1/H2 and H3/H4 lineage. Nevertheless, compared with the plasmid with a promoter and 3′-UTR from the same lineage, the recombinant plasmid with a promoter from H2 and a 3′-UTR from H3 showed about double fold increased luciferase activity, Conversely, the recombinant plasmid with a promoter from H3 and a 3′-UTR from H2 resulted in about 2-fold decreased luciferase activity. These results indicate that the promoter and 3′-UTR of HLA-DRB1 may antagonistically regulate the gene expression, which may be subjected to stabilizing selection. These findings may provide a novel insight into the mechanisms of the diseases associated with HLA-DRB1 genes."
