https://openalex.org/W1577273492,"The effect of human plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) on the particle size distribution of human high density lipoprotein (HDL) was studied by incubating human HDL3 (particle diameter, 8.7 nm) together with PLTP in vitro. Incubation of HDL3 with highly purified preparations of PLTP, devoid of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), induced a conversion of the homogenous population of HDL particles into two main populations of particles, one larger, particle diameter 10.9 nm, and one smaller, particle diameter 7.8 nm, than the original HDL3. These size changes were evident as analyzed by gradient gel electrophoresis and by high resolution gel filtration. The degree of the conversion was dependent on the amount of PLTP added to the incubation and on incubation time. An inhibitory monoclonal antibody (TP-1) directed against CETP had no effect on the HDL conversion. The PLTP used was purified to homogeneity from human plasma using ultracentrifugation and a combination of hydrophobic, cation-exchange, heparin-Sepharose-, anion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies. The monoclonal anti-CETP antibody (TP-1), which inhibits lipid transfer catalyzed by CETP, did not react with PLTP or inhibit its activity. The estimated molecular weight of PLTP is 75,000. The present study demonstrates that PLTP can act like the putative conversion factor and has the ability to convert HDL3 into populations of larger and smaller HDL particles. The mechanism(s) involved in this process and its physiological relevance remain to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1606703336,"Regulation of adenylyl cyclases by protein kinase C was studied. Types 1-6 were transiently expressed in 293 cells. The cells were treated with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and adenylyl cyclase activity was measured. PMA treatment of untransfected or vector-transfected cells resulted in a 35% (mean) increase in basal and forskolin-stimulated activity. PMA treatment of type 2 enzyme-transfected cells showed a 3-fold increase in basal activity. This stimulation varied with Mg2+ concentration with up to 4.5-fold increases at low Mg2+. PMA treatment resulted in about a 60% increase in fluoride or GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate))-stimulated activity in type 2 enzyme-transfected cells. Expression of the type 1 and 3 enzymes resulted in pronounced Ca2+/calmodulin stimulation, which was significantly increased upon pretreatment with PMA. No effects of PMA treatment were observable on other activities of the type 1 enzyme, whereas all activities of the type 3 enzymes were stimulated. Expressed types 4, 5, and 6 enzymes showed modest (approximately 30%) or no increases in basal and forskolin-stimulated activities upon PMA treatment. These data indicate that specific types of adenylyl cyclases can be functional targets for protein kinase C. The pronounced effects on the basal activity of the type 2 enzyme suggest this adenylyl cyclase could in the appropriate environment be an intracellular signal generator for external signals not routed through the activation of Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1507232548,"A new class of inositol phosphates containing energy-rich pyrophosphoryl residues has been characterized. D/L-1-Diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate(s) and D/L-bis-(1,4)-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate(s) are present as soluble ionic species in the cytosol of amoebae (Dictyostelium discoideum) at concentrations in the range of 0.05-0.25 mM. These compounds are rapidly metabolized in intact cells and can be synthesized in cell lysates from myo-inositol hexakisphosphate in the presence of ATP. Their phosphomonoester groups have predicted C-O-P bond energies of between 3.3 and 4 kcal mol-1; however, the bond energies of the P-O-P links in their diphosphate moieties are 6.6 kcal mol-1 and hence similar to the equivalent bonds in ADP, indicating a potential role for these compounds as phosphate donors in phosphotransferase reactions. Compounds with similar chromatographic properties are found in a variety of mammalian cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1605366679,"Free radicals are thought to play an important role in many types of tissue injury. Recently, we reported that a series of prostaglandin F2-like compounds (F2-isoprostanes) capable of exerting potent biological activity are produced in vivo by free radical-induced lipid peroxidation. Their formation is independent of the cyclooxygenase enzyme and has been shown to increase profoundly in animal models of free radical injury and lipid peroxidation. We now report the identification of F-ring isoprostane metabolites in human urine and plasma utilizing a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay for the major urinary metabolite of prostaglandin D2 (9 alpha,11 beta-dihydroxy-15-oxo-2,3, 18,19-tetranorprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid). Evidence confirming these metabolites as tetranor, dicarboxylic acid compounds containing one double bond, cis-cyclopentane ring hydroxyls, and one keto group similar in structure to the major urinary metabolite of prostaglandin D2 was obtained by analysis of human urine by electron ionization mass spectrometry. Levels of these metabolites in normal human urine were determined and found to be unaffected by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Evidence that these metabolites arise from F2-isoprostanes was obtained by demonstrating that (a) marked increases in plasma levels and urinary excretion of these metabolites, which were unaffected by coadministration of indomethacin, occurred in rats administered CCl4 to induce F2-isoprostane formation and (b) marked increases in levels of these metabolites in plasma and urine resulted from the intravenous infusion of F2-isoprostanes into a rat. Quantification of these isoprostane metabolites in urine and plasma may provide a reliable index of endogenous isoprostane production which could prove to be an important advance in our ability to assess oxidant stress in vivo in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1483837298,"Endothelin receptors (ETRs) are distributed throughout a variety of tissues. Two human cDNAs were identified which encode distinct ETR proteins. One cDNA encoded a 427-amino acid protein that shared 91% identity to rat ETAR. The second cDNA encoded a 442-amino acid protein that was 88% identical to rat ETBR. Ligand binding studies of the cloned receptors expressed in COS cells confirmed that they were pharmacologically ETAR and ETBR subtypes; although the selective antagonist BQ123 showed a potency similar to ET-3 in displacing 125I-ET-1 binding to ETAR. This observation contrasts with rat ETAR pharmacology where BQ123 has a 100-fold higher affinity than ET3. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human ETAR displayed equal potencies in displacing 125I-ET-1 binding, which indicates that rat and human ETAR are pharmacologically distinct. Electrophysiological studies of both ETRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed that they are functional. Northern analysis indicated that the two ETRs are differentially expressed in many tissues. Marmosets maintained on a high fat/high cholesterol diet exhibited 3-fold increase in ETBR mRNA levels with little change in ETAR mRNA levels. Availability of cDNA clones for ETR subtypes can open avenues for future analysis of their role in pathophysiology of various diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1594523559,"The biosynthesis of proinsulin is specifically stimulated by glucose in the pancreatic beta-cell, and this, in turn, places an increased demand on the mechanism for proinsulin to insulin conversion. Proteolytic proinsulin processing is catalyzed by two endopeptidases putatively identified as the subtilisin-related PC2 and PC3 convertases (Bennett, D. L., Bailyes, E. M., Nielson, E., Guest, P. C., Rutherford, N. G., Arden, S. D., and Hutton, J. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15229-15236; Bailyes, E. M., Shennan, K. I. J., Seal, A. J., Smeekens, S. P., Steiner, D. F., Hutton, J. C., and Docherty, K. (1992) Biochem. J. 285, 391-394). In this study, we demonstrate in isolated rat pancreatic islets that the biosynthesis of PC3 was specifically stimulated by glucose relatively parallel to that of proinsulin. In contrast, however, PC2 biosynthesis was not glucose-regulated. The stimulation of PC3 and proinsulin biosynthesis was observed above a threshold of 4 mM glucose and reached a maximum (about 7-10-fold) above 10 mM glucose concentrations. Glucose stimulation for PC3 and proinsulin biosynthesis was rapid (occurring within 20 min and reaching a maximum by 60 min) and was not affected by the additional presence of actinomycin D, suggesting regulation predominantly at the translational level. Moreover, the intracellular signals for glucose-stimulated PC3 and proinsulin biosynthesis appeared to be similar, requiring the metabolism of glucose. PC3 has been implicated as the key endopeptidase in proinsulin to insulin conversion, in that it is the enzyme which preferentially initiates the process (Rhodes, C. J., Lincoln, B., and Shoelson, S. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22719-22727). We suggest that co-ordinate stimulation of PC3 biosynthesis, along with that of its proinsulin substrate, elucidates an additional control point by which the mechanism of proprotein processing might be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1640758599,"We have partially purified and characterized two protein kinases that were strongly activated by interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in MRC-5 fibroblasts. The kinases were separated by anion exchange chromatography of cytosolic fractions. They phosphorylated in vitro the small heat shock protein (hsp27) or beta-casein and were stimulated 3- and 4.5-fold, respectively, in cells that had been exposed to IL-1 or TNF for 10 min. They were distinct from the mitogen-activated protein kinases, whose activation by IL-1 or TNF has been reported recently. The hsp27 kinase phosphorylated its substrate on serine residues. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 45-kDa by gel filtration. It is probably involved in the increase in hsp27 phosphorylation seen in intact cells. The beta-casein kinase behaved as a 65-kDa protein. It phosphorylated its substrate on serine and threonine residues and had little activity on alpha-casein. The hsp27 and beta-casein kinases were not activated after stimulation of the cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). In contrast, the MAP kinases were activated to a similar extent (2-3-fold) by the cytokines and by PMA. The hsp27- and beta-casein kinases probably correspond to novel enzymes whose mechanisms of activation may be independent of protein kinase C or MAP kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1679824971,"The synthesis of malate and citrate by sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) perfused with KH13CO3 was analyzed using 13C NMR. To perform in vivo experiments, cells were compressed in a 25-mm tube and perfused with an arrangement enabling tight control of the circulating nutrient medium. An original method using paramagnetic Mn2+ that induced a complete loss of the vacuolar malate and citrate signals was developed to discriminate between cytoplasmic and vacuolar pools of malate and citrate. Our results indicated the following. (a) The accumulation of appreciable amounts of malate in sycamore cells required rather high (1 mM) concentrations of bicarbonate at all the pH values tested. (b) Malate was equally labeled at C-1 and C-4, suggesting that malate labeled at C-1 was produced by randomization of C-1 and C-4 by mitochondrial fumarase. Indeed, the separation of the intact organelles from the lysed protoplasts indicated that fumarase activity was essentially limited to the mitochondria. Similarly, citrate was equally enriched at C-1 and C-5 + C-6 carboxyls. (c) Malate appeared first in the cytoplasmic compartment; and when a threshold of cytoplasmic malate concentration was attained, malate molecules were expelled into the vacuole, where they accumulated. On the other hand, citrate accumulated steadily in the vacuole. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated the central role played by the tonoplast in governing the vacuolar influx of citrate and the permanent exchange of malate between the cytoplasm and the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W1603078285,"Two small interstitial dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans, biglycan and decorin, are present in extracellular matrices of skin, tendon, ligament, and cartilage. We investigated the effects of biglycan and decorin on the inhibition of alpha-thrombin by the serine proteinase inhibitor heparin cofactor II. In solution, heparin cofactor II inhibition of thrombin is accelerated by intact biglycan or decorin and by the dermatan sulfate-containing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains prepared from the proteoglycans, while core protein from cartilage biglycan had no effect. L-Iduronic acid-rich skin decorin and GAG chains had a greater accelerating effect than proteoglycan and GAG chains from cartilage that had lower L-iduronic acid content. Treatment of skin decorin and GAG chains with chondroitinase ABC totally eliminated the ability of these compounds to accelerate thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II suggesting that dermatan sulfate was responsible for this action. Both biglycan and decorin bound to type V collagen in a saturable and specific manner. Biglycan, decorin, and core protein from biglycan competed for decorin binding to the type V collagen, while only the intact proteoglycans competed for biglycan binding. When bound to type V collagen, both biglycan and decorin accelerated the heparin cofactor II/thrombin inhibition reaction as efficiently as the proteoglycans in solution. Our results demonstrate that heparin cofactor II in the presence of biglycan or decorin bound to type V collagen provides a thromboresistant surface, further suggesting a physiological function for these proteins in regulating the extravascular activities of thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W41285967,"Diverse GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the p21rho subfamily were detected by a novel overlay assay (Manser, E., Leung, T., Monfries, C., Teo, M., Hall, C., and Lim, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16025-16028), with some GAPs being tissue-specific. Using a PCR strategy exploiting conserved regions common to rho/rac-GAPs, we have isolated a rat testis cDNA encoding a 34-kDa rac-GAP termed beta-chimaerin, as it was highly related to n-chimaerin, containing both a GAP domain (77% identity) and the phorbol ester-binding region (93% identity). beta-Chimaerin mRNA is expressed exclusively in the testis at the onset of sexual maturation. In situ hybridization and cell fractionation analyses show beta-chimaerin mRNA expression to be stage-specific, paralleling acrosomal assembly at the late stage of spermatogenesis. A corresponding testis-specific 30-kDa rac-GAP was detected. The testis-specific and stage-dependent expression of this new member of the chimaerin family offer an alternative model system for investigating the functional role of this class of p21 GAPs, particularly in relation to cytoskeletal reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W1495728121,"Head-to-head association of two spectrin alpha beta heterodimers to form tetramers involves the formation of two equivalent alpha-beta complexes. The sites on the alpha subunit N-terminal region and beta subunit C-terminal region that form these alpha beta complexes have been identified using protease footprinting and direct binding assays. The existence of a similar previously hypothesized internal head-to-head alpha beta interaction in dimers was also demonstrated. The discrete regions of both subunits that are protected from proteolysis in tetramers and dimers are not due to the laterally associated subunit since head-to-head complexes of a univalent alpha peptide with a univalent beta peptide show similar protection of the same sites. These sites are unshielded immediately after monomers assemble side-to-side to form heterodimers, demonstrating that reconstituted dimers are initially in an conformation. Conversion of open dimers to a closed form through formation of the internal head-to-head alpha beta association, as demonstrated by restoration of protease protection, occurred on a time scale of hours at 0 degrees C. Analysis of peptide binding affinities as well as isolation and sequence analysis of head-to-head alpha beta noncovalent complexes further defined the regions required for association on both subunits. These regions are homologous to the 106-residue repetitive motif that comprises most of both chains. An algorithm designed to improve prediction accuracy of multiple homologous motifs was used to model the conformation of spectrin repetitive motifs as well as the contact regions. In this model, the separate alpha and beta binding sites are incomplete complementary parts of a triple stranded folding unit. Formation of the alpha beta head-to-head complex produces a triple stranded conformational unit that is slightly different from other homologous motifs in the protein. Most hemolytic anemia mutations that are known to disrupt tetramer association are located in the mapped regions, including several mutations that induce a conformational change in the paired subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1950877953,"The interaction of the precursor of the chloroplast protein ferredoxin with membrane lipids was studied in monolayer experiments in order to investigate the possible involvement of membrane lipids in the protein translocation process. The precursor efficiently and specifically inserts into a total lipid extract of its biological target the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts. This interaction is mediated by the transit sequence as it can also be observed for the chemically prepared transit peptide of ferredoxin but neither for the ferredoxin apoprotein nor holoprotein. Interactions with the individual chloroplast lipids, monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol, sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol are predominantly involved which corresponds to the results obtained for transit peptide fragments of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (van't Hof, R., Demel, R. A., Keegstra, K., and De Kruijff, B. (1991) FEBS Lett. 291, 350-354). No efficient interaction was obtained with digalactosyl-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine, suggesting that a loose lipid headgroup packing due to small lipid headgroups and/or electrostatic repulsions facilitates efficient insertion. The observed preferences for interaction of the precursor and transit peptide of ferredoxin for the chloroplast outer envelope membrane lipid extract and the presequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV for the mitochondrial outer membrane lipid extract indicate that targeting sequence-lipid interactions contribute to organelle-specific protein targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1952676054,"Abstract Functional domains of the smooth muscle regulatory light chain (LC) were identified from the assembly and motor properties of smooth muscle myosin containing chimeric LCs, in which the N- and C-terminal halves of the smooth and skeletal LCs were interchanged. A C-terminal domain was also expressed. The affinity of these LCs for the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (HC) is: wild-type LC > N-skeletal/C-smooth > N-smooth/C-skeletal approximately skeletal LC > C-terminal domain. The C-terminal half of the LC thus contains an isoform-specific HC binding site, but the two halves of the LC must interact for tight binding. Smooth muscle myosin containing chimeric or skeletal LCs can no longer assume the folded monomeric conformation, suggesting that control of assembly involves both halves of the LC. Dephosphorylation/phosphorylation of the N-skeletal/C-smooth chimera nonetheless regulates the ability of smooth muscle myosin to move actin. Myosin containing phosphorylated N-smooth/C-skeletal or skeletal LCs, in contrast, is locked in the off state. Interactions between the stronger binding C-terminal domain of the LC and the HC are therefore primarily responsible for the regulatory capabilities of this subunit. Localization of the regulatory LC at the head/rod junction by electron microscopy establishes that phosphorylation-induced changes must be transmitted over 10 nm within the head for product release to be enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W1490630327,"An unusual protein kinase gene, termed PfCPK, was isolated from Plasmodium falciparum. The gene, which contains five exons and four introns, encodes a product with a predicted length of 524 amino acids. The amino-terminal segment of the predicted protein contains all of the conserved sequences characteristic of a protein kinase catalytic domain and has a high homology to several protein serine-threonine kinase subfamilies (30-41% amino acid identities). These subfamilies include calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, calcium-dependent protein kinase, ribosomal S6 protein kinase, cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C, and the yeast SNF1 subfamily. All of these protein kinases are relatively close in the phylogeny tree and within the kinase catalytic domains have about 35% amino acid identities to each other, suggesting that PfCPK is also in this region of the phylogeny tree. An unusual feature of PfCPK is that its carboxyl-terminal segment displays homology to the EF hand calcium-binding proteins, for example 34% amino acid identity to chicken fast skeletal muscle troponin C and 35% amino acid identity to human calmodulin. Like troponin Cs and calmodulins, PfCPK also contains four EF hand calcium-binding motifs. Furthermore, the four introns in the PfCPK gene are all located in the carboxyl-terminal putative EF hand calcium-binding region (EF hand calcium-binding proteins from higher eukaryotes generally contain multiple introns). This combination of a protein kinase and an EF hand calcium-binding protein in a single polypeptide implies that PfCPK may be directly activated by calcium. Constructs containing the full-length PfCPK cDNA have been expressed in Escherichia coli at a high level to generate a 60-kDa recombinant protein. Compared with similar fractions from control cells, the fraction containing PfCPK recombinant protein exhibited an elevated protein kinase activity which was Ca(2+)-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1507516414,"Abstract The crystal structure of the major lignin peroxidase isozyme from Phanerocheate chrysosporium has been refined to an R = 0.15 for data between 8 A and 2.03 A. The refined model consists of 2 lignin peroxidase molecules in the asymmetric unit, 2 calcium ions per monomer, 1 glucosamine per monomer N-linked to Asn-257, and 476 water molecules per asymmetric unit. The model exhibits excellent geometry with a root mean square deviation from ideality in bond distances and angles of 0.014 A and 2.9 degrees, respectively. Molecule 1 consists of all 343 residues, while molecule 2 consists of residues 1-341. The overall root mean square deviation in backbone atoms between the 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit is 0.36 A. The refinement at 2.0 A confirms our conclusions based on the partially refined 2.6-A structure (Edwards, S. L., Raag, R., Wariishi, H., Gold, M. H., and Poulos, T. L. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 750-754). The overall fold of lignin peroxidase closely resembles that of cytochrome c peroxidase. A superimposition of alpha-carbons gives a root mean square deviation of 2.65 A between the two peroxidases and 1.66 A for the helices. The active sites also are similar since both contain a proximal histidine heme ligand hydrogen-bonded to a buried aspartate residue and both contain histidine and arginine residues in the distal peroxide binding pocket. The most obvious difference in the active site is that whereas cytochrome c peroxidase has tryptophan residues located in the proximal and distal heme pockets, lignin peroxidase has phenylalanines. There are four other especially noteworthy differences in the two structures. First, although the heme in cytochrome c peroxidase is recessed about 10 A from the molecular surface, the heme pocket is open to solvent. The analogous opening in lignin peroxidase is smaller which can explain in part the differences in reactivity of the two hemes. This same opening may provide the site for binding small aromatic substrates. Second, lignin peroxidase has a carboxylate-carboxylate hydrogen bond important for heme binding that is not present in cytochrome c peroxidase. Third, lignin peroxidase contains 2 structural calcium ions while cytochrome c peroxidase contains no calcium. The calciums in lignin peroxidase coordinate to residues near the C-terminal ends of the distal and proximal helices and hence are probably important for maintaining the integrity of the active site. Fourth, the extra 49 residues in lignin peroxidase not present in cytochrome c peroxidase constitutes the C-terminal end of the molecule with the C terminus situated at the front end of the molecule between the two heme propionates."
https://openalex.org/W1524121247,"A protein geranylgeranyltransferase (PGGT) that transfers the geranylgeranyl group from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to the cysteine residue in the C-terminal sequence Cys-Ali-Ali-Leu (Ali is an aliphatic amino acid) of proteins and peptides has been purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine brain. This was accomplished by affinity chromatography of partially purified enzyme on a gel containing a covalently attached hexapeptide SSCILL. This peptide was identified as a tight-binding ligand of the PGGT by employing a semi-random peptide synthetic strategy. The purified enzyme consists of two subunits of apparent molecular mass 40 and 48 kDa. Affinity-purified PGGT effectively catalyzes the prenylation of peptides that contain a C-terminal Leu or Phe residue. The PGGT forms a stable binary complex with intact GGPP that can be isolated by gel filtration. Addition of a peptide substrate to this complex results in the quantitative transfer of the prenyl group to the peptide. This transfer occurs without the equilibration of enzyme-bound GGPP with free GGPP. When the PGGT was incubated with farnesyl pyrophosphate, the amount of binary complex formed was about 25% of that formed with GGPP."
https://openalex.org/W1484015205,"Abstract Recent evidence suggests that nuclei possess Ca2+ transport mechanisms to regulate nucleoplasmic/cytosolic Ca2+ gradients. We, therefore, investigated the possibility that Ca(2+)-binding proteins may also exist within the nucleus. Electrophoretic analysis revealed the presence of an acidic 93-kDa protein (p93) in the membranes of isolated nuclei. p93 stained blue with Stains-All in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and was the major 45Ca(2+)- and ruthenium red-binding nuclear envelope protein in electroblot overlays. p93 was resistant to extraction by 6 M urea but was solubilized in 2% Triton X-100. Citric acid was highly effective in removing the outer nuclear membrane (ER) with concomitant reduction (< 10-fold) of mannose-6-phosphatase activity, but not p93. 45Ca(2+)-binding assays of purified p93 revealed the presence of high capacity Ca(2+)-binding sites comparable to calreticulin. This evidence strongly suggests that p93 is a major Ca(2+)-binding protein of the inner nuclear envelope membrane. Partial amino acid sequence analysis revealed that p93 was close to 100% homologous with a recently identified ER Ca(2+)-binding protein known as calnexin. It is likely, therefore, that p93 is calnexin. However, mild CHAPS detergent treatment of nuclear envelopes and ER revealed distinctly different solubility properties of each membrane for the extraction of p93. This, together with the citrate data, strongly suggests that p93/calnexin, in isolated nuclear envelopes, is mostly bound to the inner membrane. It is possible that p93 may be involved with the regulation of Ca2+ transients between the nucleoplasm and perinuclear space."
https://openalex.org/W1508381160,"The role of two putative, cis-acting thyroid hormone-responsive elements, TRE1 and TRE2, located at -129 to -149 and -102 to -120, respectively, on the murine alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene, has been investigated in transgenic mice. These motifs are present in a 4.5-kilobase fragment lying upstream of the transcriptional start site of the mouse alpha-MHC gene: this fragment directs appropriate expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice (Subramaniam, A., Jones, W. K., Gulick, J., Wert, S., Neumann, J., and Robbins, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24613-24620). Here, we independently mutate the TRE1 and TRE2 elements by base substitution. The mice were analyzed for transgene expression in different muscle and non-muscle tissues including the atria and ventricles. Normal levels of transgene expression were observed in euthyroid mice carrying a mutation in TRE1. In contrast to these results, mice in which TRE2 was mutated showed reduced levels of CAT activity in both the atria and ventricles, suggesting a previously undefined role for this element in the constitutive up-regulation of the alpha-MHC gene. In hypothyroid mice carrying either of these mutations, the complete cessation of ventricular expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcripts that takes place in the alpha-5.5 (wild type) animals did not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1495367630,"The CMT-cKd1 cell line provides a system for studying the initial processing steps of N-linked oligosaccharides as these cells have been shown to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules which, due to a defect in assembly, recycle between the endoplasmic reticulum and a pre-Golgi compartment, failing to reach the cell surface (Hsu, V.W., Yuan, L. C., Nuchtern, J. G., Lippincott-Schwartz, J., Hammerling, G. J., and Klausner, R. D. (1991) Nature 352, 441-444). In the present study we observed that when the MHC class I heavy chain of these CMT cells was pulse-radiolabeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine (CST), it underwent a rapid degradation during a 60-min chase, in contrast to control cells in which it remained stable during that period. The CST-promoted instability of the MHC molecule appeared to be specific, as it did not occur when 1-deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of mannosidase, was added to the cells. Although endomannosidase was found to be present in the CMT cells, the electrophoretic mobility of the MHC heavy chain produced in the presence of CST indicated that deglucosylation through the alternate route provided by this enzyme did not occur. Furthermore, gamma-interferon did not prevent the rapid disappearance of the MHC molecule, although it brought about entry of this glycoprotein into the secretory pathway in cells incubated without CST. The results of our studies suggest that retention of glucose on N-linked oligosaccharides may under certain circumstances provide a signal for pre-Golgi protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1527860038,"Streptococcus suis causes sepsis, meningitis, and other serious infections in piglets, and meningitis in humans. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments with mono- and oligosaccharides and glycoproteins indicated that galactose-binding strains of S. suis recognized the Gal alpha 1-4Gal sequence present in the P1 and Pk blood group antigen structures. In thin-layer chromatography overlay assays the bacteria bound to trihexosylceramide (GbO3) but not to globoside (GbO4) or Forssman glycolipid (GbO5), in contrast to P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, which bound only to the latter two. The S. suis adhesin also differed from that of E. coli in that some of the hydrogen bonds formed with the receptor, as determined with chemically modified receptor analogues, were different. In agreement with the binding specificity, the S. suis bacteria agglutinated best among P blood group erythrocytes those of the P1k and P2k type, and from different animal erythrocytes those from rabbit, which express GbO3 as the predominant glycolipid. Binding to frozen sections of pig pharyngeal tissue was decreased by the free GbO3 oligosaccharide and its protein conjugate, which indicated that the corresponding glycolipid may function as receptor for galactose-binding strains of S. suis in pig pharyngeal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1487384455,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine) is a biologically active phospholipid. Tissues, blood cells, and plasma contain PAF acetylhydrolases (calcium independent phospholipase A2 activities) that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids containing short chain sn-2 acyl groups. They inactivate PAF and thereby determine PAF accumulation. We purified the PAF acetylhydrolase from human erythrocytes 15,600-fold. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 25,000, it behaves as a dimer during gel filtration, and it is a previously uncharacterized cytosolic esterase, as it has a unique amino-terminal sequence. The erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolase requires the addition of sulfhydryl agents for maximal activity, is inhibited by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), NaF, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, diethylpyrocarbonate, p-bromophenacylbromide, and a number of proteases. Antibodies against the purified protein precipitate all PAF hydrolase activity from erythrocyte lysates. The erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolase is specific for short or oxidized sn-2 acyl residues. It exhibits surface dilution kinetics, suggesting that hydrolysis occurs at lipid interfaces. This suggests that this enzyme acts in vivo as a scavenger of oxidatively fragmented phospholipids that are toxic to the cell."

Chem. 267, 4247-4252), whereas a substrate binding site for factor IX was localized to the second Apple (A2) domain (Baglia, F. A., Jameson, B. A., and Walsh, P. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24190-24197). To define the factor XI domain that binds factor XIIa, we have screened a panel of synthetic peptides for their capacity to inhibit factor XI activation by factor XIIa. Peptide Gly326-Lys357 (located in the A4 domain) is a noncompetitive inhibitor of factor XI activation by factor XIIa (Ki = 3.75 microM), whereas structurally similar peptides from the A1, A2, and A3 domains were required at > 1000-fold higher concentrations for similar effects. The same peptide (Gly326-Lys357) is a competitive inhibitor of factor XIIa amidolytic activity (Ki = 3.8 microM) suggesting that it binds near the active site of factor XIIa. Computer modeling was used to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of the A4 domain of factor XI that interacts with factor XIIa. Rationally designed, conformationally constrained peptides were synthesized comprising residues Ala317-Gly326, Lys331-Lys340, and Gly344-Gly350, which act in concert to inhibit factor XI-activation by factor XIIa. Finally, a conformationally constrained peptide spanning residues Ala317-Gly350 inhibits factor XIIa-catalyzed factor XI activation 50% at a concentration of 5 x 10(-7) M. These results, interpreted in the context of the model, suggest that the sequence of amino acids from Ala317 through Gly350 of the heavy chain of the A4 domain of factor XI contains three peptide structures, possibly consisting of three antiparallel beta-strands that together comprise a contact surface for interacting with factor XIIa."

We report the cloning, genomic location, and DNA sequence of the gene (called gcl) encoding E. coli Gcl and isolation of mutants lacking the enzyme. Gcl is a protein of 593 amino acid residues (64,738 Da) that has a high level (30%) of sequence similarity to the acetohydroxy acid synthases (AHAS) of branched chain amino acid synthetic pathway. Significant sequence identity (26%) was also observed with E. coli pyruvate oxidase, a redox flavoprotein, previously shown to be related to the AHAS enzymes (Chang, Y.-Y., and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170, 3937-3945). Consistent with a grouping of Gcl with the AHAS and pyruvate oxidase enzymes. Gcl contains a quinone binding site as well as binding site for thiamine pyrophosphate and FAD. We also found that a gene (orf258) immediately downstream of the gcl gene encoded a protein (Orf258) of 258 residues. Although the gene organization of gcl and orf258 is analogous to that of the ilv gene operons which encode the E. coli AHAS isozyme large and small subunits, Orf258 does not function as a Gcl subunit. Moreover, disruption of the chromosomal copy of orf258 did not affect growth on glyoxylate or glycolate."
https://openalex.org/W1648597871,"Among multiple CRE (cyclic AMP response element)-binding proteins, CRE-BP1 (also designated ATF-2) has two unique characteristics: it mediates the adenovirus E1A-induced trans-activation and forms a heterodimer with c-Jun. Two structures, a putative metal finger and a leucine zipper, in CRE-BP1 are responsible for these capacities. As a new member of a CRE-BP1 family that has similar metal finger and leucine zipper structures, we have isolated cDNA clones of CRE-BPa by cross-hybridization with CRE-BP1 cDNA. CRE-BPa protein consists of 508 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 56,840. CRE-BPa protein is highly homologous with CRE-BP1 in four regions: two of them are the regions containing the putative metal finger or the DNA-binding domain consisting of the basic amino acid cluster and the leucine zipper. Like CRE-BP1, CRE-BPa binds to CRE with higher affinity than to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element as a homodimer or a CRE-BPa/c-Jun or CRE-BPa/CRE-BP1 heterodimer. However, using the c-Myb-CRE-BPa fusion protein, it was show that CRE-BPa could not mediate the E1A-induced trans-activation. Expression of CRE-BPa mRNA was found in a limited number of cell lines, and multiple sizes of CRE-BPa mRNA species were detected in some cell lines and tissues. CRE-BPa will be useful to clarify the mechanism of CRE-mediated transcriptional activation by E1A or c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W1717245686,"In the present study we used the water-soluble short chain phosphatidylcholine analogue L-alpha-dibutyryl-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (diC4PC) to investigate the mechanism involved in the canalicular secretion of phospholipids in rat liver. Uptake of 14C-labeled di-C4PC was studied in isolated microsomes as well as in basolateral (sinusoidal) and canalicular plasma membrane vesicles. Saturable uptake of diC4PC into an osmotically active space was observed in microsomes and canalicular membrane vesicles. In contrast, diC4PC uptake into basolateral membrane vesicles could be accounted for by cross-contamination with endoplasmic reticulum and canalicular membrane vesicles. Whereas the Km values for diC4PC uptake (37 degrees C) were similar in microsomes (7.4 +/- 2.6 mM) and canalicular membrane vesicles (8.2 +/- 2.0 mM), the Vmax values were approximately 2-fold higher in canalicular membrane vesicles (29.6 +/- 2.7 nmol/mg of protein x min) than in microsomes (16.7 +/- 2.1 nmol/mg of protein x min). Furthermore, Pronase treatment of the membrane vesicles reduced diC4PC uptake by 34-54% in both subfractions, whereas the D-[14C]glucose-accessible water space was only reduced by approximately 20%. These data provide direct evidence for the presence of a protein-mediated phosphatidylcholine translocating activity in the canalicular membrane of rat hepatocytes. This canalicular flippase has kinetic properties similar to those described previously in microsomes and provides a potential pathway for the translocation of bile salt dissolvable biliary phospholipids to the exoplasmic leaflet of the canalicular membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1581938764,"Steps in the hydroxylation pathway of the flavoprotein phenol hydroxylase with resorcinol as substrate have been studied by a combination of fluorescence and absorbance stopped flow techniques. In the presence of azide, a series of highly fluorescent oxygenated flavin intermediates has been observed, corresponding to those previously detected by absorbance measurements (Detmer, K., and Massey, V. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5998-6005). In addition, yet another intermediate has been found as the immediate product of the reaction of the reduced enzyme with O2. This new species is non-fluorescent in the presence of azide, but fluorescent in the absence of monovalent anions and had escaped detection in previous absorbance studies because of the similarity in its rates of formation and conversion to the next intermediate and similarity in their spectra. These two early intermediates are tentatively identified as the anionic and protonated species of the flavin C4a-hydroperoxide or, alternatively, as two conformationally different forms of the enzyme hydroperoxide. The next intermediate, previously referred to as intermediate II, is also highly fluorescent and so is considered unlikely to be due to a complex of a flavin alkoxyl radical and a substituted cyclohexadienyl radical, as proposed by Anderson et al. (Anderson, R. F., Patel, K. B., and Stratford, M. R. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1952-1957). The conversion of intermediate II to the next intermediate, intermediate III (the C4a-hydroxyflavin), is characterized by a large substrate deuterium isotope effect in the 320-390 nm range, but not by fluorescence or by absorbance at wavelengths > 400 nm. This is ascribed to dissociation from the enzyme of a cyclohexadienone product, leaving the enzyme in its C4a-hydroxyflavin form. The latter eliminates H2O to re-form oxidized flavin, but in a competing reaction, in the presence of excess substrate, forms a very stable complex, which decays orders of magnitude more slowly than the uncomplexed enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1497157754,"Biosynthesis of apolipophorins of high density lipophorin of the locust Locusta migratoria was studied in vitro. Analysis of immunoprecipitates from homogenates of in vitro labeled fat body revealed a common precursor for apolipophorin I (apoLp-I, M(r) 220,000) and apolipophorin II (apoLp-II, M(r) 72,000) with a molecular mass of approximately 280 kDa. Pulsechase experiments showed that this high molecular mass precursor is cleaved into apoLp-I and apoLp-II which subsequently are secreted as high density lipophorin from the fat body. The time required for the complete synthesis and secretion was estimated to be approximately 35 min. Both apolipophorins are glycoproteins as demonstrated by the incorporation of [3H]mannose. Treatment of [3H]mannose-labeled apolipophorin with endoglycosidase H resulted in the complete removal of the incorporated [3H]mannose. Endoglycosidase H treatment of [3H]leucine-labeled apolipophorins caused a reduction in molecular mass of approximately 3 kDa for apoLp-I and 3.5 kDa for apoLp-II, suggesting the N-linked carbohydrate content to be 1-2 and 5%, respectively. Incubation of fat body tissue in the presence of low concentrations of tunicamycin led to the synthesis and release of nonglycosylated apolipophorins."
https://openalex.org/W1566636695,"An important feedback mechanism in blood coagulation is supplied by the protein C/protein S anticoagulant pathway. In this study we demonstrate that the binding of human protein S to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) is required for the expression of cofactor activity of protein S toward factor Va inactivation by activated protein C (APC). The initial rate of endothelial cell-mediated factor Va inactivation was 21.7 pM factor Va/50 pM APC min-1, which could be enhanced twice at a protein S concentration of 5 nM. This increase appeared to be specific for protein S because it could be inhibited by C4b-binding protein and polyclonal antibodies against protein S. Furthermore, thrombin-cleaved protein S did not accelerate factor Va inactivation by APC on endothelial cells. The binding of 125I-protein S to endothelial cells was time-dependent, specific, saturable, and required the presence of calcium ions. Scatchard analysis revealed (8.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(5) binding sites per cell with an apparent Kd of 24.4 +/- 2.2 nM. To study the physiological importance of the binding of protein S to human endothelial cells, seven monoclonal antibodies were examined for their ability to influence the protein S cofactor activity and binding capacity. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain and the thrombin-sensitive region of protein S completely inhibited the protein S cofactor function in factor Va inactivation by APC on HUVECs. These monoclonal antibodies also inhibited 125I-protein S binding to HUVECs. Another monoclonal antibody, directed against an epitope on the third and/or fourth epidermal growth factor-like region, did not influence either protein S cofactor activity or binding of protein S to HUVECs. We conclude that binding of protein S to HUVECs is essential for the expression of its cofactor activity for APC. At least two regions in protein S, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain and the thrombin-sensitive region, are involved in the expression of cofactor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1568298634,"The unoccupied insulin receptor is a structurally symmetric, disulfide-linked dimer, comprising two alpha beta halves, each with a potential insulin binding alpha subunit and a kinase active beta subunit. In the accompanying paper (Shoelson, S. E., Lee, J., Lynch, C. S., Backer, J. M., and Pilch, P. F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4085-4091), we described the utility of a novel insulin analogue, L-benzoylphenylalanineB25,B29 epsilon-biotin insulin (BBpa insulin)1 as a probe for receptor behavior, and we determined that binding and cross-linking of one BBpa insulin molecule could fully stimulate insulin receptor autophosphorylation. Here we use this analogue to determine the symmetry of the autophosphorylation reaction. The alpha beta half-receptor that does not covalently couple to BBpa insulin incorporates 50% more orthophosphate than the alpha beta half that becomes coupled to the insulin analogue. Phosphopeptide mapping of each receptor half shows minimal differences in the phosphorylation sites or their relative contribution to the phosphate content of each half. The kinetics of 32P incorporation into each receptor half are essentially identical over a 10-20-min time course. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis reveals that the phosphate incorporation patterns do not change between the two alpha beta half-receptor forms (BBpa insulin-linked and unlinked, respectively) at different time points or concentrations of ATP ranging from 12 to 200 microM. Based on these and other data, we propose a model of insulin receptor activation whereby binding of one insulin molecule can trigger autophosphorylation in an asymmetric fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1568989609,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase (HL) catalyzes the final step of ketogenesis, an important pathway of mammalian energy metabolism. HL deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error in man leading to episodes of hypoglycemia and coma. Using the N-terminal peptide sequence of purified chicken liver HL, we designed degenerate sequence primers and amplified an 89-base pair (bp) chicken liver HL cDNA fragment. Longer cDNA clones for chicken (1384 bp) and human (1575 bp) HL were obtained by library screening. The peptide sequence predicted from the chicken clone contains two peptides from purified chicken HL. Mature human and chicken HL are 298-residue peptides. The sequence of the human clone predicts a 27-residue mitochondrial leader and a 31.6-kDa mature HL peptide. Human fibroblast and liver RNA contain a single 1.7-kilobase HL message. Two Acadian French-Canadian siblings with HL deficiency were homozygous for a 2-base pair deletion within the Ser-69 codon (S69fs(-2)), predicted to result in a truncated nonfunctional HL peptide lacking a complete active site. S69fs(-2) was not present in 12 other HL-deficient patients of 10 other ethnic origins, showing that HL deficiency is genetically heterogeneous."
https://openalex.org/W1538862365,"Stimulation of fibroblasts with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) led to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins, including a major substrate of 90 kDa. The methyltransferase inhibitor 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) was found to be a specific inhibitor of bFGF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts, blocking both receptor autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. MTA had no effect on either epidermal growth factor- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts. MTA also inhibited both bFGF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. MTA was a specific inhibitor of bFGF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation only in intact cells. MTA delayed and reduced, but did not inhibit, bFGF internalization and processing. The effects of MTA on bFGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation required only a brief pretreatment with the agent and were readily reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1652393711,"The human vinculin gene contains 22 exons ranging in size from 71 base pairs (bp) to 303 bp (average 155 bp) with the exception of exon 22 which contains 144 bp of coding sequence and 1848 bp of 3‘-untranslated sequence including two polyadenylation signals. There is a limited correlation between exon boundaries and functional domains within the vinculin molecule. The talin-binding domain in vinculin spans residues 1-258, and the first 6 exons encode residues 1-261. Similarly, the predicted boundaries of the central repeat domain (residues 259-589) are close to the boundaries of exons 7 and 12. Analysis of vinculin mRNAs in human uterus showed that alternative splicing of the gene is limited to exon 19, which encodes the 68 amino acids included in the muscle-specific isoform called metavinculin. We have determined 1.1 kilobases of sequence 5‘ of the transcription start site. The vinculin promoter lacks a TATA box, but does contain six Sp1 sites, and a CArG box at position -262 which forms the core of the serum response element found in immediate-early response genes. Expression of a vinculin promoter/CAT construct is serum-inducible in NIH3T3 cells demonstrating that the promoter does contain a functional serum response element."
https://openalex.org/W1582973073,"Recombinant human 125I-interleukin-6 (IL-6) was cross-linked with the homobifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate to human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Three recombinant human 125I-IL-6-containing complexes of apparent molecular masses of 100, 120, and 200 kDa were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies to human IL-6 or to the 80-kDa IL-6 receptor subunit. We show by immunoprecipitation, peptide mapping, and by the use of a cleavable heterobifunctional cross-linker (Denny-Jaffe reagent) that different polypeptides are involved in the formation of the 100- and 120-kDa IL-6-containing complexes. The molecular compositions of the 100- and 120-kDa cross-linked complexes were identified. The 100-kDa complex consisted of one ligand and one IL-6 receptor subunit, glycoprotein 80 (gp80), whereas the 120-kDa complex was found to be composed of one ligand and a polypeptide which was immunoprecipitable with the monoclonal antibody AM64 directed against gp130. Exposure of HepG2 cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or PMA-dexamethasone led to an increase in the 80-kDa IL-6 receptor mRNA and functional receptor protein. Whereas treatment of HepG2 cells with PMA led to an increase in the formation of gp80.gp130.IL-6 complexes determined by cross-linking, no corresponding increase in high affinity binding sites was found. The existence of a third IL-6 receptor subunit present in limiting amounts on HepG2 cells is proposed to explain this discrepancy. Evidence is presented that the 80-kDa IL-6 receptor up-regulation by PMA-dexamethasone is caused by the depletion of protein kinase C since the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine mimics the effect of PMA-dexamethasone."
https://openalex.org/W1522284441,"Abstract The PriA replication protein of Escherichia coli guides the ordered assembly of the primosome, the mobile, multiprotein, bidirectional, DNA replication priming/helicase complex of which it is an integral part. Although the PriA protein is not essential for viability, primosome assembly via a PriA-dependent pathway is required for normal cellular replication and growth. The PriA protein itself is multifunctional. In addition to its role in directing primosome assembly, PriA is a site-specific, single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase (dATPase) and a 3'-->5' DNA translocase and helicase. In an attempt to assess how each individual PriA activity is related to the others (i.e. can one activity function independently of the others or are they intrinsically coupled?), a series of site-directed mutations within priA have been created. priA encodes a cysteine-rich motif, the sequence of which suggests that this region of the protein may be involved in metal binding. Biochemical characterization of three purified cysteine to glycine substitution mutant PriA proteins revealed that these mutant proteins retained their site-specific single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. However, two of the three mutant proteins were completely incapable of any helicase activity. Residual helicase activity of the third mutant PriA protein could be stimulated 3-fold by the presence of low concentrations of Zn2+ ions. Primosomes assembled with the mutant PriA proteins were also defective in both their ability to act as bidirectional helicase complexes, as well as their ability to synthesize primers for extension by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The results presented here suggest that the cysteine-rich region of PriA is indeed involved in metal binding and that single cysteine to glycine substitutions within this region result in the uncoupling of the ATPase activity of PriA from both its helicase activity and its ability to interact correctly with the DNA template and the six other primosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1589217885,"The precursor to rat mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (pmAspAT) can be expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as a fully active enzyme with remarkable trypsin resistance. Only two sites within the presequence are readily hydrolyzed (Martinez-Carrion, M., Altieri, F., Iriarte, A., Mattingly, J. R., Youssef, J., and Wu, T. (1990) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 585, 346-356). In contrast, pmAspAT freshly synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is significantly less resistant to proteolysis and is completely digested by trypsin. Extended incubation of the pmAspAT translation product slowly converts it to a species with qualitatively the same trypsin resistance as the purified pmAspAT. In addition, this species binds pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, exhibits catalytic activity, and loses its ability to be imported into mitochondria. This process appears to reflect protein folding. The rate of folding is unaffected by the addition of cofactor or the depletion of endogenous cofactor and is not significantly affected by the concentration of translation product in the reaction. Agents that decrease the availability of ATP partially inhibit the folding, whereas the sulfhydryl alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide and the detergent Triton X-100 completely prevent the conversion. Although the folding of pmAspAT in reticulocyte lysate is slow, folding is rapid once the translation product is sequestered within the mitochondria as the mature form of the enzyme. These results are presented as a model for the in vivo folding of pyridoxal-dependent, oligomeric mitochondrial precursors in the presence of cytoplasmic components and for the fate of true mitochondrial precursor proteins when not imported."
https://openalex.org/W1523193039,"Recently, a gene (dsbA) involved in the biogenesis of secreted oligomeric enterotoxins in Vibrio cholerae was described, which encodes an exported protein possessing a -Cys-Pro-His-Cys- motif similar to that found in the active sites of eukaryotic and prokaryotic thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (Yu, J., Webb, H., and Hirst, T. R (1992) Mol. Microbiol. 6, 1949-1958). Here, we report the cloning of the dsbA gene of V. cholerae and the demonstration that the encoded periphlasmic enzyme has disulfide isomerase-like activity. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of either of the 2 Cys residues to Ala in the putative active site of DsbA abolished both its isomerase activity and its capacity to promote enterotoxin biogenesis. We conclude that the Cys residues constitute the active site domain of DsbA and are essential for its activity in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1535288850,"The effect of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) on the Ca2+ transients of isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes was assessed. LDL was oxidized by a free radical generating system in vitro. The systolic Ca2+ concentration in transients was significantly increased after treatment with 100 micrograms of oxLDL cholesterol/ml for 16 min without having any effect on the diastolic [Ca2+]. However, a toxic effect was observed when the concentration of oxLDL was increased to 1,000 micrograms/ml. Cells treated with 100 micrograms of oxLDL/ml were more sensitive to the blocking action of nicardipine on the Ca2+ transient than were control cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, oxLDL failed to produce a stimulatory effect on the transient when the extracellular [Ca2+] was lowered. The malondialdehyde content in the oxLDL correlated well with the change in systolic [Ca2+] of treated cells. Lazaroid, a novel antioxidant, completely inhibited malondialdehyde formation in the oxLDL and prevented the increment of systolic [Ca2+] in the treated cells. The data indicate that oxLDL can induce relatively rapid alterations in cellular Ca2+ transients via a modification of Ca2+ entry through the L-type Ca2+ channel. LDL oxidation induced by free radicals may play an important role in influencing cardiac contractile function during pathological conditions such as ischemia/reperfusion challenge."
https://openalex.org/W1489159439,"A system is described for studying protein N-myristoylation, a eukaryotic protein modification, in Escherichia coli strains containing components of eukaryotic metabolic pathways that regulate metabolism of myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p) substrates. Three recombinant plasmids were used to simultaneously direct synthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nmt1p, a substrate protein (S. cerevisiae ADP-ribosylation factor 1, Arf1p), and one of the acyl-CoA synthetases produced by S. cerevisiae (Faa1p) in isogenic strains of bacteria with wild type or mutant alleles of genes comprising the regulon for fatty acid degradation (FadR, FadE, FadL and FadD). Incorporation of exogenous tritiated myristate into Arf1p and bacterial phospholipid biosynthetic pathways was analyzed. Removal of FadL, a 448-residue protein necessary for efficient transport of fatty acids across the outer membrane, had no detectable effect on Nmt1p-dependent N-myristoylation of Arf1p. This finding is consistent with the notion that permeation of C14:0 across the bacterial inner membrane can occur by simple diffusion. Studies of strains that contain a mutation in FadE which inhibits beta-oxidation of exogenous fatty acids, confirm that Nmt1p retains its specificity for myristoyl-CoA over palmitoyl-CoA in E. coli. A mutation that inactivates FadD, a 580-residue protein which is the only acyl-CoA synthetase produced by this bacterium, completely blocks incorporation of exogenous myristate into Arf1p. This failure to be incorporated indicates that myristoyl-acyl carrier protein, generated by inner membrane acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase, is not a substrate for Nmt1p. S. cerevisiae Faa1p can partially complement this mutant fadD allele. It can fully restore N-myristoylation of Arf1p. Faa1p can also rescue growth at 37 degrees C of fadD- strains on minimal media supplemented with C12:0, although this rescue becomes less efficient as the chain length of the supplemental fatty acid increases. In addition, S. cerevisiae Faa1p is better able to direct myristoyl-CoA to the bacteria's phospholipid biosynthetic pathways than FadD, while FadD is more efficient at directing myristoyl-CoA to the genetically engineered protein N-myristoylation pathway. Since cellular acyl-CoA synthetase activity in S. cerevisiae has been distributed to at least two functionally differentiated proteins, this system should be useful for comparing their structure-activity relationships as well as their interactions with Nmt1p in an organelle-free environment."
https://openalex.org/W1577665504,"In the isolated guinea pig diaphragm muscle, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) elicited a marked potentiation of twitch contraction evoked by direct electrical stimuli. Although tetraethylammonium (TEA) and charybdotoxin only slightly potentiated twitch contraction, 4-AP, but not TEA, also augmented a contractile response to caffeine. These effects of 4-AP on muscle contraction could not be interpreted by a simple inhibition of potassium channels on the plasma membrane. In the fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) prepared from the guinea pig psoas muscle, 4-AP inhibited the ATP-driven Ca2+ uptake from the extravesicular medium. Furthermore, 4-AP at concentrations less than 10 mM elicited a selective inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated SR ATPase in a competitive manner against the Ca2+ concentration of the medium and 10 mM 4-AP showed the unsurmountable inhibition. 4-AP at 30 mM apparently inhibited activities of other ATPases such as Na+,K+- and myosin ATPases. In contrast, other potassium channel blockers such as TEA, apamin, charybdotoxin, and glibenclamide did not inhibit the SR function. These results suggest that, although the specific concentration range is rather small, 4-AP elicits an inhibition of SR Ca(2+)-pumping activity, leading to the marked potentiation of muscle contractile responses to electrical stimuli and caffeine."
https://openalex.org/W1537437879,"The expression of a hematopoietic proteoglycan core protein (HpPG) gene is up-regulated during the early stages of myeloblast differentiation at a time point coinciding with the beginning of granule genesis (Stellrecht, C. M., Mars, W. M., Miwa, H., Beran, M., and Saunders, G. F. (1991) Differentiation 48, 127-135). The mechanism of this up-regulatory event was investigated by analyzing the expression and regulation of the HpPG gene during the differentiation of the pluripotent hematopoietic cell line, K562. The level of HpPG gene expression in these cells was up-regulated approximately 10-fold upon 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, as measured by Northern blot analysis. The HpPG gene's expression remained relatively unchanged during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, further demonstrating the specificity of this regulatory event for granule-producing cell lineages. The effect of TPA induction on HpPG gene expression was also assessed during the differentiation of the myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60. The expression of the gene was down-regulated approximately 20-fold upon TPA-induced differentiation into macrophage-like cells. In contrast, only a minimal decrease in HpPG gene expression was detected in gamma-interferon-induced monocyte differentiation. No detectable changes in expression levels were seen in HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocytes with retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide. Nuclear runoff analysis demonstrated that the regulation of the HpPG gene is under transcriptional control in both TPA-induced differentiation systems."
https://openalex.org/W2106015188,"Tetramer-dimer equilibrium of lambda repressor has been studied by fluorescence anisotropy techniques. We have chosen 1-dimethylamino naphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (dansyl chloride)-labeled repressor to study the dissociation-association equilibrium, because of relatively long life-time of the probe (> 10 ns). Polarization of the dansyl-labeled repressor decreases with decreasing protein concentrations in the range of 20 to 0.2 microM. The decrease of anisotropy was shown to be due to reversible dissociation of the protein. Size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography studies and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under native conditions (Ferguson plot) confirmed that at around 20 microM concentrations the repressor exists in predominantly tetrameric form, whereas in lower concentrations it exists in predominantly dimer form. A dissociation constant of 2.3 +/- 0.9 microM was estimated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, at 25 degrees C. A stoichiometric amount of isolated single operator shifted the tetramer-dimer equilibrium toward the dimer. Increased ionic strength had only a modest effect on the dissociation constant. The thermodynamic constants for the dissociation reaction calculated from the Van't Hoff plot was +26.6 kcal/mol for delta H and +64.7 e.u. for delta S. The rotational correlation times derived from isothermal Perrin plot indicated elongated dimers and tetramers."
https://openalex.org/W1586920366,"Abstract Calmodulin (CaM) is an integral subunit, called delta, of the phosphorylase kinase hexadecamer, and the activity of the isolated catalytic gamma-subunit of the kinase is stimulated by CaM. We report here the first analysis of functionally important features of CaM for activation of the gamma-subunit. A set of genetically engineered CaMs, in which acidic residues in each of the four E-helices of the EF-hands were changed to basic lysine residues, was used to probe the relative importance of charge features in each domain of CaM. The maximal activation of the isolated gamma-subunit was diminished by all of the charge reversal mutations. The gamma-subunit was especially sensitive to reversals in the second and third E-helix of CaM (residues 45-47 and 82-84), the latter being present in the central helix. The results suggest the functional importance of electrostatics in the interactions between the delta-subunit (CaM) and the catalytic gamma-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which is similar to results obtained with CaM-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) from chicken gizzard and CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMPK-II). However, novel features of the interaction between CaM and the gamma-subunit of phosphorylase kinase are the significant contribution of electrostatics throughout the CaM molecule, including residues in both halves and on more than one face of CaM, and the lack of a major effect of the CaM mutations on substrate kinetic parameters, unlike the effects observed with MLCK and CaMPK-II. These results are consistent with a model in which the delta-subunit (CaM) of phosphorylase kinase interacts with an extended region or multiple regions of the gamma-subunit and suggest that the mechanism of CaM activation of the gamma-subunit may have features that are distinct from those of MLCK and CaMPK-II."
https://openalex.org/W1509625360,"The chemotactic peptide fMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) induced the production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) incubated with cytochalasin B (CB). CoA-independent transacylase showed similar activity in both resting and stimulated PMN, and PAF production only occurred when lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase had been converted into the high activity form. PAF formation was coincidental with an increase of the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and with an enhanced formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol. Both fMLP-induced PAF production and the activation of lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase were diminished by propranolol. Since several molecular species of phosphatidic acid (PA) produced an inhibition of both PAF production and acetyltransferase activation on intact cells, a portion of the inhibitory effect of propranolol was related to the accumulation of PA. Furthermore, whereas CB increased both the extent and the duration of the fMLP-induced [Ca2+]i transient, propranolol was found to inhibit the CB-induced increase of the [Ca2+]i transient. These data indicate that both the attenuation of [Ca2+]i transient and the accumulation of PA may operate as termination signals for PAF production by actin on lyso-PAF:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1529599978,"The binding of L-tryptophan to Escherichia coli tryptophan aporepressor enables the holorepressor complex to bind operator DNA tightly. The side chain of residue alanine 77 is located in one of the most flexible regions of Trp repressor, between residues critical for binding DNA. Codon-directed mutagenesis was used to make genes encoding mutant Trp repressors with each of the 19 naturally occurring amino acid changes of Ala77. The 19 mutant proteins are made at the same steady-state levels as wild type. Sensitive challenge phage assays show that 7 of the 19 mutant proteins (Cys, Ser, Val, Leu, Thr, Ile, and Lys) are more active than wild-type protein when tryptophan is limiting in vivo. Among these 7 mutant super-aporepressors, proteins with Cys and Ser changes also are super-holorepressors, because they repress better than wild-type holorepressor when tryptophan is in excess. These results and others suggest that super-aporepressors associate more poorly than wild-type aporepressor with nonspecific DNA. Consistent with this idea, these 7 changes are predicted to disrupt the tertiary structure of aporepressor, but have more limited effects on the structure of holorepressor."
https://openalex.org/W1544775656,"Mitogen activation of resting lymphocytes induces expression of high affinity insulin receptors on the plasma membrane. The mechanism underlying this effect on insulin receptor expression was examined by comparing levels of insulin receptor mRNA and protein in resting and mitogen-activated rodent lymphocytes. Analysis of RNA levels indicated that resting and concanavalin A-activated lymphocytes contained equivalent amounts of insulin receptor mRNA with predominant transcripts of 7.9 and 9.5 kilobases. Although little or no insulin binding was detectable on intact resting lymphocytes, detergent solubilization of these cells resulted in the appearance of readily detectable insulin binding activity that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibodies. Detergent-solubilized resting and mitogen-activated lymphocytes expressed equivalent amounts of insulin receptors that bound insulin with similar affinity (KD = 90 pM) and migrated on reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gels with apparent masses of approximately 130 and approximately 95 kDa. Insulin receptors from resting lymphocytes appeared to be associated with the plasma membrane since 125I labeling of intact lymphocytes radiolabeled the insulin receptor, insulin binding activity was detected in membrane fractions of hypotonically lysed cells, and trypsin treatment of intact cells destroyed > 90% of the insulin binding activity in detergent extracts. These results suggest that resting lymphocytes express insulin receptor mRNA and protein and that mitogen activation exposes cryptic insulin receptors present in the plasma membrane of resting lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1559740390,"Fifteen mutant T4 glutaredoxins (previously T4 thioredoxin) have been assayed for activity with Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase. The mutations include substitutions in the region of the active site, in the 2 cysteines, and in the 2 residues between the cysteines forming the active-site disulfide bridge. Mutant thioredoxins where substitutions have been made in charged residues around the active site show the biggest differences in activity. The positive residues Lys-13 and Lys-21 were found to be important for efficient binding to thioredoxin reductase. Substitution of the aspartic acid at position 80 with a serine produced a glutaredoxin with superior activity. This mutant glutaredoxin has earlier been shown to be more efficient than the wild type in thiol transferase activity (Nikkola, M., Gleason, F. K., Saarinen, M., Joelson, T., Bjornberg, O., and Eklund, H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16105-16112). Even the glutaredoxin P66A, where the active-site cis-proline has been substituted, could be efficiently reduced by thioredoxin reductase. Glutaredoxins lacking one or both cysteines were not active."
https://openalex.org/W1590137198,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) function as signal transducers for a variety of hormone-coupled enzyme and ion transport systems in eukaryotic cells. The expression of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (Gi) which couple their cognate receptors and effectors are regulated by cell cycle-dependent events in porcine LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells. G alpha i-2 and G alpha i-3 isoforms are detected in these cells, and like G alpha i-2 (Holtzman, E. J., Soper, B. W., Stow, L. L., Ausiello, D. A., and Ercolani, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1763-1771), we now demonstrate that G alpha i-3 mRNA and protein is coordinately expressed in these cells during differentiation. To gain further insights into these events, the porcine G alpha i-3 gene minimal promoter was characterized and found 67 base pairs upstream from the major transcription start site. The 56-base pair minimal promoter lacked TATAAA and GC boxes but did contain a sequence GGAAGTG conserved in both the human and porcine gene that could potentially bind an adenovirus E4TF1 transcription factor. In cells stably transfected with G alpha i-2 or G alpha i-3 gene 5'-flanking sequences fused to firefly luciferase cDNA reporter, temporal 10-15-fold transcriptional activation of both genes occurred before cellular polarization. Utilizing mobility shift assays which compared nuclear extracts from cells before and after cell polarization, a motif in the 5' region of the gene promoter GTACTTCCGCT was identified that bound an induced nuclear protein complex during transcriptional activation. In polarized cells complemented with the human glucocorticoid receptor, dexamethasone decreased G alpha i-2 but increased G alpha i-3 basal transcription and mRNA content 3-fold. These studies demonstrate that both G alpha i genes are dynamically regulated in LLC-PK1 cells by both growth, differentiation, and hormone signals."
https://openalex.org/W1651750842,"Reduced hirudin N-terminal fragment (Hir1-27, 4 cysteines) refolds to form two-disulfide structures. The isomer containing the native disulfide prevailed as the predominant product. The disulfide folding pathway was elucidated by trapping the intermediates with acid (4% trifluoroacetic acid). All six possible one-disulfide intermediates were detected to exist in equilibrium with molar ratio of approximately 1:1:1:0.4:0.4:0.18. These intermediates were purified and structurally characterized. They were also allowed to resume the folding by reconstituting into alkaline buffer in order to evaluate the productivity of individual intermediate along the pathway. These results demonstrate that the most productive intermediate that specifies the pathway flow is neither a well populated species nor the one that contains the native disulfides."
https://openalex.org/W1484014841,"In vitro specific transcription by the Rickettsia prowazekii RNA polymerase was investigated. The purified rickettsial RNA polymerase, in striking contrast to that of Escherichia coli, could specifically transcribe two R. prowazekii genes (ATP/ADP translocase and citrate synthase genes) and one E. coli gene (RNA-I) on negative supercoiled plasmids but not the same genes on linear plasmids. Following the specific binding of the rickettsial RNA polymerase to the translocase gene promoter on a linear plasmid, there was no detectable open complex formation. Both the E. coli and the R. prowazekii RNA polymerases worked well when poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC).poly-(dI-dC) was used as template for generalized transcription. However, the rickettsial RNA polymerase, in contrast to the E. coli enzyme, had little activity on poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), a template with a larger number of hydrogen bonds. These data indicate that the rickettsial RNA polymerase is weak, at least relative to E. coli, in the function required for the opening of DNA duplex. It appears that this operation in R. prowazekii is aided by the negative supercoiling and the high 72% AT composition of the rickettsial genome."
https://openalex.org/W1574168213,"Cartilage matrix glycoprotein (CMGP) is a disulfide-bonded 550,000-dalton protein that is synthesized by chondrocytes and ciliary epithelial cells. We have purified the protein from bovine and porcine articular cartilage and have sequenced two peptides, which both have significant homology with human ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding oxidase. Immunolocation analysis indicates that a commercial polyclonal antiserum to human ceruloplasmin reacts with bovine cartilage CMGP. Chelating columns made with copper bind CMGP from bovine cartilage extracts. CMGP is present in bovine chondrocyte membrane preparations purified from sucrose density gradients. Oligonucleotide probes have been synthesized based on the published sequence of the 3'-untranslated region and a portion of the C terminus of human ceruloplasmin and have been used to amplify a cDNA fragment from bovine cartilage and human liver libraries. CMGP demonstrates oxidase activity towards p-phenylenediamine similar to that of ceruloplasmin. These studies suggest that CMGP is closely related to, if not identical with, ceruloplasmin. It is possible that CMGP may be involved in metal transport into and/or within the chondrocyte."
