https://openalex.org/W2101969937,"Cdt1, a protein essential in G1 for licensing of origins for DNA replication, is inhibited in S-phase, both by binding to geminin and degradation by proteasomes. Cdt1 is also degraded after DNA damage to stop licensing of new origins until after DNA repair. Phosphorylation of Cdt1 by cyclin-dependent kinases promotes its binding to SCF-Skp2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, but the Cdk2/Skp2-mediated pathway is not essential for the degradation of Cdt1. Here we show that the N terminus of Cdt1 contains a second degradation signal that is active after DNA damage and in S-phase and is dependent on the interaction of Cdt1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through a PCNA binding motif. The degradation involves N-terminal ubiquitination and requires Cul4 and Ddb1 proteins, components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in protein degradation after DNA damage. Therefore PCNA, the matchmaker for many proteins involved in DNA and chromatin metabolism, also serves to promote the targeted degradation of associated proteins in S-phase or after DNA damage.

Suzuki S. Kato N. Onozawa M. Chiba K. Hashino S. Imamura M. Minami Y. Minamino N. Asaka M. J. Biol.

In apparent conflict, SCF-Skp2 complex and Cul4-DDB1 complex have both been reported to induce degradation of Cdt1 after UV irradiation (14Kondo T. Kobayashi M. Tanaka J. Yokoyama A. Suzuki S.

Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) but not in humans. In this report we identify the signal for the Skp2-independent degradation of Cdt1 and demonstrate that this signal operates through interaction of Cdt1 with PCNA and uses the Cul4/Ddb1 ubiquitin ligases. The redundancy of the two pathways in S-phase stands in contrast to the predominant use of the PCNA/Cul4/Ddb1 pathway after DNA damage. Cell Culture, Transfections, UV Treatment, Virus Infection, and Antibodies Used—293T cells and H1299 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% iron-supplemented calf serum. HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with 50 J/m2 of UV and 1 h later were lysed by directly adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer and sheared using a needle. Equal loading of proteins in immunoblots was ensured by comparing intensity of Ponceau S staining of lanes and intensity of background bands in immunoblots. To make recombinant virus, each construct was cloned into the PMXpuro vector (kindly provided by Dr. Kitamura at Tokyo University) and transfected to 293T cells with plasmids that express VSV-G envelope protein and viral gag and pol proteins (18Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the supernatant from the 293T cells was added to H1299 cells with 5 μg/ml of Polybrene, the mixture was incubated for 24 h, and then puromycin (3 ng/ml) was added to select infected cells stably expressing Cdt1 derivatives (19Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to Cdt1 was generated against the first 20 amino acids of Cdt1. To detect HA, 12CA5 monoclonal antibody or Y11 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) was used. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—A 4× HA tag was cloned into the PMXpuro vector between EcoR1 and NotI, and then the NotI site was destroyed using a fill-in reaction followed by self-ligation. A linker was cloned into BamH1 and EcoR1 to generate a multicloning site with BamH1, EcoR1, and NotI. Full-length, 1–98, and deletion mutants of Cdt1 were cloned into this vector between EcoR1 and NotI. GST tag was cloned in EcoR1 and NotI. To make 3xNLS, the NLS sequence of SV40 was cloned in BamH1 and EcoR1 three times, each time destroying the EcoR1 site and creating a new EcoR1 site. The Cdt1 fragments were cloned between BamH1 and EcoR1. 1–98K(0) was made by using PCR (20Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For in vivo ubiquitination, the 1–98 fragment of Cdt1 and a lysineless form of Cdt1 (1–98K(0)) were cloned into pcDNA3 with a 4× HA tag on the C terminus. For in vitro binding assays, full-length Cdt1 and a mutant lacking the first 20 amino acids (Δ20) were cloned into pcDNA3 with 4× HA tag on the C terminus. In Vivo Ubiquitination—1–98 or 1–98K(0) Cdt1 were transfected into 293T cells with or without a plasmid expressing His6-ubiquitin. 24 h later cells were treated with MG132 for 3 h followed by UV. 1 h later cells were lysed with lysis buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), sonicated until the lysate was no longer viscous and mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Samples were rotated at room temperature for 2 h and then washed with lysis buffer and TI buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm imidazole). 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 300 mm imidazole was added to the sample, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min and loaded onto gels. Ubiquitinated products were detected by anti HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5). Interaction of Cdt1 and PCNA—For detecting the in vivo interaction, a plasmid expressing Cdt1 with a Myc epitope tag at the C terminus was transfected into 293T cells. The cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mM Na2EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and freshly added protease inhibitor mix. The lysed cells were sonicated twice for 15 s to release chromatin-associated protein. For in vitro interaction, full-length Cdt1 or Cdt1 with a deletion of 20 N-terminal residues (Δ20) were transfected to 293T cells. 24 h later, non-chromatin associated Cdt1 was recovered by lysis in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal HA antibody. Immunoprecipitated samples were mixed with bacterial lysate that had been induced to express recombinant PCNA for 1 h (21Chen J. Peters R. Saha P. Lee P. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Wagner G. Dutta A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), washed with lysis buffer for four times, and then probed for PCNA and HA. siRNA Transfection—The day before transfection, 2 × 104 H1299 cells were plated in 6-well plates. RNA duplexes were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 160 pm RNA duplex was used for each transfection. The sequence of RNA oligonucleotide used are as follows: Cul4A, 5′-GACAAUCCGAAUCAGUACC-3′; Cul4B, 5′-AAGAACGUACCUGGUCUUCAU-3′; DDB1, 5′-ACAGAGUGGCGAGAGCAUU-3′; and PCNA, 5′-GGAGGAAGCUCUUACCAUA-3′. Cell-cycle Synchronization—To arrest cells in G2/M, cells were treated with 40 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h, rounded cells were collected by shaking them off, washed three times, and re-plated. Cells were then harvested at the indicated time point. To arrest cells in G1, cells were treated with 10 μm mevastatin for 24 h. G1 arrest was confirmed by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry. To gain further insight into the signals necessary for the degradation of Cdt1, we started mapping the regions necessary for degradation after UV radiation. H1299 cells stably expressing Cdt1 were treated with 50J/m2 UV. Full-length and 1–98 of Cdt1 were clearly degraded (Fig. 1A). We have demonstrated earlier that 1–98 of Cdt1 contains all the signals necessary for the degradation of Cdt1 (10Takeda D.Y. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23416-23423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and so further deletions were initiated on this fragment (data summarized in Fig. 2E). Because further truncation of 1–98 of Cdt1 deleted a nuclear localization signal (NLS, around residue 60) that is essential for degradation and made the protein too small to detect, we fused 3xNLS, GST, and 4× HA tags to the C terminus of every construct. Using this strategy, we found that 1–28Cdt1, 1–23Cdt1, and 1–18Cdt1 were degraded but 1–10Cdt1 was stable after UV irradiation, suggesting that residues 10–18 contributed to the UV degradation signal (Fig. 1B). The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, inhibited degradation of 1–18, suggesting that degradation of this portion of Cdt1 is dependent on the proteasome pathway (Fig. 1C). Degradation of 1–28 and smaller portions of Cdt1 were, however, not as complete as that of full-length Cdt1 or 1–98 of Cdt1, suggesting that there may be a second signal for degradation in the 28–98 region, a point that we will return to later. When determining the N-terminal limit of the degradation signal, deletion of the first 5 amino acids of full-length Cdt1 (Δ5) was sufficient to stabilize the protein after UV irradiation (Fig. 1D). Therefore the extreme N terminus of Cdt1 contained signals critical for UV-mediated degradation.FIGURE 2There are two regions responsible for Cdt1 degradation in S-phase. L.C., Exo Cdt1, and Endo Cdt1 are as defined in Fig. 1. A, both 1–28Cdt1 and 1–18Cdt1 are degraded while 1–10Cdt1 is stable in S-phase. Cell lines that express each construct were released from a nocodazole-induced mitotic block, harvested at indicated time points, and probed with anti-Cdt1 polyclonal antibody. Cells enter S-phase at 12–14 h after release from mitotic block. Upper panels show degradation of 1–28Cdt1 and 1–18Cdt1, and lower panels show degradation of endogenous Cdt1. B, 5–28Cdt1 is stable in S-phase. Details are the same as those in Fig. 2A. C, Δ5Cdt1 is degraded in S-phase, indicating that sequences C-terminal to residue 28 provide a second mode of degradation in S-phase. Details are the same as in Fig. 2A. D, Δ5ΔCy and Δ5T29A are stable in S-phase, indicating that the S-phase degradation of Cdt1 is dependent on two redundant signals: the N-terminal signal and the Cdk/Skp2-mediated signal. Details are the same as in Fig. 2A. E, summary of key data. Full-length Cdt1 with Thr-7, Thr-29, and Cy motif is shown at the top, and mutant derivatives are shown below. +, degradation by UV or in S-phase; –, no degradation. n.d., not determined.

The link to Cdk2 and Skp2 has been published (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Cdt1 is phosphorylated after UV irradiation (14Kondo T. Kobayashi M. Tanaka J. Yokoyama A. Suzuki S. Kato N. Onozawa M. Chiba K. Hashino S. Imamura M. Minami Y. Minamino N. Asaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the single potential phosphorylation site in 1–18 of Cdt1, Thr-7, was substituted to alanine (T7A). T7A (both full-length Cdt1 and as part of 1–28Cdt1) was resistant to UV-dependent degradation (Fig. 1E). An antibody specific for phospho-Thr-7, however, did not recognize Cdt1 after radiation. In vivo labeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate also did not provide any evidence of phosphorylation of 1–28Cdt1 after UV irradiation. Mass spectrometry analysis did not pick up phosphorylation of Thr-7. These results suggested that the threonine residue itself (rather than its phosphorylation) was part of the degradation signal. We therefore focused on the sequence features near the T7 and discovered that there were a few amino acids in the N terminus of Cdt1 conserved between species (Fig. 1F), and together they resemble a potential PCNA binding motif (22Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hubscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1G). The most important feature of a PCNA binding motif is glutamine (Gln-3), a hydrophobic residue (Val-6), and two aromatic residues (Phe-9 and Phe-10). To determine the significance of the PCNA interaction motif, we mutated some of these amino acids to alanine and examined degradation of the mutants by UV (Fig. 1H). Cdt1 is completely stable when Phe-9 was substituted to alanine. Point mutation of Gln-3, Arg-5, or Val-6 also rendered Cdt1 partially refractory to degradation by UV. These results suggest that the conserved sequence near the N terminus of Cdt1 is critical for UV-dependent degradation. Next we checked whether the N-terminal degradation signal of Cdt1 was active in S-phase (Fig. 2A; summarized in Fig. 2E). Cells were released from a nocodazole-induced M-phase block, and degradation of Cdt1 was examined by immunoblotting at different time points. Because the Skp2-dependent degradation signal was dependent on phosphorylation of T29, we eliminated that pathway by focusing on 1–28Cdt1. Both 1–28Cdt1 and 1–18Cdt1 were clearly degraded in S-phase, whereas 1–10Cdt1 was stable. So the C-terminal limit of the degradation signal was between residues 10 and 18. Deletions from the N terminus indicated that 5–28Cdt1 was totally stable in S-phase (Fig. 2B), indicating that the N-terminal limit of the degradation signal was between residues 1 and 5. These results suggested that the 1–18 region of Cdt1, required for degradation after UV, is also capable of mediating degradation in S-phase. To determine whether the Skp2-dependent degradation signal downstream from residue 28 plays any role in the S-phase degradation of Cdt1, we evaluated the effect of deleting the N-terminal 5 amino acids in full-length Cdt1 (Δ5Cdt1). In contrast to 5–28Cdt1, Δ5Cdt1 was still degraded in S-phase (Fig. 2C), suggesting that residues downstream from 28 played a redundant role in Cdt1 degradation during S-phase. The F-box protein, Skp2, associates with Cdt1 when Thr-29 is phosphorylated, but full-length Cdt1 is still degraded in S-phase when the Skp2 binding site is disrupted either by a T29A mutation that removes the site of phosphorylation by cdk2 or by a Cy mutation that eliminates interaction with the cyclin and inhibits phosphorylation on Thr-29 (10Takeda D.Y. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23416-23423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cdt1 with mutation of either Cy motif (ΔCy) or Thr-29 (T29A) was degraded in S-phase, but Δ5ΔCy and Δ5T29A were stable in S-phase (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the N-terminal region and the Skp2 binding region of Cdt1 constitute independent and redundant signals for degradation in S-phase. 1–18 of Cdt1 does not have any lysine residue but is still degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway (Fig. 1C). Although ubiquitin is usually attached to the ϵ-NH2 groups of internal lysine residues, occasionally proteins with no internal lysines or mutations in all internal lysine residues were still ubiquitinated and degraded in a proteasome-dependent pathway (23Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In some cases, the attachment of ubiquitin to the free α-NH2 group at the N terminus has been shown by mass spectrometry (25Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because there is no lysine residue in residues 1–18 of Cdt1, we wondered whether the degradation of Cdt1 by UV is dependent on N-terminal ubiquitination. Because 1–18Cdt1 has a tag with internal lysine residues that may serve as receptors for ubiquitin, we made 1–98Cdt1 without any lysine residue and fused a 4× HA tag that has no lysine residue to the C terminus (1–98K(0)). 1–98K(0) was still degraded by UV irradiation, and the degradation was inhibited by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3A). Since adding large tags to the N terminus has been reported to stabilize proteins by inhibiting N-terminal ubiquitination (26Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we added His6 and 4× HA tags to the N terminus of Cdt1 (HHACdt1). HHACdt1 is partially resistant to UV-induced degradation (Fig. 3B). To confirm that 1–98K(0) Cdt1 was indeed being ubiquitinated in vivo, His6-ubiquitin was co-expressed with wild-type and K(0) versions of 1–98 Cdt1 (Fig. 3C). In the presence of His6-ubiquitin, 1–98 wt Cdt1 produces slower moving forms that are pulled down on nickel resin, indicative of protein with attached polyubiquitin chains. Even in the absence of His6-ubiquitin, the nickel resin pulls down a few high molecular weight forms of 1–98K(0). Despite these background bands, two to four additional slower moving isoforms of 1–98K(0) are seen when His6-ubiquitin is present, indicating that polyubiquitin chains are attached to 1–98K(0) Cdt1 despite the absence of any internal lysine residues. 1–98K(0) is therefore degraded by UV in a proteasome-dependent reaction, this degradation is blocked by a bulky adduct attached to the N terminus, and the protein is polyubiquitinated despite the absence of internal lysine residues. These results suggest that, although internal lysine residues in Cdt1 may be ubiquitinated, they are not essential for the proteasome-dependent degradation of Cdt1 because of ubiquitination at the N terminus. This is similar to the N-terminal ubiquitination reported for other proteins (26Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because disruption of the PCNA binding motif stabilized Cdt1 after UV irradiation, we first examined whether PCNA interacts with Cdt1. When full-length Cdt1 was transfected to 293T cells, immunoprecipitation of PCNA co-immunoprecipitated Cdt1 and this co-precipitated Cdt1 was degraded by UV (Fig. 4A). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 not only inhibited the degradation of the Cdt1 but also promoted the progressive accumulation of Cdt1 associated with PCNA suggesting the continued recruitment of Cdt1 to PCNA in the presence of DNA damage. To assay the interaction in vitro, Cdt1 was recovered independently of cellular PCNA by a different lysis procedure and mixed with recombinant PCNA in vitro. PCNA specifically associated with full-length Cdt1 but not Δ20, deleted in the N-terminal PCNA interacting motif (Fig. 4B). In a parallel study the interaction of Xenopus PCNA with Xenopus Cdt1 was shown to be dependent on the PCNA-interacting peptide of Cdt1 (27Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Specifically, the interaction of Xenopus Cdt1 with Xenopus PCNA was competitively inhibited by a wild-type PCNA-interacting peptide from the cdk inhibitor p21. In addition, point mutations in the PCNA interacting motif of Xenopus Cdt1 disrupted its interaction with PCNA. Therefore, the interaction of Cdt1 with PCNA appears to be mediated by the conserved PCNA interacting peptide at the N terminus. To determine whether PCNA was required for the degradation of Cdt1, we depleted PCNA by siRNA and checked Cdt1 degradation after UV treatment. PCNA was clearly decreased by siRNA (Fig. 4C). The degradation of endogenous Cdt1 was affected by silencing PCNA, consistent with the notion that the PCNA-dependent mode of degradation is critical after UV (Fig. 4C). 1–18Cdt1 or 1–98K(0) Cdt1 lack internal lysine residues used by the SCF-Skp2 pathway for ubiquitination. Silencing of PCNA also inhibited the degradation of these derivatives of Cdt1 after UV (Fig. 4, D and E), consistent with the hypothesis that the PCNA-dependent pathway of degradation can be mediated by N-terminal ubiquitination. One concern after PCNA siRNA is that inhibition of DNA replication might activate checkpoint pathways similar to what we have reported after ORC2 depletion (28Machida Y.J. Teer J.K. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27624-27630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the cells might arrest in G1 with low Cdk2 kinase activity. If the Cdk2/Skp2-dependent pathway was critical for Cdt1 degradation after UV, then such a G1 arrest might appear to stabilize Cdt1. To address this issue we wished to demonstrate that Cdt1 was degraded by UV even if cells are arrested in G1 with low Cdk2 kinase activity. HCT116 cells can be arrested in G1 with low Cdk2 kinase activity using the hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevastatin (29Ukomadu C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43586-43594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The propidium iodide-stained fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that the cells were indeed arrested mostly in G1 (Fig. 4F, right). Despite this arrest in G1, Cdt1 was still degraded after UV damage (Fig. 4F, left) suggesting this degradation pathway is independent of Cdk2 activity, and that the stabilization seen after PCNA depletion cannot be ascribed to a G1 arrest. The PCNA-dependent, N-terminal ubiquitination-mediated degradation of a substrate is unusual. No E3 ligase has been specifically implicated in N-terminal ubiquitination of proteins. Cul4A, Cul4B, and DDB1, however, have been reported to be involved in Cdt1 degradation by UV. As reported earlier (14Kondo T. Kobayashi M. Tanaka J. Yokoyama A. Suzuki S. Kato N. Onozawa M. Chiba K.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), DDB1 is co-immunoprecipitated with Cdt1 from cell extracts (not shown) and silencing DDB1 made full-length Cdt1 resistant to degradation after radiation (Fig. 4B). We therefore wondered whether Cul4 and DDB1 might be the E3 used by the PCNA-dependent N-terminal degradation signal. By silencing either Cul4 (-A and -B) or DDB1, both 1–98K(0) Cdt1 and 1–18Cdt1 became resistant to degradation by UV (Fig. 4C). Therefore, Cul4, DDB1, and PCNA are involved in N-terminal ubiquitination of Cdt1, although they could also contribute to the ubiquitination of internal lysines. We have shown that the N terminus of Cdt1 regulates Cdt1 degradation after UV damage and in S-phase. PCNA is involved in the UV-induced degradation of Cdt1 possibly by interacting with the N-terminal residues of Cdt1. How PCNA promotes the degradation of Cdt1 is unknown. Because DDB1 recruits Cdt1 to Cul4 (14Kondo T. Kobayashi M. Tanaka J. Yokoyama A. Suzuki S. Kato N. Onozawa M. Chiba K. Hashino S. Imamura M. Minami Y. Minamino N. Asaka M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), PCNA might stabilize the interaction, activate the catalytic function of Cul4, protect the Cdt1 from de-ubiquitination, or target the ubiquitinated Cdt1 to the proteasome. In Xenopus, Cdt1 is ubiquitinated on the chromatin in S-phase, so if Cdt1 degradation by UV also takes place on chromatin, it is tempting to speculate that PCNA facilitates the ubiquitination by bringing the Cdt1-DDB1-Cul4 complex to chromatin. Because PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated upon DNA damage (30Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), it is also possible that modified PCNA specifically interacts with Cdt1-DDB1-Cul4 complex. This study resolves the many conflicting reports of mechanisms of degradation of Cdt1. A number of reports suggested that Cy motif mediated phosphorylation of Cdt1 targets it to the SCF-Skp2 complex for ubiquitination and degradation, and yet, at least in animal cells and in Xenopus egg extracts, elimination (or absence) of the Skp2 interaction did not abrogate the degradation of Cdt1 in S-phase. On the other hand, Cul4 has been implicated in the degradation of Cdt1 in C. elegans and with DDB1 in the degradation of mammalian Cdt1 after DNA damage but not in S-phase. Our results suggest that there are at least two independent pathways for the degradation of Cdt1: a Cdk2/Skp2-dependent pathway that uses Thr-29 and ubiquitination of internal lysines and a PCNA/DDB1/Cul4-dependent pathway that uses an N-terminal PCNA-interacting motif and N-terminal ubiquitination (Fig. 2E). Both these pathways are independently capable of degrading mammalian Cdt1 in S-phase, whereas the PCNA-dependent pathway is critical for degradation after DNA damage. A direct physical interaction between PCNA and Cdt1 is required for Cdt1 destruction during DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts (27Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the PCNA-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Cdt1 is not an isolated process in Xenopus egg extracts but is seen in somatic cells in other species and utilized to degrade Cdt1 after DNA damage. N-terminal ubiquitination is a controversial process but an increasing number of proteins are reported to be degraded by this pathway. That 1–98K(0) Cdt1 is degraded by UV in a proteasome-dependent manner and is ubiquitinated in vivo and that a large tag on the N terminus inhibits Cdt1 degradation, strongly suggest that N-terminal ubiquitination is critical for Cdt1 degradation. So far, proteins such as MyoD, LMP1 (from Epstein-Barr virus), LMP2A, E7 (from human papillomavirus), p21, and Id2 have been reported to be N-terminally ubiquitinated (26Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Of these, p21 has a PCNA-interacting motif at the C terminus (31Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 32Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) so that PCNA may be essential for the N-terminal ubiquitination of this protein. Indeed a recent report implicates PCNA in the degradation of recombinant Xic1 (a p21 homolog) in Xenopus egg extracts, suggesting that this PCNA-dependent ubiquitination machinery may be important for other proteins (33Chuang L.-C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35299-35309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether there are E3 ligases that are specific for N-terminal ubiquitination versus internal ubiquitination, but our results suggest that at least the Cul4-DDB1 complex is capable of promoting ubiquitination at the N terminus, because they are essential for the degradation of 1–18Cdt1 and 1–98K(0) Cdt1, proteins that do not have an internal lysine but are still degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. In summary, our results indicate that PCNA, the ring-shaped clamp that is central for coordinating the action of a number of proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and chromatin assembly, also plays a critical role in the degradation of Cdt1. Degradation of Cdt1 is critical to ensure that licensing is restricted to once per cell cycle, and so it is interesting that two redundant E3 ubiquitin ligase pathways, Cdk2-Skp2 and PCNA-Cul4, are used to achieve this end. This is reminiscent of the redundant use of Mdm2 and E6AP for the ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and suggests that such redundancy in use of E3 ligases against specific substrates may be more widespread than currently suspected. J. H. P. discovered the stabilizing effect of T7A; U. S., W. Z., and T. S. did all remaining experiments reported. E. E. A. and J. C. W. discovered the role of PCNA in the degradation of Xenopus Cdt1 and communicated their finding as part of this collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2035737415,"Complex I of Arabidopsis includes five structurally related subunits representing γ-type carbonic anhydrases termed CA1, CA2, CA3, CAL1, and CAL2. The position of these subunits within complex I was investigated. Direct analysis of isolated subcomplexes of complex I by liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry allowed the assignment of the CA subunits to the membrane arm of complex I. Carbonate extraction experiments revealed that CA2 is an integral membrane protein that is protected upon protease treatment of isolated mitoplasts, indicating a location on the matrix-exposed side of the complex. A structural characterization by single particle electron microscopy of complex I from the green alga Polytomella and a previous analysis from Arabidopsis indicate a plant-specific spherical extra-domain of about 60 Å in diameter, which is attached to the central part of the membrane arm of complex I on its matrix face. This spherical domain is proposed to contain a heterotrimer of three CA subunits, which are anchored with their C termini to the hydrophobic arm of complex I. Functional implications of the complex I-integrated CA subunits are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2096459937,"CsoSCA (formerly CsoS3) is a bacterial carbonic anhydrase localized in the shell of a cellular microcompartment called the carboxysome, where it converts HCO3- to CO2 for use in carbon fixation by ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). CsoSCA lacks significant sequence similarity to any of the four known classes of carbonic anhydrase (α, β, γ, or δ), and so it was initially classified as belonging to a new class, ϵ. The crystal structure of CsoSCA from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus reveals that it is actually a representative member of a new subclass of β-carbonic anhydrases, distinguished by a lack of active site pairing. Whereas a typical β-carbonic anhydrase maintains a pair of active sites organized within a two-fold symmetric homodimer or pair of fused, homologous domains, the two domains in CsoSCA have diverged to the point that only one domain in the pair retains a viable active site. We suggest that this defunct and somewhat diminished domain has evolved a new function, specific to its carboxysomal environment. Despite the level of sequence divergence that separates CsoSCA from the other two subclasses of β-carbonic anhydrases, there is a remarkable level of structural similarity among active site regions, which suggests a common catalytic mechanism for the interconversion of HCO3- and CO2.

The efficiency of carbon fixation in cyanobacteria and many autotrophic bacteria is enhanced by a polyhedral microcompartment called the carboxysome.

Microbiol. 1980; 124: 185-189Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The structures of some of these shell proteins have been recently reported (6Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O. Science. 2005; 309: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is proposed that carboxysomes enhance carbon fixation by elevating [CO2] up to 1000-fold around the active site of RuBisCO, effectively saturating it with substrate. The rate enhancement afforded by this mechanism is made evident when one considers the remarkably low affinity RuBisCO has for its substrate, CO2 (Km >150 μm). The mechanism by which CO2 is concentrated in the carboxysome is not clearly understood. It is proposed that HCO3-, which is actively transported and accumulated in the cytoplasm, diffuses through the proteinaceous shell and is dehydrated to CO2 by a carboxysome-associated carbonic anhydrase. The close proximity of the carbonic anhydrase to encapsulated RuBisCO is thought to be a key factor in speeding the fixation of CO2. It is also possible that the carboxysomal shell provides a barrier to the escape of CO2 from RuBisCO.Carbonic anhydrases have been found associated with carboxysomes of the two known types: the ccm type, which appears to be limited to cyanobacteria, and the cso type, which occurs in non-photosynthetic autotrophs and in some cyanobacteria (2Cannon G.C.

Shively J.M. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 175-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are four known classes of carbonic anhydrases: α, β, γ, and δ. In the ccm-type carboxysomes, both β and γ classes were discovered. These are called CcaA and CcmM, respectively. CcaA activity co-purifies with carboxysome-enriched subcellular fractions (1Price G.D. Sultemeyer D. Klughammer B. Ludwig M Badger M.R. Can. J. Bot. 1998; 76: 973-1002Google Scholar, 2Cannon G.C.

Phycol. 2000; 36: 1109-1118Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In cso-type carboxysomes, however, sequence comparisons could not discern a gene that might encode any of the four known carbonic anhydrase classes. Classical biochemical approaches revealed carbonic anhydrase activity in the carboxysomal shell protein CsoS3 (which we rename here CsoSCA, for carboxysome shell carbonic anhydrase) isolated from homogeneous carboxysome preparations from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus or prepared by recombinant techniques (12So A.K.-C. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).Contrary to earlier predictions that placed the carboxysome-associated carbonic anhydrase into the interior of the microcompartment, CsoSCA was shown to be an integral component of the shell (12So A.K.-C.

Heinhorst, manuscript in preparation. imply that CsoSCA is not a major structural determinant of the carboxysome shell. The protein is, however, crucial for carboxysome function since this csoS3 mutant has a HCR (high CO2 requiring) phenotype.Because of its large size (57 kDa, approximately twice that of other carbonic anhydrases) and its lack of homology at the primary structure level, CsoSCA was assigned to a new (ϵ) class of carbonic anhydrase (12So A.K.-C. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the 2.2 Å crystal structure of CsoSCA from the chemoautotrophic bacterium H. neapolitanus, which suggests that the enzyme is a variant β-type carbonic anhydrase. The structure also provides clues to the catalytic mechanism of the dehydration reaction and reveals quaternary structure assemblies that may be biologically relevant in the context of carboxysome function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Cloning, overexpression, and purification of recombinant CsoSCA were performed as described for the pcsoS3ProEx-based system (12So A.K.-C. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For crystallization, purified CsoSCA with the uncleaved His tag was concentrated to 1.2 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Crystals were obtained at room temperature by hanging drop (containing 1 μl of protein plus 1 μl of reservoir) vapor diffusion over a reservoir containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 10% ethanol. The crystals indexed in space group P1 (a = 47.7 Å, b = 77.6 Å, c = 82.7 Å, α = 66.8°, β = 78.8°, γ = 79.1°) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified recombinant CsoSCA (∼1 mg/ml) was loaded at 1 ml/min over a Sephacryl S300 column (1 × 16 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl. Two peaks were observed, monitored by absorbance at 280-nm wavelength. The first peak (consisting of ∼10% of the loaded protein) likely corresponds to aggregated species, lying completely within the exclusion volume (Mr > 1.5 × 106). The second peak (having a symmetrical shape) corresponds to a dimer, eluting with an apparent Mr of 125,000. Measurements of carbonic anhydrase activity indicated that the dimer peak was active, and no other carbonic anhydrase activity was detected throughout the elution pattern. It should be noted that solutions of CsoSCA with concentrations above 1.5 mg/ml accumulated precipitated aggregates when held at 4 °C over several days, and this aggregation roughly paralleled the loss of carbonic anhydrase activity, consistent with the observation that no activity was observed in the large molecular weight fractions eluted from the gel filtration column.Structure Determination and Refinement—Potential heavy atom derivatives were screened for binding to CsoSCA using the native gel shift approach of Boggon and Shapiro (15Boggon T.J. Shapiro L. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: R143-R149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The following heavy atom compounds were identified as promising candidates for derivatization: HgCl2, mersalyl, and di-m-iodobis(ethylendiamine)diplatinum. The compounds were dissolved at 2 mm concentration in a mixture of 65% reservoir, 35% ethylene glycol for cryo-protection. Crystals were soaked at room temperature for 1 h and then flash-cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection. An iodide derivative was also prepared by dissolving 8 mg of solid KI in 100 μl of 65% reservoir, 35% ethylene glycol, and then soaking the crystal for 1 min in this solution.The x-ray diffraction data set on the native crystal was collected at the Advance Light Source beamline 8.2.2, equipped with an ADSC quantum 315 CCD detector. Derivative data sets were collected on a Rigaku FR-D rotating copper anode x-ray generator equipped with an R-axis IV++ imaging plate detector. Data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (16Otwinowsk Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Mercury sites were identified by SHELXD using isomorphous differences between the native and HgCl2 derivative data sets (17Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Turk D. Johnson L. Methods in Macromolecular Crystallography. IOS Press, Amsterdam2001: 72-81Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated with MLPHARE and later improved by density modification and two-fold symmetry averaging with DM (18Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Isomorphous and anomalous difference Fourier methods revealed the positions of the heavy atoms in the other derivatives and the location of four zinc ions in the unit cell. Phasing information from all the derivatives was combined. The model was built manually using the graphics program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Only the N-terminal residues, 1-37, and residues 145-150 (connecting the N-terminal and catalytic domains) are missing from the structural model, presumably due to disorder.FIGURE 2Structure based sequence alignment of CsoSCA and β-carbonic anhydrase homologs.

As such, the domain bears no significant structural resemblance to the numerous helical bundles deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The closest structural similarity uncovered by VAST (27Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) is with a putative signal recognition particle (Protein Data Bank ID 1WGW) in which 43 residues align with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.4 Å. An evolutionary relationship between the two could not be established with any confidence. Related β-carbonic anhydrase structures from Pisum sativum (28Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (29Cronk J.D. Endrizzi J.A. Cronk M.R. O'Neil J.W. Zhang K.Y.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) also have N-terminal helical extensions in which the helices strengthen homodimer interactions by domain swapping. In CsoSCA, the lack of contacts between the N-terminal domain and other symmetry-related molecules seems to preclude a role in oligomerization. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain is located at an isolated extremity of the protein, suggesting the possibility that it might function to anchor CsoSCA to the carboxysomal shell or to molecules of RuBisCO.Catalytic and C-terminal Domains Related by Gene Duplication and Fusion—The catalytic and C-terminal domains possess structural similarity to each other (Fig. 3C), suggesting that they arose from a gene duplication event. Sixty-one Cα atoms from the catalytic domain can be superimposed on the C-terminal domain with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.5 Å. The two domains each contain a central five-stranded mixed β-sheet with two helices flanking one side of the sheet and one helix flanking the other side. Interestingly, this latter helix, corresponding to helix K in the catalytic domain, is structurally analogous to helix D, which although tightly associated with the C-terminal domain, originates from the N-terminal part of the primary structure (Fig. 1A). The catalytic and C-terminal domains are related by an approximate two-fold symmetry axis perpendicular to the β-sheet (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3The loss of active site pairing in carboxysomal β-carbonic anhydrases. In P. sativum (A, upper panel), active site pairing is accomplished through homodimerization. Molecule A of the dimer is shown in yellow; molecule B is shown in red. Green spheres mark the location of the two identical active site zinc ions. An ellipse marks the location of a two-fold symmetry axis. Superimposed molecules A and B are shown in C, lower panel. Only the very C-terminal (C-term) tails are not superimposable (colored gray). In P. purpureum (B, upper panel), the same pairing is accomplished by a single polypeptide, not a dimer. The N-terminal (N-term) domain is shown in yellow; the C-terminal domain is shown in red. Pseudo-two-fold symmetry is still evident but is not exact (B, lower panel). Non-superimposable regions are shown in gray. Presumably, the P. purpureum carbonic anhydrase arose from gene duplication and fusion. Divergence appears minimal (70% sequence identity between domains). In A, upper panel, CsoSCA, like the P. purpureum enzyme appears to be the result of gene duplication and fusion. However, divergence between the two internal domains has progressed to the extent that the C-terminal domain has lost all active site residues that it presumably once contained. Superimposed catalytic and C-terminal domains (C, lower panel) show much larger areas of structural nonequivalence (gray).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The catalytic domain of CsoSCA bears structural similarity to numerous other carbonic anhydrases of the β-class (Fig. 1B).

These structures all contain a central five-stranded β-sheet and at least three flanking helices. Each of these homologs is approximately half the mass of CsoSCA, or roughly the same mass as an isolated catalytic domain of CsoSCA.In addition to the similarity in fold, the identity and positions of three zinc ligands are conserved in the active sites of all these β-carbonic anhydrases (Figs. 2 and 4A). Specifically, the zinc ion directly coordinates Cys-173, His-242, and Cys-253 in CsoSCA (Figs. 1C and 4B). An aspartic acid and an arginine are also structurally conserved in β-carbonic anhydrases (Asp-175 and Arg-177 in CsoSCA); these residues presumably assist in a number of catalytic steps, including substrate binding, proton shuffling, and product release.FIGURE 4Conservation of active site structure and mechanism. A, currently available structures of β-carbonic anhydrases can be divided into two groups: those in which the conserved aspartate and arginine residues are hydrogen-bonded to each other (CsoSCA, P. sativum, M. thermoautotrophicum, and Rv1284) and those in which the hydrogen bonds are broken (P. purpureum, E. coli, and Rv3588c). These are represented in dark gray and light gray, respectively. In the former group, a water molecule serves as the fourth ligand to the zinc ion. In the latter group, the aspartate plays this role. The duality of conformations suggests a conformational flexibility that might play a role in catalysis. Residue numbering corresponds to CsoSCA. B, a stereo figure showing a superpositioning of CsoSCA (light gray) and P. sativum (dark gray) enzymes. A HCO3- ion was modeled into the active site, based on similarities with the position of the acetate ion found in the P. sativum structure. Small changes in orientation of the HCO3- allowed hydrogen bonds to form between the HCO3- and zinc, His-397, Asp-175, and backbone nitrogens of Ala-254 and Ala-255.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The similarity between CsoSCA and other β-carbonic anhydrases extends beyond the active site. The homologs cited above all dimerize with a two-fold symmetry axis that coincides with the pseudo-symmetry axis relating the catalytic and C-terminal domains of CsoSCA (Fig. 3). Apparently, the catalytic and C-terminal domains of CsoSCA have maintained their relative orientations following gene duplication and fusion, despite much subsequent divergence.The carbonic anhydrase from Porphyridium purpureum bears special resemblance to CsoSCA in that it appears to have undergone a similar sequence of events in which two carbonic anhydrase domains are fused and arranged about a central two-fold axis of pseudo-symmetry (32Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5521-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). However, the extent of the divergence between gene duplicates in CsoSCA is much greater than in P. purpureum; there is 70% sequence identity between the N- and C-terminal domains of P. purpureum carbonic anhydrase but only 11% identity between the catalytic and C-terminal domains of CsoSCA (Fig. 2).CsoSCA Qualifies as a Distinct Subclass of the β-Carbonic Anhydrases—Although the structural similarities are sufficient to allow recognition of CsoSCA as a member of the β-class of carbonic anhydrases, three important differences merit qualification of CsoSCA as a member of a new, carboxysomal subclass of β-carbonic anhydrases. First, the sequence similarity between CsoSCA and the β-carbonic anhydrases is negligible; there is no statistically meaningful sequence similarity between CsoSCA and these proteins (less than 15% identity for aligned residues as compared with an average of 25% sequence identity among the remaining structurally determined β-carbonic anhydrases). The number of absolutely conserved residues among β-carbonic anhydrases decreases from 13 to 5 upon adding CsoSCA to the alignment (Fig. 2).The numerous insertions and deletions in the CsoSCA primary structure as compared with other β-carbonic anhydrases offer a second distinguishing feature of carboxysomal carbonic anhydrases. These include: a 16-residue insertion extending helix F and its following loop; an 8-residue loop insertion between strand 3 and helix G; and severe shortening of helices G and H and intervening sequence (averaging a 30-residue deletion) (Figs. 1B and 2). This last region forms part of a dimer interface in some β-carbonic anhydrases (see below). Clearly, the structural differences between CsoSCA and the other β-carbonic anhydrases are far greater than those used to distinguish the two previously identified β subclasses, “plant” (P. purpureum, E. coli, P. sativum, M. tuberculosis, Rv3588c) and “cab” (M. thermoautotrophicum, M. tuberculosis, Rv1284). Indeed, the plant and cab subclasses superimpose with an average pairwise r.m.s. deviation of 0.9 Å for 132 αC pairs, whereas CsoSCA superimposes on these carbonic anhydrases with an average pairwise r.m.s. deviation of 2.4 Å over only 81 αC pairs.Lastly, CsoSCA is distinct from the other structurally determined β-class carbonic anhydrases in that it alone has lost the two-fold symmetric pairing of active sites that most likely was once part of its heritage (Fig. 3). Active site symmetry is apparent in all species of β-carbonic anhydrases observed so far, except in CsoSCA. Active sites of carbonic anhydrases from E. coli, P. sativum, and M. thermoautotrophicum are organized as identical pai"
https://openalex.org/W2020387348,"Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is the smallest eukaryotic molybdenum enzyme consisting of a molybdenum cofactor-binding domain but lacking the heme domain that is known from vertebrate sulfite oxidase. While vertebrate sulfite oxidase is a mitochondrial enzyme with cytochrome c as the physiological electron acceptor, plant sulfite oxidase is localized in peroxisomes and does not react with cytochrome c. Here we describe results that identified oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor for plant sulfite oxidase and hydrogen peroxide as the product of this reaction in addition to sulfate. The latter finding might explain the peroxisomal localization of plant sulfite oxidase. 18O labeling experiments and the use of catalase provided evidence that plant sulfite oxidase combines its catalytic reaction with a subsequent non-enzymatic step where its reaction product hydrogen peroxide oxidizes another molecule of sulfite. In vitro, for each catalytic cycle plant SO will bring about the oxidation of two molecules of sulfite by one molecule of oxygen. In the plant, sulfite oxidase could be responsible for removing sulfite as a toxic metabolite, which might represent a means to protect the cell against excess of sulfite derived from SO2 gas in the atmosphere (acid rain) or during the decomposition of sulfur-containing amino acids. Finally we present a model for the metabolic interaction between sulfite and catalase in the peroxisome."

In addition, the kinase activity of IKKϵ contributes to the control of p65 nuclear uptake. Serines 468 and 536 are evolutionarily conserved, and the surrounding amino acids display sequence homology. Down-regulation of IKKϵ levels by small interfering RNA does not affect inducible phosphorylation of Ser536 but largely prevents Ser468 phosphorylation induced by T cell costimulation. Ser536-phosphorylated p65 is found predominantly in the cytosol. In contrast, the Ser468 phosphorylated form of this transcription factor occurs mainly in the nucleus, suggesting a function for transactivation. Reconstitution of p65–/– cells with either wild type p65 or point-mutated p65 variants showed that inducible phosphorylation of Ser468 serves to enhance p65-dependent transactivation.

These results also provide a mechanistic link that helps to explain the relevance of IKKϵ for the expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes without affecting cytosolic IκBα degradation. The NF-κB transcription factor system serves to control the expression of an extraordinarily wide array of genes in response to infections, inflammation, and other harmful situations (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). NF-κB target genes (such as immunoreceptors, cytokines, and chemokines) contribute to the innate immune response but also serve to control cell survival and proliferation (3Ben Neriah Y. Schmitz M.L. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a collective name for homo- or heterodimers composed of five different DNA-binding subunits, with the most frequently detected form being a heterodimer of p50 and p65 (RelA). The p65 subunit contains two strong, acidic transactivation domains called TAD1 3The abbreviations used are: TAD, transactivation domain; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; IP-10, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and TAD2 in its C-terminal portion (4Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A large variety of different inducers leads to NF-κB activation by activation of numerous cellular and membrane receptors, including toll-like receptors and the T cell receptor. Thus far, three major pathways mediating NF-κB activation have been identified, the so-called canonical and noncanonical pathways and the DNA damage-induced NF-κB pathway. All NF-κB activating events have in common that they lead to the proteasome-dependent generation of DNA-binding dimers (5Viatour P. Merville M.P. Bours V. Chariot A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). NF-κB signals activating the canonical pathway funnel into the IKK complex, which is composed of the enzymatically active subunits IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory subunits IKKγ/NEMO (6Yamaoka S.

Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). IKKβ-mediated Iκβ phosphorylation allows subsequent ubiquitination and proteolytic destruction of this inhibitory protein. This leads to an unmasking of the p65 nuclear localization sequence and results in NF-κB nuclear immigration, DNA binding, and gene expression. Once activated, inducible post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, or prolyl isomerization, allow the regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity (9Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 10Schmitz M.L. Mattioli I. Buss H. Kracht M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus far, eight different phosphorylation sites have been mapped for the strongly activating NF-κB p65 subunit. Three sites are contained in the N-terminal Rel homology domain, whereas five sites (Ser468, Thr505, Ser529, Ser535, and Ser536) are contained within both C-terminal TADs. Inducible phosphorylation of Ser276 and threonine 311 promotes the interaction of p65 with the coactivating acetylase CREB-binding protein/p300, thus leading to p65 acetylation and stimulating NF-κB-driven transcription. Various experimental approaches revealed that phosphorylation of serines 529, 535, and 536 serve to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcription. Expression of a p65 protein mutated in Ser529 in p65–/– cells revealed only a minor role of Ser529 in transactivation, since it only contributes to achieve the Tax-induced maximal transcriptional response (11O'Mahony A.M.

Phosphorylation of Ser535 is mediated by the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, which results in an increase of NF-κB-dependent transcription, as revealed by a phosphomimetic mutation where Ser535 was replaced by glutamic acid (12Bae J.S.

We have previously shown that phosphorylation of p65 Ser468 can be induced by T cell costimulation (13Mattioli I. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Livingstone M. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. Blood. 2004; 104: 3302-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the responsible kinase(s) is not yet known. Phosphorylation of p65 NF-κB at Ser536 couples p65 to TAFII31-mediated transcription and is mediated, dependent on the stimulus, by various kinases, including IKKα/β, RSK1, TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase-1)/NAK (NF-κB-activating kinase)/T2K (TRAF2-associated kinase), and IKKϵ (also called IKKi) (16Buss H.

Whereas NF-κB regulates IKKϵ, the role of IKKϵ for NF-κB activation remains elusive, since IKKϵ–/– cells show unchanged inducible IκBα phosphorylation and DNA binding. On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of some late NF-κB target genes, including COX-2, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) is lost in IKKϵ-deficient cells (22Kravchenko V.V.

Jurkat cells (1.5 × 107) were transfected by electroporation using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V/950 microfarads with constant amounts of DNA. Stable Jurkat cell lines were generated by cotransfection of IKKϵ-encoding plasmids or pSUPER-IKKϵ and a plasmid carrying a selection marker (pEF-Puro). After further growth in the presence of puromycin (1 μg/ml), either pools of stably selected cells were used for further experiments (small interfering RNA), or single cells were isolated by limiting dilution (Jurkat Tet-on cells). Costimulation of Jurkat cells was performed in a final volume of 500 μl (2 × 107 cells) by adding PMA (40 ng/ml) together with ionomycin (1 μm).

The pEF-p65 expression vector allowing the expression of p65 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag was constructed by standard methods, and point mutants were produced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol using partially overlapping primers (30Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). PMA and ionomycin were from Sigma. AS602868 was a kind gift from Serono International S.A. (Geneva, Switzerland). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Cells were lysed in TOTEX buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.35 m NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, equal amounts of supernatants were tested for DNA binding activity to a double-stranded, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide as described (31Hehner S.P. Li-Weber M. Giaisi M. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3829-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the free and complexed oligonucleotides were separated by electrophoresis on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel, and the dried gel was exposed to an x-ray film. Cell Extracts, Phosphatase Treatment, and Western Blotting—After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Phosphatase treatment was performed by incubating the cell extract lacking phosphatase inhibitors with 400 units of λ-phosphatase for 1 h at 30°C according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Biolabs). Equal amounts of protein contained in the supernatant were further analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking, membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, followed by protein detection using the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence system. Purification of GST-p65 and Kinase Assays—The GST-p65-(354–551) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to standard protocols. The immune complex kinase assays were done by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged IKKϵ using α-FLAG antibodies or by immunoprecipitation of endogenous IKKϵ. The precipitate was washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2). The kinase assay was performed in a final volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 40 μm ATP and 2 μg of the purified GST-p65 substrate protein. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Human 293 T cells were transiently transfected to express the hemagglutinin-tagged p65 variants. 36 h later, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and one aliquot was used to confirm correct expression of the proteins. Equal amounts of protein contained in the remaining supernatants were immunoprecipitated either with α-hemagglutinin or with control antibodies and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose and rotated for 4 h on a spinning wheel at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in Nonidet P-40 buffer and then boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and further analysis by Western blotting. Subcellular Fractionation—Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were separated upon resuspending pelleted cells in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by gentle pipetting. After incubation for 20 min on ice, 10 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and cells were lysed by vortexing. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant representing the cytosolic fraction was collected, and the pellet containing the cell nuclei was dissolved in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The Eppendorf tubes were incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged for 10 min with 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant representing the nuclear fraction was collected. IKKϵ Directly Phosphorylates NF-κB p65 at Ser468—Basal phosphorylation at Ser468 is mediated by GSK3β, whereas TNFα- and IL-1-induced phosphorylation of this site is maximal already 7.5 min after stimulation and is mediated by IKKβ (15Schwabe R.F. Sakurai H. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1758-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Ser468 is inducibly phosphorylated by T cell costimulation (13Mattioli I. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Livingstone M. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. Blood. 2004; 104: 3302-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the kinase mediating inducible phosphorylation in response to this stimulus is not known. Ser468 is contained in a sequence motif called TAD1′ that shows homology to TAD1 (4Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The relative positions of Ser536 and Ser468 within the sequence motif are conserved (Fig. 1A), raising the possibility that both sites may employ the same kinase. From all of the kinases known to mediate Ser536 phosphorylation, only IKKα/IKKβ and IKKϵ are known to be induced by T cell costimulation or by PMA and ionomycin, which mimic T cell costimulation upon protein kinase C activation and calcium release, respectively (32Tanahashi M. Yokoyama T. Kobayashi Y. Yamakawa Y. Maeda M. Fujii Y. Hum. Immunol. 2001; 62: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To compare the relative roles of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKϵ for p65 phosphorylation, Jurkat T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding these three IKKs together with very low amounts of a vector directing expression of a GFP-tagged p65 protein, allowing expression of this fusion protein at physiological levels. This experimental approach was taken, because the low transfection efficiency of Jurkat T leukemia cells hampers the analysis of the endogenous p65 protein, thus enabling the detection of the slower migrating GFP-p65 fusion protein, which is fully regulated and functional (25Schmid J.A. Birbach A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Pengg M. Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Binder B.R. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whereas expression of IKKα only slightly induced p65 Ser536 phosphorylation, IKKβ strongly triggered Ser536 phosphorylation of GFP-p65 and also of the endogenous p65 protein (Fig. 1B). IKKβ also caused a slight induction of Ser468 phosphorylation. In contrast, even faint amounts of IKKϵ potently stimulated p65 phosphorylation at serines 536 and 468 and even caused the appearance of a slower migrating p65 form (Fig. 1B). In contrast to IKKβ, the overexpression of IKKϵ failed to cause the phosphorylation of the endogenous p65, which is in complex with IκB proteins. A similar experimental approach revealed that this strong IKKϵ-induced phosphorylation could not be further enhanced by PMA/ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 1C). Is the slower migrating form of p65 due to IKKϵ-mediated phosphorylation, or is it also caused by other modifications? To address this question, extracts from cells coexpressing GFP-p65 and IKKϵ were incubated with λ-phosphatase. This treatment completely converted the slower migrating form of p65 into the faster migrating version (Fig. 1D), indicating that the upper band represents a phosphorylated form of p65. Of note, phosphorylated Ser536 occurred in the lower and in the upper band, whereas modified Ser468 was found only in the upshifted p65 form. These results raise the possibility that both phosphorylations depend on each other. To test this hypothesis experimentally, IKKϵ-mediated phosphorylation of each individual site was determined with a substrate GFP-p65 protein, where the respective other phosphorylation site was mutated to alanine. These experiments revealed full Ser468 phosphorylation in the presence of a mutated Ser536 and vice versa (Fig. 2A), showing that both sites can be phosphorylated independently from each other. Mutation of the phosphorylatable serines to alanine precluded binding of the phosphospecific antibodies, thus confirming their specificity. Next, we wanted to test whether IKKϵ phosphorylates p65 directly or causes phosphorylation upon activation of a downstream kinase. Cells were transfected to express epitope-tagged wild type or kinase-inactive forms of IKKϵ or the control protein IKKβ, followed by purification via immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays. The GST-p65-(354–551) protein was efficiently phosphorylated at Ser468 and Ser536 by IKKϵ wild type but not by the kinase-inactive IKKϵ point mutant, as revealed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 2B). These in vitro experiments also revealed that IKKϵ can cause the induction of a slower migrating p65 form. We also found a direct phosphorylation of p65 at both sites when IKKβ was used as a kinase source. In summary, these results identify IKKϵ as a kinase directly mediating p65 phosphorylation at Ser468 and Ser536.FIGURE 2IKKϵ directly phosphorylates p65 in vitro and induces the occurrence of a slower migrating p65 form. A, Jurkat cells were transfected to express GFP-p65 or various GFP-p65 mutants, where Ser468 and/or Ser536 were changed to alanine together with FLAG-tagged IKKϵ at the indicated combinations. Phosphorylation of p65 and expression of IKKϵ was analyzed by immunoblotting as shown. B, Jurkat cells were transfected with expression vectors for epitope-tagged forms of IKKβ, IKKϵ, and kinase-inactive point mutants of these kinases, respectively. After 36 h, cells were lysed, and the IKK proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) and purified from cell lysates with polyclonal FLAG or α-Myc antibodies, respectively. Subsequently, kinase activity was monitored by immune complex kinase assays (KA) using recombinant GST-p65-(354–551) as substrate. Phosphorylation of p65 was determined by immunoblotting using phosphospecific antibodies as shown. Note that IKKϵ causes the upshift also in these in vitro assays. In the control immunoblot, the α-FLAG antibody was detected first, followed by visualization of IKKβ with αMyc antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NF-κB p65 Phosphorylated at Ser468 Is Found Predominantly in the Nucleus—Following T cell costimulation, p65 phosphorylated at Ser536 is predominantly found in the cytosol (33Mattioli I. Sebald A. Bucher C. Charles R.P. Nakano H. Doi T. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6336-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the same holds true for p65 phosphorylated at Ser468 and stimulated Jurkat cells for various time periods with PMA/ionomycin, followed by subcellular fractionation into cytosolic and nuclear extracts (Fig. 3A). The Ser468-phosphorylated p65 protein was found predominantly in the nucleus, which is in contrast to the Ser536-phosphorylated p65 occurring mainly in the cytosol. Also, the kinetics revealed differences, since Ser536 phosphorylation started to vanish already 30 min after stimulation, whereas Ser468 phosphorylation displayed a delayed kinetics and was unchanged even 45 min after PMA/ionomycin treatment. To test whether the same intracellular distribution occurs when p65 phosphorylation is triggered by IKKϵ, Jurkat cells were transfected to express GFP-p65 in the absence or presence of cotransfected IKKϵ. Two days after transfection, nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared and p65 phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). Also in this setting, Ser468-phosphorylated p65 was found predominantly (but not exclusively) in the nucleus. Overexpressed IKKϵ was found in the nucleus and in the cytosol, which reflects the distribution of the endogenous kinase that is also found in both fractions (Fig. 3A). To address the question of whether IKKϵ-mediated phosphorylation of p65 Ser468 can also occur in the nucleus, we tested the effects of IKKϵ on phosphorylation of the Gal4-p65 protein, which is constitutively nuclear (26Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). IKKϵ-triggered Ser468 phosphorylation was further augmented by treatment with PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 3C). These results show that IKKϵ phosphorylates nuclear p65 that is not in complex with IκB but do not exclude the possibility that IKKϵ-mediated p65 phosphorylation can also happen in the cytoplasm. In contrast, coexpression of a kinase-inactive IKKϵ point mutant completely inhibited this inducible phosphorylation, pointing to the relevance of IKKϵ for this pathway. The Kinase Activity of IKKϵ Is Activated in Response to T Cell Costimulation—To address the question of whether the kinetics of IKKϵ activation parallels that of p65 Ser468 phosphorylation, Jurkat cells either containing or lacking the IKKγ/NEMO protein were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for various periods. Immune complex kinase assays using the immunoprecipitated endogenous IKKϵ protein as a kinase source revealed phosphorylation of the p65 substrate protein 20 and 45 min after stimulation (Fig. 4A). These data show that induction of IKKϵ kinase activity parallels p65 Ser468 phosphorylation and that IKKγ/NEMO, which is essential for the function of the IKK complex, is not important for primary IKKϵ activation at the time points analyzed. The amount of IKKϵ protein is unchanged in response to T cell costimulation and not influenced by the presence of IKKγ/NEMO (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468 Requires Its Release from IκBα—We next asked whether free or IκB-bound p65 is phosphorylated at Ser468. To address this question, Jurkat cells lacking the IKKγ/NEMO protein and thus being unable to phosphorylate IκBα and to release the p65 protein from the cytosol (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) were stimulated for various periods with PMA/ionomycin. IKKγ/NEMO-deficient cells failed to induce p65 phosphorylation at Ser468 and Ser536, whereas IKKγ/NEMO-retransfected control cells showed full phosphorylation at both sites (Fig. 5A), suggesting that only free and untrapped p65 can be phosphorylated. To substantiate this finding by an independent experimental approach, Ser468 phosphory"

Constitutive expression of Cdt1 causes DNA re-replication and is associated with the development of a subset of human non-small cell-lung carcinomas. In mammalian cells, DNA damage-induced Cdt1 degradation is catalyzed by the Cul4-Ddb1-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Critically missing from the current understanding of these two ligases in promoting Cdt1 ubiquitination is the signal(s) that recruits Cdt1 to either ligase.

In an effort to clarify the role of CDKs in regulating Cdt1 ubiquitination, we examined how CDK inhibitors may affect Cdt1 degradation during the DNA damage response. This investigation did not identify any evidence for the requirement of a CDK in regulating Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage but instead led to the unexpected finding that the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for Cdt1 degradation.

RNA Interference—All siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized with 3′-NN overhangs by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) in a purified and annealed duplex form. The sequences targeting each human gene were as follows: Ddb1, 5′-CCUGUUGAUUGCCAAAAAC-3′ and PCNA, 5′-UCAAGGACCUCAUCAACGA-3′. Opti-MEM medium (500 μl) was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (10 μl) for 5 min and then incubated with 10 μl (20 mm) of siRNA for 20 min at room temperature. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's, 10% fetal bovine serum medium (1.5 ml) was added to the mixture, and the entire 2.5 ml was added to HeLa cells cultured on a 60-mm plate at 30–40% confluence. S. pombe Genetics and Strain Construction—Strain construction, gene deletion, and epitope tagging were performed by standard genetic techniques (18.Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G.

To determine how CDK activity may affect Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage, we overexpressed the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 in HEK 293T cells and determined the steady-state levels of Cdt1 protein following UV irradiation. Overexpression of p21 considerably inhibited Cdt1 degradation following UV irradiation (Fig. 1A). Although this finding is consistent with the notion that CDK may cause Cdt1 phosphorylation and thereby promote its degradation in response to DNA damage, surprisingly, overexpression of p27 had no detectable effect on Cdt1 degradation in the same experiment. Both p21 and p27 have indistinguishable CDK substrate specificity regions in their N termini. The major difference between these two CDK inhibitors lies in their C-terminal regions; while p21 contains a PCNA binding and inhibitory domain in its C-terminal region, the C-terminal sequence of p27 plays roles in regulating the phosphorylation of p27 and stability but has no PCNA binding activity. This prompted us to determine which region in p21, the N-terminal CDK-cyclin binding or C-terminal PCNA binding sequence, is required for inhibiting Cdt1 degradation following UV irradiation. The C-terminal PCNA binding domain in p21 has been extensively characterized and residues required for the binding of p21 to PCNA have been identified (20.Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A.

Combined mutations of Met148 and Phe151 to Ala in p21 (referred to as p21ΔPCNA) completely disrupted its binding with PCNA (22.Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol.

The p57KIP2 CDK inhibitor also contains a C-terminal domain, often referred to as the QT domain, that shares sequence homology with the C-terminal PCNA binding domain of p21 and binds with and inhibits the function of PCNA (16.Watanabe H. Pan Z.-Q. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Hurwitz J. Xiong Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To further confirm the role of PCNA in regulating Cdt1 degradation, we ectopically expressed the p57QT domain and examined Cdt1 degradation following UV irradiation. Overexpression of the p57QT peptide, but not a L271A/F275A mutant peptide (referred to as p57QTΔPCNA) that cannot bind with PCNA (16.Watanabe H. Pan Z.-Q. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Hurwitz J. Xiong Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), blocked Cdt1 degradation after UV irradiation (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that inhibition of PCNA blocked Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage. These results also indicate that CDKs that are inhibited by p21 and p27 (CDK1–CDK6) are unlikely to be required for DNA damage-induced Cdt1 degradation. In the absence of DNA damage, overexpression of both p21 and p27 increased the steady-state level of Cdt1 protein, particularly the slower migrating form (Fig. 1A). This observation suggests that either a p21/p27-sensitive CDK(s) is involved in regulating Cdt1 stability during normal cell growth, or the Cdt1 increase resulted indirectly from the G1 cell cycle arrest caused by p21 or p27 overexpression. Our subsequent study was focused on the control of CDT1 stability during the DNA damage response. To obtain further evidence corroborating the function of PCNA in controlling Cdt1 degradation, we examined the distribution of these two proteins by gel filtration. Size exclusion chromatography analyses indicated that soluble (non-chromatin-associated) PCNA and Cdt1 co-eluted in a fraction at molecular mass of less than 158 kDa that is consistent with the formation in vivo of a complex containing PCNA, Cdt1 (Fig. 2A). Cul4A, on the other hand, is present in high molecular mass fractions and is not detected in the low molecular mass fractions that contain both Cdt1 and PCNA. The patterns of co-elution of Cdt1 and PCNA and mutually exclusive distribution of PCNA-Cdt1 from Cul4A are consistent with the possibility that PCNA is involved in promoting Cdt1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Cdt1 by the Cul4A ligase. Using a newly generated Cdt1 antibody (12.Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we immunopurified Cdt1 complexes from an Nonidet P-40-soluble extract and examined them by Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 2B). Cdt1-interacting proteins were identified as the polypeptides that were competed off by a molar excess of antigen peptide. In addition to a 60-kDa band that was identified as Cdt1 (see below), the only prominent polypeptides visualized were several bands clustered at a molecular mass of around 35 kDa. Mass spectrometry analyses identified, in addition to the 60-kDa Cdt1, two proteins: geminin and PCNA (Fig. 2C). The close migration of geminin and PCNA prevented us from determining the relative stoichiometric ratio of Cdt1 and these two proteins. Overexpression of p21 reduced the PCNA-Cdt1 association (Fig. 2D), suggesting that one possible mechanism by which p21 stabilizes Cdt1 is to hinder PCNA-Cdt1 association. This result, however, needs to be interpreted cautiously as the possibility remains that p21 could also impede CDT1-PCNA association by inhibiting CDK-mediated CDT1 modification. To seek in vivo evidence supporting a role of PCNA in Cdt1 degradation, we first performed RNAi-based experiments in cultured mammalian cells to determine how silencing the expression of PCNA affects the steady-state level of Cdt1 protein. Consistent with our previously published data (12.Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), knocking down Ddb1 by siRNA accumulated Cdt1 in UV-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Notably, reduction of the steady-state level of PCNA by siRNA accumulated Cdt1 following UV irradiation as well (Fig. 3A, comparing lanes 1 and 3) but did not increase Cdt1 protein level in non-irradiated cells (comparing lanes 2 and 4). The partial effect of PCNA RNAi on degradation of Cdt1 is likely due to incomplete depletion of PCNA protein. For further in vivo experiments, we utilized fission yeast, which have conserved PCNA, Cdt1, and the Cul4-Ddb1 E3 ligase. We constructed fission yeast strains expressing TAP-tagged Cdt1 under the control of its native promoters in both Ddb1+ and Ddb1Δ backgrounds. The steady-state level of TAP-Cdt1 is much higher in Ddb1Δ than in Ddb1+ cells (Fig. 3B, comparing lanes 1 and 3). This result provides the first evidence that in fission yeast Ddb1 is also involved in controlling Cdt1 degradation as in mammalian cells and that a Ddb1-mediated E3 ligase in fission yeast cells also controls Cdt1 degradation during normal cell growth in the absence of DNA damage. We then examined the level of Cdt1 in TAP-Cdt1, Ddb1Δ and TAP-Cdt1, Ddb1+ cells sustaining either inhibition of DNA replication or DNA damage. Unexpectedly, unlike DNA damage (see below), inhibition of DNA replication by treatment of cells with hydroxyurea (HU) increased, rather than decreased, the steady-state level of Cdt1-TAP (Fig. 3B, comparing lanes 1 and 2). To confirm this result, we constructed yeast strains expressing TAP-tagged Spd1 (Spd1-TAP) under the control of its native promoters in both Ddb1+ and Ddb1Δ backgrounds. Spd1 is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and is also targeted for degradation by the Cul4-Ddb1 ligase both during S phase and in response to DNA damage in S. pombe (24.Liu C. Powell K.A. Mundt K. Wu L. Carr A.M. Caspari T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25.Bondar T. Ponomarev A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, inhibition of DNA replication caused complete degradation of Spd1 and deletion of Ddb1 blocked HU-induced Spd1 degradation (Fig. 3C, comparing lanes 1 and 3). We also noted that during the normal cell cycle, the steady-state level of Spd1 is higher in Ddb1+ cells than in Ddb1Δ cells (Fig. 3C, comparing lanes 2 and 4), confirming that Ddb1 in fission yeast cells is involved in degradation of Spd1 both during normal cell cycle and when DNA replication is blocked. HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, and thus dNTP production, therefore arresting the DNA replication fork. Our results reveal a major difference between Cdt1 and Spd1 degradation during the normal cell cycle. We speculate that during S phase, Spd1 and Cdt1 are degraded before and after replication fork formation, respectively, and an additional factor(s) may contribute differently to the ubiquitination of these two proteins by the same Ddb1-mediated E3 ligase. We note that in ddb1Δ cells, Cdt1 accumulated to a much higher level (comparing lanes 1 and 3 of Fig. 3B or lanes 6 and 8 in Fig. 3D) than Spd1 (comparing lanes 2 and 4 of Fig. 3C), indicating that although Ddb1 is required for the degradation of both proteins, the level of these two proteins is regulated by an additional mechanism(s). We postulate that there may exist a feedback regulatory mechanism to repress the expression of Spd1, but not Cdt1, in ddb1Δ cells during each cycle. As a result, Cdt1 continuously accumulates to a very high level that, although not inhibiting cell growth, would contribute to deregulated DNA replication and thus genomic instability. Treatment of cells with methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), a DNA damage reagent, caused Cdt1 degradation in Ddb1+ cells (Fig. 3D, comparing lanes 3 and 4 or lanes 5 and 6) but had no effect on the steady-state level of Cdt1 in ddb1Δ cells (lanes 7 and 8), indicating that DNA damage-induced, Ddb1-mediated Cdt1 degradation had evolved as early as in yeast cells. To investigate whether PCNA is required for Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage in S. pombe, we generated a strain in which PCNA encoding gene Pcn1 expression is under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt81 promoter and TAP is tagged after the Cdt1 gene (nmt81-pcn1, Cdt1-TAP). Repression of Pcn1 expression by thiamine addition was confirmed by direct blotting with an antibody specific to PCNA (Fig. 3D, comparing lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4). Loss of PCNA had no significant effect on the steady-state level of Cdt1-TAP in the absence of DNA damage (comparing lanes 2 and 4) but blocked the degradation of Cdt1 in response to DNA damage (comparing lanes 1 and 3). Hence PCNA is required for Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage in S. pombe. Less Cdt1 was accumulated in PCNA-depleted cells than in Ddb1-null cells. This is likely because depletion of PCNA arrests the cell cycle and thus prevents further Cdt1 accumulation, while Ddb1 null cells continue to proliferate and accumulate Cdt1. In this study, we present three separate lines of evidence that collectively support a role of PCNA in mediating Cdt1 degradation by Cul4-Ddb1 in response to DNA damage. First, overexpression of the PCNA inhibitory domain of either p21 or p57, but not the CDK-cyclin inhibitory domain, blocked Cdt1 degradation in UV-irradiated cells. Second, soluble PCNA and Cdt1 co-exist in the same fractions and PCNA and Cdt1 physically associate with each other in vivo. Third, knocking down PCNA in cultured mammalian cells and repression of PCNA expression in fission yeast both block Cdt1 degradation following DNA damage. Together with the findings that Ddb1 is required for DNA damage-induced Cdt1 degradation in mammalian cells (12.Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and in fission yeast (Fig. 3D), we suggest that PCNA-dependent Cdt1 degradation by Cul4-Ddb1 ligase in response to DNA damage evolved quite early and has been conserved during evolution. Our study also raises three new questions. First, what is the exact biochemical role of PCNA in promoting Cdt1 degradation? We previously reported that Ddb1 can directly bind to Cdt1 (12.Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), suggesting that PCNA is not required for recruiting Cdt1 to the Cul4-Ddb1 ligase. Thus far, our in vitro immunoprecipitation-based Cdt1 ubiquitination assay has neither identified a significant amount of PCNA nor revealed a role of PCNA in Cdt1 ubiquitination by the Cul4-Ddb1 ligase. One factor obviously missing from these assays is subcellular localization. In particular, given that all four proteins, Cdt1, PCNA, Ddb1, and Cul4, are associated with chromatin, it is likely that Cdt1 ubiquitination may occur in situ at the site of damaged DNA on chromatin and that PCNA plays a critical role in bringing about in situ Cdt1 ubiquitination, a function that is not possible to be detected in the current in vitro assay or by reconstitution. In fact, in Xenopus, Cdt1 is degraded during the course of DNA replication on chromatin (27.Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Whether this replication-dependent Cdt1 degradation on chromatin is catalyzed by the Cul4-Ddb1 ligase or regulated by CDK remains to be determined. The second issue concerns the role of Ddb1, a factor that was initially identified as a component of a damaged DNA binding activity and has long been associated with DNA repair processes, during normal cell growth in the absence of DNA damage. Surprisingly, deletion of Ddb1 in fission yeast cells accumulated Cdt1 as well as Spd1 in non-damaged cells (Fig. 3, B–D), revealing a function of Ddb1 in controlling normal cell growth. It remains to be determined whether this function of Ddb1 is also conserved in higher eukaryotes. Related to this issue is the role of Skp2 in Cdt1 degradation. Accumulating evidence has suggested that another E3 ligase, possibly SCFSkp2, is involved in causing Cdt1 ubiquitination and degradation in mammalian cells (10.Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13.Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17283-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of multiple E3 for Cdt1 degradation, knocking down Ddb1, while accumulating abundant Cdt1 following DNA damage, was not sufficient to accumulate Cdt1 during normal cell growth (11.Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12.Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We have thus far obtained no evidence in fission yeast that would suggest the involvement of another E3 ligase in promoting Cdt1 ubiquitination. Deletion of Ddb1 accumulated Cdt1 to a very high level (Fig. 3D), arguing that if there exists another E3 ligase in fission yeast that controls Cdt1 ubiquitination, its activity must be very minor in comparison with that of Ddb1. We suggest that the Cul4-Ddb1 ligase evolved early to ubiquitinate Cdt1 both during normal cell growth as well as in response to DNA damage. Later in evolution, a separate E3 ligase evolved to either share or take over the function of Cdt1 ubiquitination during normal cell growth, but DNA damage-induced Cdt1 degradation continues to be carried out by the Cul4-Ddb1 ligase.

https://openalex.org/W1985924268,"Eukaryotic gene expression starts off from a largely obstructive chromatin substrate that has to be rendered accessible by regulated mechanisms of chromatin remodeling. The yeast PHO5 promoter is a well known example for the contribution of positioned nucleosomes to gene repression and for extensive chromatin remodeling in the course of gene induction. Recently, the mechanism of this remodeling process was shown to lead to the disassembly of promoter nucleosomes and the eviction of the constituent histones in trans. This finding called for a histone acceptor in trans and thus made histone chaperones likely to be involved in this process. In this study we have shown that the histone chaperone Asf1 increases the rate of histone eviction at the PHO5 promoter. In the absence of Asf1 histone eviction is delayed, but the final outcome of the chromatin transition is not affected. The same is true for the coregulated PHO8 promoter where induction also leads to histone eviction and where the rate of histone loss is reduced in asf1 strains as well, although less severely. Importantly, the final extent of chromatin remodeling is not affected. We have also presented evidence that Asf1 and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex work in distinct parallel but functionally overlapping pathways, i.e. they both contribute toward the same outcome without being mutually strictly dependent.

We have also presented evidence that Asf1 and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex work in distinct parallel but functionally overlapping pathways, i.e. they both contribute toward the same outcome without being mutually strictly dependent. The DNA of eukaryotic cells is compacted in the nucleus into a complex structure called chromatin. The first level of chromatin organization is formed by the nucleosome, which consists of a histone octamer core organizing ∼1.7 turns of double-stranded DNA around its surface (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). DNA that is wound around a histone octamer in a canonical nucleosome is much less accessible for most DNA-interacting factors than DNA in the linker regions between nucleosomes. It is now widely accepted not only that nucleosomes serve a structural role for the compaction of eukaryotic DNA but also that the obstructive nature of the nucleosomal histone-DNA interactions is a means to regulate the expression of genetic information (2Roeder R.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T.

Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). This mode of regulation involves changes in chromatin structure at, for example, promoter or enhancer regions. A hallmark of such regulatory changes is the switch of DNA regions from a state that is protected from nucleases to a state that is sensitive, or even hypersensitive, to nucleases. To understand the process of regulation through chromatin structure it is therefore crucial to study the molecular mechanisms that lead to the inducible generation of hypersensitive sites. To this end, the PHO5 promoter in yeast became a classical model system (5Svaren J. Hörz W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In its repressed state this promoter region is organized into four positioned nucleosomes with a short hypersensitive site in the middle. Upon activation by phosphate starvation this characteristic chromatin organization becomes remodeled into an extended hypersensitive region (6Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The promoter nucleosomes in this induced state are completely disassembled as assayed by the loss of histone DNA contacts (7Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 8Reinke H. Hörz W. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others showed that this loss of nucleosomal organization corresponds to a movement of histones away from the promoter in trans (10Korber P. Luckenbach T. Blaschke D. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10965-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 667-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), raising the mechanistic question of where the histones go. Free histones together with DNA are notoriously aggregation prone, and it is assumed that they occur in the cell mainly in complex with nucleic acids or histone chaperones (12Verreault A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1430-1438PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Histone chaperones are a diverse family of proteins that interact with various kinds of histones and probably serve mainly as histone donors and acceptors during nucleosome assembly or disassembly processes. In addition, they can have regulatory functions as in the case of the Hir proteins or Asf1 (15Osley M.A. Lycan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4204-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Sutton A. Bucaria J. Osley M.A. Sternglanz R. Genetics. 2001; 158: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histone chaperones appear to form a redundant network as yeast strains deleted in multiple histone chaperone genes are viable (13Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, histone chaperones can also be specific for certain histone variants (17Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) or for certain processes, e.g. for replication-dependent or -independent chromatin assembly (18Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol.

Chromatin remodeling complexes may work more or less specifically with, or may even contain, histone chaperones (14Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 20Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, histone chaperones are likely candidates for the histone acceptor in the process of histone eviction in trans upon remodeling of PHO5 promoter chromatin. In this study we investigated the effect of mutations in genes coding for various histone chaperones on the induction of the PHO5 gene. Of all five tested histone chaperones, only the lack of Asf1 showed an effect on PHO5 induction. The rate of chromatin remodeling was delayed, but, importantly, the final extent of chromatin remodeling and gene expression was not compromised. We also extended our study to the PHO8 gene that codes for an alkaline phosphatase and is coregulated with PHO5 by the same transactivator Pho4 (24Münsterkötter M. Barbaric S. Hörz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Barbaric S. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here as well, chromatin remodeling upon induction led to histone loss from the promoter region and Asf1 contributed to the rate of histone eviction. Because PHO8 induction is strictly dependent on Snf2 (26Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Münsterkötter M. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6407-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we conclude that Asf1 may cooperate with the remodeling complex SWI/SNF. However, Asf1 and Snf2 do not exclusively work in the same pathway, as we observed a synthetic effect of combined snf2 and asf1 mutations for the case of PHO5 induction.

Strains W303 asf1::KANr (alias MAR101), W303 cac1::TRP1, W303 hir1::HIS3, W303 hir2::HIS3, W303 hir3::HIS3, and W303 asf1::KANr, hir3::HIS3 (alias YAG120) were a gift from Alain Verreault. Strains PKY028 (wt, W303), PKY937 (asf1), and PKY1019 (asf1,cac1) were gifts from Paul Kaufman (27Sharp J.A. Rizki G. Kaufman P.D. Genetics. 2005; 171: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Strain BY4741 asf1::KANr was obtained from EUROSCARF (web.unifrankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf). Using the primers Asf1-fwd 5′-GGTGGCGTCTTTTGCTG-3′ and Asf1-rev 5′-GGAGAGGTCTCCGGTTC-3′, we generated an asf1::KANr disruption construct by PCR with genomic DNA of BY4741 asf1::KANr as template. The ASF1 gene in the strains CY337 (a ura3–52, lys2–801, ade2–101, leu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200 (28Richmond E. Peterson C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3685-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)), CY407 (CY337 snf2Δ::HIS3), and YS31 (29Svaren J. Schmitz J. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4856-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was disrupted by linear transformation with this PCR product, yielding the strains CY337 asf1::KANr, CY407 asf1::KANr, and YS31 asf1::KANr, respectively. The disruption of the locus was confirmed by genomic PCR with the above primers and digestion of the PCR product with HindIII and ClaI, thus detecting an introduced ClaI site. Plasmids pPpho8-lacZ, pPpho5v33-lacZ, and pPgal1-lacZ were as described (24Münsterkötter M. Barbaric S. Hörz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Barbaric S. Walker J. Schmid A. Svejstrup J.Q. Hörz W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4944-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose/adenine (YPDA) or in yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium supplemented with the required amino acids (high phosphate conditions), and PHO5 induction was initiated by transferring cells to phosphate-free synthetic medium (6Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Galactose induction was done as described (30Barbaric S. Walker J. Schmid A. Svejstrup J.Q. Hörz W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4944-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Functional Assays—Acid phosphatase and β-galactosidase assays were done as described (30Barbaric S. Walker J. Schmid A. Svejstrup J.Q. Hörz W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4944-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chromatin Analysis—Nuclei preparation and chromatin analysis by restriction enzymes or DNaseI as well as indirect end labeling, gel electrophoresis, and blotting procedures were as described (6Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Svaren J. Venter U. Hörz W. Methods Med.

Quantification of restriction enzyme accessibility assays was done using phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA3000, AIDA™ software). The probe for the PHO5 locus corresponds to the ApaI-BamHI fragment upstream of the PHO5 promoter (probe D in Ref. 6Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and ApaI (for DNaseI mapping) or HaeIII (for restriction enzyme accessibility) was used for secondary cleavage. The probe for the PHO8 locus corresponds to the PvuII-XhoI fragment downstream of the PHO8 promoter (25Barbaric S. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and BglII (DNaseI mapping) or BglII and EcoRV (restriction analysis) were used for secondary cleavage. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cultures of a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched by adding glycine to 125 mm final concentration. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, resuspended in HEG150 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and treated with a French Press three times at 1100 psi. This step lysed the cells and sheared the chromatin to an average size of 450 bp. Alternatively, glass beads were added and cells were lysed by shaking for 2 h in an Eppendorf shaker at 4 °C. Subsequently the glass beads were removed, and chromatin was sheared by sonication to a similar average fragment size as with the French press. Immunoprecipitation was done as described (33Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the C termini of histones H3 and H4, respectively, were gifts from A. Verreault. The anti-Pho4 antibody was commercially prepared (Abcam) using purified Pho4. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantitated in duplicates by the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system using the following amplicons: PHO5 UASp2-A, 5′-GAATAGGCAATCTCTAAATGAATCGA-3′; PHO5 UASp2-B, 5′-GAAAACAGGGACCAGAATCATAAATT-3′; PHO5 UASp2 probe, 5′-FAMACCTTGGCACTCACACGTGGGACTAGC-3′-TAM; ACT1-A, 5′-TGGATTCCGGTGATGGTGTT-3′; ACT1-B, 5′-TCAAAATGGCGTGAGGTAGAGA-3′; ACT1-probe, 5′-FAM-CTCACGTCGTTCCAATTTACGCTGGTTT-3′-TAM; PHO5 upstream ORF-A, 5′-TTATTCAATTTTAGCCGCTTCTTTG-3′; PHO5 upstream ORF-B, 5′-CAATCTTGTCGACATCGGCTAGT-3′; PHO5 upstream ORF probe, 5′FAM-CCAATGCAGGTACCATTCCCTTAGGCA-3′-TAM; PHO8 UASp2-A, 5′-TGCGCCTATTGTTGCTAGCA-3′; PHO8 UASp2-B, 5′-AGTCGGCAAAAGGGTCATCTAC-3′; PHO8 UASp2-probe, 5′-FAM-ATCGCTGCACGTGGCCCGA-3′-TAM. The Kinetics of PHO5 Induction Are Delayed in the Absence of the Histone Chaperone Asf1—In the course of our mechanistic studies of chromatin opening at the PHO5 promoter, we examined a possible role of histone chaperones in the process that leads to histone eviction in trans (10Korber P. Luckenbach T. Blaschke D. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10965-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 667-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether induction of Pho5 activity, i.e. secreted acid phosphatase activity, was impaired in strains that are singly disrupted in various of the known histone chaperone genes in yeast: hir1, hir2, hir3, cac1, or asf1, as well as the double mutants asf1,hir3 and asf1,cac1 (12Verreault A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1430-1438PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). All these strains could be induced to wild type levels of Pho5 activity by overnight incubation in phosphate-free medium (Fig. 1 and data not shown). As complete remodeling of the PHO5 promoter chromatin is a prerequisite for induction of Pho5 activity (34Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Hörz W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this result shows that neither of the tested histone chaperones is essential for chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter. The histone chaperone Asf1 was recently reported to be required for remodeling at the PHO5 promoter (35Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore we compared the chromatin structure of asf1 and wild type (wt) 2The abbreviations used are: wt, wild type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ORF, open reading frame. strains by DNaseI mapping and restriction enzyme digestion, both under repressive conditions and after overnight incubation in phosphate-free medium. Under both conditions the asf1 mutant showed the same results as the wt strain (data not shown). We conclude that Asf1 is necessary neither for the assembly of the repressed state nor for chromatin remodeling upon induction. We and others observed in the past that the absence of chromatin-related factors like Gcn5 or Snf2, although not essential for chromatin opening at the PHO5 promoter, could lead to a delay in the induction process 3T. Luckenbach, S. Barbaric, P. Korber, D. Blaschke, and W. Hörz, manuscript in preparation. (7Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol.

Kladde M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3788-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We also tested this possibility for the above histone chaperone mutant strains by monitoring induction kinetics. The strain deleted in the ASF1 gene showed a marked delay in PHO5 induction (Fig. 1). An equivalent delay was observed in two other strain backgrounds if deleted for ASF1 (W303 and BY4741, data not shown). The cac1 mutant also showed a significant delay in PHO5 induction. However, by monitoring restriction enzyme accessibility during induction kinetics (see below), we found that the delay in induction was not because of retardation on the level of chromatin opening (data not shown) as was analogously observed by Adkins et al. (35Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) in histone-loss kinetics during induction of a cac2 mutant. Accordingly, the induction of phosphatase activity in the asf1,cac1 double mutant was more delayed than in either single mutant but did not show a significant further delay on the level of chromatin opening as compared with the asf1 single mutant (data not shown). All other tested mutants did not significantly affect PHO5 induction (data not shown), and we focused our further studies on the role of Asf1. The Absence of Asf1 Delays the Kinetics of PHO5 Induction on the Level of Chromatin Opening—We tested whether the kinetic effect of the asf1 mutation as measured on the level of PHO5 activity was because of a kinetic delay at the chromatin transition step. The course of chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter during induction kinetics in asf1 and wt strains was monitored by measuring the accessibility of the intranucleosomal ClaI site in the PHO5 promoter region (6Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 32Gregory P.D. Barbaric S. Hörz W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). A clear delay in nucleosome remodeling was observed (Fig. 2A). In addition, we followed the loss of histones from the PHO5 promoter region by ChIP assay either with antibodies directed against the C terminus of histone H3 in the CY337 background (Fig. 2B) or with antibodies directed against the C terminus of histone H4 in the W303 background (data not shown). The ChIP assay was internally controlled for region specificity as amplicons corresponding to an open reading frame upstream (“upstream ORF”) of PHO5 (Fig. 2B) did not detect significant changes in histone levels (7Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This chromatin assay also showed a clear delay for the asf1 strain in both cases, but after prolonged incubation in phosphate-free medium no difference between the wt and asf1 strains was observed (Fig. 2B). Therefore, both quantitative chromatin assays confirmed that the rate of chromatin opening, rather than only other steps downstream in the gene expression process, is affected in the absence of Asf1. It was shown previously that stable binding of Pho4 to its intranucleosomal binding site UASp2 requires chromatin opening (38Venter U. Svaren J. Schmitz J. Schmid A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4848-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the observed delay in chromatin remodeling should also cause a delay in Pho4 binding to the promoter. Indeed, by ChIP assay using anti-Pho4 antibodies, we found in asf1 strains that Pho4 recruitment to the promoter was equally delayed as chromatin remodeling (Fig. 2C). Equivalent results were obtained in a W303 background (data not shown). The Kinetic Delay in asf1 Strains Is Not Due to Effects Upstream of the Chromatin Remodeling Process—Previously, we took advantage of the PHO5 promoter variant 33 (Ppho5v33), in which both Pho4 binding sites are replaced by Gal4 binding sites, to control for effects that a mutation might have upstream of the chromatin remodeling step at the PHO5 promoter (30Barbaric S. Walker J. Schmid A. Svejstrup J.Q. Hörz W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4944-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 39Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Lui L. Berger S.L. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In such a variant, the same chromatin transition and resulting promoter activation take place upon galactose induction as with the wt promoter upon phosphate starvation (40Ertinger, G. (1998) The Role of Transcription Factors for Opening of the Chromatin Structure at the PH05 Promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ph.D thesis, Universität München, GermanyGoogle Scholar). Therefore, any mutation that is thought to directly affect the chromatin remodeling step should also affect the chromatin transition in this variant. The induction of the promoter Ppho5v33 through the GAL pathway was similarly delayed in an asf1 strain (Fig. 3A) as the induction of the wt promoter through the PHO pathway (Fig. 1). This delay was not because of possible effects on the GAL signaling pathway or on Gal4 activity as the induction kinetics of the GAL1 promoter was unaffected by the asf1 mutation (Fig. 3B). The asf1 strain even showed a much higher extent of final induction for the Pgal1-lacZ construct than the wild type strain (data not shown). We note that asf1 strains tend to yield higher final values than the wt strains for basal and fully induced levels of PHO5 induction (Fig. 1) or for final Pho4 binding (Fig. 2C). However, such higher expression levels are not associated with changes in the chromatin structure (data not shown) and are probably due to downstream effects on gene expression. The Combined Disruption of the SNF2 and ASF1 Genes Has a Synthetic Effect on the Induction Kinetics of PHO5—So far, no chromatin remodeler has been identified that is essential for opening PHO5 promoter chromatin. However, the absence of Snf2 leads to a marked kinetic delay in PHO5 induction3 (7Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 36Dhasarathy A. Kladde M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2698-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Neef D.W. Kladde M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3788-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating a significant role of the SWI/SNF complex in chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter. We wanted to test whether the SWI/SNF complex cooperates with Asf1 in this remodeling process and, if so, whether they function exclusively in the same pathway or whether Asf1 also has a role in the alternative pathway through which PHO5 promoter chromatin is remodeled in the absence of Snf2. We constructed an asf1,snf2 double disruption strain and compared PHO5 induction kinetics in this strain with the kinetics in the single mutants (Fig. 4A). While the kinetics of PHO5 induction were strongly delayed in the snf2 strain, the additional absence of Asf1 caused a significant further delay, showing that Asf1 contributes to the rate of the alternative, Snf2-independent remodeling process. After overnight induction, however, the final activity level of the double mutant was similar to that of the single mutants (data not shown), arguing for full opening of PHO5 promoter chromatin even in the absence of both Snf2 and Asf1. Deletion of the negative regulator Pho80 has previously been shown to lead to full opening of the chromatin structure at the PHO5 promoter even under otherwise repressive high phosphate conditions (41Schmid A. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Cell. 1992; 71: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 42O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1996; 271: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Under such conditions the absence of Asf1 had no effect, or even slightly increased Pho5 activity, and the absence of Snf2 led to a modest decrease in activity. However, the level of induction of the asf1,snf2 double mutant was strongly reduced in comparison to that of the snf2 mutant (Fig. 4B). This demonstrated again a synthetic effect of this double deletion, suggesting that under such conditions the contribution of Asf1 to chromatin remodeling becomes important only in the absence of Snf2, i.e. as part of an alternative pathway. Nonetheless, the double mutant was still able to significantly induce PHO5 in a pho80 background under high phosphate conditions as compared with the corresponding repressed PHO80 strain (compare asf1,snf2,pho80 to asf1,snf2 in Fig. 4B). The Kinetics of PHO8 Induction Are Also Delayed at the Level of Chromatin Remodeling in the Absence of Asf1—Induction of the PHO8 promoter is triggered by the transactivator Pho4 as well and also leads to a pronounced chromatin transition (25Barbaric S. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, chromatin remodeling and the induction of this promoter depend critically on the activities of Snf2 and Gcn5 (26Gregory P.D. Schmid A. Zavari M. Münsterkötter M. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6407-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), much in contrast to the chromatin transition at the PHO5 promoter. Adkins et al. (35Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that Asf1 was essential for induction of PHO8. We measured PHO8 promoter activity by using a PHO8 promoter-driven lacZ reporter gene because alkaline phosphatase activity in yeast is due not only to the PHO8 but also to the PHO13 gene product (43Kaneko Y. Toh-e A. Banno I. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 220: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PHO8 induction kinetics in phosphate-free medium were delayed in an asf1 strain, whereas the final level of activity was close to wild type levels (Fig. 5A). We have shown here that induction of the PHO8 gene also led to histone depletion in the promoter region in agreement with recently published data (35Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinetics of histone loss in asf1 strains were significantly delayed in comparison to wt strains (Fig. 5B), corresponding with the delay in promoter induction. The same immunoprecipitated DNA as in Fig. 2B was used, making additional control regions not necessary. Normalization of the data in Figs. 2B and 5B to the pre-induction values allows one to compare more directly the kinetic delay of histone loss at the PHO5 and PHO8 promoter regions (Fig. 5C). For unknown reasons, the histone occupancy at the PHO8 promoter prior to induction as measured by ChIP started off with lower absolute values in asf1 strains either by using antibodies directed against the H3 (Fig. 5B) or the H4 C terminus (data not shown). Further support for a delay of PHO8 induction on the level of chromatin opening came from restriction enzyme acce"
https://openalex.org/W2087290732,"We have previously shown that ASK1 undergoes ubiquitination and degradation in resting endothelial cells (EC) and that proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces deubiquitination and stabilization, leading to ASK1 activation. However, the mechanism for the regulation of ASK1 stability is not known. In the present study, we have shown that SOCS1, a member of suppressor of cytokine signaling, induces ASK1 degradation. SOCS1 was constitutively expressed in EC and formed a labile complex with ASK1 that can be stabilized by proteasomal inhibitors. The phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain of SOCS1 was critical for its association with ASK1. Thus a SOCS1 mutant defective in phosphotyrosine binding failed to bind to and induce ASK1 degradation. Phosphotyrosine of ASK1 was induced in response to growth factors, and TNF induced dephosphorylation and dissociation of ASK1 from SOCS1. ASK1 with a mutation at Tyr-718 diminished the binding to SOCS1, suggesting that the phosphotyrosine-718 of ASK1 is critical for SOCS1 binding. Moreover, ASK1 expression and activity were up-regulated in SOCS1-deficient mice and derived EC, resulting in enhanced TNF-induced activation of JNK, expression of proinflammatory molecules, and apoptotic responses. We concluded that SOCS1 functions as a negative regulator in TNF-induced inflammation in EC, in part, by inducing ASK1 degradation.

Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) induce EC dysfunction by disturbing normal homeostasis, relaxation, and survival by triggering signal transduction and gene transcription (1Madge L.A. Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition to the NF-κB pathway, the stress-activated MAP kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPKs have been shown to be critical for TNF-induced gene expression of proinflammatory molecules such as E-selectin and VCAM-1 (2Davis R.J.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, is an upstream activator of JNK/p38 MAPK cascades (3Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Tobiume K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that ASK1 functions as an effector in TNF-induced inflammation in EC (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin.

Berk B.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus ASK1 can be activated by almost all inflammatory stimuli such as TNF, interleukin-1, and reactive oxygen species. In contrast, anti-inflammatory factors such as antioxidants and shear stress inhibit ASK1 activity (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin.

ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein that functionally is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The C-terminal domain of ASK1 binds to the TRAF domain of TRAF2 and TRAF6 (7Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol.

We have recently shown that the association with TRAF2 followed by recruitment of AIP1 (ASK1-interacting protein-1, a Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) family protein) is required for ASK1 activation by TNF (8Zhang R.

Specifically, redox sensors Trx and glutaredoxin in reduced forms bind to ASK1 and block cytokine/stress-induced ASK1 activation (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). 14-3-3, a phosphoserine-binding molecule, binds to ASK1 specifically via Ser-967 of ASK1 and inhibits ASK1-induced apoptosis (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism by which ASK1 activity is regulated in EC is not fully understood. We have previously shown that TNF activates ASK1, in part, by dissociating preexisting complexes of ASK1 with 14-3-3 and Trx. In contrast, atheroprotective laminar flow inhibits TNF-induced ASK1 and JNK activation by preventing the release of ASK1 from 14-3-3 and Trx (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that ASK1 is a labile protein and undergoes ubiquitination/degradation in resting EC. Although cellular inhibitors such as Trx promote ASK1 ubiquitination/degradation, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF induce deubiquitination and stabilization of ASK1 (5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus regulation of ASK1 stability is a critical step in ASK1 activation. However, the mechanism for ASK1 degradation is not understood. SOCS1, a member of the SOCS family of proteins, was first identified as an inhibitor of cytokine signaling. The role of SOCS1 in T cell function has been extensively studied (14Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A.

Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). SOCS1 deletion causes perinatal lethality with death by 2–3 weeks due to uncontrolled inflammation. Introducing an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) deficiency or introducing neutralizing antibody to IFN-γ eliminates lethality, suggesting that lymphocyte-produced IFN-γ is critical to SOCS1-associated perinatal lethality (15Marine J.C.

Cell. 1999; 98: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Thus SOCS1 functions as a feedback regulator in IFN-γ signaling. Mechanistic studies suggest that SOCS1 via its N-terminal domain binds to and inhibits the kinase activities of all members of JAK kinase family (JAK1–3 and Tyk2), kinases critical for signaling in many cytokines in immune cells (17Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Thus SOCS1 is generally considered as an anti-inflammatory molecule by suppressing cytokine production from T cells, macrophages, and antigen presentation from dendritic cells (17Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Eight SOCS family members (CIS, SOCS1–7) have been identified and are defined by a characteristic structure composed of a highly variable N-terminal region, a central SH2 domain, and a highly conserved 40–50-amino acid motif (called SOCS box) at the C terminus. SOCS1 also functions as an inhibitor in other cytokine signaling by various mechanisms. For example, SOCS1 attenuates insulin/IGF-1 signaling by binding to the insulin/IGF-1 receptors to inhibit the receptor kinase activity and by targeting insulin/IGF-1 receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) for proteasome degradation (18Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 12: 12Google Scholar, 19Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25889-25893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Besides IFN-γ, other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and interleukin-6 also induce SOCS1 in fat and muscle tissues and inhibit insulin/IGF-1 signaling (18Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 12: 12Google Scholar, 19Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25889-25893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus SOCS1 has been implicated in inflammation-induced insulin resistance. A general model has been proposed for SOCS protein-targeted protein degradation; SOCS box contains a conserved elongin BC-binding motif (BC box) and mediates interaction with elongin BC complex. In turn, the elongin complex associates with the putative ubiquitin ligase cullin-2. Signaling proteins (e.g. JAKs) associated with the N-terminal or SH2 domains of SOCS proteins could be ubiquitinated by cullin-2 and are targeted for degradation by the proteasome (20Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 196-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. Stem Cells (Durham). 2001; 19: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that SOCS1 may also function as an inhibitor in TNF signaling. Thus SOCS1-knock-out (KO) mice or cells derived from the mice are hypersensitive to TNF (22Morita Y. Naka T. Kawazoe Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Nakagawa R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which SOCS1 suppresses TNF signaling is not known. In the present study, we have shown that SOCS1 via its SH2 domain binds to the phosphotyrosine residues on ASK1 to induce ASK1 degradation in an elongin complex-dependent manner. TNF induced dephosphorylation of ASK1 and dissociation of ASK1 from SOCS1, resulting in ASK1-JNK activation. Moreover, SOCS1-KO mouse tissues and derived EC showed increased ASK1 expression and enhanced TNF-induced ASK1-JNK activation, gene expression of proinflammatory molecules, as well as apoptotic responses. We concluded that SOCS1 functions as a negative regulator in TNF-induced inflammatory signaling in EC.

ASK1 constructs were described previously (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The mutant SOCS1, SOCS3, and ASK1 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells and Cytokines—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were from Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine Cell Culture Core, Yale University. Human recombinant TNF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at 10 ng/ml, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell Transfection—Transfection of BAEC was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 90% confluence in 6-well plates and were transfected with total of 4 μg of plasmid constructs as indicated. Cells were harvested at 36–48 h after transfection, and cell lysates were used for protein assays. Isolation of SOCS1-deficient Mouse Lung EC (MLEC)—SOCS1+/– and SOCS3+/– mice were from Dr. James Ihle (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (15Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D.

MLEC isolation was performed as we described (25Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) followed by immunoselection and immortalization modified from the protocol described by Lim et al. (26Lim Y.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Allport J.R. Zervoglos M. Connolly A.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luscinskas F.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1591-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For immunoselection, 10 μl of beads (per T-75 of mouse lung cells) were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline +2% fetal bovine serum) and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A. 10 μl (10 μg) of anti-mouse ICAM-2 or 10 μl (10 μg) of PECAM-1 were added and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed three times and resuspended in 160 μl of buffer A. Confluent mouse lung cells cultured in a T-75 flask were placed at 4 °C for 5 min and incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 3 ml of warm Trypsin/EDTA. When cells were detached, 7 ml of growth media were added. An empty 15-ml tube in the magnetic field was placed on the holder, and the cell suspension (∼10 ml) was added slowly by placing the pipette on the wall of the tube so that the cells pass through the magnetic field. Cells were incubated for 5 min, and the media were carefully aspirated. The 15-ml tube was removed from the magnetic holder, and the beads/cells were resuspended in 10 ml of media. The selected cells were plated on 0.2% gelatin-coated flasks and cultured for 3–7 days. When the cells were confluent, another round of immunoselection was repeated. Antibody Array Screening—The antibody array membranes were provided by Dr. Y. Eugene Chin (Brown University School of Medicine, Providence, RI) (27Wang Y. Wu T.R. Cai S. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 100 polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, including those against SOCS family proteins, were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (5 by 5 cm) at predetermined positions. The antibody array membranes were then incubated with 5% milk at room temperature for 2 h followed by incubation with cell lysates from BAEC in the presence or absence of HA-tagged ASK1. After incubation for 2 h, the membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnosis) for 2 h followed by three washes and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—EC (HUVEC, BAEC, or MLEC) after various treatments were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad kit. For immunoprecipitation to analyze protein interaction in vivo, 400 μg of cell lysate supernatant were precleared by incubating with 5 μg of normal rabbit serum plus protein A/G-agarose beads on rotator at 4 °C overnight. The lysates were then incubated with 5 μg of the first protein-specific antiserum (e.g. anti-SOCS1 from Medical and Biological Laboratory) for 2 h with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. The immune complexes were collected after each immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min followed by four washes with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot (Immobilon P, Millipore, Milford, MA) with the second protein (e.g. ASK1)-specific antibody (H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The chemiluminescence was detected using an ECL kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of FLAG-tagged proteins (e.g. SOCS proteins), anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was used for immunoblot. For detection of HA-tagged proteins (ASK1 and elongin B/C), anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics) was used for immunoblot. ASK1 and JNK Kinase Assays—ASK1 and JNK assays were performed as described previously (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) using GST-MKK4 and GST-c-Jun-(1–80) fusion protein as a substrate, respectively. Briefly, a total of 400 μg of cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of antibody against ASK1 or JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were mixed with 10 μg of GST-MKK4 or GST-c-Jun-(1–80) suspended in the kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP) containing 1 μl (10 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase assay was performed at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by protein transferring to a membrane (Immobilon P). The phosphorylated GST-MKK4 or GST-c-Jun-(1–80) was visualized by autoradiography. The membrane was further used for Western blot with anti-ASK1 or anti-JNK1. GST-SOCS1 Pull-down Assay—GST fusion protein preparation and GST pull-down assay were performed as described previously (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-SOCS1 fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli XL-1 blue were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 400 μg of cell lysates expressing HA-tagged ASK1 were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST-SOCS1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose in the lysis buffer. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer before the addition of boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Bound ASK1 proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. Quantitation of Apoptotic Cell—CCell killing assays were performed as described previously with a modification (5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3954-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The propidium iodide (PI) exclusion method for loss of integrity of cell membranes was used to assess viability. In brief, cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 μg/ml PI for 5 min at 37 °C and then subjected to analytic flow cytometry on a FACSort (BD Biosciences) immediately after labeling. A light scatter gate was set up to eliminate cell debris from the analysis. The PI fluorescence signal was recorded on the FL3 channel and analyzed by using CellQuest software. Phosphatidylserine translocation, which precedes loss of PI exclusion in apoptotic cell death, was assessed by an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining kit (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For nuclear morphology, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and apoptotic cell (nuclei condensation) were visualized under UV microscope. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from EC with a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) as recommended by the supplier. Total RNA was quantitated by OD at 260 using a Du-64 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). Using an equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) from EC, stimulated under various conditions, mRNA was primed with random hexamers, and cDNA was synthesized from mRNA by TaqMan reverse transcription with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CT) according to the manufacturer’s description. The final cDNA product was used for subsequent cDNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction. cDNA was amplified and quantitated by using SYBR Green PCR reagents from Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cDNA for the specific genes (E-selectin, VCAM-1, SOCS1) and 18 S rRNA were amplified by AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase using specific primers, which were synthesized by Yale Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Keck oligonucleotide synthetic facility (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The cDNA for 18 S rRNA was amplified by using a specific forward primer (5′-TTC CGA TAA CGA ACG AGA CTCT-3′) and a specific reverse primer (5′-TGG CTG AAC GCC ACT TGTC-3′). The following specific forward and reverse primers were used to amplify the gene of interest: SOCS1, 5′-TCC GTT CGC ACG CCG ATT AC-3′ and 5′-TCA AAT CTG GAA GGG GAA GG-3′; E-selectin, 5′-CAT CCA ACG AAC CAA AGA CTCG-3′ and 5′-GGC ACT TGC AGG TGT AAC TATT-3′; VCAM-1, 5′-AGT TGG GGA TTC GGT TGT TCT-3′ and 5′-CCC CTC ATT CCT TAC CAC CC-3′ The PCR reaction mixture (final volume 25 μl) contained 5 μl of cDNA, 1 μl of 10 μm forward primer, 1 μl of 10 μm reverse primer, 2.5 μl of PCR 10× SYBR Green PCR buffer, 3 μl of 25 mm MgCl2,2 μl of dNTP mix (2.5 mm dATP, 2.5 mm dCTP, 2.5 mm dGTP, and 5 mm dUTP), 0.25 μl of AmpErase UNG (1 unit/μl uracil-N-glycosylase), 0.125 μl of AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase (5 units/μl of AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase), and 10.125 μl of H2O. The PCR reaction was performed in triplicate (3 wells of C96-well plate). The reaction was amplified with iCycler iQ multicolor real time PCR detector (Bio-Rad) for 37 cycles with melting at 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min in iCycler iQ PCR 96-well plates (Bio-Rad). The relative quantification values for the interest gene expression were calculated from the accurate CT, which is the PCR cycle at which an increase in reporter fluorescence from SYBR Green dye can be first detected obtained above a baseline signal. CT values for 18 S rRNA cDNA were subtracted from CT values for the interest gene cDNA for each well to calculate –CT. The triplicate –CT values for each sample were averaged. To calculate the fold induction of the interest gene mRNA in cells treated with cytokines over control cells, the averaged –CT values calculated for control cells were subtracted from –CT values calculated for cytokine-treated cells to calculate –CT. Then, the fold induction for each well was calculated by using the 2 – (–CT) formula. The fold induction value for triplicate wells was averaged, and data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate wells. SOCS1 Binds to ASK1 and Induces ASK1 Degradation—To understand the mechanism of ASK1 degradation, we performed antibody arrays using HA-ASK1 as bait (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results showed that ASK1 interacted with several members of the SOCS protein family that have been implicated in protein degradation. This result prompted us to reason that SOCS family protein may target ASK1 to degradation machinery. We first confirmed the interaction of ASK1 with SOCS proteins by co-immunoprecipitation assays. ASK1 was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged SOCS1, -2, -3, -6, or CIS into bovine EC (BAEC). Expression of SOCS and ASK1 was determined by Western blot with anti-FLAG and anti-ASK1 antibody, respectively. SOCS proteins showed similar levels in expression (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, ASK1 expression was dramatically different in the presence of different SOCS proteins. Co-expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 significantly decreased ASK1 expression (Fig. 1b). Association of ASK1 with SOCS was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blot with anti-ASK1 antibody. SOCS1 and SOCS3 strongly bind to ASK1 (Fig. 1c). These data suggest that SOCS1 and SOCS3 might bind to ASK1 and induce ASK1 degradation. We focused on SOCS1 for further studies to determine the role of SOCS1 in ASK1 degradation. The SH2 Domain of SOCS1 Is Critical for the Association with ASK1—To define the critical domain of SOCS1 for ASK1 binding and degradation, we generated SOCS1 truncated mutants in GST- or FLAG-tagged constructs (5Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). SOCS1-DC contains a deletion of the C-terminal SOCS box, and SOCS1-DN contains a deletion of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2a). Preliminary data indicated that both SOCS1-DC and SOCS1-DN bind to ASK1 in a GST pull-down assay (not shown), suggesting that the SH2 domain might be critical for ASK1 interaction. We then mutated the Arg-105 (to Lys) within the SH2 domain of SOCS1, which has been previously shown to be critical for phosphotyrosine binding (14Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M.

To explore the role of different signaling pathways in Epo-mediated antiapoptotic effects in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we employed a prolactin receptor (PrlR)/erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) chimera system, in which binding of prolactin (Prl) to the extracellular domain activates EpoR signaling in the cytosol. On induction of apoptosis by staurosporine, Prl supports survival of the SH-SY5Y cells expressing the wild-type PrlR/EpoR chimera. In these cells Prl treatment strongly activates the STAT5, AKT, and MAPK signaling pathways and induces weak activation of the p65 NF-κB factor. Selective mutation of the eight tyrosine residues of the EpoR cytoplasmic domain results in impaired or absent activation of either STAT5 (mutation of Tyr343) or AKT (mutation of Tyr479) or both (mutation of all eight tyrosine residues). Most interestingly, Prl treatment does not prevent apoptosis in cells expressing mutant PrlR/EpoR chimeras in which either the STAT5 or the AKT signaling pathways are not activated. In contrast, ERK 1/2 is fully activated by all mutant PrlR/EpoR chimeras, comparable with the level seen with the wild-type PrlR/EpoR chimera, implying that activation of the MAPK signaling pathway per se is not sufficient for antiapoptotic activity. Therefore, the antiapoptotic effects of Epo in neuronal cells require the combinatorial activation of multiple signaling pathways, including STAT5, AKT, and potentially MAPK as well, in a manner similar to that observed in hematopoietic cells.

However, recent evidence indicates that Epo provides neuroprotective effects in the damaged brain during ischemic events and neurodegenerative diseases; the EpoR is expressed in several neuronal cell lines and in hippocampal and cortical neurons of rodent and human brains (3Juul S.E.

These results suggest that, like its role in erythroid progenitor cells, Epo supports survival of neuronal cells through antiapoptotic effects. Mice null for the EpoR (EpoR-/-) or Epo or Jak2 genes die at embryonic day 13 because of a deficiency in erythropoiesis that leads to severe anemia (1Lin C.S. Lim S.K. D'Agati V. Costantini F.

No gross morphological abnormalities were identified in the brain of these mice. Suzuki et al. (23Suzuki N. Ohneda O. Takahashi S. Higuchi M. Mukai H.Y. Nakahata T. Imagawa S. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2002; 100: 2279-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) generated a transgenically rescued EpoR-/- mouse by expression of the EpoR exclusively in the hematopoietic lineage using a GATA-1 minigene cassette. These mice are grossly normal despite the fact that they do not express EpoR in nonhematopoietic tissues, including the brain. This suggests that Epo signaling might not be necessary for normal brain development but could be required to respond to stresses in adults. In the hematopoietic system, the mechanisms by which the Epo signal is linked to gene transcription have been extensively investigated. The EpoR is a member of the type I cytokine receptor family that does not contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (24Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 18-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Instead, the signal is mediated by the Janus family protein-tyrosine kinase, JAK2. Once Epo binds to the EpoR, JAK2 associated with the EpoR cytoplasmic domain rapidly becomes activated by transphosphorylation. Subsequently, several tyrosine residues in the EpoR become phosphorylated and recruit multiple signaling molecules that contain Src homology 2 domains, including signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and phospholipase C-γ. One major EpoR intracellular signaling pathway involves STAT5. After binding to the activated EpoR, STAT5 becomes phosphorylated, dissociates from the EpoR, homodimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus, where it up-regulates expression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-X (25Damen J.E.

Activation of PI 3-kinase through recruitment to the activated EpoR results in conversion of the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (29Ghaffari S.

PI(3,4,5)P3 anchors the serine/threonine kinase AKT to the plasma membrane and induces a conformational change, which consequently allows phosphorylation of AKT by two other kinases. Activation of AKT requires phosphorylation of two regulatory residues, a threonine residue on the kinase domain and a serine residue on the C-terminal hydrophobic domain (Thr308 and Ser473 for AKT1; Thr309 and Ser474 for AKT2; and Thr305 and Ser472 for AKT3). Phosphorylation of the threonine residue, mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, is essential for AKT activation, whereas phosphorylation of the serine residue enhances the AKT activity about 10-fold. Several kinases, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2, integrin-linked kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase CβII, and the Rictor-mTOR complex, were suggested to phosphorylate the serine residue of AKT (32Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar, 33Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 34Sarbassov D.D.

However, which kinase is primarily responsible for the phosphorylation of the serine residue has not been clarified. Once activated, AKT phosphorylates and inactivates members of the Forkhead transcription factor family. Subsequently, this leads to reduced expression of several apoptotic proteins that are normally activated by the Forkhead transcription factors. In hematopoietic cells, the EpoR also activates other signaling pathways, including the phospholipase C-γ and Ras/MAPK pathways (24Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol.

Studies using EpoR mutants overexpressed in EpoR-/- erythroid progenitors showed that normal erythroid differentiation was fully supported when only some of these signal proteins were activated (44Wu H.

The detailed molecular mechanisms by which Epo exerts its neuroprotective effects have not been clarified. Recent papers have suggested that the antiapoptotic activity of Epo in neuronal cells is mediated by activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathways (16Chong Z. Lin S. Kang J. Maises K. J.

Nature. 2001; 412: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) suggested that activation of the EpoR in neurons triggers cross-talk between the JAK2 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Nevertheless, the contribution of each signaling pathway downstream of the EpoR to the neuroprotective activity of Epo in the brain is not clarified and may differ in different types of neurons. We demonstrate that activation of at least the STAT5 and AKT signaling pathways is essential for the antiapoptotic activity of Epo in neuronal cells. Cell Culture—SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum using collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences). Differentiation was induced with 5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) in Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen) for 7 days. Generation of Ecotropic Receptor-overexpressing SH-SY5Y Cell Lines—SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with the plasmid pM5-EcoRneo that contains the murine ecotropic receptor cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene (46Baker B.W.

Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged human EpoR expression construct was provided by Dr. S. Constantinescu of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium. Retroviral supernatants were prepared by transient transfection of 5 μg of pMSCVpuroIRES2-EGFP or the PrlR/EpoR chimera expression construct or the HA-EpoR expression construct with 5 μg of pCL-Eco as described previously (49Marszalek J.R.

For retroviral infection, SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the mouse ecotropic receptor (clone Eco-SH-SY5Y 7) were plated on 100-mm collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) and infected with retroviral supernatants in media with 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells, indicating expression of PrlR/EpoR chimeras or the HA-EpoR, were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). For cells overexpressing PrlR/EpoR chimera, drug selection using 1 μg/ml puromycin was also applied. Once cells were sorted, integration of the correct PrlR/EpoR chimera cDNA was confirmed by genomic DNA PCR and sequencing. Surface Expression of FLAG-PrlR/EpoR Chimeras and HA-EpoR—Surface expression of PrlR/EpoR chimeras and the HA-EpoR was examined as described (50Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing PrlR/EpoR chimeras or the HA-EpoR were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mm EDTA (10 mm EDTA/PBS) and incubated for 30 min in cold PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 4% donkey serum (Blocking buffer). Cells were then incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (Covance, 10 μg/ml in Blocking buffer), washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.4% donkey serum (Washing buffer), and incubated with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (12.5 μg/ml in Blocking buffer; BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with Washing buffer and were analyzed by FACS. Median fluorescence intensities of APC for GFP-positive cells that correspond to the cells expressing PrlR/EpoR chimeras or the HA-EpoR were used for quantification. Apoptosis Analysis—Apoptosis was induced by treatment with 0.1 μm staurosporine (Calbiochem). For pretreatment, 30 pm Prl (National Hormone and Peptide Program) was added to cells 24 h prior to addition of staurosporine and removed when staurosporine was added. For concomitant treatment, 30 pm Prl was added at the same time as staurosporine. At 24 h after addition of staurosporine, cells were harvested by trypsin treatment. The cell population was then analyzed by FACS using APC-conjugated annexin V binding and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining (BD Biosciences). For quantification of the “apoptosis proportion,” both dead cell fraction and apoptotic cell fraction were calculated. Apoptosis induced by staurosporine was normalized by removing the background apoptosis detected in control differentiation medium. To facilitate comparisons, apoptosis induced by 0.1 μm staurosporine in each type of cells without Prl treatment was set equal to 1.0 (relative apoptosis proportion). For the EpoR-overexpressing cells, 25 pm Epo (Epogen®; Amgen) was used instead of Prl with the same procedures. For experiments involving LY294002 or wortmannin tests, 10 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem) or 100 nm wortmannin (Calbiochem) was added at the same time as Prl. All subsequent procedures were as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—SH-SY5Y cell lysates were prepared as described (52Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In detail, SH-SY5Y cells differentiated for 7 days were growth factor-starved for 5 h, harvested with 10 mm EDTA/PBS, treated with Prl (or Epo for the EpoR-overexpressing cells) for 10 min, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 Lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The soluble fractions of the lysates were incubated with anti-STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-AKT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-ERK 1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. The immune complexes were recovered using protein-A-Sepharose beads and eluted with NuPAGE buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins from these immunoprecipitates were separated on NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and Western-blotted using anti-phospho-STAT5 (p-STAT5, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-phosphoserine-AKT (p-Ser-AKT, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 (p-ERK 1/2, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. For experiments in Fig. 7, anti-phosphothreonine-AKT (p-Thr-AKT, Cell Signaling Technology) was used instead of anti-p-Ser-AKT antibody. For quantification of protein loading, the membranes were stripped with 0.2 m Glycine buffer (pH 2.6) and reprobed with anti-STAT5 or anti-AKT or anti-ERK 1/2 antibodies. For cells overexpressing the EpoR, cells were treated with Epo instead of Prl, and subsequent procedures were as described above. To confirm expression of FLAG-tagged PrlR/EpoR chimeras and the exogenously expressed HA-tagged EpoR, SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing PrlR/EpoR chimeras or the HA-EpoRs were harvested with 10 mm EDTA/PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. The lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (Covance). Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—SH-SY5Y cells differentiated for 7 days were growth factor-starved for 5 h, harvested with 10 mm EDTA/PBS, and treated with Prl (or Epo for the EpoR-overexpressing cells) for the times indicated in the figure legends. To isolate nuclear fractions, cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3V2O4, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)), incubated for 15 min on ice, treated with Nonidet P-40 (0.5% final concentration), and mixed vigorously. The pellets were recovered by centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were made by resuspending the nuclear pellets in hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). After 20 min of incubation on ice, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. As a positive control for NF-κB activation, nuclear extracts were made from SH-SY5Y cells treated with 50 ng/ml TNF-α (53Bui N.T. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Prehn J.H. J.

The nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-TATA-binding protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2028641698,"RUNX2 is a member of the runt family of DNA-binding transcription factors. RUNX2 mediates endothelial cell migration and invasion during tumor angiogenesis and is expressed in metastatic breast and prostate tumors. Our published studies showed that RUNX2 DNA-binding activity is low during growth arrest, but elevated in proliferating endothelial cells. To investigate its role in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation, RUNX2 was depleted in human bone marrow endothelial cells using RNA interference. Specific RUNX2 depletion inhibited DNA-binding activity as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation. Cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary with excess thymidine or in mitosis (M phase) with nocodazole. Endogenous or ectopic RUNX2 activity was maximal at late G2 and during M phase. Inhibition of RUNX2 expression by RNA interference delayed entry into and exit out of the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. RUNX2 was coimmunoprecipitated with cyclin B1 in mitotic cells, which further supported a role for RUNX2 in cell cycle progression. Moreover, in vitro kinase assays using recombinant cdc2 kinase showed that RUNX2 was phosphorylated at Ser451. The cdc2 inhibitor roscovitine dose dependently inhibited in vivo RUNX2 DNA-binding activity during mitosis and the RUNX2 mutant S451A exhibited lower DNA-binding activity and reduced stimulation of anchorage-independent growth relative to wild type RUNX2. These results suggest for the first time that RUNX2 phosphorylation by cdc2 may facilitate cell cycle progression possibly through regulation of G2 and M phases, thus promoting endothelial cell proliferation required for tumor angiogenesis.

RUNX1 may promote proliferation and cell cycle progression through G1 phase and entry into S phase by controlling the gene expression of cyclin D2, D3, and the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 in hematopoietic cells. The ability of RUNX2 to control cell growth may be the result of the activation and/or repression of RUNX target genes that affect the kinetic components of the cell cycle. RUNX2 is an integral part of the TGFβ signaling pathway. It regulates the promoter of the TGFβ type I receptor and interacts with Smad signaling intermediates to control both cell proliferation and differentiation in several developmental systems (33Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4232-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Ito Y. Miyazono K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The RUNX2 protein interacts with coactivators and corepressors through specific domains to regulate transcription of target genes (2Durst K.L. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4220-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Anglin I. Passaniti A. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 119: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RUNX2 may promote cell proliferation by interacting with histone deacetylase 6 at the carboxyl-terminal to repress the p21Cip1/Waf1 promoter in mesenchymal fibroblast and osteoblast cells (36Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification by kinases also regulates the transactivation ability of RUNX2 (37Franceschi R.T. Xiao G. J. Cell.

We have shown that the angiogenic, growth-promoting factor insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulates human bone marrow endothelial (HBME) cell proliferation and RUNX2 mRNA and protein expression through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ERK signaling pathways (41Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar, 42Qiao M. Shapiro P. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42709-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Serum deprivation of HBME cells resulted in growth arrest at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle and reduced RUNX2 protein levels and DNA-binding activity (43Sun L. Vitolo M. Qiao M. Anglin I. Passaniti A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4722-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We further found that RUNX2 overexpression increased endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, DNA synthesis, and pRb phosphorylation. In these studies, RUNX2 attenuated the ability of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) to inhibit EC proliferation, whereas a dominant negative variant of RUNX2 increased EC sensitivity to TGFβ1. RUNX2-stimulated cell proliferation was characterized by repression of the p21Cip1 cdk inhibitor at the promoter and protein levels. The goal of the current study was to determine the role of RUNX2 in cell proliferation by identifying the molecular mechanism(s) through which RUNX2 activity is modulated during cell cycle progression. RUNX2 expression in HBME cells was reduced with RUNX2 sequence-specific RNAi treatment and the effect on RUNX2 DNA-binding activity and cell cycle profile was examined. The results indicate that RUNX2 is essential for cell cycle progression and that loss of RUNX2 leads to decreased cell proliferation. Maximal RUNX2 activity was observed in late G2/M phases of the cell cycle when cdc2 kinase activity is highest. RUNX2 associated with the cdc2 partner cyclin B1 in cultured cells and cdc2-phosphorylated RUNX2 on Ser451 in vitro. Inhibition of cdc2 activity during mitosis or mutation of RUNX2 Ser451 also reduced RUNX2 DNA-binding activity. Finally, the RUNX2 Ser451 mutant was less potent than wild type RUNX2 at stimulating growth in soft agar. These data demonstrate that RUNX2 may promote cell proliferation in endothelial cells by regulating cell cycle progression. Moreover, we have identified cdc2 as one of the kinases responsible for post-translational modification of RUNX2. These findings support a mechanism for cell proliferation involving RUNX2 phosphorylation by a cellular cdk, which may promote angiogenesis and/or tumorigenesis. Reagents—Thymidine and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma and EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA), respectively. Roscovitine was from Calbiochem. Anti-AML3 (RUNX2) polyclonal antibody was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdc2, and phospho-threonine-proline antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). FLAG-M2 monoclonal and β-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Histone-H1 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and cdc2 recombinant kinase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Protein-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Peptide-specific RUNX2 antibody was prepared by synthesizing a peptide unique to RUNX2 (C-LWPSTL-SKKSQ-COOH; encoded by exon 8) using methods suggested by Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), which include consideration of hydrophobicity, predicted secondary structure, and antigenicity. Peptide was synthesized with a free cysteine group at the N terminus, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into two rabbits. After two months, test bleeds were analyzed for peptide binding by solid-phase, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods. Preimmune sera were obtained prior to immunization for use as a negative control. Reactive antisera were tested for RUNX2 specificity by Western blotting. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Proliferation Assays—HBME cells, a gift from Dr. Kenneth Pienta (Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan), 293T cells (ATCC), and human breast tumor cell line, SUM159PT, a gift from Dr. Steven Ethier (University of Michigan), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin from Invitrogen at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All cell lines were plated on 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 (5 × 105/dish). After 24 h, transfection of HBME or 293T cells was carried out in complete medium with Mirus TransIT LT1 reagent from Mirus Corp. (Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cell cycle blockade was performed with either thymidine or nocodazole, essentially as described (44Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, to synchronize cells at the G1/S boundary, double thymidine blockade was performed by incubating cells in 2 mm thymidine for 16 h followed by an 8-h recovery and a second 16-h incubation. To synchronize cells at metaphase, nocodazole-induced blockade was performed by treating cells with 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 14–16 h. Proliferation assays were performed 24 h after plating cells in complete medium. Medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and the number of cells in equivalent regions of the culture plates were counted after 2 days. Determination of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar was measured using NIH3T3 cells 24 h after transfection with specific RUNX2 expression vectors. Cells (40,000 per well; 6-well plates) mixed with 0.33% soft agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were added to a base layer of 0.5% soft agar in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The number of colonies per well (from 2 to 3 wells per treatment) were counted and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Ser451 of RUNX2, a possible target for cdc2, was mutated using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Clonetics). The mutagenic primer was 5′-pAGACCGGGCTCCTTCCAGAAT-3′, which converted Ser451 to alanine (S451A) or 5′-pGGTGCCGGGGGGAGACCGGGAACCTTCCAGAATGCTTCCGCC-3′, which converted Ser451 to glutamate (S451E), thus abolishing the AgeI site at nucleotide 1351 in RUNX2. The desired mutations were confirmed by AgeI restriction analysis and DNA sequencing at the University of Maryland, Biopolymer Facility (a Core facility of the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center). RNA Interference—RUNX2-specific double-stranded cDNA oligonucleotides consisted of a 21-nucleotide sense and a 21-nucleotide antisense sequence separated by a linker (45Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). The sequences for RUNX2 RNAi expression were as follows: sense Rx5, 5′-CAACCGCACCATGGTGGAGAT-3′; antisense Rx5, 5′-ATCTCCACCATGGTGCGGTTG-3′; sense Rx8, 5′-CCTTCCACTCTCAGTAAGAAG-3′; antisense Rx8, 5′-CTTCTTACTGAGAGTGGAAGG-3′. The sequences for mutant RUNX2 RNAi were as follows: sense Rx5(m), 5′-CAGCCGCACTATGGTGTAGAT-3′; antisense Rx5(m), 5′-ATCTACACCATAGTGCGGCTG-3′; sense Rx8(m), 5′-CCTTCCGCTCTCAGGAAGAGG-3′; antisense Rx8(m), 5′-CCTCTTCCTGAGAGCGGAAGG-3′. These oligonucleotides were subcloned into the pSupNeo expression vector (Imgenex) prior to transfection of the cells. The control pSupNeo vector contained a 400-bp scrambled cDNA insert. HBME cells were plated in 6-well plates (0.5 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of medium). After 24 h, RNAi plasmid transfection was performed in a total volume of 1 ml using Mirus LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final concentration of RNAi was 1 μg/ml. Total mRNA and proteins were isolated after 1, 2, or 3 days for analysis of RUNX2 expression. Nuclear Protein Isolation—Cells were harvested with trypsin and washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and treated with hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and nuclear proteins were extracted with buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 600 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad). All buffers contained a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors consisting of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—RUNX2 DNA-binding activity was measured as described previously (42Qiao M. Shapiro P. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42709-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extract protein were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from the human osteocalcin promoter (–141 to –165), and containing the human Runx2 consensus binding sequence (shown in bold): 5′-CGTATTAACCACAATACTCG-3′, 3′-AATTGGTGTTATGAGCATGC-5′. The double-stranded RUNX2 probe was end-labeled using [α-32P]ATP and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase according to standard protocols from Amersham Biosciences. DNA-protein complexes were then resolved on 6% TBE polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with RUNX2-specific antibody in binding buffer for 45 min at room temperature before 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding mixture. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Two days after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting using specific antibodies. 250 μg of nuclear protein or 500 μg of total protein were diluted into 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and precleared for 1 h at 4°C with 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). One μg of anti-M2 antibody recognizing the FLAG epitope and prebound to 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose was incubated with precleared protein extract at 4 °C on an orbital shaker for 16 h. The mixture was centrifuged and the pellet was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended in gel sample buffer prior to electrophoresis. For in vitro phosphorylation of RUNX2, immunoprecipitated proteins in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2) were incubated with 1 unit of recombinant cdc2 and cyclin B1 for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample. Proteins phosphorylated by the cdc2 kinase were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Western Blotting—Heated, denatured proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using the Novex-NuPAGE system from Invitrogen and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit from Amersham Biosciences. FACS Analysis—Cells cultured on a 6-cm dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol. Cell pellets were collected and stored at 4 °C. One hour before analysis, ethanol was removed by centrifugation of the cell suspension. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before FACS analysis at the Greenebaum Cancer Center FACS Core Facility. Data Analysis—The densitometry analysis to quantify RUNX2 DNA-binding activity was performed using the NIH Image analysis program. Arbitrary densitometric units were normalized to total protein levels in each nuclear extract. Results shown are representative of at least three experiments. In other experiments, results were calculated using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and are expressed as mean ± S.D. from at least three determinations. Significance was calculated using paired analysis (Excel Office Suite) and expressed as p values. RUNX2 and EC Proliferation—We showed previously that RUNX2 expression, as analyzed by DNA-binding activity and protein levels, correlated with EC proliferation (43Sun L. Vitolo M. Qiao M. Anglin I. Passaniti A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4722-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subconfluent, proliferating HMBE expressed RUNX2, but not after subsequent growth arrest at confluence. We further showed that RUNX2 overexpression in bovine aortic EC lacking endogenous RUNX2 stimulated cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and pRb phosphorylation, whereas a dominant negative RUNX2 variant inhibited cell proliferation (43Sun L. Vitolo M. Qiao M. Anglin I. Passaniti A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4722-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To further define the function of RUNX2 in EC proliferation, we employed RUNX2-specific RNAi to knock down endogenous RUNX2 expression and determine changes in cell proliferation. HBME cells were transfected with plasmids expressing RNAi or mutant RNAi corresponding to specific regions of the RUNX2 gene and cultured for 1, 2, or 3 days. The maximal inhibition (60–70%) of RUNX2 protein expression was achieved 48 h after transfection of each specific RNAi (data not shown). Specific depletion of RUNX2 protein was achieved at doses ≤1 μg/ml, compared with mutant RNAi, which was inactive. Two RNAi encoding plasmids targeting the 5′-end (Rx5) and exon 8 region (Rx8) of RUNX2 were tested for their ability to knock down RUNX2 DNA-binding activity and protein expression. Cells were transfected with RNAi or an unrelated RNAi (pSupNeo) for 2 days and RUNX2 DNA-binding activity and protein levels were compared. RUNX2 expression was relatively insensitive to increasing amounts of Neo control RNAi. RUNX2 RNAi, on the other hand, decreased both RUNX2 activity and protein expression (Fig. 1A). Either Rx5 or Rx8 reduced RUNX2 protein levels, whereas the combination of the two RNAi exhibited more than 90% inhibition of RUNX2 expression. These experiments confirmed the efficacy and specificity of RUNX2 RNAi. To quantify the ability of reduced RUNX2 expression to inhibit cell proliferation, HBME cells were transfected with pSupNeo or RNAi (Rx5, Rx8, and Rx5+Rx8) for 48 h. Photographs were taken of representative fields of cells at days 0 or 2 after transfection and cell numbers in each field were measured. HBME cells transfected with the pSupNeo vector showed a 28-fold increase in cell number over 2 days (Fig. 1B). In comparison, RUNX2-specific RNAi significantly inhibited cell proliferation (Rx5, 2-fold decrease; Rx8, 4-fold decrease) compared with Neo vector. The combination of the two RNAi completely abolished cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). Cell Cycle-restricted RUNX2 Activity and Protein Expression—Either delayed cell cycle progression or increased apoptosis could account for the decreased cell number in RNAi transfectants. To determine whether endogenous RUNX2 has a role in regulating cell cycle progression, HBME cells were synchronized using double thymidine block in late G1/S phase followed by release for up to 24 h. Nuclear extracts were isolated and incubated with a consensus RUNX2-binding site oligonucleotide from the osteocalcin promoter (15Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). As expected, cells blocked at G1 expressed very low RUNX2 activity and protein, which increased to a maximum level 8 h after release of the blockade (Fig. 2A). We showed previously that the binding complex could be competed with excess cold oligonucleotide, but not with a nonspecific oligonucleotide, and that it could be supershifted in the presence of RUNX2-specific antibody (43Sun L. Vitolo M. Qiao M. Anglin I. Passaniti A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4722-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Duplicate samples were collected at different time points, labeled with propidium iodide, and analyzed for cell cycle progression by FACS. The number of cells exhibiting 2N or 4N ploidy was determined as a function of time afte"

Here we show that in human keratinocytes HSV-1 attains a sophisticated control of the IKK/NF-κB pathway, inducing two distinct temporally controlled waves of IKK activity and disrupting the NF-κB autoregulatory mechanism. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that dysregulation of the NF-κB-response is mediated by a virus-induced block of NF-κB recruitment to the promoter of the IκBα gene, encoding the main NF-κB-inhibitor. We also show that HSV-1 redirects NF-κB recruitment to the promoter of ICP0, an immediate-early viral gene with a key role in promoting virus replication. The results reveal a new level of control of cellular functions by invading viruses and suggest that persistent NF-κB activation in HSV-1-infected cells, rather than being a host response to the virus, may play a positive role in promoting efficient viral replication.

As other members of the family, HSV-1 can establish productive and latent infections (1Roizman B. Knipe D.M. Knipe B.N. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2399-2459Google Scholar). During productive infection HSV-1 efficiently redirects the host transcriptional machinery to express its own genes in a tightly regulated temporal cascade, consisting of the sequential expression of three gene classes: the immediate-early (IE), delayed-early (DE) and late (L) genes. The five IE genes are expressed shortly after entry into the host cell, and the resulting IE proteins (infected cell proteins ICP-0, -4, -22, -27, and -47) are essential for the subsequent temporally controlled expression of DE genes, the majority of which encode proteins involved in viral DNA replication, as well as of later L genes, which encode predominantly structural proteins. In particular, the multifunctional phosphoprotein ICP0 acts as a strong activator of all classes of HSV-1 genes, as well as of other eukaryotic genes (1Roizman B. Knipe D.M. Knipe B.N. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2399-2459Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism responsible for ICP0 transactivating activity is not yet understood. No specific DNA-binding sequence for ICP0 could be identified, and the transactivating activity seems to be dependent on one or more of the different functions of the ICP0 protein (2Everett R.D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The facts that ICP0-negative mutants grow poorly in most tissue systems and are reactivation-impaired indicate that adequate ICP0 activity confers a growth advantage and is essential to promote initiation of the lytic-phase transcriptional events (1Roizman B. Knipe D.M. Knipe B.N. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2399-2459Google Scholar). Several distinct cis-acting elements are important for ICP0 expression during productive infection (3Davido D.J. Leib D.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to the transactivating activity of the virion VP16 protein-induced complex, ICP0 expression can be modulated by a variety of host-transactivating factors, including the nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB). NF-κB is a collective term referring to a class of dimeric transcription factors consisting of homo- and heterodimers of five structurally related Rel/NF-κB proteins (4Santoro M.G. Rossi A. Amici C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2552-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In most cells NF-κB exists as an inactive cytoplasmic complex, whose predominant form is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65/RelA subunits, bound to inhibitory proteins of the IκB family, including IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ (5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). IκB proteins consist of an N-terminal regulatory domain followed by a series of ankyrin repeats important in the binding to the NF-κB heterodimer. The interaction with IκB masks the nuclear localization sequence in the NF-κB complex, sequestering the factor in the cytoplasmic compartment. Different stimuli for NF-κB activation initiate different signal transduction pathways most of which converge on the IκB kinase (IKK) signalosome that plays a major role in NF-κB activation (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). IKK is a multisubunit complex, containing two catalytic subunits (IKK-α and IKK-β), which are able to form homo- or heterodimers, and the IKK-γ or NEMO regulatory subunit, which is not a kinase per se, but acts as a docking protein for IKK kinases or other signaling proteins (7Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, the NF-κB/IκB complex is activated via the phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein. In the case of IκBα, IKK-mediated phosphorylation occurs at serine residues 32 and 36 in the N-terminal portion of the molecule (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation targets IκBα for ubiquitination by the β-TrCP (transducin repeat-containing protein)-containing SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box-protein) ubiquitin ligase complex at lysines 21 and 22, which leads to degradation of the inhibitory subunit by the 26 S proteasome, allowing the release of NF-κB. Following the degradation of the inhibitory protein and exposure of the nuclear localization sequence motif, freed NF-κB dimers translocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA consensus sequences (κB elements), activating the transcription of several target genes, including the NF-κB-inhibitory protein IκBα, which provides a negative feedback mechanism to limit NF-κB activity (8Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). IκBα displays nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties and, after NF-κB-dependent resynthesis, it enters the nucleus and promotes NF-κB removal from DNA, restoring the inducible pool of the transcription factor into the cytoplasm (9Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). NF-κB was found to be activated early during HSV-1 infection (10Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W.E. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and was shown to be involved in up-regulation of several host genes (12Taddeo B. Esclatine A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17031-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as well as in promoting the progression of the virus replication cycle (11Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Gregory D. Hagett D. Holmes D. Money E. Bachenheimer S.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13582-13590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms governing NF-κB activity in the nucleus of HSV-1-infected cells have still not been defined. In the present report we show that, in its target cell, the human keratinocyte, HSV-1 infection induces two separate, temporally controlled waves of IKK activity with distinct characteristics. For the first time we demonstrate that the virus recruits NF-κB to the ICP0 promoter, enhancing ICP0 gene transcription. We also demonstrate that, during the second wave of IKK activity, the virus disrupts the NF-κB autoregulatory loop, by interfering with the recruitment of the factor to the IκBα promoter. The results give new insights on how viruses have evolved sophisticated control mechanisms to redirect the cellular signaling machinery to their own advantage. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Virus Infection—Human HaCaT keratinocytes were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. HaCaT cell monolayers were infected for 1 h at 37°C with HSV-1 strain F1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque forming units/cell, unless stated otherwise. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay or by cytopathic effect 50% (CPE50%) assay on confluent VERO cell monolayers (11Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Inactivated HSV-1 virus was prepared by exposure to UV light (254-nm wavelength) on ice for 15 min. UV exposure reduced HSV-1 infectivity by >106-fold, as verified by plaque assay. Prostaglandin A1 (PGA1, Cayman Chemicals) was added after the 1-h adsorption period and maintained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E., and p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Plasmid Construction and Generation of a Keratinocyte Cell Line with Stably Integrated ICP0-promoter (HaCaT-ICP0-Luc)—A fragment of the ICP0 promoter spanning from –809 to +150 derived from the pIE1-CAT vector (kind gift of Dr. R. D. Everett) was subcloned into the PGL3 basic vector (Promega). To obtain HaCaT cells, which presented the HSV-1 ICP0-promoter integrated in their chromatin (HaCaT-ICP0-Luc), the PGL3-ICP0 promoter vector was cotransfected with pBABE-puro plasmid, and stable integrants were selected by using puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 12 days. Selected pools of HaCaT cells were tested for luciferase induction after HSV-1 infection. For the construction of the pcDNA3-ICP0-vector used in the run-on experiments, the cDNA corresponding to sequence 1494–2152 of the first ICP0-exon was obtained by amplifying the viral HSV-1 DNA using synthesized primers 5′-GGATGTCTGGGTGTTTCCCTGC-3′ (1494–1515, sense) and 5′-CGTCGTCCAGGTCGTCGTCATCC-3′ (2130–2152, antisense). The fragment was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector EcoRV site, and the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Whole cell extracts (15 μg) prepared after lysis in a high salt extraction buffer (14Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) were incubated with 32P-labeled κB DNA probe (15Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) followed by analysis of DNA-binding activity by EMSA. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (15Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specificity of protein-DNA complexes was verified by immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies specific for p65 (Rel A). Quantitative evaluation of NF-κB-DNA complex formation was determined by Typhoon 8600 imager (Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, MDP) with the use of ImageQuaNT (MDP analysis). Kinase Assay and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were incubated with anti-IKKα antibodies in the presence of 15 μl of protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing, endogenous IKK activity was determined using GST-IκBα-(1–54) as substrate (11Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein (40 μg/sample) from HaCaT whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and filters were incubated with polyclonal anti-IκBα/MAD3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα, or anti-p65 antibodies followed by decoration with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) (11Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Filters were analyzed by Versadoc-1000 system (Bio-Rad) for protein quantitative determination. Transcriptional Run-on Assay and Protein Synthesis—In vitro run-on transcription reactions were performed in isolated HaCaT nuclei as previously described (16Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). RNA, 32P-labeled, was hybridized with nitrocellulose filters containing plasmids for HSV-1 ICP0 (ICP0-pcDNA3), human IκBα (IκBα-pcDNA3), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, as a control. Following hybridization, filters were visualized by autoradiography, and the radioactivity was quantified by MDP analysis. For determination of protein synthesis, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (10 μCi/105 cells, 45-min pulse) and lysed in L buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS). Samples containing the same amount of radioactivity were separated by SDS-PAGE (3% stacking gel, 10% resolving gel) and processed for autoradiography (11Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HaCaT cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde (Sigma) to the medium to a final concentration of 1%. After 15 min, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and scraped. After centrifugation, cells were lysed in L1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. After removal of supernatants, nuclei were resuspended in L2 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA), and chromatin was sheared by sonication. After removal of nuclear debris by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 8 °C, lysates were diluted 10-fold with DB buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then precleared for 3 h using 80 μl of 50% salmon sperm-DNA-saturated protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm-DNA-saturated protein A-agarose beads. Antibodies utilized included anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or pre-immune rabbit serum as control for nonspecific interaction. After washing three times with high salt WB buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl) and twice with low salt TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), immunocomplexes were eluted with TE containing 1% SDS. Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by incubating at 65 °C overnight. After proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol using 15 μg of tRNA as carrier. PCR was performed (30 cycles, denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s) using primers specific for the human IκBα promoter IκBα-proS (5′-ACTTGCAGAGGGACAGGATTACAG-3′) and IκBα-proAS (5′-AGGCTCGGGGAATTTCCAAG-3′); for the ICP0 viral promoter ICP0-proS (5′-TAATGGGGTTCTTTGGGGGACACC-3′) and ICP0-proAS (5′-TGCAAATGCGACCAGACTGTC-3′); for the ICP8 viral promoter ICP8-proS (5′-AGCACCTGACCGTAAGCATCTG-3′) and ICP8-proAS (5′-CTTTGTCTCCATGTCCTCCTGG-3′). To discriminate the integrated form of the ICP0 promoter from the non-integrated viral promoter in the ChIP analysis, we have utilized the same upstream primer ICP0-proS but different downstream primers: the internal ICP0 gene primer ICP0-AS1 (5′-CATGGCGGCCGGTTCCAGTGTAAGG-3′) for the viral form and the Luc-AS primer (5′-TCCATCTTCCAGCGGATAGAATGG-3′) for the integrated ICP0-Luc fragment, respectively. HSV-1 Induces a Biphasic Wave of IKK-dependent NF-κB Activation in Human Keratinocytes—To investigate how herpes simplex viruses modulate the IKK/NF-κB pathway in human keratinocytes, confluent HaCaT cell monolayers were infected with HSV-1 for 60 min at 37 °C. After this time, the virus inoculum was removed and cells were incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Control cells were treated identically. In a parallel experiment, cell monolayers were exposed to infectious or UV-inactivated HSV-1, to determine whether virus replication was necessary for NF-κB activation. Immediately after the adsorption period (time 0) and at different times post infection (p.i.), whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for IKK activity by kinase assay, IκBα degradation by immunoblot analysis, and NF-κB activation by EMSA. In human keratinocytes, HSV-1 infection was found to activate IKK in a biphasic way (Fig. 1A, upper panels). During virus entry, a first wave of IKK activity was observed. IKK activation at this time was rapid, transient, and independent of virus replication, because it occurred also after exposure of cells to UV-inactivated virions (Fig. 2). Induction of IKK function was rapidly followed by IκBα degradation (Fig. 1A, middle panels) and triggering of NF-κB DNA-binding activity, which lasted for ∼2 h (Fig. 1A, lower panels). As expected, transcriptionally active NF-κB switched on IκBα resynthesis, rapidly restoring the intracellular pool of the inhibitory protein and, consequently, activating the NF-κB autoregulatory turn-off signal (Fig. 1A, middle panels). At later times (3 h) p.i., HSV-1 infection induced a second wave of IKK activity (Fig. 1A, upper panels), which, differently from the early transient phase of induction, persisted at elevated levels for several hours p.i. This second wave of IKK activity was dependent on active virus replication, because UV-inactivated virus particles were unable to turning it on (Fig. 2). The second wave of IKK activity also led to complete IκBα degradation, and it induced massive and persistent NF-κB activation (Fig. 1A, middle and lower panels); however, no detectable IκBα resynthesis was observed up to 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1B), suggesting that HSV-1 could interfere with the NF-κB autoregulatory loop at this stage of infection. In the absence of the inhibitory protein, NF-κB remained in the activated DNA-binding state for at least 24 h in HSV-1-infected keratinocytes (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Induction of IKK and NF-κB activity by UV-inactivated HSV-1 in HaCaT cells. HaCaT cells were exposed to UV-inactivated HSV-1 for 1 h at 37 °C.Attheendofthe adsorption period (time 0) and at different times p.i., whole cell extracts from uninfected (U), or UV-inactivated-HSV-1-infected (UV-HSV-1) cells were assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA (upper panel), and for IKK activity and recovery by kinase assay (KA) and immunoblotting (IB), respectively (middle panels). Sections of fluorograms from native gels are shown. Levels of IKK (○) and NF-κB (•) activity were quantified by MDP analysis and expressed as -fold induction of uninfected control (C, lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recruitment of NF-κB Dimers to the IκBα Promoter Is Impaired during Lytic HSV-1 Infection—To investigate whether the lack of IκBα resynthesis following the second wave of HSV-1-induced IKK activity was merely the consequence of a general shut-off of cell protein synthesis after viral infection, HaCaT cells were infected with HSV-1, and, at different time intervals, cellular and viral protein synthesis was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, after [35S]methionine labeling. In parallel samples, whole cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA for NF-κB activity and by Western blot for detection of IκBα. As expected, two peaks of NF-κB activity were detected immediately after the adsorption period and at 3 h p.i., respectively (Fig. 3A, filled circles). As determined by [35S]methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, HSV-1 was found not to significantly alter protein synthesis in the host cell up to 6 h after infection (Fig. 3A, open circles). In addition, analysis of autoradiographic patterns after SDS-PAGE separation of labeled proteins did not reveal major differences in cellular protein synthesis in infected cells up to 6 h p.i. (data not shown), excluding the possibility that the lack of IκBα could be the consequence of a general protein synthesis shut-off at this time. The kinetics of the IκBα gene transcription was then analyzed by in vitro run-on assay on nuclei isolated from duplicate samples. As shown in Fig. 3B (upper panel), IκBα transcription was rapidly induced upon virus entry. The transcription rate attained a 5-fold induction at the end of the virus adsorption period, leading to IκBα resynthesis at this time (Fig. 3B, lower panels) and declined thereafter to reach basal levels at 2 h p.i. However, IκBα gene transcription was not observed at later times p.i., even when NF-κB DNA-binding activity had reached maximal levels (Fig. 3, compare A and B), indicating that HSV-1-induced NF-κB complexes are unable to transactivate this cellular target gene at this stage of infection. Supershift assay using antibodies against various members of the Rel/NF-κB family identified p65 as a component of the DNA-binding complex (data not shown), excluding the possibility that the defect in IκBα gene transactivation could be due to the formation of transcriptionally inactive NF-κB dimers. On the other hand, control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene transcription levels were not affected by the virus up to 6 h p.i. NF-κB recruitment to the IκBα promoter was then analyzed in vivo by ChIP assay in HSV-1-infected and mock infected keratinocytes at different times p.i. Formaldehyde cross-linked, sonicated chromatin fragments from HaCaT cells were immunoprecipitated with an affinity purified antibody against p65. DNA released from immunocomplexes was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR to detect an enrichment of the IκBα promoter in the immunoprecipitates. The rate of amplification was verified at all time points using cross-linked, not immunoprecipitated chromatin (Fig. 3C, upper panel, INPUT). The specificity of chromatin immunoprecipitation was determined by using a control unrelated antibody (Fig. 3C, lower panel, NS IgG). The virus entry process was found to induce a rapid recruitment of p65 to the IκBα gene promoter (Fig. 3C, middle panel), which, driving gene transcription, led to restoration of IκBα levels by 1 h p.i., as shown in Fig. 3B. De novo synthesized IκBα is known to induce the removal of p65 from its promoter switching off gene transcription. As expected, recruitment of p65 to the IκBα promoter ceased when IκBα levels went back to normal between 1 and 2 h p.i. (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, p65 recruitment could not be detected on IκBακB-elements at later times p.i., indicating that the defect in IκBα gene transcription is due to an impairment of NF-κB recruitment to the promoter of this target gene. NF-κB Is Recruited to the Viral ICP0 Promoter during HSV-1 Lytic Infection—Several NF-κB binding elements have been described in the promoter region, as well as in the first intron sequence, of the HSV-1 ICP0 gene (17Karin M. Lin A. Nature Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the requirement of NF-κB for induction of ICP0 gene transcription. We then investigated whether NF-κB is actually recruited to the viral ICP0 gene promoter. HaCaT cells were infected with HSV-1 and analyzed by ChIP assay using anti-p65 polyclonal antibodies. p65/RelA-coprecipitating DNA was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR with promoter-specific primers amplifying the ICP0 viral promoter (Fig. 4A, IP anti-p65). An unrelated rabbit polyclonal antiserum was used as control. The viral ICP8 promoter was also analyzed with specific primers in the p65-coprecipitating DNA. In a parallel experiment, viral ICP0 and cellular IκBα mRNA transcription rates were measured by in vitro run-on assay performed on isolated nuclei. Similarly to the IκBα gene, p65 was found to be recruited to the ICP0 promoter rapidly after virus entry into the host cell (Fig. 4A, ICP0, middle panel). p65/RelA recruitment to the ICP0 promoter corresponded with a remarkable burst in ICP0 transcription (Fig. 4B), indicating that NF-κB bound to the viral enhancer may contribute significantly to ICP0 transcriptional activation. Interestingly, p65 recruitment to the ICP0 promoter was also detected at 2 h p.i., when IκBα resynthesis had been completed and NF-κB DNA-binding activity had partially declined. p65/RelA recruitment to the viral promoter persisted for several hours, accompanied by a further increase in ICP0 gene transcription, which reached maximal levels at 6 h p.i. No amplification of chromatin immunoprecipitated with the anti-p65 antibody was detected using primers to the ICP8 promoter, which lacks NF-κB consensus sequences, demonstrating the specificity of p65 occupancy on the ICP0 promoter (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Viral ICP0 Promoter Shows Remarkable Avidity for NF-κB—To investigate whether the differences observed in NF-κB recruitment could be a consequence of the different status of viral and cellular DNA organization (episomal versus chromosomal), we have generated HaCaT cells (HaCaT-ICP0-Luc cells) in which the ICP0 promoter controlling the expression of the luciferase reporter gene is stably integrated into the chromatin structure. HaCaT-ICP0-Luc cells were infected with HSV-1, and, at different times post-infection, were processed for luciferase or ChIP analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B, HSV-1 infection induces luciferase activity in these cells, indicating that the ICP0-Luc promoter is transcriptionally activated by the virus. In the same experiment, NF-κB recruitment to the integrated and to the free viral ICP0 promoters was analyzed at the end of the virus adsorption period and at 5 h post-infection, which correspond to the first and second waves of NF-κB activation, respectively. To discriminate the integrated form of the ICP0 promoter from the non-integrated viral promoter in the ChIP analysis, we have utilized the same upstream primer but different downstream primers (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5C, at the end of the 1-h adsorption period, NF-κB is recruited to the IκBα promoter and to both forms (viral and integrated form) of the ICP0 promoter, indicating that during the first wave of NF-κB activation all the promoters analyzed behave similarly in respect to NF-κB recruitment. As expected, at 5 h p.i. NF-κB was not recruited to the IκBα promoter. Interestingly, at this time, NF-κB was recruited selectively to the viral form of the ICP0 promoter. When integrated into the host chromatin structure, the ICP0 promoter looses its ability to recruit the nuclear factor, behaving like IκBα (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the differences in NF-κB recruitment observed between ICP0 and IκBα promoters could be due to differences in the status of DNA and/or to gener"
https://openalex.org/W1582179831,"Homomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs) have a single channel conductance (γ) below the resolution of single channel recording (966 ± 75 fS, estimated by variance analysis). By contrast, heteromeric 5-HT3A/B and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have picosiemen range γ values. In this study, single channel recordings revealed that replacement of cytoplasmic membrane-associated (MA) helix arginine 432 (-4′), 436 (0′), and 440 (4′) residues by 5-HT3B (-4′Gln, 0′Asp, and 4′Ala) residues increases γ to 36.5 ± 1.0 pS. The 0′ residue makes the most substantial contribution to γ of the 5-HT3AR. Replacement of 0′Arg by aspartate, glutamate (α7 nAChR subunit MA 0′), or glutamine (β2 subunit MA 0′) increases γ to the resolvable range (>6 pS). By contrast, replacement of 0′Arg by phenylalanine (α4 subunit MA 0′) reduced γ to 416 ± 107 fS. In reciprocal experiments with α4β2 nAChRs (γ = 31.3 ± 0.8 pS), replacement of MA 0′ residues by arginine in α4β2(Q443R) and α4(F588R)β2 reduced γ slightly. By contrast, the γ of double mutant α4(F588R)β2(Q443R) was halved. The MA -4′ and 4′ residues also influenced γ of 5-HT3ARs. Replacement of nAChR α4 or β2 MA 4′ residues by arginine made current density negligible. By contrast, replacement of both -4′ residues by arginine produced functional nAChRs with substantially reduced γ (11.4 ± 0.5 pS). Homology models of the 5-HT3A and α4β2 nAChRs against Torpedo nAChR revealed MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ residues within five intracellular portals.

This locus may be a common determinant of ion conduction throughout the Cys loop receptor family. There are five families of vertebrate Cys loop receptors as follows: the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), 3The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; MA, membrane-associated; WT, wild type; ANOVA, analysis of variance; 5-HT3AR, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; MA, membrane-associated; WT, wild type; ANOVA, analysis of variance; 5-HT3AR, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-HT3R), the zinc-activated ion channel, the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, and the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (1Alexander S.P.H.

Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Structural analysis by cryo-EM of tubular crystals prepared from the Torpedo marmorata electric organ revealed that five subunits combine in nAChRs, forming a rosette around the central ion channel (3Unwin N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The second transmembrane (M2) domain of each subunit participates in lining the channel pore, and collectively they present a hydrophobic constriction adjacent to what is traditionally believed to be the rate-limiting portion of the ion conduction pathway that controls single channel conductance (γ) and ionic selectivity (2Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Peters J.A. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 587-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The homomeric 5-HT3A receptor is unique among Cys loop receptors, having a γ below the resolution of single channel recording, estimated by variance analysis to be in the femtosiemen range. The incorporation of the 5-HT3B subunit into human heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors increases γ to 16 pS, enabling direct observation of events by single channel recording from outside-out patches (5Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The use of chimeric 5-HT3A-5-HT3B constructs and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a critical role of three arginine residues within the MA helix of the M3-M4 cytoplasmic loop in determining γ (6Finer-Moore J.

Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This has prompted speculation that the MA helix may participate in the control of γ in other Cys loop receptors (4Peters J.A.

In support of this interpretation, cryo-EM analysis revealed portals within the Torpedo nAChR formed, in part, by the MA helices of adjacent subunits that may participate in the ion conduction pathway (9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).In this study we investigated the influence of the 5-HT3A subunit's MA helix Arg-432 (-4′), Arg-436 (0′), and Arg-440 (4′) residues in the control of γ. We investigated the effect of introducing arginine into the equivalent locations within the nAChR α4 and β2 subunits. Our data confirm the critical role of MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ residues in controlling γ of 5-HT3A receptors and support the hypothesis that the MA helix also forms part of the ion conduction pathway of nAChRs. Our functional data provide support for the existence of cytoplasmic portals depicted in the 4 Å structural model of the nAChR (10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs and Transient Transfection of Subunit cDNAs—cDNAs encoding rat wild-type (WT) nAChR α4 and β2 subunits (Dr. J. M. Boulter, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA), human WT 5-HT3A subunits, and mutant nAChR and 5-HT3A subunits were cloned into pGW1 (11Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced using standard molecular biological techniques (7Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All cDNAs were sequenced to confirm fidelity. Transfection of tsA-201, or HEK-293 cells, with subunit cDNAs, at equimolar ratios when appropriate, was performed by either the calcium phosphate precipitation method or electroporation (400 V, infinite resistance, 125 microfarads) using a Bio-Rad gene electropulser II. Transfected cells were routinely cultured at 37 °C for 24-72 h before use, although in the case of nicotinic receptor constructs incubation temperature was reduced to 29 °C overnight prior to recording in order to enhance cell surface expression (12Cooper S.T. Harkness P.C. Baker E.R. Millar N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27145-27152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Electrophysiology—Whole-cell and outside-out patch configurations were used to record macroscopic and single channel currents, respectively, from transfected cells. The recording chamber was perfused (5 ml min-1) with a solution of (in mm) NaCl 140, KCl 2.8, MgCl2 2.0, CaCl2 1.0, glucose 10, and HEPES 10; pH 7.3. For macroscopic current recordings, patch-clamp electrodes contained (in mm) KCl 140, MgCl2 2.0, CaCl2 0.1, EGTA 1.1, HEPES 10; pH 7.3. Acetylcholine (1 mm) was applied by pressure ejection to whole cells to obtain estimates of peak current, which were then normalized to cell capacitance in order to determine current densities. Slowly rising and decaying whole-cell currents, suitable for fluctuation analysis, were evoked by agonists applied to voltage-clamped cells (-60 mV) via diffusion pipettes. Single channel conductances were estimated from the macroscopic current (1-1000-Hz bandwidth) response to agonist as described previously (13Brown A.M. Hope A.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 653-665Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Variance analysis was performed using the electrophysiology data recorder (Dr. J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde). For single channel recordings from outside-out patches, or variance analysis recorded from the latter, electrodes were filled with (in mm) potassium gluconate 130, NaCl 5, MgCl2 2, EGTA 5, HEPES 10; pH 7.2. Single channel currents recorded from outside-out patches were either low pass filtered at 2 kHz in nACh receptor experiments or 1 kHz in 5-HT3 receptor experiments (digitized at 10 kHz in both cases). Data were acquired as described previously (14Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Hales T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 101-113Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Agonists were applied by pressure ejection to patches voltage-clamped at either -74 mV in the case of WT and mutant 5-HT3A constructs or -94 mV in the case of nAChR constructs (values include correction for liquid junction potential compensation). Sections of digitized data (∼10-s duration), in which unitary events predominated, were selected for analysis and were leak current-subtracted (using Clampfit) for the creation of all-points amplitude histograms using Fetchan (pCLAMP 8.0, Axon Instruments, CA). Multiple gaussians were fitted (least squares minimization) to amplitude histograms using the Simplex method within pSTAT (pCLAMP 8.0). The amplitude of the single channel current recorded from each patch was determined from the difference between the mean current amplitudes determined from the gaussians fitted to the closed and open-state currents. Single channel conductances are reported as the chord conductance derived as γ = i/(Vm - Erev), where i is unitary current amplitude; Vm is the holding potential, and Erev is the reversal potential of the agonist-evoked macroscopic current response. In several outside-out patch recordings from 5-HT3 and nACh receptors, two conductances were evident. Our analysis of single channels was restricted to the main state, which in all cases corresponded to the larger amplitude events readily detected in all-points amplitude histograms.Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data sets were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post hoc Tukey's test.Modeling the 5-HT3A and nAChR α4 and β2 Subunits onto the 4 Å Model of the Torpedo nAChR—Amino acid sequences of 5-HT3A (WT and 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436D,R440A) mutant) and WT α4 and β2 subunits were aligned against Torpedo α, β, δ, and γ subunits using MultiAlign (prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/). Gaps between N-terminal amino acids (predominantly in loop 9) introduced into the template sequence (for modeling against the AChBP) were also introduced in the appropriate locations of each aligned subunit. The 5-HT3A sequence lacks several N-terminal residues found in nAChR subunits, and these were filled with corresponding residues from the equivalent template subunit. The lengths of the C termini of query sequences differ from template sequences. To allow successful homology modeling, residues were either introduced from the corresponding template subunit or removed from the query sequence.Homology Modeling—The Torpedo template structure was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (code 2BG9) into the DeepView Swiss-Pdb Viewer (swissmodel.expasy.org/). Aligned sequences of 5-HT3A (WT and 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436D,R440A) mutant) and WT nAChR α4 and β2 subunits were threaded onto the Torpedo template in DeepView. The nAChR subunits were threaded onto the template with the 2α4:3β2 stoichiometry in the ββαβα arrangement. The models were then submitted to SwissModel (swissmodel.expasy.org/) for optimization. Following energy minimization (Gromos96, SwissModel), models were returned to DeepView for viewing and imaging. Excess C-terminal residues were removed from query sequences for imaging. The subunit interface illustrated (Fig. 7) represents the homology model corresponding to the Torpedo 1′α-5′γ interface (10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar).RESULTSResidues in the MA Helix of the 5-HT3A Subunit Control γ—Application of 5-HT (10 μm) to outside-out membrane patches excised from HEK cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding the human 5-HT3A subunit activated currents without resolvable single channel events (Fig. 1A), consistent with our previous observations (5Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Variance analysis of whole-cell currents activated by 5-HT (10 μm) reveals WT 5-HT3A receptors to have a single channel conductance (γ) of 966 ± 75 fS (Table 1).FIGURE 1MA helix -4′,0′, and 4′ residues of the 5-HT3 receptor are determinants of single channel conductance. A, current recording from an outside-out patch excised from an HEK cell expressing human WT homomeric 5-HT3A receptors. The patch was voltage-clamped at -74 mV. The current was activated by 5-HT (10 μm) applied by pressure ejection. No unitary events are evident even in the expanded section of data because the γ of WT 5-HT3A receptors is below the resolution of recording. B, left, the 5-HT3A receptor homology modeled onto the Torpedo nAChR indicating the position of cytoplasmic MA helices. Right, alignment of amino acids within the MA helices of human and rat 5-HT3 receptor A and B subunits and human and rat nAChR α4, α7, and β2 subunits. Totally conserved residues are identified by shaded boxes, and MA helix -10′, -4′,0′, and 4′ residues are identified by open boxes. Numbers refer to the location of arginine residues found in the human 5-HT3A subunit. C, 5-HT (10 μm)-activated currents recorded from an outside-out patch containing homomeric triple mutant 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436D,R440A) receptors in which native MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ arginine residues were replaced by corresponding glutamine, aspartate, and alanine residues located in the MA helices of the 5-HT3B subunit. D, the all-points amplitude histogram of the current trace reveals that there are at least four channels active in this patch. The amplitudes of the events, as revealed by the sum of five gaussians were -2.4, -4.6, -6.9, and -9.3 pA at a holding potential of -74 mV.

Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab We aligned the human 5-HT3A subunit amino acid sequence with those of the human 5-HT3B subunit and various nAChR subunits, including the T. marmorata α, β, γ, and δ subunits. The 5-HT3A sequence was then threaded on to the 4 Å structural model of the Torpedo nAChR (10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar), and the homology model was energy-minimized (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 5-HT3A subunit contains a series of regularly spaced arginine residues located within the MA helix (Fig. 1B). Here we denote these residues MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ for ease of comparison with the homologous residues in the structurally related nAChR subunits (Fig. 1B).By using variance analysis of whole-cell currents, we previously suggested that arginine residues at positions MA -4′ (Arg-432) and 4′ (Arg-440) participate with MA 0′ (Arg-436) in the control of γ. In agreement, single channel recordings of 5-HT-activated currents from outside-out patches containing triple mutant homomeric 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436D,R440A) receptors (in which MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ residues were replaced by corresponding 5-HT3B residues (hereafter referred to as the 5-HT3A(QDA) mutant)) revealed robust unitary current events with a γ of 36.5 ± 1.0 pS (Fig. 1, C and D; Table 1), i.e. an ∼40-fold increase in γ in comparison to WT 5-HT3A receptors. The determination of γ by variance analysis is indirect and can result in an underestimation of this parameter. Indeed, the value of γ reported here from direct observation of single channel events mediated by the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor is greater than that which we reported previously, using a different electrode solution (7Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), but is in agreement with values recently published by others using a similar recording configuration (15Reeves D.C. Jansen M. Bali M. Lemster T. Akabas M.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9358-9366Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we re-investigated the contribution of the MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ 5-HT3 residues in the control of γ individually and in combination by single channel analysis, where resolution permitted. Fig. 2A illustrates the effect of replacing the MA -4′, 0′, and 4′ residues in 5-HT3A with equivalent residues from the 5-HT3B subunit. Direct measurements of γ using single channel analysis are qualitatively similar to estimates of γ that we reported previously using variance analysis. There is a good correlation between γ values determined using these two approaches (r2 = 0.98; Fig. 2B). The systematic underestimation of γ using variance analysis could be caused by the presence of subconductance events below the resolution of single channel recording or alternatively the use of different recording solutions.FIGURE 2The MA 0′ arginine residue in the 5-HT3A receptor has the most profound effect on γ. A, bar graph illustrates the effects of replacing MA helix -4′ (432), 0′ (436), and 4′ (440) residues in the 5-HT3A subunit by corresponding residues in the 5-HT3B subunit. Gray bars represent average γ values determined directly from outside-out patch recordings of single channel events. Using ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test, all gray bars are significantly different (p < 0.001) in amplitude to γ values for either WT or 5-HT3A(R432Q). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001. The open bar represents γ for the 5-HT3A(R432Q) determined by variance analysis of 5-HT-activated patch currents that could not be resolved into single channel events. Error bars represent ± S.E. The dashed line indicates the γ derived from variance analysis of 5-HT-activated currents recorded from HEK cells expressing WT 5-HT3A receptors. B, the graph illustrates the correlation between γ measured from resolved unitary channel events (gray bars in A) and γ values estimated by variance analysis. # indicates that these data contain values reported previously (7Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The coefficient of correlation (r2) determined from a linear regression fitted to the data points was 0.98. C, 5-HT (10 μm)-activated currents recorded at -74 mV from an excised outside-out patch containing homomeric mutant 5-HT3A(R436D) receptors in which the 5-HT3A subunit MA 0′ arginine residue has been replaced by aspartate (the MA 0′ residue of the 5-HT3B subunit). Unitary events are clearly resolved in the expanded section of data. D, the all-points amplitude histogram of the unitary events in D was fitted with the sum of two gaussians (representing closed and open states).

Variance analysis of 5-HT-induced current responses recorded from outside-out patches suggests a sub-pS unitary conductance (Fig. 2A; Table 1), similar to that reported previously (7Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) using analysis of whole-cell variance for WT 5-HT3A and mutant 5-HT3A(R432Q) receptors. This demonstrates that estimates of γ using variance analysis are not influenced by the whole-cell or outside-out patch recording configuration. A role for the -4′ arginine in the control of γ can be directly observed by comparing the amplitude of channels mediated by the 5-HT3A(R436D,R440A), in which the -4′ arginine is preserved, to the amplitude of channels mediated by 5-HT3A(QDA) mutation in which the -4′Arg was replaced by Gln. Outside-out membrane patches expressing 5-HT3A(R436D,R440A) receptors exhibited clearly discernible 5-HT-activated single channel events of a modestly reduced γ in comparison to 5-HT3A(QDA) receptors (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Collectively, these data reveal Arg-432 to have a limited influence on γ. In contrast to the R432Q exchange, replacement of Arg-436 of the 5-HT3A subunit by the equivalent 5-HT3B subunit residue (Asp) caused a substantial increase in γ such that single channel events were evident in outside-out patch recordings (Fig. 2C). From the all points amplitude histograms (Fig. 2D), we determined γ for channels mediated by the 5-HT3A(R436D) mutant receptor to be 9.1 ± 0.6 pS (Table 1). The importance of Arg-436 is further emphasized by the 5-HT3A(R432Q,R440A) receptor, which mediates 5-HT-activated single channels of a greatly reduced (p < 0.001) conductance compared with the 5-HT3(QDA) receptor (Fig. 2; Table 1). The exchange of the 5-HT3A Arg-440 residue by the equivalent 5-HT3B residue (Ala) produced an increase in γ compared with the WT 5-HT3A receptor (Fig. 2A; Table 1). Furthermore, the 5-HT-activated γ of the 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436D) receptor is reduced (p < 0.001) relative to the 5-HT3(QDA) receptor (Table 1). Therefore, the data emphasize that for the 5-HT3A receptor the nature of the residue occupying the MA 0′ position is an important determinant of γ, but Arg-440 (MA 4′) and to a lesser extent Arg-432 (MA -4′) are also influential in this regard.Introduction of MA 0′ Residues of nAChR into the 5-HT3A Subunit Influences γ—The γ of neuronal nicotinic receptors (e.g. α7 and α4β2)is much greater than that of the 5-HT3A receptor. Given that the much higher γ of the heteromeric 5-HT3A/5-HT3B receptor versus the homomeric 5-HT3A receptor is due, at least in part, to the nature of MA residues and the MA 0′ residue in particular, we investigated the influence of the residues that occupy homologous MA 0′ positions in the nAChR α7(Glu), β2(Gln), and α4(Phe) subunits on the γ of the 5-HT3A receptor (see Fig. 1B).Activation of the 5-HT3A(R436E) receptor elicited single channel events that were readily resolved in outside-out patch recordings (Fig. 3A; Table 1). Furthermore, the γ of the 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436E,R440A) receptor was similar to that of the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor, demonstrating that negatively charged Glu (the MA 0′ residue in the α7 subunit) and Asp (the MA 0′ residue in the 5-HT3B subunit) residues are approximately equally effective in facilitating γ at this location (Table 1). The 5-HT3A(R436Q) receptor also mediated discernible 5-HT-activated single channels (Fig. 3B; Table 1). The γ of the 5-HT3A(R432Q, R436Q,R440A) receptor was modestly reduced in comparison to the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor (Table 1). Hence, for the 5-HT3A receptor, these two constructs reveal that Gln (the MA 0′ residue of the nACh β2 subunit) facilitates γ, although it is not as effective in this regard as Asp or Glu (Table 1). No single channel events were resolvable in outside-out patch recordings of 5-HT3A(R436F) receptors, although inward current responses were clearly present (Fig. 3C). Variance analysis of whole-cell currents confirmed that this receptor has a γ below the resolution of single channel recording (Table 1). Similarly, the 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436F,R440A) receptor exhibited a low γ estimated by fluctuation analysis of the 5-HT-induced patch current (Table 1). These experiments demonstrate that the introduction into the 5-HT3A subunit of the MA 0′ residues found in the nAChR α7, β2, but not α4 subunits substantially increases γ.FIGURE 3Replacement of the MA 0′ residue of the 5-HT3A subunit by equivalent residues in nAChR subunits alters single channel conductance. A, 5-HT (10 μm)-activated currents recorded at -74 mV from an excised outside-out patch containing homomeric mutant 5-HT3A(R436E) receptors in which the 5-HT3A subunit MA 0′ arginine residue has been replaced by glutamate (the MA 0′ residue of the nAChR α7 subunit). Clearly resolvable channels were activated by 5-HT (10 μm) applied by pressure ejection. The all-points amplitude histogram was fitted with the sum of two gaussians to determine the single channel amplitude of -1.0 pA, in this"

In sperm, there are a number of signaling pathways required to achieve egg-fertilizing ability that depend upon an intracellular rise of cAMP. Most of these processes were thought to be mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinases. Here we report a new dependence for the cAMP-induced acrosome reaction involving Epac. The acrosome reaction is a specialized type of regulated exocytosis leading to a massive fusion between the outer acrosomal and the plasma membranes of sperm cells. Ca2+ is the archetypical trigger of regulated exocytosis, and we show here that its effects on acrosomal release are fully mediated by cAMP. Ca2+ failed to trigger acrosomal exocytosis when intracellular cAMP was depleted by an exogenously added phosphodiesterase or when Epac was sequestered by specific blocking antibodies. The nondiscriminating dibutyryl-cAMP and the Epac-selective 8-(p-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate analogues triggered the acrosome reaction in the effective absence of extracellular Ca2+. This indicates that cAMP, via Epac activation, has the ability to drive the whole cascade of events necessary to bring exocytosis to completion, including tethering and docking of the acrosome to the plasma membrane, priming of the fusion machinery, mobilization of intravesicular Ca2+, and ultimately, bilayer mixing and fusion. cAMP-elicited exocytosis was sensitive to anti-α-SNAP, anti-NSF, and anti-Rab3A antibodies, to intra-acrosomal Ca2+ chelators, and to botulinum toxins but was resistant to cAMP-dependent protein kinase blockers. These experiments thus identify Epac in human sperm and evince its indispensable role downstream of Ca2+ in exocytosis.

The AR is a secretory event that is completed by sperm of many species at an early stage of fertilization, when sperm contact glycoproteins of the egg's extracellular matrix, or zona pellucida (ZP) (12Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Ca2+ is an essential mediator of the AR. Two phases of ZP-evoked Ca2+ responses have been described, a first, transient phase mediated by voltage-gated channels and a second, sustained phase in which Ca2+ permeates into the sperm cytosol through store depletion-activated channels (SOC) (13O'Toole C.M. Arnoult C. Darszon A. Steinhardt R.A. Florman H.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In human sperm, the acrosome behaves as the internal store of releasable Ca2+ (14De Blas G. Michaut M. Trevino C.L. Tomes C.N. Yunes R. Darszon A. Mayorga L.S. J. Biol.

The first precedes (and drives) the opening of SOC channels on the plasma membrane, whereas the second follows this opening, taking place later in the fusion cascade, once the biochemical machinery for fusion has been assembled (14De Blas G.

Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an attempt to refine our understanding of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathways during the AR, we resorted to a plasma membrane streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilization protocol developed in our laboratory (17Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Incubating permeabilized sperm with Ca2+ resembles the physiological situation of Ca2+ influx through open SOC channels. Thus, ours constitutes a particularly attractive system to examine relatively late steps of the exocytic cascade, occurring after the sustained Ca2+ influx, while bypassing earlier pathways whose end point is the opening of SOC channels. In mammalian cells, cAMP is synthesized by a family of nine transmembrane and one soluble adenylyl cyclase (18Sunahara R.K. Taussig R. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 168-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 19Jaiswal B.S. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dev. 2000; 56: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The latter, known as sAC, appears to be the predominant form of adenylyl cyclase in sperm. Its direct activation by bicarbonate is thought to be responsible for the cAMP-induced changes in motility and AR mentioned above (21Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl.

Pancreas (Online). 2001; 2: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar). sAC defines a novel means for generating cAMP, implying that the second messenger can be generated at a distance from the membrane, closer to its required site of action, and circumventing the need for diffusion to reach distant targets. Models whereby cAMP can signal in a complex consisting of both sAC and effectors have been proposed (24Zippin J.H. Levin L.R. Buck J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 366-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The best characterized cAMP effectors include cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), cyclic nucleotide gated channels, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (25Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (26Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

PKA is composed of two separate polypeptides, the catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits that interact to form an inactive tetrameric holoenzyme (R2C2). PKA activation is achieved by binding of four molecules of cAMP to the R subunits, which induces a conformational change in the R subunits and leads to the dissociation of the holoenzyme into two free, catalytically active, C subunits and an R subunit homodimer (27Taylor S.S.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PKA has been described in spermatozoa from several mammalian species. Furthermore, it has been implicated in sperm motility and capacitation through still undefined signaling cascades that culminate in enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies have implicated PKA in the ZP-triggered (29Bielfeld P. Faridi A. Zaneveld L.J. De Jonge C.J. Fertil. Steril. 1994; 61: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and progesterone-triggered (30Harrison D.A. Carr D.W. Meizel S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) AR of human sperm. It has been proposed that activation by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ca2+ channels on the outer acrosomal membrane leads to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and, consequently, to the AR (11Breitbart H. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2003; 49: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). The second well known targets for cAMP are the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. These channels are directly opened by either cAMP of cGMP and are permeable to Ca2+ ions. They form heterooligomeric complexes composed of at least two distinct subunits (α and β) (31Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Both subunits have been found in the flagellum of mammalian sperm and implicated in motility (32Wiesner B. Weiner J. Middendorff R. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Weyand I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The most recently described cAMP effector is Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP). Epac is a Rap-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that is activated by the binding of cAMP to a cyclic nucleotide monophosphate-binding domain (33de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 34Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Two isoforms, Epac1 and Epac2, were described in mammalian cells, both containing a regulatory and a catalytic region in the N- and C-terminal portions of the protein, respectively. The regulatory domain contains the cAMP binding site, which autoinhibits the catalytic activity in the absence of cAMP (35de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Evidence suggesting a crucial role for Epac in exocytosis first arose from the lack of effect of specific blockers of PKA- and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels on this process (1Kashima Y. Miki T.

In light of the recently described multiplicity of proteins with which cAMP interacts, functions previously ascribed solely to PKA may need reevaluation. Specifically, we were interested in the possibility of an Epac-mediated, cAMP-dependent signaling pathway in the AR. Here we report a requirement for Epac in Ca2+-induced acrosomal release in human sperm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activation of Epac alone by a specific cAMP analogue is sufficient to achieve maximum exocytosis levels in intact and SLO-permeabilized cells. This exocytosis relies on the bona fide machinery required for fusion in all secretory cells. Epac functions in a relatively early step during the exocytosis cascade, prior to tethering by Rab3, priming by NSF/α-SNAP, docking by SNAREs, and intra-acrosomal Ca2+ release. Reagents—SLO was obtained from Corgenix (Peterborough, UK). Specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Epac were generated by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) using the synthetic peptide LREDNCHFLRVDK (molecular mass 1644.8) and affinity-purified on immobilized Epac peptide. This peptide, spanning residues 285-297 in human Epac1 (33de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) and 438-450 in human Epac2 (40Ueno H. Shibasaki T. Iwanaga T. Takahashi K. Yokoyama Y. Liu L.M. Yokoi N. Ozaki N. Matsukura S. Yano H. Seino S. Genomics. 2001; 78: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), is identical in both isoforms and corresponds to an unconserved region within the cAMP binding domain of Epac1 and the cAMP binding domain B of Epac2, located within the phosphate-binding cassette (41Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The sequence is unique to Epac and bears no homology with any other mammalian proteins whose amino acid sequences are deposited in public data bases. Mouse polyclonal antibodies to recombinant α-SNAP were previously described (42Tomes C.N. De Blas G.A. Michaut M.A. Farre E.V. Cherhitin O. Visconti P.E. Mayorga L.S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 11: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab3A (purified IgG) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

All other chemicals were reagent or analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma or from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Recombinant Proteins—A plasmid encoding the light chain of botulinum toxin E (His6-BoNT/E-LC) in pQE9 was generously provided by Dr. T. Binz (Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany). The DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and protein expression was induced overnight at 20 °C with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. A plasmid encoding His6-NSF in pQE9 (Qiagen) was a kind gift from Dr. S. Whiteheart (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). This construct was transformed into E. coli M15pRep4 (Qiagen), and protein expression was induced for 4 h at 30°C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Purification of recombinant proteins was accomplished according to The QIAexpressionist (available on the World Wide Web at www.qiagen.com), except that 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol were added to all buffers involved in the purification of His6-NSF. The expression plasmid pGEX2T containing the cDNA-encoding human Rab3A was generously provided by Drs. M. Colombo and P. Stahl (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Glutathione S-transferase-Rab3A was expressed in E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose following the manufacturer's instructions. SLO Permeabilization and AR Assay—After at least 2 days of abstinence, semen samples were provided by masturbation from healthy volunteer donors who were free from sexually transmitted diseases. Semen was allowed to liquefy for 30-60 min at 37 °C. Highly motile sperm were recovered by swim-up separation for 1 h in gamete preparation medium (GPM; Serono, Aubonne, Switzerland) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The composition of GPM is based on Earle's balanced salt solution (0.2 g/liter CaCl2, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.097 g/liter MgSO4, 6.8 g/liter NaCl, 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.14 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 1 g/liter d-glucose, 0.01 g/liter phenol red) supplemented with 0.1 g/liter sodium pyruvate and 1 mg/ml human serum albumin. GPM contains no antibiotics. The pH and osmolality were maintained within the ranges 7.2-7.4 and 278-288 mosm, respectively. After swim up, sperm concentration was adjusted to 5-10 × 106/ml, and the cells were incubated for at least 2 h under conditions that support capacitation (GPM; 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air). Permeabilization was accomplished as previously described (17Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed spermatozoa were resuspended in cold PBS containing 0.4 units/ml SLO for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, inhibitors were added when indicated, and cells were further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After the addition of stimulants to the sperm suspensions, incubation proceeded at 37 °C for 15 min. For the experiments with the photoinhibitable Ca2+ chelator NP-EGTA-AM, SLO-permeabilized sperm were preloaded with 10 μm NP-EGTA-AM before incubating in the presence of inhibitors and stimulants as described, except that all procedures were carried out in the dark (supplemental Fig. S1A). Alternatively, NP-EGTA-AM preloaded sperm were incubated first with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and second with the inhibitors to test, also in the dark (supplemental Fig. S1B). In all cases, photolysis of the chelator was induced at the end of the second incubation by 2-min exposure to a UV transilluminator FBTIV-614 (Fisher). Incubations proceeded for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. 10 μl of each reaction mixture were spotted on 8-well slides, air-dried and fixed/permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 30 s. Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with FITC-coupled PSA according to Ref. 43Mendoza C. Carreras A. Moos J. Tesarik J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1992; 95: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar. At least 200 cells were scored using a Nikon microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Negative (no stimulation) and positive (10 μm Ca2+) controls were included in all experiments. For each experiment, the data were normalized by subtracting the number of reacted spermatozoa in the negative control from all values and expressing the result as a percentage of the AR observed in the positive control. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Sperm were washed in PBS, and proteins were extracted in sample buffer (44Tomes C.N. Carballada R. Moses D.F. Katz D.F. Saling P.M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), separated on polyacrylamide slab gels according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in washing buffer (PBS, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with the anti-Epac antibody (0.92 μg/ml) preblocked or not with 12 nm (0.02 μg/ml) immunogenic peptide for 60 min at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody (0.25 μg/ml) with 45-min incubations. Excess first and second antibodies were removed by washing five times for 10 min each in washing buffer. Detection was accomplished with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR film for 5-30 s. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells maintained in GPM for 3 h under capacitating conditions were washed twice with PBS and allowed to air-dry on polylysine-coated, 9-mm round coverslips before fixing/permeabilizing in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Sperm were incubated in PBS containing 50 mm glycine for at least 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS containing 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; average Mr = 40,000; ICN) (PBS/PVP). Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubation in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS/PVP for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-Epac antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (7.6 μg/ml), pretreated or not with blocking peptide (0.1 μm, 0.16 μg/ml), added to the coverslips, and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C in a moisturized chamber. After washing three times with PBS/PVP, TRITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG (15 μg/ml in 0.5% horse serum in PBS/PVP) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing as before, samples were mounted with Gelvatol and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Slides were examined with an Eclipse TE3000 Nikon microscope equipped with a Plan Apo 60×/1.40 oil objective and a Hamamatsu Orca 100 camera (Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ) operated with MetaMorph 6.1 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Background was subtracted, and brightness/contrast were adjusted to render an all-or-nothing labeling pattern using Jasc Paint Shop Pro 6.02 (Jasc Software; available on the World Wide Web at www.corel.com). Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein assay in 96-well microplates. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard, and the results were quantified on a Bio-Rad 3550 Microplate Reader. Statistical Analysis—Data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. The Tukey-Kramer test was used for pairwise comparisons. The results are listed as supplemental data (Tables S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 corresponding to data depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Only significant differences (p < 0.05) are discussed. Reagents that Mimic cAMP Trigger AR in SLO-permeabilized Sperm—If the opening of Ca2+ channels elicited by PKA (11Breitbart H. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2003; 49: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar) was the only cAMP-dependent signaling pathway during the AR, it would be expected that reagents that augment the intracellular concentration of cAMP would not have an effect in cells where the plasma membrane is permeabilized by SLO, bypassing any requirement for ion channel opening. However, when SLO-permeabilized human sperm were incubated with 1 mm Bt2cAMP they underwent acrosomal exocytosis of a magnitude similar to that achieved by 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the cAMP endogenously synthesized by sperm must be enough to cause a maximal response, given that 100 μm IBMX (a PDE inhibitor) elicited the same level of exocytosis as either Ca2+ or Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that an alternative mechanism, not related to PKA-induced opening of Ca2+ channels, operates during the cAMP-elicited AR. This cAMP-dependent step must be located downstream of the influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol through SOC channels. cAMP-induced AR Does Not Require Extracellular Ca2+—The addition of micromolar concentrations (10-500 μm) of Ca2+ triggers acrosomal exocytosis in permeabilized spermatozoa. The same effect is observed without Ca2+ addition when Bt2cAMP is used as inducer (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, free Ca2+ concentration in the reaction mixture, which contains 0.5 mm EGTA, is on the order of 10-7 m (14De Blas G. Michaut M. Trevino C.L. Tomes C.N. Yunes R. Darszon A. Mayorga L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49326-49331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When 5 mm EGTA is added to the system, free Ca2+ concentration drops to less than 10 nm. Even at this very low Ca2+"

Ca2+ ion plays a critical role in controlling a large number of neuronal processes, including neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, neurite outgrowth, growth cone behavior, and apoptosis (1Berridge M.J.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 331-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The specificity of Ca2+ signaling lies in complex spatial and temporal patterns mediated by the activity of membrane channels and transporters (3Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). Among these, Na+/Ca2+-exchange plays a predominant role in transporting Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Under normal physiological conditions, the exchange process couples the electrochemical Na+ gradient to the extrusion of Ca2+. However, Na+/Ca2+-exchange can also catalyze Ca2+ influx under conditions in which the Na+ gradient and/or the membrane potential are compromised (4Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). The role of Na+/Ca2+-exchange during pathological conditions such as ischemia is a controversial issue, with some studies suggesting a neuroprotective effect through enhanced Ca2+ extrusion, whereas others suggest a damaging effect due to exchanger-mediated Ca2+ influx (5Choi D.W.

(K+-independent) exchangers, NCX1–3 (SLC8A1–3) and the K+-dependent NCKX exchangers, NCKX1–4 (SLC24A1–4). The cardiac Na+/Ca2+-exchanger NCX1 is the best characterized member of the former, NCX, family (12Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Pfügers Arch. 2004; 447: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas the rod photoreceptor Na+/(Ca2++K+)-exchanger NCKX1 is the most extensively studied member of the latter, NCKX, family (13Schnetkamp P.P. Pfügers Arch. 2004; 447: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The pattern of expression of the NCX family members in brain has been characterized (14Papa M. Canitano A. Boscia F. Castaldo P. Sellitti S. Porzig H. Taglialatela M. Annunziato L. J. Comp.

Porzig H. Neruon. 1995; 15: 1077-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). More recently, this role has been confirmed in mice lacking the NCX2 protein. Knock-out animals display reduced Ca2+ clearance from axon terminals and increased synaptic plasticity associated with enhancements in both learning and memory (16Jeon D. Yang Y.M. Jeong M.J. Philipson K.D. Rhim H. Shin H.S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 965-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Gene products in the NCKX branch of the exchanger superfamily have only recently been identified and characterized. The expression of NCKX1 is restricted essentially to retina, whereas NCKX2, NCKX3, and NCKX4 are robustly and broadly expressed with distinct, but overlapping, regional distributions among brain neurons (17Lytton J.

Moreover, in the context of so many different related gene products, the specific roles for any one isoform have not yet been defined. To address these issues, we used a genetargeting approach to knock out expression of NCKX2, the major neuronally expressed isoform in this family. Mice lacking NCKX2 were analyzed molecularly, cellularly, and behaviorally, and found to exhibit deficits in neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, in synaptic plasticity, and in measures of motor learning and memory.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of NCKX2 Knock-out Mice—A mouse 129/SvJ genomic library (Stratagene) was probed with a PCR-derived fragment from exon 2 of mouse nckx2 to yield clones spanning a genomic region of ∼15 kb encompassing only exon 2. A targeting construct was engineered by combining two contiguous ∼3-kb HindIII genomic fragments with a polymerase II promoter-driven neomycin resistance cassette (22Tsuzuki T. Rancourt D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the herpes simplex virus promoter-driven thymidine kinase gene derived from the pflox vector (23Marth J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), to create the molecule illustrated in Fig. 1A, in which the neomycin resistance gene has been inserted in the antisense orientation into the unique HindIII site within exon 2, while the thymidine kinase gene flanks the 5′ end of the upstream nckx2 fragment. An NotI fragment of ∼11 kb was isolated and used to electroporate R1 embryonic stem cells, which were subjected to positive-negative selection as previous described (22Tsuzuki T. Rancourt D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Targeted cells were identified by Southern blot using an upstream ApaI-HindIII probe. Positive clones were expanded, karyotyped, and re-screened to confirm the targeted locus before being used for blastocyst injections to create chimeric mice, as previously described (24Lees-Miller J.P. Guo J. Somers J.R. Roach D.E. Sheldon R.S. Rancourt D.E. Duff H.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1856-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Male chimeras were then bred with C57Bl/6 females, and agouti animals screened by Southern blot to identify recombinant nckx2(+/–) heterozygous animals. Subsequent animal genotyping was conducted using a mixed PCR primer protocol. Most studies were performed on F2 animals from nckx2(+/–) heterozygote crosses, using littermates of different genotypes for comparison. In some experiments, particularly the brain slice electrophysiology, nckx2(+/–) heterozygote animals derived from more than ten C57Bl/6 backcrosses were bred to generate the (+/+) and (–/–) littermates studied. Embryonic stem cell targeting and chimeric mice production were conducted at the Center for Mouse Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary. Mice were maintained and treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care as determined by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee. Mice were sacrificed for all experiments described below following halothane anesthesia.Molecular Analyses—All molecular biology procedures were conducted essentially according to standard protocols (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY2005Google Scholar). Genotyping of mice was performed using genomic DNA isolated by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation from either tail or ear-punch biopsies. For Southern analysis, DNA was digested overnight with EcoRI, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to nylon, and probed with a digoxigenin-labeled genomic fragment found upstream of the targeting sequence. This probe recognizes an 11-kb band in genomic DNA from wild-type nckx2, and an 8-kb band in the targeted allele (Fig. 1A). For PCR analysis, we employed forward (P2, GGCATGTGTGCTCTGTTTTCTA) and reverse (P1, CCACATAGGCGAAATAAGCTGT) primers from within exon 2 of mouse nckx2 and forward primer from the neomycin resistance cassette (P3, CGGGCCTCGTTCATGAATATTC; this primer is actually found as the reverse complement of sequences from the murine polymerase II promoter at the 5′-end of the neomycin resistance cassette). Amplification from wild-type genomic DNA resulted in a band of 172 nucleotides between primers P1 and P2, whereas amplification from the targeted locus resulted in a band of 283 nucleotides between primers P1 and P3 (see Fig. 1A).Total cellular RNA was isolated from whole brain or eyes of 4- to 5-month-old mice of different genotype by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and CsCl centrifugation. 10 μg of total RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose electrophoresis, transferred to nylon, and analyzed at high stringency essentially as described previously (26Wu K.-D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled probes corresponding to nucleotides 379–1102 of rat nckx2 exon 2 (5′ probe) or nucleotides 5004–8086 of exon 12 (3′ probe), nucleotides 11–1376 of rat nckx1, nucleotides 259–1846 of mouse nckx3, nucleotides 680–1398 of mouse nckx4, nucleotides 1815–3290 of rat ncx1, nucleotides 1016–1907 of rat ncx2, or nucleotides 1–1273 of rat gapdh.A membrane fraction, enriched in synaptic markers, was isolated from homogenized whole brains of mice of each genotype according to published procedures (27Salvaterra P.M. Matthews D.A. Neurochem. Res. 1980; 5: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 μg of this membrane fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against either NCKX2 (polyclonal PA-926 (from Affinity BioReagents, Inc.), polyclonal N2F (29Cai X.

Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12482-12488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)).Morphological Analyses—Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the brain was removed and fixed overnight in the same solution. For histological analysis, brains were then embedded in paraffin, and 8-μm parasagittal sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard procedures. Immunofluorescence was performed on 50-μm free floating brain horizontal sections cut by using a vibratome. The sections were blocked for 1 h in working solution (3% donkey serum, 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.2% Tween 20 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), then incubated at 4 °C overnight with affinity-purified polyclonal N2F antibody diluted 1:1000 in working solution. After three rinses with working solution diluted 1:3 with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, the sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:1000 in working solution. After three more washes with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, the sections were mounted on slides, observed with a 63× oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope, and photographed using a SPOT RT-Slider camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Exposure and contrast of the photographs (adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS) from the nckx2(–/–) animal sections were the same as those used to photograph and adjust the wild-type sections.Eyes from 10-week-old mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline at room temperature for 2 h, cryoprotected by soaking in 30% sucrose solution, and embedded in OCT. 11-μm cryostat sections were mounted on glass slides, blocked, and permeabilized with 10% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and then analyzed using either the M/L-cone-specific antibody, COS-1 (32Szel A. Rohlich P. Caffe A.R. van Veen T. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 35: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) followed by Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, or with rhodamine-conjugated peanut agglutininlectin, which specifically recognizes cone outer segment sheaths (33Blanks J.C. Johnson L.V. J. Comp. Neurol. 1983; 221: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Labeled eye sections were observed and photographed as described above.Neuronal Cell Culture and Ca2+ Imaging—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from new born mouse pups obtained either from nckx2(–/–) or nckx2(+/+) breeding pairs, which were each the littermate progeny of nckx2(+/–) matings. Neurons were grown and maintained in culture for 14–17 days as described previously (8Kiedrowski L. Czyz A. Baranauskas G. Li X.F. Lytton J. J Neurochem. 2004; 90: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To monitor Ca2+ fluxes associated with the reverse action of NCKX exchangers, cells were first loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-FF (using the acetoxymethyl ester obtained from Teflabs) and then incubated in 96.7 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 57.9 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine-Cl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm ouabain, 10 μm nifedipine, 10 μm 2,3-dioxo6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), 10 μm (5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801), 1 mm iodoacetate, 2 μm rotenone, 3 μg/ml oligomycin, and 10 μm KB-R7943. These conditions were chosen to inhibit all other pathways for calcium entry and to block the production of cellular ATP that will drive ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration and efflux pathways. The accumulation of [Ca2+] that is a measure of exchanger-dependent Ca2+ flux is compromised if any of these inhibitors are not present (8Kiedrowski L. Czyz A. Baranauskas G. Li X.F. Lytton J. J Neurochem. 2004; 90: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Czyz A. Kiedrowski L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Kiedrowski L. Czyz A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In some experiments (Fig. 4E),aK+-free medium was used. This medium had the same composition as that described above except KCl was omitted and NaCl and N-methyl-d-glutamine-Cl concentrations were increased to 100 and 59.6 mm, respectively. Ca2+ uptake via NCKX was then initiated by equilibrating the plasma membrane Na+ gradient using 5 μm gramicidin. The change in [Ca2+] was monitored by measuring the fluorescence emitted by neuronal cell bodies excited at either 340 or 380 nm using an Attofluor digital imaging system fitted to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. Calibration and conversion from fluorescence units to Ca2+ flux, measured in micromolar/min was performed as described previously (8Kiedrowski L. Czyz A. Baranauskas G. Li X.F. Lytton J. J Neurochem. 2004; 90: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, more than 90% of the resulting Ca2+ flux is dependent upon external K+, consistent with the requirements of NCKX for activity (see Fig. 4E).FIGURE 4NCKX-mediated Ca2+ entry into cultured cortical neurons. A and B, Ca2+-entry via plasma membrane K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+-exchangers was initiated by the addition of 5 μm gramicidin (gramic) to equilibrate the Na+ gradient, and monitored by Fura-FF fluorescence, in cortical neurons cultured from nckx2 wild-type (+/+) or knockout (–/–) mice. Ca2+ flux via pathways other than K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+-exchangers was prevented by the addition, at the arrow, of medium containing a mixture of various inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”), including the NCX inhibitor KB-R7943 (KB-R) plus 5 mm KCl (K5). In each panel the left plot shows individual traces (fluorescence data converted to [Ca2+]) obtained from the indicated number of cells in one microscopic field, whereas the right plot shows averaged data. C, a portion of the data from A and B has been replotted on a linear scale to illustrate the linear regression fit used to calculate the rate of gramicidin-induced [Ca2+] rise. D, summary data for the rate of [Ca2+] rise obtained from 15 experiments on four different neuronal cultures for each genotype. **, p < 0.01 (Mann-Whitney rank sum test). E, the K+ dependence of Ca2+ entry into nckx2 wild-type cortical neurons, measured as described above for A and B, except that incubation solutions initially lacked KCl, which was then added back at a concentration of 5 mm (K5). Under the conditions used for these experiments, more than 90% of the rate of [Ca2+] rise depends upon the presence of K+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Brain Slice Electrophysiology—Hippocampal slices (400-μm thickness) of nckx2(+/+) or nckx2(–/–) age-matched littermates (8–9 weeks old for LTP measurements and 3–4 weeks old for LTD measurements) were prepared in ice-cold high sucrose slicing solution (87 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glucose, and 75 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2, and then incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (126 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 for at least 1 h at 35°C prior to recording at 25 °C. Extracellular field potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum area of CA1 neurons using a glass recording microelectrode filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (3- to 5-MΩ resistance). Synaptic responses were elicited by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral fibers using a monopolar platinum stimulating electrode (grounded to the bath) placed in the stratum radiatum area close to the CA2 region, ∼100 μm from the glass recording microelectrode. A series of test responses were elicited to determine a baseline stimulation intensity that corresponded to ∼50% of the maximum evoked response. fEPSPs were then recorded at 0.1 Hz for 10 min. LTP was initiated with two 0.5-s, 100-Hz stimulation trains, and LTD was invoked by 15 min of 1-Hz stimulation. fEPSPs recordings were continued at 0.1 Hz for 30–45 min following initiation of either LTP or LTD. Traces were acquired using a Digidata 1340 interface, recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, and analyzed using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The fEPSP slope was calculated from the rising phase (10–90%) of the peak response.For whole cell current-clamp analysis of CA1 pyramidal neurons, hippocampal slices cut as described above were transferred into buffer composed of 125 mm NaCl, 3.25 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 25 mm d-glucose, and saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, placed in the recording chamber of a Zeiss Axioskop FS-2 microscope, and maintained at 22 °C as a submerged preparation. Neurons were visualized using differential interference contrast optics and infrared light transmission. All recordings were carried out in the presence of synaptic blockers that were bath-applied after obtaining the initial seal: 50 μm picrotoxin, 25 μm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, 10 μm 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 1 μm CGP 55845. Pipettes had a resistance of 4–8 mΩ with access resistance of 8–15 MΩ. Our internal solution for current clamp recordings consisted of 130 mm potassium gluconate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 7 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm di-tris-creatine phosphate, 2 mm Tris-ATP, and 0.5 mm sodium GTP, pH 7.3, with KOH. Membrane potential was then recorded in response to 300-ms current injection pulses stepping from –60 pA to +185 pA in 5-pA increments. Data were collected using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier and pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.).Behavioral Assessment—A battery of behavioral tests, including appearance and reflexes and tests of sensorimotor functions, visual and auditory perception, learning, and memory, were conducted by NeuroInvestigations, Inc. at the Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, according to established procedures (36Whishaw I.Q. Haun F. Kolb B. Windhorst U. Johansson H. Modern Techniques in Neuroscience Research. Springer, Berlin1999: 1243-1271Crossref Google Scholar). Twelve 4- to 5-month-old, age-matched litter-mate mice, six female and six male, of each genotype (wild-type and nckx2 knock-out) were tested. The accelerating rotating rod (rotarod) task consists of a 5-cm round drum suspended between Plexiglas walls 24 cm above a soft mat. Mice were subjected to two three-trial sessions, one session per day. For each trial the mice were first placed on the stationary rod for 1 min. At that point, the rod was rotated at 5 rpm for 1 min, and subsequently the speed increased in 5-rpm increments each minute until the mouse fell off, or 50 rpm was reached. The speed of the rod at which the mice fell off was then averaged for each session and genotype. The Morris water maze task hidden platform test was performed by placing the mice into a round pool of opaque water from one of four different peripheral start locations. The mice were allowed to swim about within the pool for 60 s to locate a platform hidden just beneath the surface of the water. The platform remained in the same location throughout the test. Distal clues to orientation were provided on the four walls of the room, visible above the level of the water through the Plexiglas walls of the pool, but there were no local cues within the pool. Each mouse was given a block of four trials with 10 min between each trial, twice a day for 7 days. The time required to find the platform was averaged over the four trials within each block and recorded. In the moving platform version of the Morris water maze task, mice were first given a block of 4 trials once per day for 4 days during which the hidden platform was moved to a novel location on each day. On the subsequent 6 test days, the platform was left in the same position for 2 days at a time, such that on days 5, 7, and 9 the platform was in a novel location, but on days 6, 8, and 10, the platform was in the same location as it had been on the previous day. A block of four test trials was administered on each day. The time taken during each test trial to find the platform in either the novel or the same location was then averaged for all the mice within each genotype across the test days.Electroretinography—Mice were dark-adapted for at least 60 min and anesthetized, and retinal recordings were obtained essentially as described previously (37Tremblay F. Abdel-Majid R. Neumann P.E. Vision Res. 2002; 42: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Scotopic recordings were obtained by stimulating from complete darkness with a series of light flashes of increasing intensity, spanning 4.8 log units up to a maximum flash intensity of 10 cd·s/m2 in steps of 0.4 log units using an interstimulus rate of 0.3 Hz or lower. Recordings in photopic conditions were performed after 10 min of exposure to a white background intensity of 32 cd/m2. Flashes of intensity ranging from 0.6 to 10 cd·s/m2 were then delivered at a rate of 0.9 Hz.Statistics—Data are presented in all plots as the means ± S.E. Differences between genotypes were tested either using the t test statistic, one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni posttest analysis, or the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Statistically significant differences was accepted with p values of <0.05.RESULTSNCKX2 Knock-out—The mouse nckx2 gene was disrupted as illustrated in Fig. 1. The expression of the 11-kb nckx2 transcript in brain RNA was analyzed by Northern blot with probes from either the 5′-end (exon 2; nucleotides 379–1102) or the 3′-end (probe from exon 12; nucleotides 5004–8086). As illustrated in Fig. 1C, although the nckx2 transcript was still detected with the 3′-end probe, the size of the band was slightly smaller in brain RNA from the knock-out animals as compared with wild type. The shift in size is due to the exclusion of the disrupted exon 2 from the transcript, because blots with the exon 2 probe revealed complete loss of signal in the knock-out animals (Figs. 1C and 3A).FIGURE 3Expression of other Ca2+ transporters.

https://openalex.org/W1979279652,"Vitamin E deficiency increases expression of the CD36 scavenger receptor, suggesting specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways modulated by α-tocopherol. We show here that α-tocopherol down-regulated CD36 expression (mRNA and protein) in oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated THP-1 monocytes, but not in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, α-tocopherol treatment of monocytes led to reduction of fluorescent oxLDL-3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate binding and uptake. Protein kinase C (PKC) appears not to be involved because neither activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate nor inhibition by PKC412 was affected by α-tocopherol. However, α-tocopherol could partially prevent CD36 induction after stimulation with a specific agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ; troglitazone), indicating that this pathway is susceptible to α-tocopherol action. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) at Ser473 was increased by oxLDL, and α-tocopherol could prevent this event. Expression of PKB stimulated the CD36 promoter as well as a PPARγ element-driven reporter gene, whereas an inactive PKB mutant had no effect. Moreover, coexpression of PPARγ and PKB led to additive induction of CD36 expression. Altogether, our results support the existence of PKB/PPARγ signaling pathways that mediate CD36 expression in response to oxLDL. The activation of CD36 expression by PKB suggests that both lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid uptake are stimulated by PKB.

Exposure of monocytes to oxLDL may alter gene expression and signaling, making them more susceptible to the following pro-atherogenic stimuli. The migration of monocytes into the intima and the conversion of monocytes/macrophages into foam cells represent initial steps in atherosclerosis. Current strategies to prevent atherosclerosis are aimed either at lowering the cholesterol load of lipoproteins or at reducing oxidative stress. Vitamin E is a redox-active natural compound that can act, depending on the conditions, as a pro- or antioxidant on low density lipoproteins (LDL) in vitro and in vivo (2Reaven P.D. Khouw A.

The major form of vitamin E in human plasma is α-tocopherol, and reduced plasma levels of α-tocopherol, such as in vitamin E-deficient mice, increase the incidence of atherosclerosis (6Terasawa Y. Ladha Z. Leonard S.W. Morrow J.D. Newland D. Sanan D. Packer L. Traber M.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13830-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Animal and cell culture studies strongly suggest that vitamin E can prevent atherosclerosis; however, the anti-atherogenic effects in clinical trials are still controversial (7Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.-M. Azzi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Brigelius-Flohe R. Kelly F.J. Salonen J.T. Neuzil J. Zingg J.-M. Azzi A. Am. J. Clin.

Nevertheless, since many compounds exist that can interfere with the oxidation of LDL without being equally effective, alternative modes of action have been proposed for atherosclerosis prevention, such as modulation of gene expression and cell signaling (reviewed in Refs. 7Ricciarelli R.

Activation of CD36 by interleukin-4, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, and oxLDL in murine macrophages is dependent on PKC and PPARγ (36Feng J. Han J. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. Gotto Jr., A.M.

In VSMC, activation of PKB by oxLDL induces proliferation (40Chien M.W. Chien C.S. Hsiao L.D. Lin C.H. Yang C.M. J.

PKB has a wide range of cell targets, and its increased activity can be found during atherosclerosis and tumorigenesis (42Yang Z.Z. Tschopp O. Baudry A. Dummler B. Hynx D. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. Soc.

However, THP-1 monocytes bind significant amounts of oxLDL (48Wang X. Greilberger J. Jurgens G. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and monocytes isolated from CD36-deficient people have a decreased capacity to take up oxLDL (31Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H.

We show here that vitamin E-deficient rats have increased expression of CD36 mRNA, indicating specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways modulated in vivo by α-tocopherol. In THP-1 monocytes, expression of the CD36 scavenger receptor was increased by oxLDL, and α-tocopherol treatment normalized it at both the protein and mRNA levels. PKC was not involved in the observed effects, but overexpression of PKB and PPARγ led to additive induction of CD36 promoter activity. Phosphorylation of PKB was increased by oxLDL, and α-tocopherol prevented it. Hence, our results suggest the existence of signaling pathways involving PPARγ and PKB that regulate CD36 expression in response to oxLDL and α-tocopherol in THP-1 monocytes. Cell Culture and Treatments—(R,R,R)-α-Tocopherol (Cognis) was dissolved in ethanol, and the concentration of the stock solutions was confirmed spectrophotometrically. The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 1.0 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 100 μmol/liter l-ascorbic acid (Sigma). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. THP-1 monocytes (106/plate) were plated 24 h before treatment with oxLDL (20 μg/ml), α-tocopherol (50 μmol/liter), or ethanol (0.1%) as a solvent control. Treatments with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma), PKC412 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Willi, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), and troglitazone (Alexis) were done as described below. LDL (Intracel) were oxidized by reaction with 200 μmol/liter CuSO4 for 18 h, a procedure that leads to heavily oxidized LDL, and oxidation was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis (15Ricciarelli R.

CD36 Determination in Vitamin E-deficient Rats—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed five in a cage. The temperature was maintained between 21 and 22 °C with a dark/light cycle of 12/12 h and with the lights turned on from 6.00 to 18.00 h. Three-month-old rats were randomly divided into two dietary groups: control rats fed ad libitum with a standard pellet diet (Harlan Italy) and rats fed a vitamin E-deficient diet. Fresh water was available ad libitum. During the experiment, the body weights of the vitamin E-deficient rats were unchanged; however, the rats had generally increased levels of urinary aldehydes (malon-dialdehydes, acetaldehydes, formaldehydes, propionaldehydes, and acetone) compared with control animals (data not shown). Tissue samples were taken in the morning under anesthesia with Nembutal (50 mg in 1 ml of saline/kg of body weight) following a 16-h (overnight) fasting period. The vitamin E levels (nmol/g of wet tissue) in the livers of the sacrificed rats were as follows: control group at the start of the experiment, 3 months old, 32.4 ± 2.92; control group, 21-24 months old, 71.0 ± 6.76; and vitamin E-deficient group, 21 months old, 1.6 ± 0.25. The samples were stored in RNAlater reagent (Qiagen Inc.) at -80 °C and later homogenized using a Polytron. Total tissue RNA was isolated using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). Determination of rat CD36 mRNA expression by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was done as described and quantified after normalization to rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression (52Ricciarelli R.

CD36 expression was measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD36 monoclonal antibody (Ancell Corp.) diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin. A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample was assessed; data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Determination of CD36 mRNA by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNA extraction kit. Semiquantitative assays for CD36 mRNA expression were performed as described previously (15Ricciarelli R.

Determination of Total CD36 Expression by Western Blotting—Protein extraction and Western blotting were done according to standard methods with mouse anti-human CD36 monoclonal primary antibody (Ancell Corp.) and sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) (55Zingg J.-M. Ricciarelli R. Andorno E. Azzi A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used as an internal control. Western blotting for PKB was done according to the protocol provided (Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Chemiluminescence was monitored by exposure to Hyperfilm ECL film (Amersham Biosciences), and the signals were analyzed using a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science). Labeling and Uptake of oxLDL—Labeling of oxLDL with 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO; Molecular Probes) and blocking of oxLDL-DiO uptake with anti-CD36 antibody were done as described previously (15Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.-M. Azzi A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The uptake and binding of oxLDL-DiO were studied by FACS. The cells were pretreated for 16 h with 20 μg/ml oxLDL, 50 μmol/liter α-tocopherol, or 0.1% ethanol (solvent control) and then incubated with oxLDL-DiO (5 μg/ml of medium). For the uptake experiments, incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 6 h; and for the binding experiment, incubation was performed at 4 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and 3% bovine serum albumin and once with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. FACS was performed with a FACScan, and data were analyzed using CellQuest software. Plasmids, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—The firefly luciferase reporter plasmids used were pCD36 (15Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.-M. Azzi A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), pDR1 (56d'Abramo C. Massone S. Zingg J.-M. Pizzuti A. Marambaud P. Dalla Piccola B. Azzi A. Marinari U.M.

The PPARγ expression vector used contains the PPARγ cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (56d'Abramo C. Massone S. Zingg J.-M. Pizzuti A. Marambaud P. Dalla Piccola B. Azzi A. Marinari U.M. Pronzato M.A. Ricciarelli R. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). THP-1 monocytes were transfected for 3 h with the indicated reporter and expression plasmids using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) and then treated with 0.1% ethanol (solvent control) or 50 μmol/liter α-tocopherol for an additional 21 h. HEK293 cells were transfected for 3 h using Superfect (Qiagen Inc.). The medium was then changed, and the cells were treated with 0.1% ethanol (solvent control) or 50 μmol/liter α-tocopherol and incubated for an additional 21 h. Extracts were prepared, and promoter activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp.) with a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The promoter-firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the thymidine kinase promoter-Renilla luciferase activities, and the activities of the control transfections were set to 100%. Apoptosis Assay—THP-1 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of oxLDL for 24 and 48 h and then stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C (58Vicca S. Hennequin C.

A total of 200 cells for each treatment were counted, and the percentage of apoptotic cells with condensed nuclei was quantified. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. as indicated in the figure legends. For FACS results, the median fluorescence intensity was determined, and the mean ± S.D. was calculated as described in the figure legends. Student's t test was used to analyze the significant differences between two conditions. A p value <0.05 was taken as significant and is indicated by asterisks in the figures. Vitamin E Deficiency in Rats Leads to CD36 Overexpression—Our previous in vitro results suggested that, in VSMC and HL-60 cells, the expression level of CD36 is inhibited by α-tocopherol, leading to reduced uptake of oxLDL (15Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.-M. Azzi A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To assess whether a similar regulation takes place also in vivo, rats were deprived of α-tocopherol intake for 21 months, and the expression level of CD36 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. α-Tocopherol deficiency led to a significantly higher level of liver CD36 expression (238 ± 41% (n = 4); p < 0.028) compared with rats kept on a normal diet (set to 100 ± 38% (n = 4)). The increased level of urinary aldehydes observed in vitamin E-deficient animals (data not shown) suggests increased oxidative stress; thus, α-tocopherol could inhibit CD36 expression by reducing oxidative stress or, alternatively, by interfering with signal transduction and gene expression modulated by oxidized molecules. α-Tocopherol Inhibits CD36 Surface Overexpression Induced by oxLDL in THP-1 Monocytes—The in vivo results described above could be explained by increased generation of oxLDL in vitamin E-deficient animals, an event that possibly could be prevented by supplementation with α-tocopherol. On the other hand, it has been shown that α-tocopherol can reduce CD36 expression in VSMC and monocytes/macrophages by interfering with signal transduction and CD36 gene expression (15Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.-M. Azzi A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Venugopal S.K. Devaraj S. Jialal I. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 175: 213-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To delineate these two pathways affected by α-tocopherol, CD36 expression was induced by oxLDL in THP-1 monocytes, and we checked whether α-tocopherol could interfere with this pro-atherogenic stimulus. By using oxLDL in this model system, a reduction of CD36 overexpression by α-tocopherol would be the consequence of inhibition of oxLDL-induced CD36 transcription rather than the result of inhibition of LDL oxidation. THP-1 monocytes were treated for 24 h with oxLDL (20 μg/ml), ethanol (0.1%; solvent control), or α-tocopherol (50 μmol/liter), and CD36 surface expression was analyzed by FACS. oxLDL significantly induced CD36 surface expression in THP-1 monocytes, and α-tocopherol reduced it by 18 ± 11% (Fig. 1). Treatment with α-tocopherol in the absence of oxLDL stimulation did not reduce CD36 expression in THP-1 mo"
https://openalex.org/W2044432481,"Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that binds GC-rich cis elements. Many posttranslational modifications have been implicated in the regulation of Sp1 activity. We now provide evidence for a novel mechanism of Sp1 regulation involving the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1). Western blot analysis revealed a high molecular mass Sp1 of 125 kDa that is stabilized by a selective SUMO hydrolase inhibitor and destabilized by a specific SUMO-1 hydrolase. The covalent modification of Sp1 by endogenous SUMO-1 and SUMO-1 that has been fused to green fluorescent protein was demonstrated using transient transfection assays. A high probability sumoylation consensus motif, VK16IE18, is located within the N-terminal negative regulatory domain of Sp1. Either arginine substitution for lysine 16 (Sp1(K16R)) or alanine substitution for glutamic acid 18 (Sp1(E18A)), abrogated Sp1 sumoylation. In vitro SUMO-1 covalently bound affinity-purified GST-Sp1, but not GST-Sp1(K16R). In vivo Sp1 was determined to be N-terminally cleaved, while Sp1(K16R) could not be cleaved indicating that sumoylation and cleavage are coupled through the key regulatory lysine 16. This coupling was evident by the demonstration of an inverse relationship between cellular SUMO-modified Sp1 and N-terminally cleaved Sp1. Compared with Sp1, sumoylation-deficient Sp1(E18A) exhibited enhanced cleavage and was a better transcriptional activator, while constitutively SUMO-1-modified Sp1 was deficient in proteolytic processing and repressed Sp1 transcriptional activity. The repressive effect of sumoylation on Sp1 activity is emphasized through the use of a GAL4 based transactivation assay. A model is proposed defining a mechanism by which sumoylation preserves the integrity of a negative regulatory domain thereby allowing for the inhibition of Sp-dependent transcription. Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that binds GC-rich cis elements. Many posttranslational modifications have been implicated in the regulation of Sp1 activity. We now provide evidence for a novel mechanism of Sp1 regulation involving the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1). Western blot analysis revealed a high molecular mass Sp1 of 125 kDa that is stabilized by a selective SUMO hydrolase inhibitor and destabilized by a specific SUMO-1 hydrolase. The covalent modification of Sp1 by endogenous SUMO-1 and SUMO-1 that has been fused to green fluorescent protein was demonstrated using transient transfection assays. A high probability sumoylation consensus motif, VK16IE18, is located within the N-terminal negative regulatory domain of Sp1. Either arginine substitution for lysine 16 (Sp1(K16R)) or alanine substitution for glutamic acid 18 (Sp1(E18A)), abrogated Sp1 sumoylation. In vitro SUMO-1 covalently bound affinity-purified GST-Sp1, but not GST-Sp1(K16R). In vivo Sp1 was determined to be N-terminally cleaved, while Sp1(K16R) could not be cleaved indicating that sumoylation and cleavage are coupled through the key regulatory lysine 16. This coupling was evident by the demonstration of an inverse relationship between cellular SUMO-modified Sp1 and N-terminally cleaved Sp1. Compared with Sp1, sumoylation-deficient Sp1(E18A) exhibited enhanced cleavage and was a better transcriptional activator, while constitutively SUMO-1-modified Sp1 was deficient in proteolytic processing and repressed Sp1 transcriptional activity. The repressive effect of sumoylation on Sp1 activity is emphasized through the use of a GAL4 based transactivation assay. A model is proposed defining a mechanism by which sumoylation preserves the integrity of a negative regulatory domain thereby allowing for the inhibition of Sp-dependent transcription. Sp1 was one of the first mammalian transcription factors to be cloned and biochemically characterized (1Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R.

Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Sp1 is representative of a large Sp/KLF family (greater than 20 members) characterized by their affinity for GC-rich cis elements found in the promoters of many housekeeping genes as well as inducible genes (3Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 4Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1 is involved in virtually all facets of cellular function. Of particular interest is Sp1 regulation of G1 phase TATA-less promoters, which govern cell growth, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis (5Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 6Zenzie-Gregory B. Khachi A. Garraway I.P. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3841-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Sp1 molecule is organized into strong glutamine-rich activating domains (A (residues 83–262) and B (residues 263–542)) and weak activating domains (C (residues 543–610) and D (residues 709–778)). A highly conserved zinc finger region (residues 615–708) responsible for DNA binding is located between domains C and D (7Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The N terminus (amino acids 1–82) endows Sp1 with repressor activity (8Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J.

A stretch of conserved amino acids known as the Sp box is located at the N terminus of Sp1–8. This element contains an endoproteolytic cleavage site situated close to a region that targets Sp1 proteasome-dependent degradation in vitro (10Su K. Roos M.D. Yang X. Han I. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15194-15202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The complexity of Sp1 gene regulation and function is explained in part through postranslational modifications, which include phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitinylation, acetylation, and ribosylation (11Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase enhances Sp1 DNA binding and thereby increases its transcriptional activity (12Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Sp1 phosphorylation also increases ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteolysis and thereby decreases Sp1 nuclear levels (13Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A. Shiotani A. Merchant J.L. J. Biol.

O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) protects Sp1 from proteolysis, and since many of the same serines and threonines may be used for phosphorylation or glycosylation, there is an inverse relationship between Sp1 phosphorylation and glycosylation (15Han I.

Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Glycosylation has been reported to enhance Sp-dependent transcription in some contexts, while in others, glycosylation interferes with Sp1/TAF factor binding resulting in transcriptional repression (17Du X.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 18Yang X. Su K.

Acetylation activates Sp1 transcriptional potential by enhancing Sp1 DNA binding (19Huang W. Zhao S. Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M. Venkatasubbarao K. Freeman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10047-10054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lysines are particularly interesting sites of protein modification because of the large number of different interactions they undergo including acetylation, ubiquitinylation, methylation, or modification by various ubiquitin-like modifiers including the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 2The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; NRD, negative regulatory domain; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; SL2, Schneider line-2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LLnL, N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal; HA, hemagglutinin; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DBD, DNA binding domain. (20Freiman R.N. Tjian R. Cell. 2003; 112: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Sumoylation is the process whereby SUMO-1, -2, or -3 is covalently and reversibly bound to specific lysines of target proteins using homologous ubiquitin-like enzymes (E1, E2, and E3). SUMO-1 is a 101-amino acid peptide sharing 18% identity to ubiquitin; however, it does not serve as a signal for protein degradation, rather sumoylation regulates protein-protein interactions resulting in modification of substrate-specific properties (21Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Sumoylation has been implicated in diverse regulatory functions including subcellular compartmentalization, protein stability, chromatin structure regulation, transcription factor activity, DNA binding, and protein complex assembly. The growing list of SUMO-1 substrates includes many transcription factors suggesting a major role for sumoylation in the regulation of gene expression. Sumoylation generally represses transcriptional activity although some reports suggest that sumoylation enhances trans factor activity (22Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Using several experimental approaches, we present evidence for the SUMO-1 modification of Sp1 and identify residue 16 as the SUMO-1-conjugating lysine. We also demonstrate that lysine 16 regulates Sp1 N-terminal cleavage in vivo. Since the Sp1 N terminus is a co-repressor binding domain, we hypothesized that SUMO-1 modification at lysine 16 inhibits Sp1 proteolytic processing/activation. To test this hypothesis we constructed a sumoylation-deficient Sp1, Sp1(E18A), and a constitutively SUMO-1-modified Sp1. The data indicate that Sp1(E18A) is a better substrate for N-terminal cleavage and a better transactivator of transcription compared with wild-type Sp1. In accord, the constitutively sumoylated Sp1 is not a substrate for N-terminal cleavage and is a less effective transcription factor. Further evidence that sumoylation represses Sp1 activity is provided through the use of a GAL4-Sp1 fusion assay. These data suggest a novel mechanism whereby sumoylation inhibits Sp1 activity by maintaining the integrity of a negative regulatory domain. A model is proposed implicating posttranslational competition at lysine 16 in the control of Sp-dependent transcription.

A constitutively SUMO-modified Sp1 was constructed using a SUMO-1 plasmid template in a PCR reaction including the primers: 5′-AGAAGAAGAGCGGCCGCGATGTCTGACCAGGAGGCAAAA-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTTCTCGCGGCCGCGCCCGTTTGTTCCTGATAAAC-3′, to generate a cDNA encoding SUMO-1 minus six C-terminal amino acids (SUMO-cleavage site). pCMV-FLAG-Sp1-HA cDNA was digested 5′ to Sp1 cDNA with NotI and the SUMO-1 PCR product was likewise digested with NotI, then ligated to linearized Sp1 plasmid forming a fusion construct (Fig. 7A). Transient Transfection and Luficerase Assay—MCF7 and Pheonix cells were transfected with CMV driven expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cellfectin was used to transfect SL2 cells. Cell extracts were prepared for luciferase assays 24 and 48 h posttransfection. Puc 18 was used to equalize DNA contents. The luciferase activities were measured and normalized for the amount of protein in cell lysates. Reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) was used to quantify luciferase activity. Luminescence was detected in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Results are representative of at least three experiments. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by boiling in 2% SDS, and proteins were resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. For immunoprecipitations, cells were extracted in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 30 μm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG and then protein A/G beads for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed prior to boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Precipitates were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer apparatus.

Subsequently, membranes were incubated 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a proprietary kit according to the manufacturer’s specifications (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). LLnL (N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal), MG132, IPTG isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and forskolin were purchased through Sigma Inc. In Vitro Sumoylation—An in vitro sumoylation kit was purchased from LAE Biotech and instructions were followed per manufacturers specifications (LAE Biotech #K007 kit). Bacterial expressed GST, GST-Sp1, and GST-Sp1(K16R) were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Corp.) as per manufacture’s specifications and then used as substrates in the in vitro reaction. Topoisomerase was used as a positive control and anti-topoisomerase and anti-Sp1 Western blots were performed to visualize sumoylated proteins. Sp1 Exhibits a High Molecular Mass Isoform That Is Stabilized by a Selective Inhibitor of SUMO Hydrolases and Desumoylated by a Specific SUMO Hydrolase—In a previous study, the Sp1 family member, Sp3, was determined to be sumoylated and both Sp3 and Sp1 were shown to interacted with UBC9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme (25Spengler M.L. Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Simmons S.O. Brattain M.G. Horowitz J.M. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether Sp1 might be SUMO-1 modified. MCF7 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Sp1 bound to agarose or with protein A/G bound to agarose. An anti-Sp1 Western blot showed the major Sp1 protein doublet at about 100 kDa as well as minor high molecular mass proteins (Fig. 1A). Sumoylated proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE slower then unmodified forms exhibiting a larger molecular mass by about 20 kDa or higher. Typically the SUMO-modified isoform represents a small fraction of the total protein. The corresponding anti-SUMO-1 Western showed a similar banding pattern but with greater complexity suggesting that Sp1 may interact with many sumoylated proteins (data not shown). This preliminary data indicated that endogenous Sp1 maybe sumoylated, and to study this specific modification, we would need to overexpress a tagged Sp1 in the cells. In the following experiments, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding tagged Sp1 and harvested directly in 2% SDS buffer to inhibit SUMO-1 hydrolases. The resulting anti-HA Western blot revealed prominent Sp1 species at 95 and 105 kDa (Fig. 1B). Upon longer exposure of the same film, a novel slower migrating isoform of 125 kDa was observed (Fig. 1C). Mock transfected cells did not express these proteins indicating that the proteins are Sp1-specific (Fig. 1, B and C). Sumoylated proteins are readily desumoylated under native conditions but can be stabilized in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a selective inhibitor of deubiquitinating/desumoylating enzymes (28Spengler M.L. Kurapatwinski K. Black A.R. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2990-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Saitoh H. Kawakami T. Omata M. Chung C.H. Kimura M. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31131-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). If the novel 125-kDa protein is SUMO-modified Sp1, then it would be expected to be hydrolyzed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and stabilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with NEM. Only when cells were immediately lysed under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 4) or when cells were lysed under native conditions in the presence of NEM (lane 3) was the novel Sp1 species observed. To confirm that the high molecular mass Sp1 is a SUMO-modified form, we transfected cells with a plasmid encoding Sp1 alone or cotransfected with a plasmid encoding SENP1, a specific SUMO hydrolase. In the presence of SENP1, the 125-kDa Sp1 species was abrogated providing evidence that Sp1 is sumoylated (Fig. 1D). Sp1 Covalently Binds SUMO-1 in Vivo—To test whether Sp1 is SUMO-1 conjugated in vivo, we transiently transfected a plasmid encoding tagged Sp1 alone or with a plasmid encoding SUMO-1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), pEVEp-SUMO. If Sp1 were SUMO-1-modified, a novel high molecular mass Sp1 protein resulting from the covalent conjugation between Sp1 and SUMO-1-GFP would be observed. Whole cell extracts were prepared and examined by immunoblotting with anti-HA. Co-expression of Sp1 and SUMO-1-GFP led to the production of a novel high molecular mass SUMO-conjugated Sp1 protein (Fig. 2A, lane 3). In lane 2, we observe the endogenous SUMO bound to ectopic Sp1, which is lost in lane 3. This loss likely results from competition, for the conjugating lysine, between the low levels of endogenous Sp1 and the abundantly expressed SUMO fusion. The high molecular mass protein was not observed in cells transfected with pEVEp-SUMO alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1). To confirm that the high molecular mass anti-HA reactive protein is Sp1-modified by the GFP-SUMO fusion protein, lysates from co-transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting nitrocellulose transfer was probed with anti-SUMO-1, then stripped and reprobed with anti-HA (Fig. 2, B and C). The novel high molecular mass Sp1 reacted with anti-SUMO-1 providing further evidence for the specific conjugation of SUMO-1 to Sp1. Lysine 16 Is Required for Sp1 Sumoylation—A high probability sumoylation consensus sequence, VK16IE, was observed within the Sp1 N terminus. Using site-directed mutagenesis, lysine 16 was replaced with an arginine. Mammalian or insect cells expressing wild-type Sp1 exhibited sumoylation, whereas the point mutant Sp1 did not (Fig. 3, A and B). These data demonstrate that lysine 16 is required for Sp1 sumoylation. In Vitro Sumoylation of Sp—To confirm that Sp1 is SUMO-1 modified and that lysine 16 is responsible for this modification, we performed an in vitro sumoylation assay. The sumoylation reaction included SAE I and SAE II (human E1), UBC9 (human E2), and the active form of SUMO-1. GST, GST-Sp1, and GST-Sp1(K16R) purified from bacteria were used as substrates in this assay. GST was not SUMO-1-modified (data not shown). An anti-Sp1 Western blot revealed that GST-Sp1(K16R) was not SUMO-1-modified, whereas GST-Sp1 exhibited one SUMO-1-modified isoform (Fig. 4A). The positive control, topoisomerase, showed multiple isoforms of sumoylation (Fig. 4B). Lysine 16 Is Required for Sp1 N-terminal Cleavage in Vivo—The data indicate that sumoylation occurs at the N terminus of Sp1; therefore, sumoylation may be involved in regulating an N-terminal process controlling Sp1 transcription. An in vitro investigation has demonstrated that forskolin, a cAMP activator, induces Sp1 protein cleavage at amino acid 64, and in combination with low glucose levels, the 89-kDa C-terminal product was readily degraded (10Su K. Roos M.D. Yang X. Han I. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15194-15202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that sumoylation prevents proteolytic cleavage and thereby maintains the integrity of Sp1 NRD/co-repressor binding domain. It was first necessary to demonstrate that Sp1 could be N-terminally cleaved in vivo similarly to what had been observed in vitro. The Sp1 proteins used in this experiment possessed an N-terminal FLAG-tag and C-terminal HA-tag allowing for Western blot detection of a cleavage product (Fig. 5A). Forskolin had been used in vitro to induce cleavage, and proteosome inhibitors were used to inhibit this cleavage. Therefore, MCF7 cells ectopically expressing Sp proteins were treated without and with forskolin alone (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 1 and 2) or with forskolin and LLnL (lane 3). An anti-HA Western blot showed that forskolin mediated production of an Sp1 89-kDa cleavage product as depicted by the arrow (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Forskolin-mediated cleavage is abrogated by treatment with a proteosome inhibitor, as seen in lane 3. Confirmation that the cleavaged product was generated through N-terminal cleavage was confirmed by its lack of anti-FLAG reactivity (Fig. 5C, lane 2). Our in vivo data support the in vitro demonstration that Sp1 undergoes proteolytic processing. Analysis of the Sp1(K16R) protein profile reveals unexpected low molecular mass proteins of about 90 and 86 kDa (Fig. 5D, lanes 3 and 4, and Fig. 5F, lanes 4–6). The calculated molecular mass of Sp1 is 86 kDa. Fig. 5E, lanes 3 and 4, show that the low molecular mass Sp1(K16R) is recognized by anti-FLAG, as well as anti-HA, and therefore cannot be a cleavage product. Fig. 5F indicates that the low molecular mass Sp1(K16R), unlike the Sp1 89-kDa product, is not affected by a proteasome inhibitor or forskolin treatment. We conclude that Sp1(K16R) is not N-terminally cleaved and that its faster migrating species may be less modified isoforms (refer to “Discussion”). From these data we conclude that Sp1 exhibits in vivo proteolytic processing and that Sp1 sumoylation and N-terminal cleavage are coupled through lysine 16. Uncoupling the Processes of Sumoylation and Cleavage—The results presented above indicated that the Sp1(K16R) construct would not be useful for studying the affect of sumoylation on Sp-dependent transcription, since it would not be possible to distinguish between the effects mediated by N-terminal cleavage. We reasoned that substituting the conserved glutamic acid, within the sumoylation motif, should generate a SUMO-deficient Sp1 with an intact cleavage-dependent lysine 16. The Sp1 sumoylation motif with its conserved glutamic acid (Glu-18) is seen in bold face in Fig. 6. Immediately adjacent to the glutamic acid 18 is another lysine (Lys-19). This lysine is not believed to be required for Sp1 sumoylation; however, it has been suggested that lysines in the vicinity of a sumoylation motif may influence sumoylation. Using site-directed mutatgenesis, glutamic acid 18 was substituted with alanine (Sp1(E18A)), and lysine 19 was substituted with arginine (Sp1(K19R)). To enhance observation of Sp1 sumoylation, cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the Sp proteins and pEYEp-SUMO-1. Anti-HA Western showed that Sp1 (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 6) and Sp1(K19R) (lane 4) were substrates for sumoylation, while Sp1(K16R) and Sp1(E18A) were not (lanes 3 and 5). We next determined whether the sumoylation-deficient Sp1(E18A) retained the potential to be N-terminally cleaved. Cells were transfected as above and treated with or without forskolin and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 6B). As observed in lane 6, Sp1(E18A) is a good substrate for the process of N-terminal cleavage. The processes of sumoylation and cleavage are uncoupled in the point mutant Sp1(E18A) thereby allowing us to study the affects of sumoylation on Sp1 function. Sumoylation Inhibits N Terminus Cleavage—If sumoylation and N-terminal cleavage are coupled through Sp1 lysine 16, then an inverse relationship should exist between the cellular concentrations of SUMO-Sp1 and 89-kDa cleaved Sp1. Sp1 was co-expressed with increasing amounts of SUMO-1 in cells treated with forskolin overnight. Anti-HA Western blot shows that the 89-kDa Sp1 product decreases with the concomitant increase in SUMO-modified Sp1 suggesting that these two activities are mutually exclusive (Fig. 7, A and B). Our ability to study the effect of sumoylation on Sp1 activity is greatly limited because only a small fraction of total Sp1 is SUMO-modified. To facilitate a functional analysis of Sp1 sumoylation, we designed a constitutively SUMO-modified Sp1. Using a PCR approach, the SUMO-1 gene (minus the last 6 amino acids, which include the SUMO hydrolase cleavage site) was fused to the 5′ end of the Sp1 cDNA (Fig. 7C). To determine whether sumoylation influences the cleavage of Sp1, cells expressing wild-type Sp1, Sp1(E18A), and constitutively SUMO-modified Sp1 were treated with forskolin followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7D). Constitutively SUMO-modified Sp1 could not be cleaved, as indicated by the lack of an 89-kDA product (Fig. 7D, lane 3). In accord with these data, SUMO-deficient Sp1 was a significantly better substrate for N-terminal cleavage (lane 2), compared with Sp1 (lane 1), thereby reaffirming that sumoylation inhibits Sp1 cleavage. Sumoylation Negatively Regulates Sp1-dependent Transcription— The N terminus of Sp1 is a NRD/co-repressor binding domain, and if sumoylation maintains the integrity of this domain, then SUMO-modified Sp1 would repress Sp-dependent transcription. The following set of luficerase reporter assays was performed to test the effect of sumoylation on Sp1 transcriptional activity. To determine whether sumoylation affects endogenous Sp1 activity, MCF7 cells were transfected with a mutant DHFR reporter containing only Sp1 binding sites. Increasing amounts of pSENP1, encoding a de-sumoylating enzyme, was co-transfected. As observed in Fig. 8A, there is a direct relationship between the amount of enzyme expressed and the increase in Sp-dependent transcription. As expected, these data indicate that sumoylation negatively influences endogenous Sp-activity. MCF7 cells were transfected with the p21 reporter and p"

Here we have shown that mutant male mice lacking ADAM1b are fertile and that the loss of ADAM1b results in no significant defect in sperm functions such as migration from the uterus into oviduct, binding to egg zona pellucida, and fusion with zona pellucida-free eggs. ADAM1b-deficient epididymal sperm showed a severe reduction of ADAM2 on the cell surface, despite the normal presence of ADAM2 in testicular germ cells. The appearance of ADAM1b and ADAM2 on the sperm surface depended on formation and abundance of ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin in testicular germ cells. These results suggest that mouse ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin may play a crucial role not in the sperm/egg fusion but in the appearance of these two ADAMs on the sperm surface.

Members of the ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; ZP, zona pellucida; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGC, testicular germ cells. 3The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; ZP, zona pellucida; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGC, testicular germ cells. family are multifunctional, transmembranous proteins consisting of pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail domains (1Schlöndorff J.

Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Although at least 40 ADAM genes have been identified in a variety of species, 4www.people.virginia.edu/%7Ejw7g/Table_of_the_ADAMs.html. 4www.people.virginia.edu/%7Ejw7g/Table_of_the_ADAMs.html. only the roles of some ADAMs have been elucidated. In particular, there are many members of the ADAM family that are exclusively or predominantly expressed in the testis but are functionally uncharacterized yet.Mammalian fertilization requires sperm to adhere/bind to and penetrate through the zona pellucida (ZP), an extracellular glycoprotein matrix surrounding the egg, and then to fuse with the egg membrane (4Yanagimachi R.

Fertilin, a heterodimeric protein complex composed of α (ADAM1) and β (ADAM2) subunits present on the sperm surface, has been believed to mediate adhesion and fusion between the sperm and egg plasma membranes, because the cysteine-rich and disintegrin domains of ADAM1 and ADAM2 contain the putative sequences that resemble the fusogenic peptide of viral fusion proteins and the integrin binding Arg-Gly-Asp tripeptide of snake venom toxins, respectively (6Primakoff P.

The loss of ADAM1a or ADAM2 resulted in male infertility; sperm of ADAM1a- or ADAM2-deficient mice were incapable of ascending from the uterus into the oviduct through the uterotubal junction and of binding to the egg ZP (13Nishimura H. Kim E. Nakanishi T. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34957-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Science. 1998; 281: 1857-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The inability of these mutant sperm to bind the ZP may be explained by a negligibly low level of ADAM3 on the sperm surface (13Nishimura H. Kim E. Nakanishi T. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34957-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Indeed, ADAM3-deficient male mice were infertile, and the mutant sperm showed the defect in the ZP binding (15Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Shamsadin R. Adham I.M. Nayernia K. Heinlein U.A.O. Oberwinkler H. Engel W. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the loss of ADAM2 in TGC resulted in the lack of both ADAM1b and ADAM3, in addition to ADAM2, on the sperm surface (15Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Stein K.K. Go J.C. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because ADAM2-deficient mouse sperm were also defective in adhesion to and fusion with the egg membrane (14Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Science. 1998; 281: 1857-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 15Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the functional roles of ADAM1b, ADAM2, and ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin complex in fertilization are still controversial.In this study, we have produced mice carrying a null mutation in Adam1b using homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, the male mice lacking ADAM1b are fertile, and ADAM1b-deficient epididymal sperm are functionally normal in the migration into the oviduct, binding to the ZP, and fusion with the egg. Despite the normal presence of ADAM2 in TGC, only ADAM2 among membranous proteins tested is severely reduced on epididymal sperm of the ADAM1b-deficient mice. On the basis of the experimental results on four lines of mutant mice lacking ADAM1a, ADAM1b, ADAM2, or ADAM3, we conclude that, at least in the mouse, ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin is responsible for the appearance of ADAM3 on the sperm surface, whereas ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin is responsible for the appearance of ADAM1b and ADAM2 on the sperm surface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Mutant Mice Lacking ADAM1b—A targeting vector containing an expression cassette of the neomycin-resistance gene, neo, flanked by 7.5- and 1.45-kbp genomic regions of Adam1b was constructed by using a mouse genomic clone, mFAG1 (11Nishimura H. Kim E. Fujimori T. Kashiwabara S. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Baba T. Gene. 2002; 291: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), encoding ADAM1b (Fig. 1A). For negative selection, the MC1 promoter-driven herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene was inserted at the 3′-end of the targeting vector. The vector was linearized by digestion with SalI and electroporated into mouse D3 embryonic stem cells, and homologous recombinants were selected by using G418 and ganciclovir as described previously (18Kashiwabara S.

Seven embryonic stem cell clones carrying the targeted mutation were identified from 450 clones resistant to G418 and ganciclovir and injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Chimeric male mice were crossed to C57BL/6 female mice (Japan SLC Inc.) to establish heterozygous mutant lines. Homozygous mice were obtained by mating of heterozygous males and females. All animal experiments were carried out according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the University of Tsukuba.Blot Hybridization—Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tail, digested by EcoRI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Total cellular RNA was prepared from testicular tissues using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) as described previously (19Honda A. Yamagata K. Sugiura S. Watanabe K. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16976-16984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were glyoxylated, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto the nylon membranes. The blots were probed by 32P-labeled DNA fragments and analyzed by a BAS-1800II Bio-Image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) as described (20Kashiwabara S. Zhuang T. Yamagata K. Noguchi J.

Okabe.Immunochemical Analysis—Testicular tissues from 3- to 4-month-old mice were minced with a razor blade in 4 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 2 mm MgCl2, filtered through a nylon mesh, and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C as described (15Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was suspended in the same buffer, and the suspension was put on a 52% Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences) in the above buffer and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. TGC was then recovered from a white band near the top of the gradient and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. TGC and cauda epididymal sperm were suspended in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), kept on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C as described (12Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins in the supernatant solution were denatured by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 1% skim milk, the blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the intensities of the immunoreactive protein bands were quantified by using a Fuji Film Science Lab Image Gauge software (version 3.4). Protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation analysis was carried out according to the previously published method (13Nishimura H. Kim E. Nakanishi T. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34957-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Sperm Migration into Oviduct—Female B6C3F1 mice were caged with male mice 12 h after intraperitoneal injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (Teikoku Zoki Co.), and formation of vaginal plug was observed every 30 min as described previously (13Nishimura H.

The oviducts were excised with a connective part of the uterus ∼2 h after copulation, fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Sections were stained with hematoxylin and observed under an Olympus BX50 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an HC-2500 camera (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).In Vitro Fertilization—Eggs tightly packed with cumulus cells were collected from the oviductal ampulla of superovulated BDF1 mice 14 to 15 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection and placed in a 0.1-ml drop of a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (TYH medium) (28Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) covered with mineral oil. Fresh cauda epididymal sperm from 3-month-old mice were capacitated by incubation for 2 h in a 0.2-ml drop of TYH medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. An aliquot (1.5 × 104 sperm/10 μl) of the capacitated sperm suspension was mixed with the eggs in a 90-μl drop of TYH medium. After incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, the eggs were treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (3 units/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min to remove cumulus cells. The female and male pronuclei in the eggs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml) for 30 min, and then viewed under an Olympus BX70 epifluorescence microscope as described (13Nishimura H.

An aliquot (1.5 × 104 sperm/10 μl) of capacitated sperm suspension was added to a 90-μl drop containing cumulus-free eggs and two-cell embryos in TYH medium, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The eggs were transferred to 100 μl of fresh TYH medium, washed by pipetting, and fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde. The number of sperm tightly bound to the egg ZP was counted under an Olympus BX71 microscope equipped with a DP-12 camera as described (29Yamagata K. Murayama K. Okabe M. Toshimori K. Nakanishi T.

The two-cell embryos were used as an internal negative control for nonspecific binding, and the average number of bound sperm/two-cell embryo was <1.0 under the above conditions.Sperm-Egg Fusion—ZP-free eggs were mechanically prepared by using a piezo-driven micromanipulator (Prime Tech Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) without the use of α-chymotrypsin as described previously (30Yamagata K. Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamaguchi R. Moss S.B. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 348-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ZP-free eggs previously treated with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml) were inseminated with capacitated sperm (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. After fixation in 0.25% glutaraldehyde, the eggs were observed under the above fluoromicroscope.RESULTSTo explore the functional role of ADAM1b in fertilization, we produced mutant mice lacking ADAM1b by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The targeting construct was designed to replace the 455-residue protein-coding region containing the pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM1b at positions 79-533 with neo (Fig. 1A). The genotypes of wild-type (Adam1b+/+), heterozygous (Adam1b+/-), and homozygous (Adam1b-/-) mice for the targeted mutation of Adam1b were identified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Northern blot analysis indicated the absence of ADAM1b mRNA in Adam1b-/- testis. In addition, protein extracts of Adam1b-/- TGC completely lacked a 120-kDa protein corresponding to the precursor form of ADAM1b. These data demonstrate the absence of ADAM1b in the Adam1b-/- testis.Mating of Adam1b+/- male and female mice yielded the expected Mendelian frequency of Adam1b-/- mice (Adam1b+/+:Adam1b+/-:Adam1b-/- = 20 (27%):35 (47%):19 (26%) for 74 offspring from 9 litters). Both Adam1b-/- males and females were apparently normal in behavior, body size, and health condition. Morphological analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the shapes, numbers, and sizes of TGC and epididymal sperm among Adam1b+/+, Adam1b+/-, and Adam1b-/- mice. The motility of cauda epididymal sperm was also normal in Adam1b-/- mice. Most importantly, Adam1b-/- male mice exhibited normal fertility and produced an average litter size (means ± S.E. = 9.9 ± 0.7 and 9.3 ± 0.3 offspring for 10 litters in Adam1b+/+ and Adam1b-/- mice, respectively). Thus, we conclude that ADAM1b is not essential for fertilization in the mouse.To examine the interaction of Adam1b-/- mouse sperm with eggs, in vitro fertilization assays were carried out using capacitated cauda epididymal sperm. When cumulus-intact eggs were used, the fertilization rate 2 (data not shown) and 6 h after insemination was normal in Adam1b-/- mouse sperm (Fig. 1C). No significant difference was found either in the sperm binding to ZP or in the fusion of sperm with ZP-free eggs between Adam1b+/- and Adam1b-/- mice (Fig. 1, D and E). Moreover, microscopic analysis of frozen sections of the uterotubal junction 2 h after copulation indicated the ability of Adam1b-/- mouse sperm to ascend from the uterus into the oviduct (Fig. 2). Thus, the loss of ADAM1b causes no significant defect in sperm function.FIGURE 2Normal migration of ADAM1b-deficient mouse sperm from uterus into oviduct. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and observed under a microscope (magnification, ×100). Arrows indicate sperm present in the uterine lumen (U) and colliculus tubarius (CT).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ascertain whether the loss of ADAM1b affects both formation of fertilin complexes in TGC and appearance of ADAM proteins on the sperm surface, we carried out immunoblot analysis of TGC and epididymal sperm proteins (Fig. 3). Adam1b-/- mice lacked ADAM1b in TGC, whereas the level of ADAM1b in Adam1b+/- mice was approximately half (58%) of that in Adam1b+/+ mice (Figs. 1B and 3A). Six other membranous proteins specifically expressed in the testis are normally present in Adam1b-/- TGC (84-111% of the protein levels in Adam1b+/+ TGC). When formation of heterodimeric protein complexes between the precursors of ADAM1a or ADAM1b and ADAM2 was examined, Adam1a-/- TGC lacked 200-kDa ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin and Adam1b-/- TGC lacked 220-kDa ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin (Fig. 3B). Immunoprecipitation analysis using antibodies against ADAM1a, ADAM1b, and ADAM2 verified the loss of ADAM1a/ADAM2 and ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilins in Adam1a-/- and Adam1b-/- TGC, respectively (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Presence of testis (sperm)-specific proteins in ADAM1b-deficient mice. Proteins from TGC and cauda epididymal sperm of Adam1b+/+ (+/+ or WT), Adam1b+/- (+/-), and Adam1b-/- (-/-) mice were extracted with 1% Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing (A, C, and D) or non-reducing (B) conditions, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against testis (sperm)-specific proteins indicated. tACE, a testis-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme.

B, formation of ADAM1a/ADAM2 and ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin complexes in TGC. Adam1a-/- (A1a) and Adam1b-/- (A1b) TGC lacked 200-kDa ADAM1a/ADAM2 and 220-kDa ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilins, respectively. C, immunoprecipitation analysis. TGC proteins from wild-type, Adam1a-/-, and Adam1b-/- mice were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-ADAM1a, ADAM1b, and ADAM2 antibodies and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. D, immunoblot analysis of sperm proteins. ADAM1b and ADAM2 were not found in the sperm extracts of Adam1b-/- mice when the blots were probed by anti-ADAM1b and anti-ADAM2 polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Four other sperm-specific proteins were normally present in Adam1b+/- and Adam1b-/- mouse sperm. Note that the protein bands corresponding to the 100-kDa precursor, processing intermediate, and 48-kDa mature forms of ADAM1a were undetectable in the sperm extracts of Adam1b+/+, Adam1b+/-, and Adam1b-/- mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the level of ADAM2 in TGC was similar between Adam1b+/+ and Adam1b-/- mice (Fig. 3A), epididymal sperm of Adam1b-/- mice showed the loss of ADAM2 as well as of ADAM1b (Fig. 3D). To verify the loss of ADAM2 on Adam1b-/- mouse sperm, we carried out an immunoblot analysis of sperm extracts from Adam1b+/+ and Adam1b-/- mice using two different antibodies (Fig. 4A). As described above, anti-ADAM2 polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 22-residue peptide (23Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was not immunoreactive with the 45-kDa mature form of ADAM2 in the Adam1b-/- sperm extracts. However, the mature protein in the Adam1b-/- extracts was slightly but significantly recognized by anti-ADAM2 monoclonal antibody 9D2.2. Moreover, the Adam1b+/+ and Adam1b-/- sperm extracts contained a very small amount of the 100-kDa ADAM2 precursor. Thus, the precursor and mature forms of ADAM2 are present on Adam1b-/- mouse sperm. The cytoplasmic tail of mature ADAM2 on Adam1b- mouse sperm may be partially processed by a proteolytic enzyme, because the C-terminal region is not recognized by anti-ADAM2 polyclonal antibody. The level of the mature form of ADAM2 on Adam1b-/- mouse sperm was ∼4% of that on Adam1b+/+ mouse sperm (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4ADAM1b-deficient mouse sperm contain a severely reduced level of ADAM2. A, immunoblot analysis. Sperm protein extracts (3 μg) from a wild-type mouse (lane 1) and three ADAM1b-deficient mice (lanes 2, 3, and 4) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-ADAM2 polyclonal (pAb) and monoclonal (mAb) antibodies.

Other proteins, ADAM3, PH-20, a testis-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and Izumo, were normally present on Adam1b mouse sperm (97-103% of the levels on Adam1b+/+ mouse sperm, see Fig. 3D). These data suggest that the appearance of ADAM1b and ADAM2 on the sperm surface may depend on the formation and abundance of ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin in TGC.FIGURE 5Appearance of ADAM1b and ADAM2 on the surface of Adam1b+/- and Adam1b-/- mouse sperm. Immunoblot analysis of sperm proteins was carried out using polyclonal antibodies against ADAM1b, ADAM3, and PH-20 and anti-ADAM2 monoclonal antibody. The intensities of immunoreactive protein bands were quantified. Both levels of ADAM1b and ADAM2 on Adam1b+/- (+/-) mouse sperm were reduced to 52 and 61% of those on Adam1b+/+ (+/+) mouse sperm, respectively. The levels of ADAM3 and PH-20 on Adam1b+/+ mouse sperm were similar to those on Adam1b+/- and Adam1b-/- (-/-) mouse sperm.

We have also demonstrated the importance of ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin formation in TGC for the appearance of these two ADAMs on the sperm surface (Figs. 3 and 5). Table 1 summarizes the correlation between the abundance of ADAM proteins and sperm function in four mouse lines lacking ADAM1b, ADAM1a, ADAM2, or ADAM3. Our data on Adam1b-/- mouse sperm strongly support the previous finding that ADAM3 is crucial in the sperm binding to egg ZP (15Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev.

Glycine 93 is a conserved residue at position i + 3 of a tight turn and has been found to be a mutational hot spot in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). The fALS-associated mutations, G93A, G93S, G93R, G93D, and G93V, were made in a pseudo wild-type background containing no free cysteines, which prevented the formation of aberrant disulfide bonds upon thermal unfolding, and enabled quantitative thermodynamic analysis of the effects of the mutations. Thermal unfolding was highly reversible for all the SODs in both the fully metallated (holo) and metal-free (apo) forms. The data for all the holo-SODs and for the apo-pseudo-wild-type SOD were well fit by a 2-state unfolding model for native dimer (N2) to two unfolded monomers (2U), N2 ↔ 2U. The holo- and apo-forms of the mutants are significantly destabilized (by 1.5–3.5 kcal mol–1 monomer) relative to the corresponding forms of pseudo wild-type, with the relative stabilities being correlated with statistical preferences for amino acids in this structural context. Although van't Hoff (ΔHvH) to calorimetric (ΔHcal) enthalpy ratios are close to unity for all the holo-SODs and for apo-pseudo-wild-type, consistent with a 2-state transition, ΔHvH is considerably larger than ΔHcal for all the apo-mutants. This suggests that the mutations cause apo-SOD to have an increased propensity to misfold or aggregate, which may be linked to increased toxic mutant SOD aggregation in fALS.

ALS is a common, rapidly progressive adult motor neuron disease for which there is very little in the way of treatment and no cure (8Bruijn L.I. Miller T.M. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Mutations in SOD were linked to fALS in 1993 (9Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. Rahmani Z. Krizus A. McKenna-Yasek D. Cayabyab A. Gaston S.M. Berger R. Tanzi R.E. Halperin J.J. Herzfeldt B. Van den Bergh R. Hung W.-Y. Bird T. Deng G.

Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar); to date, over 110 SOD mutations have been associated with the disease. Although mutant SOD fALS represents only a few percent of all ALS cases, this is the major known cause of the disease (10Andersen P.M. Sims K.B. Xin W.W. Kiely R. O'Neill G. Ravits J. Pioro E. Harati Y. Brower R.D. Levine J.S. Heinicke H.U. Seltzer W. Boss M. Brown Jr., R.H. Amyotroph. Lateral Scler.

Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Recent attention has focused on increased toxic misfolding of mutant SOD as a cause for fALS, analogous to other protein misfolding diseases (12Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 13Stefani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1739: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 14Gregersen N. Bolund L. Bross P.

Increased misfolding has been correlated with decreased protein stability; hence, a better understanding of the thermodynamic effects of fALS mutations may lead to valuable insights into the disease process. Wild-type human SOD contains 4 cysteines per monomer; in the native protein two of these (Cys-57 and Cys-146) form a conserved intra-subunit disulfide bond, and the other two (Cys-6 and Cys-111) remain as free cysteines. Thermal unfolding of wild-type SOD is highly irreversible because of the oxidation of the free cysteines (1Lepock J.R. Arnold L.D. Torrie B.H. Andrews B. Kruuv J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which precludes thermodynamic analysis. However, substitution of the cysteines at position 6 and 111 by alanine and serine, respectively, results in much higher reversibility (2Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McRee D.E. Redford S.M. Getzoff E.D. Lepock J.R. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. J. Biol.

Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 12: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structure, activity, and stability of the protein lacking free cysteines (pseudo-WT) are very similar to wild-type SOD (2Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol.

Glycine 93 is a mutational hotspot for fALS; disease-associated mutations include substitutions to alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, valine, serine, and cysteine (www.alsod.org) (11Radunovic A. Leigh P.N. Amyotroph. Lateral Scler. Other Motor Neuron Disord. 1999; 1: 45-49PubMed Google Scholar). Gly-93 is situated at position 3 of a type I tight turn (loop V, connecting β-strands 5 and 6), where it adopts a left-handed backbone conformation (supplemental Fig. S1) (23Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y. Getzoff E.D. Hu P. Herzfeldt B. Roos R.P. Warner C. Deng G. Soriano E. Smyth C. Parge H.E. Ahmed A. Roses A.D. Hallewell R. Pericak-Vance M.A. Siddique T. Science. 1993; 261: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). This glycine is conserved in sequence and structure among many SODs (5Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Stempien M.M. Bell G.I. Hallewell R.A. Proteins. 1989; 5: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study, all of the above substitutions, with the exception of cysteine which would oxidize, were engineered into pseudo-WT. Highly homogeneous solutions of holo-and apo-pseudo-WT and mutant SODs were prepared and found to undergo highly reversible thermal unfolding. We show that DSC can be used to quantitate the effects of SOD mutations on both thermodynamic stability and on aggregation. SOD Expression and Purification—Human fALS-associated mutant SODs were engineered into the pHSOD1ASlacIq vector, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Getzoff E.D.

Apoproteins were prepared by dialyzing the holoproteins against EDTA (7McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metal content of the purified proteins was assessed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and measurements of enzymatic activity by the pyrogallol autoxidation method (25Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (8010) Google Scholar). DSC—Measurements were performed using a Microcal LLC VP-DSC (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Unless otherwise stated, SOD samples were in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8. Under these nonreducing conditions, the native disulfide remains intact. Protein concentrations for samples typically ranged from ∼0.05 to ∼3 mg ml–1. A negligible scan rate dependence on excess specific heat absorption was observed for SOD between 0.25 and 1.5 °C min–1 and so experiments routinely used a scan rate of 1 °C min–1. Buffer/buffer base lines were determined for each experiment and subtracted from protein/buffer scans, followed by data normalization for protein concentration. Thermodynamic Analysis of DSC Data—DSC data were fit to a dimer 2-state model for equilibrium between native dimer (N2) and two unfolded monomers (2U), N2 ↔ 2U, as described elsewhere (26Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar), according to Equation 1,Cptot(T)=βΔh2(T)RT2fU(1-fU)2-fU+(1-fU)(A+BT)+fU(C+DT)(Eq. 1) where C totp(T) is the total specific heat absorption at temperature (T; in Kelvin); R is the universal gas constant; fU is the fraction of unfolded protein at T; Δh(T) is the specific enthalpy of unfolding at T; A and C are the intercepts; B and D are the slopes of the folded and unfolded base lines, respectively; β is a temperature-independent constant equal to the ratio of the van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpies of unfolding, ΔHvH/ΔHcal, multiplied by the molecular weight of the dimer; and Tm is the temperature where fU = 0.5 (Tm is the temperature in Kelvin where the fraction unfolded is 0.5). For comparison, data were also fit to a monomer 2-state transition between the native and unfolded state, N ↔ U, where there is no change in molecularity upon unfolding (MN2State in Origin, version 5.0, Microcal), after subtraction of base-line heat capacity, using Equation 2,Cpex(T)=γΔH2(T)fU(1-fU)RT2(Eq. 2) where Cexp(T) is the excess specific heat absorption at T; ΔH(T) is the enthalpy of unfolding at T, and γ is ΔHcal/ΔHvH. DSC data were fit by nonlinear least squares using Origin. Aggregation Measurements—Aggregation propensity of apo-SODs was measured by monitoring 90° light scattering at 450 nm, caused by protein aggregation as temperature was increased from 5 °C at ∼0.7 °C/min as described previously (20Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and applied to many SOD mutants (19Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Aggregation was found to be extremely sensitive to solution pH (19Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and to conditions of the apo stock solutions; highly reproducible temperatures for onset of aggregation were obtained by using stock apo-SOD solutions buffered in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, and then diluted to 0.024 mg/ml in 20 mm MES, with a final pH of 5.5. The temperature (in °C) of onset of aggregation, tagg, was taken as the intercept of the lines for base-line scattering in the pre-aggregation temperature range and for scattering in the initial aggregation region. High Reversibility of Thermal Unfolding of Apo-pseudo-WT SOD—Reversibility of unfolding is required for thermodynamic analyses, and so this was evaluated using 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8. These buffer conditions were chosen to be identical to previous DSC studies for pseudo-WT SOD (2Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), which demonstrated high reversibility upon thermal denaturation, and to chemical denaturation experiments on SOD, which have shown high reversibility of unfolding (data not shown). The reversibility was calculated from the areas for the unfolding endotherms in successive DSC heating scans (Fig. 1A). Nearly 100% reversibility was observed when apo-pseudo-WT was scanned to the end of the unfolding transition. Scanning 15 °C beyond the transition caused the reversibility to decrease to ∼90%. Consequently, apo data were fit just to the end of the unfolding transition, where thermal unfolding was completely reversible. Apo-pseudo-WT Thermal Unfolding Fits a Dimer 2-State (N2 ↔ 2U) Model—The DSC unfolding endotherms for the apo-SODs studied here were clearly asymmetric, because changes in heat capacity, Cp, were more gradual at lower temperatures and more abrupt at increased temperatures (e.g. see Fig. 1); such asymmetry is expected for 2-state unfolding of a dimeric protein (N2 ↔ 2U) (26Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar). Because apo-SOD monomers associate with very high affinity (Kd∼10–10 m, pH 7.8, 25 °C (27Khare S.D. Caplow M. Dokholyan N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15094-15099Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)), it is reasonable that the dimer persists until the protein thermally unfolds. The apo-DSC data were well fit by a dimer 2-state model (Fig. 1B), whereas systematic deviations were observed upon fitting to the MN2-state model with no change in molecularity upon unfolding (N ↔ U) (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, fitting of data normalized per mol of monomer to the monomer model gave ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios of ∼2, indicative of a dimeric cooperative unfolding unit. Formation of monomer was also confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurements, which showed that count rate and protein hydrodynamic diameter decreased through the temperature range of the DSC transition (supplemental Fig. S2). Protein cross-linking using glutaraldehyde, monitored by SDS-PAGE, also indicated formation of monomer at increased temperature (data not shown). For a dimer 2-state transition, the unfolding transition should shift to higher temperature with increasing protein concentration, as has been observed for other dimeric proteins (26Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar). This behavior was observed for all the apo-SOD proteins. Fig. 2A shows the thermograms and the fitted lines for the dimer 2-state model for 0.05–3.0 mg ml–1 apo-pseudo-WT. The parameters obtained from the fits are summarized in Table 1. The average ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratio was 1.00, in agreement with the expected ratio of 1. The observed concentration dependence of the temperature (in °C) where the fraction unfolded is 0.5, tm, corresponds well with the dependence expected for dimer 2-state unfolding simulated using the average of the fitted ΔHvH and ΔCp values (where ΔCp indicates change in specific heat capacity upon unfolding (kcal mol–1 °C–1)) (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Fitted 2-state dimer parameters for apo-SODsApo-SOD[Protein]tmΔHvHaΔHvH errors (±) were propagated according to standard procedures (74) from fitted errors for Δh and β.ΔHvH/ΔHcalΔCpbΔCp errors for individual fits could not be reliably calculated since they are based on uncertainties of five different variables.mg ml-1°Ckcal mol-1kcal mol-1 °C-1Pseudo-WT3.0061.9 ± 0.0183.3 ± 1.91.443.93Pseudo-WT2.9961.3 ± 0.0178.5 ± 1.41.005.11Pseudo-WT1.5060.3 ± 0.0164.3 ± 4.01.095.11Pseudo-WT1.4260.0 ± 0.0163.6 ± 2.40.964.38Pseudo-WT0.7358.8 ± 0.0144.4 ± 2.50.944.30Pseudo-WT0.4459.1 ± 0.2137.6 ± 9.40.964.25Pseudo-WT0.2757.8 ± 0.2115.4 ± 2.70.783.85Pseudo-WT0.2158.4 ± 0.1116.7 ± 9.10.843.74Pseudo-WT0.2058.3 ± 0.1112.8 ± 6.71.022.95Pseudo-WT0.0557.8 ± 0.6106.5 ± 18.90.973.71Mean ± S.D.1.00 ± 0.184.13 ± 0.65G93S0.4050.6 ± 0.0158.6 ± 2.51.962.13G93S0.2949.8 ± 0.0149.8 ± 4.11.653.48G93S0.2549.4 ± 0.1146.4 ± 7.81.892.60G93R0.4048.5 ± 0.0144.0 ± 2.41.204.30G93R0.2147.1 ± 0.0123.7 ± 2.71.225.73G93R0.2146.8 ± 0.1115.4 ± 3.71.226.14G93A1.0048.9 ± 0.1149.7 ± 2.11.643.25G93A0.5047.8 ± 0.0138.1 ± 2.11.553.92G93A0.5048.8 ± 0.0147.2 ± 0.91.363.82G93A0.5048.8 ± 0.0150.3 ± 2.41.692.77G93A0.5048.9 ± 0.2148.2 ± 5.01.473.81G93A0.1246.4 ± 0.1123.1 ± 8.31.993.60G93A0.1045.6 ± 0.2119.8 ± 8.31.652.99G93D0.5045.6 ± 0.1140.4 ± 3.63.241.20G93D0.3246.0 ± 0.2144.1 ± 5.71.621.92G93D0.2145.1 ± 0.1135.8 ± 7.31.582.76G93V0.8243.7 ± 0.0127.1 ± 3.01.762.67G93V0.4042.7 ± 0.1131.0 ± 2.33.000.01G93V0.3042.4 ± 0.1126.2 ± 3.22.810.86Mean ± S.D.1.82 ± 0.593.05 ± 1.51a ΔHvH errors (±) were propagated according to standard procedures (74Taylor J.R.

Open table in a new tab ΔCp values may be calculated from the difference in the native and unfolded base line-specific heat values at the tm. The fitted values of ΔCp at the tm for individual scans (Table 1) have large uncertainties, because they are based on the fitted errors of five different variables, as has been noted previously for fits of this type (28Liu Y. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3059-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Truncation of the range of fitted data to the end of the unfolding endotherm compounds the uncertainty. Because of these uncertainties, ΔCp was analyzed further by acquiring DSC scans as a function of pH (29Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar) and fitting data to the Kirchoff Equation 3,ΔCp=dΔHvHdT(Eq. 3) Fig. 2C shows the DSC thermograms of apo-pseudo-WT for pH 3.0–4.4, which are well fit by the dimer 2-state model, with average ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios of 1.04 and average fitted ΔCp values of 3.13 kcal mol–1 °C–1. The slope of the corresponding Kirchoff plot decreases somewhat with increasing tm, with the average slope corresponding to a ΔCp value of 2.39 ± 0.22 kcal mol–1 °C–1 (Fig. 2D). By comparison, the average fitted ΔCp value at pH 7.8 for apo-pseudo-WT data is 4.13 ± 0.65 (Table 1), and the theoretical ΔCp value calculated based on the primary sequence of SOD (30Gomez J. Hilser V.J. Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1995; 22: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) is 4.15 kcal mol–1 °C–1 at the average tm of the DSC scans. ΔCp can also be predicted based on change in solvent-accessible surface area of the folded protein relative to the unfolded (31Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). By using the solvent-accessible surface area of the native state based on the crystal structure of pseudo-WT (Protein Data Bank code 1sos (33Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and the average of the upper and lower limits for the solvent-accessible surface area of the unfolded monomer (34Creamer T.P. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16245-16250Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the predicted ΔCp is 3.79 kcal mol–1 °C–1. Using the lower bound for the unfolded surface area gives ΔCp of 2.91 kcal mol–1 °C–1. Taking all the data into consideration, the ΔCp for apo-pseudo-WT is in the range of values expected for a globular protein of this size and containing a single disulfide bond (30Gomez J. Hilser V.J. Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1995; 22: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 32Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M.

High Reversibility of Thermal Unfolding of Gly-93 Mutant SOD—The reversibility of unfolding was very high for all the apo-mutants, close to 100% for scans to the end of the unfolding transition, and >90% for scans 15 °C beyond the transition. As for apo-pseudo-WT, data were fit just to the end of the unfolding endotherm. Thermograms for the apo-Gly-93 mutants and pseudo-WT and fits of the data to a dimer 2-state model are shown in Fig. 3A. Values for the fitted parameters are summarized in Table 1. All the fALS-related substitutions (Ser, Arg, Ala, Asp, and Val) of Gly-93 cause thermal unfolding to be shifted to lower temperature, with decreases in tm ranging from ∼8 °C for G93S to ∼16 °C for G93V. ΔHvH/ΔHcal Ratios for Apo-mutant SODs Are Greater Than 1—A particularly interesting result is that the ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios for all the apo-mutants are significantly greater than 1 (Table 1). This is in marked contrast to apo-pseudo-WT that shows ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios of ∼1 for a wide range of pH values and protein concentrations. High ratios for ΔHvH/ΔHcal are often taken as an indication of protein aggregation (26Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar, 36Lepock J.R. Ritchie K.P. Kolios M.C. Rodahl A.M. Heinz K.A. Kruuv J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12706-12712Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and may be related to increased mutant protein misfolding in fALS. Aggregation can cause high ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios in a number of ways. Irreversible aggregation can distort DSC traces and cause increases in ΔHvH and/or decreases in ΔHcal (26Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar, 36Lepock J.R. Ritchie K.P. Kolios M.C. Rodahl A.M. Heinz K.A. Kruuv J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12706-12712Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This does not occur to a significant extent for apo-SODs, however, as these showed very high reversibility in routinely performed multiple reheating scans. Another cause of high ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios is non-native intermolecular interactions during thermal unfolding, resulting in an apparent cooperative unfolding unit that is larger than the dimer, i.e. ΔHvH is increased and ΔHcal calculated per mol dimer is too low. Another possibility is the formation of small, weakly associated reversible aggregates during the scan; if formation of such aggregates is slightly exothermic, the effects on fitted parameters could be similar to those for irreversible aggregation. Finally, if aggregates are measured by protein concentration measurements, but do not contribute to the DSC endotherm, then ΔHcal will be systematically low. Several additional approaches were used to try to distinguish between the various potential causes for high ΔHvH/ΔHcal values. Apo-G93R was stabilized using glycerol, to assess whether the high ratios were a consequence simply of decreased tm. Addition of 20% glycerol increased the tm from ∼49 to 59 °C, however, ΔHvH/ΔHcal was unchanged. Dynamic light scattering and chemical cross-linking by glutaraldehyde as a function of temperature did not clearly identify the formation of aggregates. The molecularity of the unfolding transition can be determined from plots of lnP versus 1/tm as shown in Equation 4,molecularity=-mRΔHvH+1(Eq. 4) where P is protein concentration; m is the slope of the plot; ΔHvH is taken as the average fitted ΔHvH at the various protein concentrations; and R is the gas constant (37Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). If high ΔHvH is the reason for ΔHvH/ΔHcal >1, then the molecularity should be larger than 2 (26Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar, 37Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). However, the observed molecularities for apo-pseudo-WT and for G93A were found to be ∼2, indicative of a dimeric cooperative unfolding unit. A Kirchoff plot of ΔHvH versus tm for the apoproteins has less scatter than the same plot for ΔHcal and has a higher slope that is more consistent with the average ΔCp of 3.30 kcal mol–1 °C–1 (see below). This suggests that ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios deviate from unity because of inaccuracies in the ΔHcal values. Note that increased ΔHvH/ΔHcal is correlated with decreased ΔCp (Table 1), as may be expected for the occurrence of some exothermic aggregation. Given the preceding considerations, plausible explanations for the high ΔHvH/ΔHcal ratios are the occurrence of reversible aggregation with small heat effects during the scan or the presence of undetected aggregates throughout the scans. Gly-93 Mutations Decrease Apo-SOD Stability—Because ΔHvH likely reflects the unfolding of the dimer, this value was used to calculate the Gibbs free energy of unfolding, ΔG (kcal mol–1), and the change in ΔG of the mutant proteins relative to the pseudo-WT, ΔΔG. For these calculations, ΔCp was taken to be independent of temperature, as is commonly assumed (38Tamura A. K"
https://openalex.org/W2018549462,"We demonstrate that 85 N-terminal amino acids of the α1(I) chain participate in a highly stable folding domain, acting as the stabilizing anchor for the amino end of the type I collagen triple helix. This anchor region is bordered by a microunfolding region, 15 amino acids in each chain, which include no proline or hydroxyproline residues and contain a chymotrypsin cleavage site. Glycine substitutions and amino acid deletions within the N-anchor domain induce its reversible unfolding above 34 °C. The overall triple helix denaturation temperature is reduced by 5–6 °C, similar to complete N-anchor removal. N-propeptide partially restores the stability of mutant procollagen but not sufficiently to prevent N-anchor unfolding and a conformational change at the N-propeptide cleavage site. The ensuing failure of N-proteinase to cleave at the misfolded site leads to incorporation of pN-collagen into fibrils. Similar, but weaker, effects are caused by G88E substitution in the adjacent triplet, which appears to alter N-anchor structure as well. As in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) VIIA/B, fibrils containing pN-collagen are thinner and weaker causing EDS-like laxity of large and small joints and paraspinal ligaments.

Mature type I collagen is a heterotrimer of two α1(I) and one α2(I) chains folded into a 300-nm-long triple helix with short, unstructured telopeptides at the N- and C-terminal ends. The distinguishing feature of the collagen triple helix is an obligatory Gly residue in every third position on each chain. Collagen precursor (procollagen) is synthesized and folded within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is secreted by cells with N- and C-terminal propeptides still attached on each side of the molecule. Subsequent cleavage of the propeptides by specialized N- and C-proteinases triggers self-assembly of the mature collagen into fibrils. The fibrils co-assemble with a variety of different extracellular matrix molecules into the structural scaffold of skin, bone, and other connective tissues. Most mutations disrupting the structure of the type I collagen triple helix (usually substitutions of one of the obligatory Gly residues) cause moderately severe to lethal forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), 2The abbreviations used are: OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; aa, amino acids; EDS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. which is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by bone fragility and skeletal deformity (1Prockop D.J.

All of them had structural mutations within the first 90 N-terminal residues of the helical region of the α1(I) chain (five Gly substitutions and a 15-aa deletion). Their mutations altered procollagen structure within the N-propeptide cleavage site, resulting in incorporation of pN-collagen with uncleaved N-propeptides into fibrils. We hypothesized that the nature of EDS-like symptoms in α1(I)-OI/EDS patients is similar to type VII EDS (5Beighton P. De Paepe A. Steinmann B. Tsipouras P. Wenstrup R.J. Am. J. Med.

However, it remained unclear why α1(I)-OI/EDS patients had a somewhat different EDS phenotype (e.g. pronounced early scoliosis and no bilateral hip dysplasia) and why their collagen fibrils had more rounded cross-section under electron microscopy investigation. Based on accumulated structural knowledge and analysis of the amino acid sequence, we proposed that the long suspected (7Privalov P.L. Adv.

Makareeva E. Colige A. Letocha A.D. Ty J.M. Yeowell H.N. Pals G. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19259-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Specifically, we postulated that a distinct, highly stable “N-anchor” folding domain is formed by the first 85 N-terminal amino acids of each chain of the type I collagen triple helix. It is separated from the rest of the triple helix by a highly flexible microunfolding region lacking the Pro and Hyp residues essential for triple helix stability. The N-anchor is responsible for the proper folding and stability of the N-terminal end of the triple helix. Disruption of the structure of the anchor domain by α1(I)-OI/EDS mutations propagates into the adjacent N-propeptide, thereby altering the folding of its cleavage site. In the present study, we provide further biochemical and biophysical evidence for the existence of the N-anchor domain and demonstrate that the putative structural change in α1(I)-OI/EDS mutations is a complete unfolding of this domain above 34 °C. We discuss implications of these findings for understanding the structural origin of the difference between α1(I)-OI/EDS and EDS VIIA/B patients, both in the appearance of collagen fibrils and in the EDS phenotype. Preparation of Procollagen—Skin fibroblast cultures were established from dermal punch biopsies collected from OI and α1(I)-OI/EDS patients. Normal control cells (CRL-2127) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mutant and control fibroblasts were grown to confluence at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine (Sigma) in the presence of 5% CO2. Culture medium was removed and fresh, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 50 μg/ml ascorbate (Sigma) was added to the cell cultures. The medium was harvested after 24 h; buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, protected with protease inhibitors (25 mm EDTA, 0.2% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide) and cooled to 4 °C. Procollagen was precipitated by gradual addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 176 mg/ml and incubation at 4 °C overnight, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 h. Ammonium sulfate precipitates were dissolved in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 9.3, or 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.4. Total protein concentration was measured by Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) and collagen concentration was measured by Sircol assay (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY). Based on these assays, collagen constituted 30–50% of the protein mix. Preparation of Pepsin-treated Collagen—Ammonium sulfate protein precipitates were suspended in 0.5 m acetic acid and digested by pepsin (EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) overnight at 4 °C (∼0.1 mg/ml, ∼1:10 pepsin:collagen). After digestion, collagen was precipitated by addition of NaCl to 0.7–0.9 m final concentration. The pellet was redissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid and dialyzed against 2 mm HCl. Purity of the preparation and the content of type III collagen were evaluated by gel electrophoresis as described below. Fluorescent Labeling and Gel Electrophoresis—For fluorescent labeling, ammonium sulfate procollagen precipitates were dissolved in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 9.3. Pepsin-treated collagen was transferred into the same buffer by mixing a 2 mm HCl solution of the protein 1:1 with the 2× concentrated buffer. The proteins were labeled by monoreactive Cy5 or Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) as described (10Cabral W.A. Mertts M.V. Makareeva E. Colige A. Tekin M. Pandya A. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10006-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For gel electrophoresis analysis, aliquots of fluorescently labeled samples were mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and analyzed on precast 3–8% Tris-acetate (collagen) or 6% Tris-glycine (procollagen) mini gels (Invitrogen). The gels were scanned on an FLA5000 fluorescence scanner (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). Intensity profiles for each lane were extracted using ScienceLab software supplied with the scanner. Quantitative analysis of band intensities was performed by ScienceLab software or by using PeakFit software (Systat, Point Richmond, CA), when band deconvolution was required. The fraction of type III collagen in each sample was estimated from the intensities of α1(III)3 and α1(I) + α1(III) bands without and with the addition of dithiothreitol. Proteolytic Cleavage and Peptide Mapping—Collagen labeled by Cy5 or Cy3 (0.1 mg/ml) was transferred into 50 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, using AutoSeq G-50 micro-spin columns (Amersham Biosciences) and treated by chymotrypsin (Sigma; 0.5 mg/ml) or trypsin (Sigma; 1 mg/ml) at different temperatures (24–38 °C). Binary mixtures of collagens (mutant and control), one labeled by Cy5 and one labeled by Cy3, were prepared so that they could be co-processed by an enzyme in the same tube under identical conditions. Sample aliquots were collected after 20 min at each temperature or after different time intervals at a fixed temperature, mixed with the gel sample buffer (with added acetic acid to stop the reaction), and analyzed on 3–8% Tris-acetate mini gels. When necessary, the samples mixed with the gel buffer were rapidly frozen on dry ice until the end of experiment. Gel slices containing major bands were excised from the gel, treated with CNBr, and re-analyzed on pre-cast 12% Tris-glycine or 12% BisTris mini gels (Invitrogen). For better visualization of CNBr peptides, higher collagen concentration (up to 0.3 mg/ml) and/or more intense fluorescent labeling were used. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—DSC measurements were performed with 0.1–0.4 mg/ml procollagen solutions in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.4, as well as with pepsin-treated collagen solutions in the same phosphate/glycerol buffer or in 2 mm HCl. A study of normal control and several OI mutants revealed that additional chromatographic purification is not required for DSC measurement of procollagen denaturation thermograms. Other proteins co-precipitated with procollagen by 176 mg/ml ammonium sulfate do not contribute measurable heat in the temperature range of procollagen denaturation. The thermograms were recorded from 10 to 60 °C in a Nano II calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Lindon, UT). Most measurements were performed at 0.125 °C/min heating rate, which provides the best resolution of different denaturation peaks. In cases of limited protein amount, 1 °C/min thermograms were recorded. Due to the effect of the scanning rate on collagen denaturation (11Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), the thermograms measured at 1 °C/min could be compared only with each other. Each thermogram was background-corrected by subtraction of a linear baseline and normalized per unit collagen concentration (for quantitative analysis) or to give the same peak height (for easier visual comparison). To extract the contribution of type I collagen, the thermogram of purified human type III collagen (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) was rescaled to represent the amount corresponding to the fraction of type III collagen in the sample and subtracted from the thermogram of the mixture. For the rescaling procedure we utilized the similarity of type I and type III denaturation enthalpies (12Davis J.M. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25965-25972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deconvolution of mutant peaks in DSC thermograms was performed with the PeakFit software. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of 0.2 mg/ml collagen in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m glycerol, pH 7.4, were recorded from 215 to 250 nm at 100 nm/min scanning rate, 1 cm optical path length, 5 nm bandwidth in a J810 (Jasco, Easton, MD) spectropolarimeter equipped with a PFD-425S thermoelectric temperature controller (Jasco). To minimize ultraviolet damage, the shutter was closed during temperature equilibration between measurements (total UV exposure <15–20 min). The change in the fraction of triple helical conformation was estimated from the change in ellipticity at 223.8 nm. This wavelength was selected to minimize the direct effect of temperature on the ellipticity not associated with changes in collagen conformation. It represents an apparent isosbestic point, in which the CD signal from the normal control collagen is independent of temperature from 10 to 30 °C. DSC Thermograms—Normalized DSC thermograms (see “Experimental Procedures”) of normal control and mutant collagens in different buffers are shown in Fig. 1. Heating of normal control collagen at a constant rate produces a single denaturation peak in DSC with a maximum at the apparent denaturation temperature Tm. This peak contains a small contribution from type III collagen also present in the sample (Fig. 1A, Normal control). Whenever possible, we measured the content of type III collagen in the sample by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C) and corrected the thermograms for its contribution as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because of the relatively low content of type III collagen (Table 1) the correction was small and not critical for qualitative interpretation of the data (Fig. 1A).TABLE 1Quantitative analysis of composition of collagen secreted by fibroblastsMutationaα1m and α1 indicate mutant and normal chains, correspondinglyType III collagenType I collagenDSC data analysisChymotrypsinbAll cleavage experiments were performed at 34 °C, except for chymotrypsin cleavage of G88E, which was performed at 30 °C to avoid excessive proteolytic damageN-proteinasebAll cleavage experiments were performed at 34 °C, except for chymotrypsin cleavage of G88E, which was performed at 30 °C to avoid excessive proteolytic damage (Ref. 4Cabral W.A.

We find that each peak corresponds to a distinct collagen form rather than melting of different domains within the same molecule. For instance, three denaturation peaks of molecules with no (Tm ≈ 42 °C), one (Tm ≈ 40 °C), or two (Tm ≈ 37.5 °C) mutant α1(I) chains can be distinguished in G76E (Fig. 1A). Although most mutant peaks have lower Tm, their specific denaturation enthalpy appears to be the same as in normal control collagen, within the accuracy of collagen concentration measurements. Thus, the area under each peak represents the fraction of the corresponding molecules, allowing one to quantify each of the fractions from peak deconvolution. The results of quantitative collagen composition analysis based on deconvolution of DSC peaks from G76E and other mutant samples are collected in Table 1. Note that additional peaks on thermograms could also result from degraded collagen. Occasionally we did observe DSC peaks originating from cleavage of mutant triple helices upon prolonged exposure to pepsin. To eliminate such artifacts, each sample was verified by gel electrophoresis, and whenever necessary, the length of the pepsin treatment was adjusted. For instance, due to the increased susceptibility, the length of G88E treatment was reduced to 6 h. The assignment of each peak in the G76E thermogram relies on the following. In heterozygous mutants, ∼25% of the synthesized molecules are expected to have no mutant chains, ∼50% (one mutant chain) and ∼25% (two mutant chains). Normally, mutant molecules have higher probability of being retained and degraded inside cells. Thus, the ∼1:2 ratio of the areas of the normal Tm peak and the middle peak indicates that the latter represents molecules with a single mutant chain, almost all of which appear to be secreted. Then the smallest, third peak represents molecules with two mutant chains, about 50% of which appear to be retained and degraded by cells. This assignment is consistent with the expected larger effect on Tm of two mutant chains with large charged residues in place of the obligatory glycine. Interpretation of the peaks and the composition analysis for thermograms of other α1(I) mutations is less straightforward when only two or one denaturation peaks are distinguishable. The loss of peaks corresponding to molecules with one or two mutant chains could be related to (a) reduced synthesis and/or secretion of such molecules and (b) weaker effect of the mutant chains on Tm so that two or even all three peaks corresponding to different molecular forms of type I collagen overlap with each other. In some cases, the three peaks can still be resolved in a different buffer, as illustrated in Fig. 1B for G34R. Different effects of pH on different denaturation peaks can be explained as follows. Glu-32 is likely to be protonated and uncharged at pH 2.7 (below the glutamic acid pK). The protonation of Glu-32 would eliminate the potentially favorable electrostatic interaction between the positively charged Arg-34 and the negatively charged Glu-32. Such interaction might reduce the destabilizing effect of G34R substitution at pH 7.4, particularly in molecules with two mutant chains. The lack of this favorable interaction might explain the larger effect of the substitution on the molecules at pH 2.7, resulting in the larger Tm shift and in the separation of the denaturation peaks for molecules with one and two mutant chains. Similarly, the loss of favorable interaction between Arg-75 and Glu-76 might explain a significant shift of the denaturation peak of G76E molecules with two mutant chains to lower temperature at pH 2.7 compared with pH 7.4. In other cases, we can only determine the total fraction of mutant molecules but cannot distinguish the molecules with one and two mutant chains (e.g. for G25V). Sometimes only one peak is observed (e.g. G352S and G832S, Fig. 2, K and M). In this case, the only conclusion that can be drawn from DSC of media collagen is that the mutation has little effect on collagen thermal stability (provided that the mutant molecules are secreted). Effect of Propeptides—We previously reported an unusual feature of mutations in the first 90 N-terminal amino acids (4Cabral W.A. Makareeva E. Colige A. Letocha A.D. Ty J.M. Yeowell H.N. Pals G. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19259-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Their DSC thermograms showed distinct differences between each procollagen and collagen. It appeared that the presence of N-propeptides had a stabilizing effect on the triple helix in molecules containing mutant chains, resulting in up to 3 °C increase in their apparent Tm (Fig. 2, B–F). No effect of propeptides on the apparent Tm was observed in normal collagen (Fig. 2A) or molecules with mutations immediately beyond this region (G121D and G136R, Fig. 2, H and I). Our subsequent, more detailed studies revealed no differences in the thermal stability of procollagen and collagen further along the triple helix (e.g. G193S, G352S, G448S and G832S, Fig. 2, J–M), except in the immediate vicinity of the C-terminal end. Stability of the latter molecules appears to be affected by cleavage of C-propeptides, but this effect is beyond the scope of the present study and it will be discussed elsewhere. 3A. Barnes, N. V. Kuznetsova, S. Leikin, E. Makareeva, and J. C. Marini, unpublished data. Proteolytic Cleavage—To verify the existence of a distinct N-terminal folding domain and to determine how mutations alter its structure, we investigated susceptibility of collagen to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin and chymotrypsin. After 20-min equilibration in 0.5 mg/ml chymotrypsin at 34 °C, we observed no substantial proteolytic degradation of control collagen, G136R, G193S, and G448S. In contrast, all tested molecules with mutations in the first 90 N-terminal amino acids of the α1(I) chain exhibited pronounced cleavage (Fig. 3A and Table 1). Each mutant was co-processed with control collagen in the same tube to ensure identical conditions. The cleavage patterns were identical within each of the following groups of molecules: 1) normal control, G136R, G193S, and G448S; 2) G13D and ΔE7; 3) G25V and G34R; and 4) G76E and G88E. Thus, only one representative from each group is shown in Fig. 3A. Analysis of CNBr peptides from the products of this cleavage revealed increased chymotrypsin susceptibility within CB5 (aa 87–123) of α1(I) chain, most likely at Phe-92 (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, G121D had an increased susceptibility to proteolysis at the N-terminal end of CB8 (aa 124–402). The results of collagen treatment by trypsin were qualitatively similar, but the reaction products were more difficult to detect and interpret due to the much larger number of potential cleavage sites. Thermal Stability of Truncated Collagen—By utilizing similar gel electrophoretic analysis and CNBr peptide mapping, we found that 4-h treatment of G25V collagen by 0.5 mg/ml chymotrypsin at 30 °C produced a mixture of intact, full-length collagen with no mutant chains and truncated collagen whose N-terminal domain was completely removed by chymotrypsin cleavage (most likely at Phe-92 in α1(I) and Phe-86 in α2(I)). DSC of this mix in 2 mm HCl at 1 °C/min produced two peaks consistent with denaturation of intact molecules at normal Tm and N-truncated molecules ∼7 °C lower (Fig. 4B). Since truncated molecules do not contain the mutation, this reduced Tm simply represents thermal stability of the triple helical fragment without 90 N-terminal amino acids. Deconvolution of DSC thermograms of untreated mutant collagens in 2 mm HCl at 1 °C/min revealed low temperature peaks in intact G25V, G34R and G76E with Tm similar to the truncated collagen (Fig. 4B). These peaks correspond to the denaturation of triple helices with two mutant chains, which therefore have the same thermal stability as the triple helix without the first 90 N-terminal amino acids. In these mutants the N-terminal domain becomes so weak that it does not contribute to the thermal stability of the triple helix at all, in sharp contrast to the normal control. In combination with significant chymotrypsin sensitivity within α1(I)-CB5 at 34 °C, stabilization of the molecule by the N-propeptide, and the inability of N-proteinase to cleave the N-propeptide, this effect suggests that the first 90 N-terminal amino acids might be completely unfolded at body temperature. The lack of such low temperature peak in ΔE7 and G13D means that the N-terminal domain contributes to the thermal stability even when these proteins contain two mutant chains. Their susceptibility to chymotrypsin cleavage within α1(I)-CB5 at 34 °C still indicates that the conformational change in the triple helix propagates through the whole N-terminal domain, but the conformational change appears to be less drastic than in G25V, G34R, or G76E, e.g. it might involve loosening rather than complete unfolding of the N-terminal domain. Reversible Partial Denaturation of G25V Collagen—To confirm unfolding of the N-terminal domain in G25V, we measured temperature-induced changes in the circular dichroism at 223.8 nm. This wave-length was selected to minimize changes in the CD signal directly associated with temperature rather than with changes in the secondary structure of collagen. Control and G25V samples were equilibrated at 10 °C and tested by similar trains of 34.5 °C pulses shown in Fig. 5B. Comparison of the observed CD changes (Fig. 5A) is consistent with reversible loss of ∼1.5–2% of the triple helix signal. Based on the results of N-propeptide processing (Ref. 4Cabral W.A. Makareeva E. Colige A. Letocha A.D. Ty J.M. Yeowell H.N. Pals G. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19259-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and Table 1) and the DSC analysis discussed above, it is reasonable to assume that these changes are associated with partial denaturation of triple helices in molecules with two mutant chains, which comprise ∼15–25% of secreted collagen. Then, the 1.5–2% loss of the triple helix signal indicates reversible unfolding of a domain containing 100 ± 40 amino acids in each chain, consistent with the results of proteolytic cleavage analysis and the truncated collagen study. (The upper and lower bounds in this estimate were calculated as 1014 × 2%/15% = 135 and 1014 × 1.5%/25% = 61 correspondingly, where 1014 is the length of each chain within the triple helical domain). The present study provides biochemical and biophysical evidence corroborating our hypothesis (4Cabral W.A. Makareeva E. Colige A. Letocha A.D. Ty J.M. Yeowell H.N. Pals G. Leikin S. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19259-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) of a highly stable 85-aa domain, which serves as the stabilizing N-anchor for the amino end of the collagen triple helix. Regardless of their location, five different glycine substitutions and a deletion within this region of the α1(I) chain have qualitatively similar effects on collagen stability. They all result in a significant loss of the thermal stability of collagen triple helix, a smaller change in the stability of procollagen, altered N-propeptide cleavage, and appearance of chymotrypsin sensitivity at Phe-92 in the α1(I) chain. Finer, quantitative effects on the thermal stability and proteolytic sensitivity appear to vary with the mutation location but not with its type. Specifically, within each of the two pairs of closely located mutations (ΔE7/G13D and G25V/G34R) these effects were virtually indistinguishable despite the difference in the nature of the mutation. Based on the present data we arrive at the following conclusions. Molecules with Two Mutant Chains Exhibit Cooperative N-anchor Unfolding—Mu"

Fruit development results from the coordination of cell division and cell expansion, and the control of these two phenomena is a crucial determinant of the final size of fruits. The early development of tomato fruit can be divided into three distinct phases (1Gillaspy G. Ben-David H. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Phase I corresponds to the development of the ovary and the decision to set fruit after successful pollination and fertilization. In phase II the ovary develops in response to fertilization by a series of intense cell division. In phase III fruit growth is mainly sustained by cell expansion leading to a fruit of almost final size that is able to ripen. During this latter phase, the development of the pericarp and the jelly-like locular (gel) tissue (Fig. 1C) is associated with an increase in the nuclear DNA ploidy (2Joubès J. Phan T.-H. Just D. Rothan C. Bergounioux C. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by endoreduplication (3Joubès J. Chevalier C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 735-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although endoreduplication is a widespread phenomenon in higher plants, its control and role during plant development are still poorly understood. The endoreduplication cycle or endocycle corresponds to a modified cell cycle lacking mitosis, and as such it utilizes several key cell cycle regulators, including those controlling the G1/S transition (4Grafi G. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Increasing our knowledge of the cell cycle control may lead to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying endoreduplication. The progression within the plant cell cycle is regulated by a class of heterodimeric protein complexes common to all eukaryotic cells (5Dewitte W. Murray J.A.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These complexes consist of a catalytic subunit referred to as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 5The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DPA, days post-anthesis; KRP; p27Kip1-related protein; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RBR, retinoblastoma-related protein; RR, red ripe; MG, mature green; TC, tentative consensus.5The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DPA, days post-anthesis; KRP; p27Kip1-related protein; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RBR, retinoblastoma-related protein; RR, red ripe; MG, mature green; TC, tentative consensus. and a regulatory cyclin subunit whose association determines the activity of the complex, its stability, and its localization and substrate specificity. The activity of the complexes is governed by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events, availability of the protein partners (synthesis and controlled degradation of the cyclin moiety), and the binding of other proteins such as inhibitors or regulatory factors.The involvement of CDKs in the control of endoreduplication has been recently demonstrated in maize endosperm cells (6Leiva-Neto J.T. Grafi G. Sabelli P.A. Dante R.A. Woo Y.-M. Maddock S. Gordon-Kamm W.J. Larkins B.A. Plant. 2004; 16: 1854-1869Google Scholar) and in Arabidopsis leaf cells (7Boudolf V. Vlieghe K. Beemster G.T.S. Magyar Z. Torres Acosta J.A. Maes S. Van Der Schueren E. Inzé D. De Veylder L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this control is associated with the inhibition of M-phase CDK activity. This has been observed in various plant cells or organs displaying an increase in the DNA ploidy level through endoreduplication, e.g. maize endosperm cells (8Grafi G. Larkins B.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1262-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), developing tomato fruit tissues (2Joubès J. Phan T.-H. Just D. Rothan C. Bergounioux C. Raymond P.

The three mechanisms for the control of CDK complex activity are likely to occur during endoreduplication. The WEE1 inhibitory kinase may play a role in endoreduplicating cells of the maize endosperm (9Sun Y. Dilkes B.P. Zhang C. Dante R.A. Carneiro N.P. Lowe K.S. Jung R. Gordon-Kamm W.J.

Mouras A. Chevalier C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 56: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The selective degradation of M-phase-specific cyclins via the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex is likely to be involved in the control of endoreduplicating cells of alfalfa root nodules (11Cebolla A.

Kelemen Z. Tarayre S. Roudier F. Mergaert P. Kondorosi A. Kondorosi E. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2093-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The involvement of CDK inhibitors in the control of endoreduplication has been more difficult to demonstrate. Their in planta overexpression always resulted in reduced endoreduplication because they are probably able to target a broad spectrum of CDK complexes, including the G1/S-specific ones (13De Veylder L. Beeckman T. Beemster G.T.S. Krols L. Terras F. Landrieu I. Van Der Schueren E. Maes S. Naudits M. Inzé D. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schnittger A. Weinl C. Bouyer D.

Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1723-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) showed that a weak overexpression of the Arabidopsis CDK inhibitor KRP2 inhibited only the mitotic cell cycle-specific CDKA;1 kinase complexes, whereas the endoreduplication cycle-specific CDKA;1 complexes were unaffected. This led to an expected increase in the DNA ploidy level. This study demonstrated for the first time the involvement of a CDK inhibitor in the control of the transition from mitosis to endoreduplication.Tomato fruit is a good model for study of the interconnection between normal cell cycle events and endoreduplication, as its nuclei become highly polyploid during fruit growth, especially in pericarp and locular tissue cells (Fig. 1C) (2Joubès J. Phan T.-H. Just D. Rothan C. Bergounioux C. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In these tissues, the ploidy can reach levels up to 256 or even 512 C (where C is the DNA content of the haploid genome) that cannot be observed in other model plants such as Arabidopsis or maize (16Melaragno J.E. Mehrotra B. Coleman A.W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 17Vilhar B. Kladnik A. Blejec A. Chourey P.S. Dermastia M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, we have shown that the arrest of cell division and subsequent endoreduplication during fruit development are associated with the inhibition of the CDK-cyclin complex (2Joubès J.

Two cDNAs, LeKRP1 and LeKRP2, encoding tomato CDK inhibitors were isolated. Their expression was associated with differentiating cells of the gel undergoing endoreduplication. At the biochemical level we showed that LeKRP1 could inhibit CDK-cyclin kinase activities in endoreduplicating cells of the gel tissue. These data provide further information on the putative role of KRP in the control of endoreduplication in plant cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Library Screening—A cDNA library was constructed with poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from the gel tissue of 20-DPA tomato fruits using the ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit and Gigapack III Gold cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA library comprised 1.1 × 106 recombinant plaques. The isolation of full-length cDNA was obtained by screening the library as described previously (2Joubès J. Phan T.-H. Just D. Rothan C. Bergounioux C. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Estimation of Relative Transcript Levels with RT-PCR—The relative transcript levels of each cDNA were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR assays as previously described (2Joubès J.

The specific pairs of primers used for the amplification of the cDNAs were CAACATTCAGACCCCTGGTTCC and GTCTAGAGATGAAACGAGGC for LeKRP1 and GCTGAGCAGCAACAACAACGCC and GACATTGGCTATGTCACCTTGC for LeKRP2. Primers for LeCYCA2;1 and LeActin1 were as described previously (18Joubès J. Walsh D. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Planta. 2000; 211: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RT-PCR experiments were repeated three times.In Situ Hybridization—Vegetative meristems and flower buds at different developmental stages were fixed according to previously described procedures (19Joubès J. Lemaire-Chamley M. Delmas F. Walter J. Hernould M. Mouras A. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 templates used for riboprobe synthesis were amplified by PCR using the specific primers described above and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Synthesis of digoxygenin-11-rUTP-labeled riboprobes, hybridization, washes, and immunological detection of the hybridized probes were carried out as previously described (19Joubès J.

The induction of the recombinant histidine-tagged LeKRP1 protein and subsequent purification by Ni-NTA column affinity chromatography were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). The His6-LeKRP1 recombinant protein was dialyzed against the following buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and used for rabbit immunization to yield a polyclonal antibody (Eurogentec, Herstal, Belgium). Total IgG was further purified on protein A-agarose using a 1-ml column of HiTrap™ Protein A high performance (Amersham Biosciences).Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunodepletion—Epidermis and gel tissues were dissected from tomato fruit and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to protein extraction. They were then ground into a fine powder and stored at -80 °C. For protein extraction, 100 mg of frozen powder was thawed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% anti-protease mixture). The cell debris was discarded after a 15-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C.For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of total protein from gel tissue in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was precleared with 20 μl of 25% (v/v) protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °Cona rotating wheel. After a brief centrifugation, the precleared supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of the LeKRP1 (1:500) antibody. 20 μl of 25% (v/v) protein A-agarose beads were subsequently added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and used as the immunodepleted extracts. The pelleted beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. After a final centrifugation, the immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli loading buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Samples were separated in a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane prior to immunological detection by Western blot analyses using the LeKRP1 (1/600) antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG diluted 1/10,000 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) with the BM Chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD) system from Roche Applied Science.The same procedure was applied for demonstrating the in vivo interaction between LeKRP1 and CDKA, except that 800 μg of total protein from gel tissue were used. A negative control was performed using the preimmune antiserum to precipitate the proteins. Samples were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-PSTAIR (1/1000) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).In Vitro Kinase Assay—p9CksHs1 was purified from an overproducing strain of E. coli and linked to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to Azzi et al. (21Azzi L. Meijer L. Reed S.I. Pidikiti R. Tung H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A 50-μl aliquot of packed p9CksHs1 protein-Sepharose beads was washed with bead buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and anti-protease mixture) and was mixed with the protein extract. The tubes were rotated constantly at 4 °C overnight. After a brief centrifugation at 10,000 × g and removal of the supernatant, the beads were carefully washed three times with bead buffer, once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and then used for kinase assay. The histone H1 kinase reaction was initiated by resuspending the pellet of p9CksHs1-Sepharose beads with 30 μl of the reaction mixture containing 1 mg ml-1 histone H1 as the substrate and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (22Magyar Z. Bako L. Bögre L. Dedeoglu D. Kapros T. Dudits D. Plant J. 1993; 4: 151-161Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Assays were terminated by placing the tube on ice. After a brief centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer was added to the supernatant. Samples were analyzed in a 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel to visualize the histone H1 and subsequent autoradiography to detect histone H1 phosphorylation. 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer was added to the bead pellet, and Western blot analysis was performed to detect CDKA using the anti-PSTAIR (1/1000). Detection of CDKA was performed by standard nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining.For assaying the retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR) kinase activity, tobacco NtRb1 was expressed using the pGEX-5X-2 plasmid (23Nakagami H. Sekine M. Murakami H. Shinmyo A. Plant J. 1999; 18: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as a glutathione S-transferase-NtRb1 fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Protein extracts were mixed with glutathione S-transferase-NtRb1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Kinase reactions were initiated at 30 °C by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and unlabeled ATP to a final concentration of 30 μm. After 30 min of incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The visualization of phosphorylated NtRb1 was as described above. Signals obtained from autoradiography, Western blot, and gel staining were quantified by image scanning using the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA).Detection of Protein-Protein Interactions—Protein-protein interactions between LeKRP1 and the different CDK and cyclins were detected by a two-hybrid assay as described previously (19Joubès J. Lemaire-Chamley M. Delmas F. Walter J. Hernould M. Mouras A. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Phylogenetic Analysis of Plant KRPs—The sequence analysis of plant KRPs was performed using BioEdit (24Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar), and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining algorithm using the software packages TREECON (25Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 569-570PubMed Google Scholar). Bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates was performed to test the significance of the nodes.RESULTSMolecular Characterization of Two cDNAs Encoding p27Kip1-related Proteins from Tomato—Exploiting the genomic resources of The Institute for Genomic Research (Rockville, MD) Tomato Gene Index (LeGI), we were able to identify two Tentative Consensus (TC) sequences corresponding to cDNAs encoding CDK-specific inhibitors of the plant KRP family (13De Veylder L. Beeckman T. Beemster G.T.S. Krols L. Terras F. Landrieu I. Van Der Schueren E. Maes S. Naudits M. Inzé D. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TC89204 was 1014 bp and contained a complete open reading frame coding for a 212-amino acid translation product of MW 24.0. TC89097 was a partial sequence of 458 bp harboring a truncated open reading frame. We obtained the corresponding full-length cDNA by screening a “20-DPA tomato gel tissue” cDNA library. The full-length cDNA corresponding to TC89097 was 1061 bp and encoded a 190-amino acid product (MW 19.9).The sequence similarities of plant KRPs are mostly in the C-terminal part of the proteins (13De Veylder L. Beeckman T. Beemster G.T.S. Krols L. Terras F. Landrieu I. Van Der Schueren E. Maes S. Naudits M. Inzé D. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jasinski S. Perennes C. Bergounioux C. Glab N. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 18871-18882Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus the 43-amino acid C termini of the two predicted proteins were used for phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2A). The translation products corresponding to TC89204 and TC89097 displayed the highest sequence homology with Arath;KRP4 and Arath; KRP3, respectively, rather than their closest evolutionary counterparts from tobacco, Nicta;KRP (26Jasinski S. Perennes C. Bergounioux C. Glab N. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 18871-18882Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Nicsy;KRP (GenBank™ accession number AJ297905). As shown in Fig. 2B, they both displayed 73.8% identity with their Arabidopsis counterparts, over the C-terminal 43 residues which encompass domains I, II, and III as defined by De Veylder et al. (13De Veylder L. Beeckman T. Beemster G.T.S. Krols L. Terras F. Landrieu I. Van Der Schueren E. Maes S. Naudits M. Inzé D. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this phylogenetic and sequence analysis, the two cDNAs were identified as putatively encoding tomato KRPs and thus named LeKRP1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AJ441249 for TC89204) and LeKRP2 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AJ441250 for TC89097).FIGURE 2Comparison of amino acid sequences of LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 with plant KRPs. A, unrooted neighbor-joining tree of the plant KRPs with the Poisson correction for evolutionary distance calculation. Bootstrap values of 500 bootstrap iterations are shown. Numbers indicate evolutionary distance. The phylogenetic analysis was performed over the last 43 C-terminal residues of the KRPs. Accession numbers are indicated in parentheses. B, sequence alignments of LeKRP1 with Arath;KRP4 and LeKRP2 with Arath;KRP3. Gaps (-) were introduced to maximize the alignments.

In fully differentiated leaves (DL), the level of LeKRP1 transcripts was much lower. The LeKRP2 transcripts were most abundant in stems (St), and roots and weakly expressed in seeds (Sd) and leaves (YL and DL).FIGURE 3Differential expression analysis by semiquantitative RT-PCR of tomato KRP genes in various organs of tomato and during fruit development. A, expression analysis in various organs from tomato plants: young leaves (YL), differentiated leaves (DL), roots (Ro), stems (St), mature seeds (Sd), and inflorescences (In). C1 and C2 correspond to the negative control (absence of cDNA matrix) and positive control (presence of cDNA of interest as a matrix) of PCR, respectively. The LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 mRNA abundances were normalized toward that of Actin1 and expressed as a ratio of arbitrary units for pixel intensities. B, expression analysis in whole fruits harvested at the following developmental stages: A, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 20 DPA and MG. C, expression analysis in the dissected fruit tissues (epidermis, pericarp, and gel) at the following developmental stages: 10, 15, and 20 DPA, MG, and RR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)During fruit development, the LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 transcripts were highly expressed very early in the cell division phase (Fig. 3B). After 3 DPA, their respective expression profiles differed. The abundance of LeKRP1 mRNA decreased, reaching its lowest level during the cell expansion phase (8-20 DPA), whereas the abundance of LeKRP2 transcripts decreased gradually, not reaching their lowest level until the mature green (MG) stage.The different tissues that compose the fruit were dissected to analyze the gene expression from a spatial and developmental perspective. As shown in Fig. 1C, the epidermis tissue per se is composed of a single cell layer. During the tissue preparation fruits were peeled to obtain the epidermis that consists of a few external layers made of small cells. The pericarp corresponds to the fleshy part of the fruit and the gel to the jelly-like locular tissue that surrounds the seeds. The above mentioned difference in the expression profiles of the two tomato KRP genes was also observed during the course of fruit development (Fig. 3C). The maximum expression of LeKRP1 was observed at 20 DPA in all the dissected tissues, especially in the gel tissue where mitosis is impaired and endoreduplication occurs (2Joubès J. Phan T.-H. Just D. Rothan C. Bergounioux C. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as evidenced by the disappearance of LeCYCA2;1 transcripts. In all three tissues, the expression of LeKRP2 gradually increased to reach its maximum level at the red ripe (RR) stage.To further characterize LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 gene expression, in situ hybridizations were performed using longitudinal sections of vegetative shoot meristems and developing floral organs (Fig. 4). In vegetative shoot meristems, the in situ hybridization signals using LeKRP1 as a probe were detected in the regions where cell divisions predominantly occur, such as the central and peripheral zones of the meristem and the leaf primordia (Fig. 4, A and B). In 5-mm floral buds, a strong signal was observed in the developing ovules and the carpel wall (Fig. 4D). A higher magnification of the flower bud and an ovule hybridized with LeKRP1 revealed a patchy pattern of expression (Fig. 4, E and F). The hybridization signal obtained with LeKRP2 as a probe was uniformly distributed within the different developing organs of a 7-mm flower bud (Fig. 4G). This uniform distribution was confirmed at the level of the ovules (Fig. 4I) and also observed in every developmental stage of flower buds we analyzed (data not shown). A stronger expression was detected in the epidermis and the 2-3 subepidermal cell layers of the carpel wall (Fig. 4H). These data not only show a differential expression of tomato KRP genes during fruit and plant development but also suggest the involvement of tomato KRPs in endoreduplication during tomato fruit development (2Joubès J. Phan T.-H. Just D. Rothan C. Bergounioux C. Raymond P. Chevalier C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Analysis of LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 expression at the spatial level. Expression was localized by in situ hybridization of Dig-dUTP antisense LeKRP1 (A, B, D, E, and F) and LeKRP2 (G, H, and I) RNA to mRNA transcripts. Positive hybridization signals correspond to the blue/violet color. LeKRP1 and LeKRP2 sense riboprobes were used as negative controls: a typical pattern of hybridization is shown for LeKRP1 (C).

https://openalex.org/W2031063750,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a transcriptional complex composed of an oxygen-sensitive α- and a β-subunit, plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen availability. Under normoxia, the α-subunit of HIF-1 is hydroxylated by a family of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and consequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. Three different PHDs have been identified, but the difference among their in vivo roles remain unclear. PHD3 is strikingly expressed by hypoxia, displays high substrate specificity, and has been identified in other signaling pathways. PHD3 may therefore hydroxylate divergent substrates and/or connect divergent cellular responses with HIF. We identified a novel WD-repeat protein, recently designated Morg1 (MAPK organizer 1), by screening a cDNA library with yeast two-hybrid assays. The interaction between PHD3 and Morg1 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. We found seven WD-repeat domains by cloning the full-length cDNA of Morg1. By confocal microscopy both proteins co-localize within the cytoplasm and the nucleus and display a similar tissue expression pattern in Northern blots. Binding occurs at a conserved region predicted to the top surface of one propeller blade. Finally, HIF-mediated reporter gene activity is decreased by Morg1 and reduced to basal levels when Morg1 is co-expressed with PHD3. Suppression of Morg1 or PHD3 by stealth RNA leads to a marked increase of HIF-1 activity. These results indicate that Morg1 specifically interacts with PHD3 most likely by acting as a molecular scaffold. This interaction may provide a molecular framework between HIF regulation and other signaling pathways.

Alternative splicing in various adult and fetal human tissues suggests a complex regulation, in particular because major transcripts encode catalytically inactive polypeptides on HIF-1α substrates. Interestingly, PHD3 is significantly shorter than either PHD1 or PHD2, and a possible additional binding partner required for full activity was discussed (30Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Elkins J.M. Schofield C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 510-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, no rigid consensus sequence for hydroxylation of HIF-1α was found and a long peptide binding site with multiple interactions is likely (8Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol.

These results suggest that additional cofactors, other prolyl hydroxylation substrates, and/or molecular scaffolds are required to allow multiple interactions. In the present work we identified Morg1, a WD-repeat protein, as a molecular scaffold that directly binds PHD3 in vitro and in vivo and may link PHD3 to different pathways. PHD3 and Morg1 perfectly co-localize in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and display a similar tissue expression pattern in different tissues. Binding of Morg1 occurs within the β-sheet of strand b, involving residues predicted to the top of one WD-propeller blade. Finally, we show that Morg1 decreases HIF-mediated reporter gene activity and that this effect is additive by co-expression of PHD3. Vice versa, suppression of Morg1 or PHD3 by stealth RNA results in a marked increase of HIF-1 activity. Morg1 may therefore serve as a scaffold for protein interactions and represent a link between PHD3 and diverse cellular outcomes. All chemicals other than indicated were purchased from Sigma, restriction and modifying enzymes from New England Biolabs, the yeast two-hybrid system vectors, primers, yeast strain, yeast plasmid purification products, cDNA library, and co-immunoprecipitation products were from Clontech. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. pGBKT7 was expressed as a fusion protein to a GAL4 DNA binding domain and a c-Myc epitope tag using tryptophan as selection marker. A rat brain cDNA library cloned into pACT2 was expressed as a fusion protein to the GAL4 activation domain and a HA epitope tag using leucine as selection marker. All yeast transformations were performed according to the high transformation efficiency protocol of yeast transformation system 2 (Clontech). Expression of PHD3 in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting yeast protein extracts using monoclonal antibodies against the c-Myc epitope. Protein extracts were obtained by the urea/SDS methods according to the yeast protocol handbook (Clontech). To check for autonomous activation, PHD3-transformed yeasts were plated onto SD-agar plates lacking tryptophan and containing X-α-galactosidase. To increase transformation efficiency both plasmids were sequentially transformed into yeast strain AH109. AH109 transformants were selected using three different reporters: adenine (ADE2), histidine (HIS3), and α-galactosidase (MEL1), under the control of distinct GAL4 upstream activating sequences and TATA boxes. Transformants were screened on SD-agar plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and containing X-α-galactosidase (high stringency selection). SD-agar plates lacking tryptophan and leucine were used to calculate the cotransformation efficiency and the number of clones screened. To eliminate false positive clones yeast plasmids were isolated using a yeast plasmid isolation KIT (Clontech), transformed into Escherichia coli, purified, retransformed into the yeast strain expressing PHD3, and streaked out twice. Positive clones from this screening were subjected to direct sequencing. Deletion constructs were screened accordingly. Generation of full-length rat PHD3, Morg1, deletion constructs, and the 6× HIF responsive element (HRE) is described as supplemental data. Northern Blots—RNA extraction and Northern blotting were performed as described (38Zahner G. Wolf G. Ayoub M. Reinking R. Panzer U. Shankland S.J. Stahl R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9763-9771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Morg1 and PHD3 cDNAs were labeled with [32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) using random hexamer primers. Probes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in rapid-hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences), washed several times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC, 0.1 SDS and exposed to a Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Morg1 cDNA was used as a probe to label a rat multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech). 5′ RACE—Total rat brain and testis RNA were extracted using TRI Reagent and DNase I treated (DNA-free; Ambion, Austin, TX). First strand cDNA was synthesized using primer CCCTGTGTCTTTATCTAGAA and Superscript II® reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The original mRNA template was removed by treatment with RNase H/T1 (Invitrogen), and unincorporated dNTPs, primer, and proteins were separated from the cDNA by Qiaquick® PCR purification (Qiagen). A polymeric tail was then added to the 3′ end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Invitrogen) and dCTP. One nested round of PCR was sufficient to reveal the full 5′ end (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′ (Invitrogen) and 5′-GGTGATGGGGCTGCCCACAT-3′). PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-easy and subjected to direct sequencing. 3′ RACE— First strand cDNA synthesis was catalyzed by SuperScript II® reverse transcriptase using DNase I-treated rat brain and testis RNA and adapter primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ (Invitrogen)). Residual mRNA was degraded by RNase H/T1 and target cDNA was amplified using primer AUAP (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′ (Invitrogen) and 5′-GGTTCTAATGTGGTACAG-3′). PCR products were ligated into pGEM T-easy and subjected to direct sequencing. PC12 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures) were maintained in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm minimal essential medium sodium pyruvate, 15 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. All transfections were performed with Superfect® (Qiagen) if not otherwise stated. To determine the ERK phosphorylation status, cells were transfected with either Morg1 and pCEP4, PHD3 and pCEP4 (to achieve equimolar concentrations), or PHD3 and Morg1, serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 10% serum for 10 min. Cells were lysed in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6.6% SDS, and denatured in loading buffer (5% glycerol, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 10 mmol/liter dithiothreitol) at 95 °C for 5 min. Yeast extracts were prepared according to the urea/SDS method following the yeast protocol handbook (Clontech). Immunoprecipitation products, yeast, or cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE® precast gel, Invitrogen), electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Amersham Biosciences) with an Invitrogen semi-dry blotting apparatus. Filters were blocked with 7.5% (w/v) dried milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), then incubated in rabbit polyclonal anti-serum, nonimmune rabbit serum, or monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (dilutions: anti-Morg1 and anti-PHD3, 1:500 (36Wolf G. Harendza S. Schroeder R. Wenzel U. Zahner G. Butzmann U. Freeman R.S. Stahl R.A. Lab.

After three washes in PBS-T, filters were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody (BD Bioscience; 1:2000 in PBS-T, 1 h at room temperature) and washed three times in PBS-T. Signal detection was performed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-phospho-44/42 MAP kinase was blocked and incubated in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween with 5% bovine serum albumin, washed, and incubated with an AP conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotech; 1:2500). Detection was performed by CDP-Star (Tropix). pGADT7/-Morg1 (HA-epitope tagged) and pGBKT7/PHD3 (c-Myc epitope-tagged), both containing T7 polymerase promotor sequences, were linearized and purified using Qiaquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen). pGBKT7-53 (expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged p53) and pGADT7-T (expressing HA epitope-tagged large T-antigen) were used as controls. Each plasmid was mixed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, reaction buffer containing 1 mm of all amino acids, except methionine, ribonuclease inhibitor, T7 polymerase (Promega), [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. 10 μl of in vitro translated Morg1 and 10 μl of in vitro translated PHD3 were incubated 1 h at room temperature, before 1 μg of monoclonal anti-c-Myc or 1 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Protein A beads were washed, added, and incubated with the reaction for another 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was washed five times, denatured, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was rinsed in amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to a Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells were transfected with Morg1-HA pCEP4 and PHD3pcDNA3-T7 fusion constructs (kindly provided by Robert S. Freeman). After 48 h cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, Complete® Mini Protein Inhibitor Mixture (Roche)) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations of PHD3, 2 μl of anti-T7 antibody (Molecular Probes) or 2 μl of anti-PHD3 antibody (36Wolf G. Harendza S. Schroeder R. Wenzel U. Zahner G. Butzmann U. Freeman R.S. Stahl R.A. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 1305-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were incubated with 1,000 μg of protein lysate overnight at 4 °C. 40 μl of Protein G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was added for another 1 h at 4°C. Subsequently, the agarose-protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer at 10,000 × g, at 4 °C for 20 s and dissociated in SDS running buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitations of Morg1 were performed with either 5 μg of anti-HA (clone 12CA5; Roche) or 2 μl of purified anti-Morg1 antibody. Immunoprecipitations with either normal rabbit serum or just Protein G plus-agarose served as controls. For co-localization experiments, PC12 and HEK293 cells were cultured in Lab-TekII® chamber slides (Nalge Nunc Co.) and transiently transfected with the chimeric pEGFP-PHD3 (gift of Robert S. Freeman) and Morg1-HA pCEP4. After 48 h PC12 cells were attached to Cell-TAK® (BD Biosciences)-treated chamber slides for 1 h. Fixation and immunostaining were performed as described (39Hopfer U. Fukai N. Hopfer H. Wolf G. Joyce N. Li N. Olsen B. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with methanol for 10 min on ice. Immunostaining was performed at room temperature using the mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche) with an isotype-matched control mouse (DAKO) and rabbit anti-EGFP antibodies (Molecular Probes) with nonimmune rabbit IgG as a control. Secondary antibodies were Texas Red anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO). The subcellular distribution of fluorescent activity was examined by conventional fluorescence (Axioscope, Zeiss) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510 META, Zeiss). For tryptic cleavage, HEK293 cells were transfected with Morg1-pCEP-4 using Superfect® reagent. Cells were lysed in trypsin reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) and incubated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (New England Biolabs) for 10 min at 30 °C as described (40Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, immediately heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. PHD3, Morg1, 6× HRE, and a normalizing pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid were transfected into HEK293 cells using Superfect® transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An empty pCEP4 vector was transfected along with all transfections to achieve equimolar amounts of plasmids. The PGL3-promotor plasmid (Promega) was used as a control. After 8 h, 800 μm l-mimosine was added as indicated. 24 h post-transfection cells were washed with PBS, lysed (25 mm glycylglycin, pH 8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase assays were performed as described (41Wolf G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19552-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed in triplicate for each construct, and all transfection sets were repeated at least three times. Transfection results were averaged, normalized with the β-galactosidase results, and expressed as the means. Two polyclonal antisera to the synthetic peptide, CRSRKPEPVQTLDEA of Morg1 (comprising amino acids 138-152), coupled to hemocyanin of limulus polyphemus were raised in New Zealand White rabbits. Specific IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography (Biotrend). Antibodies were characterized by immunoblotting and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (43Hopfer H. Maron R. Butzmann U. Helmchen U. Weiner H.L. Kalluri R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, 96-well plates were coated with 100 ng/well peptide in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2, overnight, washed with PBS-T, blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS-T, 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS-T, and incubated with the appropriate concentration of sera (diluted in 5% goat serum) for 2 h at 37°C. After four additional wash steps plates were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody (Southern Biotechnology, dilution 1:2500, 1 h at room temperature). Detection was performed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate for 30 min at 37 °C. A stealth RNA targeting the 25-nucleotide sequence, ACUCUACUCUGAGGCUUCUAGAUAA of Morg1, the Morg1 control stealth RNA, ACUCUCAGAGUUUCGGAUCAUCUAA, a stealth RNA targeting the PHD3 gene, TGGAGCGAGTCAAGCAGCTGCATTA, and the corresponding PHD3 control RNA, TGGGAGCAACTGACGCGTCAGATTA, were obtained from Invitrogen. 100 nm stealth RNA was transfected with Lipofectamine® (Invitrogen), after 48 h RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit® (Qiagen). cDNAs were synthesized using 200 ng of RNA, random hexamers, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCRs were performed as described (44Wolf G. Schroeder R. Stahl R.A. Am. J. Nephrol. 2004; 24: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using primers Morg1-F, GCGATACACACGTGGTCAGC; Morg1-R, CCCAGAAGAACACTTTGCCG; PHD3-F, TGGGACACATCATGAGGCTG; PHD3-R, CGATGTACTCCAGGGCGATC. Transfection efficiencies were optimized by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen). For luciferase assays the indicated plasmids were transfected 4 h post-transfection of stealth RNAs using Lipofectamine®. Identification of Morg1 as PHD3-associated Protein—We used the yeast two-hybrid technique to identify proteins that interact with PHD3. We took advantage of three different reporter genes to eliminate false positive clones: adenine, histidine, and α-galactosidase. A PHD3 cDNA was taken as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library. From 2.97 × 107 library transformants, 54 clones were obtained that restored growth of AH109 yeast on high stringency selection agar in a PHD3-dependent manner. Three positive clones encoded the carboxyl-terminal half of Morg1 (Fig. 1, A and B), a WD-repeat protein recently described as a component of the ERK cascade (45Vomastek T. Schaeffer H.J. Tarcsa"
https://openalex.org/W2041112826,"The α-1,6-mannosyltransferase encoded by Saccharomyces cerevisiae OCH1 (ScOCH1) is responsible for the outer chain initiation of N-linked oligosaccharides. To identify the genes involved in the first step of outer chain biosynthesis in the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, we undertook the functional analysis of three H. polymorpha genes, HpHOC1, HpOCH1, and HpOCR1, that belong to the OCH1 family containing seven members with significant sequence identities to ScOCH1. The deletions of these H. polymorpha genes individually resulted in several phenotypes suggestive of cell wall defects. Whereas the deletion of HpHOC1 (Hphoc1Δ) did not generate any detectable changes in N-glycosylation, the null mutant strains of HpOCH1 (Hpoch1Δ) and HpOCR1 (Hpocr1Δ) displayed a remarkable reduction in hypermannosylation. Although the apparent phenotypes of Hpocr1Δ were most similar to those of S. cerevisiae och1 mutants, the detailed structural analysis of N-glycans revealed that the major defect of Hpocr1Δ is not in the initiation step but rather in the subsequent step of outer chain elongation by α-1,2-mannose addition. Most interestingly, Hpocr1Δ showed a severe defect in the O-linked glycosylation of extracellular chitinase, representing HpOCR1 as a novel member of the OCH1 family implicated in both N- and O-linked glycosylation. In contrast, addition of the first α-1,6-mannose residue onto the core oligosaccharide Man8GlcNAc2 was completely blocked in Hpoch1Δ despite the comparable growth of its wild type under normal growth conditions. The complementation of the S. cerevisiae och1 null mutation by the expression of HpOCH1 and the lack of in vitro α-1,6-mannosyltransferase activity in Hpoch1Δ provided supportive evidence that HpOCH1 is the functional orthologue of ScOCH1. The engineered Hpoch1Δ strain with the targeted expression of Aspergillus saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase in the endoplasmic reticulum was shown to produce human-compatible high mannose-type Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide as a major N-glycan.

Glycosylation is one of the most ubiquitous forms of post-translational modification, and the early stages of N-linked glycosylation are highly conserved among eukaryotes. The formation of N-linked oligosaccharides assembled on glycoproteins begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ORF, open reading frame; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; M-Pol, mannan polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; PA, 2-aminopyridine; GOD, glucose oxidase; rGOD, recombinant glucose oxidase.2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ORF, open reading frame; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; M-Pol, mannan polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; PA, 2-aminopyridine; GOD, glucose oxidase; rGOD, recombinant glucose oxidase. where an identical Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide is transferred to the Asn residues on nascent proteins by oligosaccharyl-transferase complex (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). Subsequent trimming by glucosidases I and II and a specific ER-residing α-1,2-mannosidase led to the formation of a core oligosaccharide (Man8GlcNAc2). Glycoproteins containing Man8GlcNAc2 are then collected into transport vesicles and delivered to the Golgi apparatus. It is in the Golgi that the diversity of N-glycan structures is generated by a series of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases acting in a manner that varies enormously between species, and even between individual proteins within a species (2Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In the traditional yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the N-linked glycosylation has been most studied, the maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi often leads to hypermannosylated glycoproteins possessing a large structure called the outer chain. This outer chain biosynthesis is initiated by the addition of the first α-1,6-mannose onto the Man8GlcNAc2 core structure in the early Golgi, a process mediated by the OCH1 gene product in S. cerevisiae (3Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the action of the S. cerevisiae OCH1 gene product (ScOch1p), the extension of an α-1,6-linked polymannose backbone occurs by the sequential action of two enzyme complexes, mannan polymerase (M-Pol) I and II (2Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The linear backbone of the outer chain is often extended with 50 or more α-1,6-linked mannoses, highly branched by the addition of α-1,2-linked mannoses and terminally capped by α-1,3-linked mannoses (4Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The mannosyltransferase activity and the substrate specificity of the S. cerevisiae Och1p are well characterized and shown to require the intact structure of Man8GlcNAc2 for efficient mannose outer chain initiation (5Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6Nakayama K. Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Tanaka A. Haga-Toda Y. Jigami Y.

The functional homologues of the S. cerevisiae OCH1 gene in other yeast species, including Schizosaccharomyces pombe (7Yoko-o T. Tsukahara K. Watanabe T. Haga-Sugi N. Yoshimatsu K. Nagasu T. Jigami Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Pichia pastoris (8Murakami, K., and Sugio, N., (January 7, 1997) Japan Patent JP 1997000261-A1Google Scholar), have been reported and shown to be involved in the initiation of α-1,6-linked mannose outer chain biosynthesis.The S. cerevisiae HOC1 gene (Homologous to OCH1), isolated as a high copy suppressor of a protein kinase C mutant, encodes a putative α-1,6-mannosyltransferase that strongly resembles ScOch1p. However, no obvious defects in N-linked or O-linked glycosylation were detected in the null mutation of HOC1, and the overexpression of HOC1 cannot suppress an och1 mutation (9Neiman A.M. Mhaiskar V.

The S. cerevisiae HOC1 gene product (ScHoc1p) was found to reside in the M-Pol II complex, but whether ScHoc1p directly contributes to the α-1,6-mannosyltransferase activity is not yet proven (2Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At present, the function of ScHoc1p is unclear, although the S. cerevisiae hoc1 mutants show phenotypes associated with glycosylation defects, including sensitivity to Calcofluor White and hygromycin B. ScHoc1p might be a protein-specific mannosyltransferase or have a function overlapping with another glycosyltransferase or function only under certain conditions.The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast, Hansenula polymorpha, has emerged as a promising host for the high level expression of heterologous genes, because of its well established expression toolboxes along with the feasibility of its high cell density culture in methanol-containing media (10Gellissen G. Veenhuis M. Yeast. 2001; 18: i-iiiCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Kang H.A. Gellissen G. Gellissen G. Production of Recombinant Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2005: 111-142Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, the less extensive hyperglycosylation of glycoproteins from H. polymorpha than from S. cerevisiae has been suggested to be another factor that favors the production of mammalian cell-originated proteins in this yeast (12Rodriguez L. Narciandi R.E. Roca H. Cremata J. Montesinos R. Rodriguez E. Grillo J.M. Muzio V. Herrera L.S. Delgado J.M. Yeast. 1996; 12: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Kang H.A. Sohn J.H. Choi E.S. Chung B.H. Yu M.H. Rhee S.K. Yeast. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our recent study on the structural characterization of the oligosaccharides assembled on glycoproteins secreted by H. polymorpha showed that most N-linked glycans synthesized in H. polymorpha have core-type structures (Man8–12GlcNAc2) and that they are mainly branched by α-1,2-linkages without hyper-immunogenic terminal α-1,3-linked mannose residues. More interestingly, the outer chains of H. polymorpha N-glycans were shown to have very short α-1,6-extensions, mainly composed of single α-1,6-linked mannose (14Kim M.W. Rhee S.K. Kim J.Y. Shimma Y. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Kang H.A. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To identify H. polymorpha genes coding for glycosyltransferases involved in the first step of α-1,6-linked mannose addition in N-linked outer chain biosynthesis, we isolated and characterized three H. polymorpha genes, HpHOC1, HpOCH1, and HpOCR1 (OCH1-related), that share significant homology with S. cerevisiae HOC1 and OCH1 genes. Here we report that HpOCH1 codes for the key enzyme responsible for initiating N-linked outer chain biosynthesis by adding the first α-1,6-mannose residue onto the core oligosaccharide, whereas the functions of HpHOC1 and HpOCR1 are closely associated with the subsequent elongation step by α-1,2-mannose addition. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of HpOCH1 deletion as a first step toward the N-glycan engineering of H. polymorpha to produce human-compatible N-linked oligosaccharides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Media—H. polymorpha DL1-L (leu2) and DL-LdU (leu2 ura3Δ::lacZ) strains were derivatives of DL-1 (ATCC26012) (15Kang H.A. Sohn J.H. Agaphonov M.O. Choi E.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Rhee S.K. Gellissen G. Hansenula polymorpha-Biology and Applications. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 124-146Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae och1Δ (MATa leu2 ura3 trp1 ade2 his3 och1Δ::TRP1) and S. cerevisiae TOY137 (MATa leu2 ura3 trp1 ade2 his3 och1Δ::hisG mnn1Δ::hisG mnn4Δ::hisG) were derived from S. cerevisiae W303-1A. 3Y. Shimma, unpublished results. The vector pDLMOX-GOD(H) (14Kim M.W. Rhee S.K. Kim J.Y. Shimma Y. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Kang H.A. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used for the secretory expressions of Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase tagged with 6 residues of histidine (GOD-His) in H. polymorpha. pMOX-YPS1ct-His vector was constructed for the secretion of C-terminally truncated H. polymorpha Yps1p tagged with histidine residues. 4E. J. Kim and H. A. Kang, unpublished results. The plasmid YEp352GAPII, containing the S. cerevisiae GAPDH promoter and terminator, 5K. Nakayama and Y. Jigami, unpublished results. was used as a backbone vector for H. polymorpha gene expression in S. cerevisiae. To construct the HA-HDEL-tagged Aspergillus saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase, the HA-HDEL tag sequence was introduced by PCR using the sense oligonucleotide primer, Msd-N (containing an EcoRI restriction site), and the antisense oligonucleotide primer, Msd-C (containing the coding sequences of the HA tag and the HDEL signal, followed by a stop codon and an NcoI restriction site), using pGAMH1 as a template (16Chiba Y. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Yoshida A. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. Jigami Y. Ichishima E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26298-26304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NcoI and used to substitute the 1.8-kb EcoRI/NcoI GOD-His fragment in pDLMOX-GOD(H) to generate the plasmid pDLMOX-MsdS(HA-HDEL). The auxotrophic marker HpLEU2 in pDLMOX-MsdS(HA-HDEL) was exchanged with HpURA3 to generate pDUMOX-MsdS(HA-HDEL). Drug sensitivity was assayed by spotting serially diluted yeast culture onto YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) solid media containing 40 μg/ml hygromycin B, 7 mg/ml Calcofluor White, or 0.4% sodium deoxycholate. Secretory expression and immunoblot analysis of A. niger GOD-His in H. polymorpha were performed as described previously (14Kim M.W. Rhee S.K. Kim J.Y. Shimma Y. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Kang H.A. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For deglycosylation, glycoproteins were digested with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) according to the supplier's instructions (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA).Cloning of the H. polymorpha OCH1 Family Genes—Two pairs of primers, R1for/R1rev and R2for/R2rev, were designed using information on two random sequenced tags of H. polymorpha (GenBank™ accession numbers AL435940 and AL433499), which shares significant homology with S. cerevisiae HOC1 and OCH1 genes. Two PCR products of 1.0 kb were amplified from H. polymorpha DL1-L chromosomal DNA using the primers R1for/R1rev and R2for/R2rev and used as probes for Southern blot analysis. Strong hybridization signals at the 7.5-kb HindIII and 5.0-kb BglII fragments of H. polymorpha DL1-L genomic DNA were detected using these probes, respectively. HindIII fragments of 6.7–7.7-kb and BglII fragments of 4.5–6.0-kb of H. polymorpha DL1-L genomic DNA were gel-eluted and ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively. To screen H. polymorpha HindIII and BglII genomic DNA libraries, colony PCR was carried out using the same primers used for synthesizing the two probes mentioned above. Plasmids from each positive clone, designated pH305 and pB52, were partially sequenced. Plasmid pH305 contained a 7.5-kb HindIII insert with a full-length open reading frame (ORF) highly similar to that of the S. cerevisiae HOC1 gene product, and thus the ORF was designated as H. polymorpha HOC1 (HpHOC1). However, plasmid pB52 containing a 5.0-kb BglII insert was found to contain only the 3′ portion of a putative ORF, which showed relatively low sequence similarity with the S. cerevisiae HOC1 and OCH1 gene products. To clone the full length of the ORF, the 3′ region of ORF obtained from pB52 was amplified using the primers R3for and R3rev from H. polymorpha DL1-L genomic DNA, and this was then used as a probe in Southern blot analysis. A strong hybridization signal was detected at an ∼2.3-kb BamHI fragment, and the BamHI fragments of 1.8–3.0 kb of H. polymorpha DL1-L genomic DNA were gel-eluted and subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript. After screening the partial H. polymorpha genomic DNA library by colony PCR, positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Plasmid pBA302 from a positive clone was found to contain a 2.3-kb BamHI insert carrying the 5′-upstream region and a portion of an ORF, which partially overlapped with the ORF from pB52. The full length of an intact ORF, showing relatively low sequence identity (22%) with S. cerevisiae OCH1, was generated by combining two ORFs from pBA302 and pB52 and was designated as H. polymorpha OCH1-related gene 1 (HpOCR1). The nucleotide sequences of HpHOC1 and HpOCR1 have been submitted to GenBank™ under accession numbers AF540063 and AF490971, respectively. H. polymorpha OCH1 (HpOCH1) was isolated by PCR from H. polymorpha DL1-L genomic DNA using two primers, 168Not-N and 168Not-C, that were designed based on information obtained from the whole genome sequence of H. polymorpha (17Ramezani-Rad M. Hollenberg C.P. Lauber J. Wedler H. Griess E. Wanger C. Albermann K. Hani J. Piontek M. Dahlems U. Gellissen G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the resulting PCR product was determined and submitted to GenBank™ under accession number AY502025. The other members of H. polymorpha OCH1 family, named HpOCR2, HpOCR3, HpOCR4, and HpOCR5, were also isolated by PCR from H. polymorpha DL1-L genomic DNA using the primer sets, ORF288F/ORF288R, ORF580F/ORF580R, ORF100F/ORF100R, and ORF576F/ORF576R, respectively, which were designed based on information obtained from the whole genome sequence of H. polymorpha. The nucleotide sequences of the resulting PCR product were submitted to GenBank™ under accession numbers DQ249343, DQ249344, DQ249345, and DQ249346, respectively. The sequences of the primers used for the gene cloning are available on request.Deletion of the H. polymorpha HOC1, OCR1, and OCH1 Genes—Deletional disruptions of the HpHOC1, HpOCR1, and HpOCH1 genes were carried out using fusion PCR and in vivo recombination as described previously (18Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Storici F. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, in the fusion PCR stage, two DNA fragments containing the promoter (H1N) and terminator (H1C) regions of HpHOC1, respectively, were amplified by using two pairs of primers, HNfor/HNrev and HCfor/HCrev. The PCR primers HNrev and HCfor were 20-bp oligonucleotides and corresponded to the upstream and downstream sequences of the directed repeat region of the HpURA3 pop-out cassette in plasmid pLacUR3. 6J. H. Bae, unpublished observations. The N- and C-terminal fragments (UR3N and UR3C) of the HpURA3 pop-out cassette containing the overlapped internal sequence of HpURA3 (100 bp) were amplified from pLacUR3 by PCR using two pairs of primers UNfor/UNrev and UCfor/UCrev. Subsequently, the UR3N and UR3C fragments were fused with the H1N and H1C fragments by PCR using two pairs of primers (HNfor/UNrev and UCfor/HCrev) to generate the fusion products HN-UR3N and HC-UR3C, respectively. In the in vivo recombination stage, these two PCR fusion products were introduced into H. polymorpha DL-LdU (leu2 ura3Δ::lacZ) and converted into one linear gene disruption cassette via in vivo homologous recombination at the overlapping sequence. Ura+ colonies were selected and screened for the Hphoc1Δ::HpURA3 strain, which was generated by the double homologous crossover of the disruption cassette at the HpHOC1 gene locus. Gene disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization analysis (data not shown). Disruptions of the genomic copies of HpOCR1 and HpOCH1 were performed using the same procedure. To construct double deletion Hphoc1ΔHpocr1Δ or Hphoc1ΔHpoch1Δ mutant strains, the HpURA3 pop-out cassette was removed from the Hphoc1Δ::HpURA3 strain to recover the Ura– auxotrophic marker by cultivation on YPD plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (0.5 mg/ml), generating the DL-LdUdH1 (leu2 ura3Δ::lacZ hoc1Δ::lacZ) strain. Subsequent gene disruptions of HpOCR1 and HpOCH1 were performed in the DL-LdUdH1 strain using the same procedure described above. The sequences of the primers used in this study are available on request.HPLC Analysis of N-Linked Oligosaccharides—N-Linked oligosaccharides were released from 200 μg of purified rGOD or HpYps1p by PNGase F treatment, and the oligosaccharides obtained were labeled with 2-aminopyridine (PA) using the commercially available reagent kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan). After pyridylamination, the samples were purified using Sephadex G-15 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences) to remove residual PA. Size fractionation HPLC was performed using a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 column (Showa Denko K. K., Tokyo, Japan, 0.46 × 25 cm) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (6Nakayama K. Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Tanaka A. Haga-Toda Y. Jigami Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After sample injection, the proportion of solvent B was increased linearly up to 45% over 42 min. PA-oligosaccharides were detected by fluorescence (λex = 320 nm and λem = 400 nm) using a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector. PA-oligosaccharides were digested sequentially with α-1,2-mannosidase (from A. saitoi, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo) and α-1,6-mannosidase (from Xanthomonas manihotis, New England Biolab, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of Membrane Proteins and α-1,6-Mannosyltransferase Activity Assay—Yeast membrane fractions were obtained as described previously (5Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultivated in YPD medium and harvested at mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 3–4). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, washed with 1% KCl, and resuspended in 5 ml of PMS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg/ml each protease inhibitor (antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A)). Glass beads (425–600 μm) were added to half of the cell suspension volume and homogenized four times for 1 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant obtained was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. High speed pellets were collected and resuspended in PMS buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay agent (Bio-Rad). α-1,6-Mannosyltransferase activity was assayed as described by Nakajima and Ballou (20Nakajima T. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7679-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μg of high speed pellet proteins was incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm GDP-mannose, 0.5 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and 100 pmol of Man8GlcNAc2-PA acceptor at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by boiling at 99 °C for 5 min, and the reaction mixture was filtered through an Ultrafree-MC membrane (10,000 cutoff; Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the filtrate was submitted for HPLC.O-Glycosylation Analysis of Chitinase—Native chitinases from supernatants of saturated cultures were isolated, and their degrees of O-glycosylation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (21Agaphonov M. Sokolov S.S. Romanova N.V. Sohn J.-H. Kim S.-Y. Kalebina T.S. Choi E.-S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 2005; 22: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thirty ml of culture supernatants of H. polymorpha cells grown in YPD for 24 h were collected and transferred into centrifuge tubes. After adding 40 mg of chitin, the tubes were rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 4 h. The chitin was then pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)). Chitinase was eluted from the chitin in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and then separated in 6% SDS-PAGE, which was visualized by silver staining.α-1,2-Mannosidase Assay—For in vitro A. saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase activity assay, yeast cell extracts were prepared and analyzed as described by Chiba et al. (16Chiba Y. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. Yoshida A. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. Jigami Y. Ichishima E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26298-26304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Soluble cell extracts were incubated with 30 pmol of Man6GlcNAc2-PA at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using a TSK-GEL ODS-80Ts column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan, 0.46 × 25 cm3) equilibrated with a mixture of solvents A (100 mm acetic acid/triethylamine (pH 4.0)) and B (solvent A + 0.5% 1-butanol) (98:2, v/v). The ratio of solvent B was increased linearly up to 20% over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.RESULTSIsolation of HpHOC1, HpOCR1, and HpOCH1 in H. polymorpha—In an effort to identify the gene(s) coding for α-1,6-mannosyltransferase contributing to the initiation of outer chain elongation on Man8GlcNAc2 in H. polymorpha, we had initially isolated two H. polymorpha genes, designated HpHOC1 and HpOCR1 (OCH1-related gene 1), using sequence information from random sequenced tags of H. polymorpha (22Blandin G. Llorente B. Malpertuy A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Dujon B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that the HpHOC1 gene product (HpHoc1p) showed 40 and 24% overall identities with the S. cerevisiae HOC1 and OCH1 gene products, respectively. On the other hand, the HpOCR1 gene product (HpOcr1p) showed relatively low sequence identity with both the ScHOC1 and ScOCH1 gene products (21 and 22% identity, respectively). A hydropathy analysis performed using PSORT II (www.psort.org/; see Ref. 23Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar) predicted that HpHoc1p and HpOcr1p possess a single potential transmembrane-spanning region, which acts as a signal-anchor domain (24Wickner W.T. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 230: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) near the N terminus of the proteins, suggesting that they are type II membrane proteins. In addition, they possess a DXD motif well conserved in many glycosyltransferase families (25Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). An alignment of amino acid sequences of HpHoc1p and HpOcr1p with Och1p homologues from other yeast species reveals that several conserved regions are shared by Och1p homologues, although N-terminal portion is largely unique to each protein (Fig. 1). Most interestingly, HpOcr1p has a long C-terminal region that is absent in other Och1p homologues.While we were analyzing the functions of HpHOC1 and HpOCR1, the entire genome of H. polymorpha was completely sequenced (17Ramezani-Rad M. Hollenberg C.P. Lauber J. Wedler H. Griess E. Wanger C. Albermann K. Hani J. Piontek M. Dahlems U. Gellissen G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus we searched this H. polymorpha whole genome data base to identify other possible H. polymorpha ORFs showing significant similarity to the S. cerevisiae OCH1 and HOC1 genes. In addition to the ORFs identified as HpHOC1 and HpOCR1, at least five other ORFs were found to encode putative mannosyltransferases with significant sequence identities to ScOch1p, ranging from 15 to 37% (Table 1). These additional ORFs were also predicted to have a potential transmembrane domain at the N-terminal region and a conserved region encompassing a DXD motif. Of these, an ORF with the highest homology to ScOCH1 was designated HpOCH1, and its functions in cell growth and N-linked glycosylation were investigated.TABLE 1Sequence identities and similarities between the Och1p homologs in S. cerevisiae and H. polymorphaTABLE 1Sequence identities and similarities between the Och1p homologs in S. cerevisiae and H. polymorphaEffect of HpHOC1, HpOCR1, and HpOCH1 Deletion on Cell Growth and N-Glycosylation—To investigate the effect of HpHOC1, HpOCR1, or HpOCH1 gene deletion on cell growth and N-linked glycosylation, the single deletion (Hphoc1Δ, Hpocr1Δ, or Hpoch1Δ) or the double deletion (Hphoc1ΔHpocr1Δ or Hphoc1ΔHpoch1Δ) mutant strains were constructed and analyzed. Disruptions of either of these genes in H. polymorpha resulted in hypersensitivity to hygromycin B or sodium deoxycholate (Fig. 2, D and E), which are characteristic phenotypes of cell wall and N-linked glycosylation defects (26Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 15: 3209-3212Google Scholar). In particular, the Hpocr1 null mutant strain showed slow-growing and temperature-sensitive phenotypes (Fig. 2, A and B), as was reported previously in Scoch1 mutant strain. In addition, the growth of Hpocr1Δ was completely inhibited by Calcofluor White, which binds to chitin and disrupts cell wall assembly (27Ram A.F. Wolters A. Ten Hoopen R. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2F). The growth defect and temperature sensitivity of the Hpocr1Δ strain were partially recovered by supplementing an osmotic stabilizer, 1 m sorbitol (Fig. 2C). Although Hphoc1Δ cells displayed no obvious growth defects besi"
https://openalex.org/W2146724496,"Pax6 is a transcriptional activator that contains two DNA binding domains and a potent transcription activation domain in the C terminus, which regulates organogenesis of the eye, nose, pancreas, and central nervous system. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) interacts with transcription factors, including homeoproteins, and regulates activities of transcription factors. Here we show that HIPK2 phosphorylates the activation domain of Pax6, which augments Pax6 transactivation by enhancing its interaction with p300. Mass spectrometric analysis identified three Pax6 phosphorylation sites as threonines 281, 304, and 373. The substitutions of these threonines with alanines decreased Pax6 transactivation, whereas substitutions to glutamic acids increased transactivation in mimicry of phosphorylation. Furthermore, the knock-down of either endogenous or exogenous HIPK2 expression with HIPK2 shRNA markedly inhibited Pax6 phosphorylation and its transactivating function on proglucagon promoter in cultured cells. These results strongly indicate that HIPK2 is an upstream protein kinase for Pax6 and suggest that it modulates Pax6-mediated transcriptional regulation.

Pax proteins are key regulators of vertebrate organogenesis and are involved in embryonic pattern formation (1Chi N. Epstein J.A. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Pax6 is a member of the Pax gene family and is expressed in eye, nose, pancreas, and central nervous system from the early stages of embryonic development (2Walther C. Gruss P. Development. 1991; 113: 1435-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Pax6 plays an important role in eye morphogenesis in animals. The human Pax6 gene was initially identified by the positional cloning of the 11p13 aniridia locus (3Ton C.C. Hirvonen H. Miwa H. Weil M.M. Monaghan P. Jordan T. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D.

Evolutionary conservation of Pax6 function is evidenced by the fact that mutations in the Pax6 homologue cause ocular phenotypes in Drosophila, mice, and humans (4Wawersik S. Maas R.L. Hum. Mol.

Development. 1999; 126: 4213-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its role in eye morphogenesis, Pax6 has important functions in the development of the brain, spinal cord, and pancreas. Much of the information about the roles of Pax6 in development comes from the analysis of mutant mice. Homozygous Pax6Sey and Pax6Sey-Neu mutants lack eyes and a nose and die at birth with severe abnormalities of the central nervous system, and the numbers of all four types of endocrine cells in the pancreas are decreased, and islet morphology is abnormal (8Hogan B.L. Horsburgh G. Cohen J. Hetherington C.M. Fisher G. Lyon M.F. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 97: 95-110PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schmahl W. Knoedlseder M. Favor J. Davidson D. Acta Neuropathol. 1993; 86: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, mice with heterozygous mutations in Pax6 have lower levels of pancreatic hormones (10Sander M. Sussel L. Conners J. Scheel D. Kalamaras J. Dela Cruz F. Schwitzgebel V. Hayes-Jordan A. German M. Development. 2000; 127: 5533-5540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the conditional inactivation of Pax6 in the pancreas causes early onset diabetes (11Ashery-Padan R. Zhou X. Marquardt T.

Consistently, consensus Pax6-binding sites have been described in the promoter regions of proglucagon, somatostatin, and insulin genes, and Pax6 has been shown to activate their gene expression (10Sander M.

The Pax6 protein is composed of several distinct domains, an amino-terminal paired domain, a glycine-rich hinge region, a homeodomain, and a carboxyl-terminal proline/serine/threonine (PST)-rich transactivation domain (1Chi N. Epstein J.A. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Both the paired domain and homeodomain have independent DNA binding activities, but they have also been shown to act cooperatively to mediate transcription (1Chi N. Epstein J.A.

It has been repeatedly reported that various nonsense or missense mutations of Pax6 are associated with aniridia, keratitis, and familial foveal dysplasia. In many cases, Pax6 mutations are found in either the paired domain or the homeodomain, pointing to the importance of their cooperative action of two DNA binding domains (20Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edeards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 21Hanson I. Churchill A. Love J. Axton R. Moore T. Clarke M. Meire F. van Heyningen V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C-terminal half of Pax6 in patients with aniridia (22Prosser J. van Heyningen V. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Such truncations result in mutant proteins that retain the DNA binding domains but have lost all or part of the transactivation domain. In addition, the position of the premature stop codon found in the Pax6Sey-Neu mutant mouse strain is located within the activation domain (23Favor J. Peters H. Hermann T. Schmahl W. Chatterjee B. Neuhauser-Klaus A. Sandulache R. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the DNA binding activity and the transactivation activity of Pax6 appear to be critical for the proper functioning of Pax6 during development. Several signaling pathways are known to be involved in the Pax6-mediated developmental program. In the spinal cord and hind brain, Pax6 establishes distinct ventral progenitor cell populations and controls the identity of motor neurons and ventral interneurons by mediating graded Shh signaling (25Ericson J. Rashbass P. Schedl A. Brenner-Morton S. Kawakami A. van Heyningen V. Jessell T.M. Briscoe J. Cell. 1997; 90: 169-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 26Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The expressions of two Drosophila orthologs of Pax6, eyeless and twin of eyeless, are induced by Notch signaling. In Xenopus embryos, the activation of Notch signaling causes eye duplication and proximal eye defects, but the molecular mechanism of its control remains largely unknown (6Onuma Y. Takahashi S. Asashima M. Kurata S. Gehring W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2020-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, Pax6 is essential for the insulin responsiveness of proglucagon promoter (27Grzeskowiak R. Amin J. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30037-30045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Insulin inhibits proglucagon gene transcription through the conserved regulatory elements onto which Pax6 binds, and the inhibition of glucagon synthesis and the secretion of insulin are important for the coordinated synthesis and secretion of biologically antagonistic islet hormones. However, the regulations of Pax6 at the molecular level for each signaling pathway remain to be understood.

HIPK2 also interacts with Groucho corepressor and p300/CREB-binding protein coactivator and regulates the transcription of various genes in a context-dependent manner (30Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kim Y.O.

Previously, we expressed constitutive active DHIPK2(KD) and dominant negative kinase-dead DHIPK2(KR) in the developing eye of Drosophila and observed occasional ectopic eyes and small eyes, respectively. Also, DHIPK2 interacted with and phosphorylated Eyeless in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the transcriptional activities of Eyeless increased upon co-expression of DHIPK2 in transient transcription assays (30Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kim Y.O. Park S.J. Kim E.A. Riemenschneider W.

In an attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying the phosphorylation-dependent transactivation of Pax6, we examined the trans-activating properties of Pax6 induced by HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation. We report here that Pax6 transactivation can be augmented by HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation of Pax6. Using both LC-MALDI-MS/MS and LC-electrospray ionization-MS/MS analysis, we identified three phosphorylation sites of Pax6 as Thr-281, Thr-304, and Thr-373. Mutation analysis of these phosphorylation sites further demonstrated that multiple phosphorylations cooperatively contribute to the recruitment of p300 and consequently enhance Pax6 transactivation. However, the knock-down of either endogenous or exogenous HIPK2 expression via HIPK2 shRNA reduced Pax6 phosphorylations and transactivation. This finding suggests that HIPK2 is an upstream kinase for Pax6. Cell Culture and Transfection—U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma cell line) and STC-1 cells (mouse intestinal endocrine cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640, respectively, and the both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For immunoblot analysis, U2OS cells were seeded onto 6-well plates, and DNA transfection was carried out using Fugene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). For reverse transcription-PCR analysis, STC-1 cells were transfected with Pax6 and HIPK2 expression plasmids using magnetofection kits (OZ Biosciences). Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Various HIPK2 constructs, p300 expression plasmid, and its deletion mutants have been described previously (29Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J.

GAL4-Pax6, GST-Pax6, and Myc-Pax6 expression plasmids were generated using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). Point mutants of Pax6 phosphorylation sites were generated using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutagenesis was conducted on pEntr-derived Pax6 plasmid, and Myc-tagged and GST fusion Pax6 expression plasmids were generated using Gateway Technology. HIPK2 shRNA plasmid was constructed by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides, which contain the HIPK2 sequence (5′-GAAAGTACATTTTCAACTG-3′), into the BglII and HindIII sites of pSUPER (OligoEngine) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The reporter plasmid containing the proglucagon promoter upstream of the luciferase gene was constructed by inserting DNA fragments for proglucagon promoter (from -350 to +63) into the NheI and XhoI sites of pGL3-basic (Promega). The proglucagon promoter was PCR-amplified from rat genomic DNA with specific primers as follows: Glu-350 (forward), 5′-GATGCTAGCAATACCAAATCAAGGGATAAG-3′; Glu-63 (reverse), 5′-GATCTCGAGATCTAGACAGAGGGAGTCCCC-3′. pEntr-p300 and pEntr-p300ΔHAT (deletion from aa 1472 to 1522, corresponding to the HAT domain) mutant were constructed by insertion of PCR-amplified full-length and combined DNA fragments (SalI-HindIII and HindIII-NotI fragments) into the SalI and NotI sites of pEntr4, respectively. Myc-p300 and Myc-p300ΔHAT expression plasmids were generated using Gateway Technology. The primers (restriction enzyme sites are underlined) for the PCR amplifications were as follows: p300-ATG (forward), 5′-GATGTCGACCATGGCCGAGAATGTGGTGGAA-3′; p300-term (backward), 5′-GATGCGGCCGCCTAGTGTATGTCTAGTGTACT-3′; p300-aa1471 (backward), 5′-GATAAGCTTTTTTTTGTACCATTCCTGCAG-3′; p300-aa1523 (forward), 5′-GATAAGCTTGAGGAAGAAGAGAGAAAACGA-3′. Luciferase Reporter Assay—For luciferase reporter assays, U2OS cells seeded onto 6-well plates were transfected with G5-TK-Luc reporter plasmid, which harbored the luciferase gene under the control of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter and five copies of GAL4 binding sites, and with combinations of GAL4-Pax6 and HIPK2 or HIPK2 K221R mutant expression plasmids, together with pCMV-β-gal, which was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. For the proglucagon promoter-luciferase reporter assay, cells were transfected with Pax6, HIPK2, and p300 expression plasmids as indicated in Figs. 2 and 5. Total plasmid amounts were adjusted using empty vectors. Thirty-six hours after transfection, luciferase activity was measured from duplicate plates using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Genios luminometer (TECAN). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test in which calculations were performed by using the INSTAT program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).FIGURE 5Mutation analysis of Pax6 phosphorylation sites.

This mixture was placed onto a rocking platform for 2 h and washed five times with buffers containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were then eluted, separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as previously described (29Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kwon H.J. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33194-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the plasmids (3 μg of reporter plasmids and 6 μg of expression plasmids) and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min before harvesting. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Myc antibodies. Total DNA (50 μl) recovered from the immunoprecipitates was subjected to quantitative PCR (22 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 45 s at 72 °C) using specific primers (5′-GATGCTAGCAATACCAAATCAAGGGATAAG-3′ and 5′-GATCTCGAGATCTAGACAGAGGGAGTCCCC-3′) for proglucagon promoter. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Equal amounts (0.5 μg) of GST-Pax6 fusion protein or mutant proteins were mixed with purified GST-HIPK2(KD)-(1-629) and 0.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 m NaCl) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylated Pax6 proteins were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. In order to detect phosphorylated Pax6 with phospho-specific antibody (Cell Signaling), kinase reactions were performed using 0.1 mm cold ATP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (28Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S-J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with wild-type Pax6 or point mutants were incubated with 32P-labeled DNA probe in binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate buffer. Reverse Transcription-PCR—First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). One-twentieth of the reaction product was used for PCR amplification (DNA denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, primer extension at 72 °C for 40 s). The following proglucagon-specific primers were used for PCR amplification: Glu nt65, 5′-CCCTTCAAGACACAGAGGAGAA-3′; Glu nt392, 5′-TCTCGCCTTCCTCGGCCTTTCA-3′. Immunocytochemistry—U2OS cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 0.2 μg of EGFP-C2 plasmids and 3 μg of the HIPK2 shRNA expression plasmid. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min at -20 °C and incubated with a solution containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were rinsed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-HIPK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody for 1 h. After washing five times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with rhodamine red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiopgoto 2 microscope, using excitation wavelengths of 543 nm (rhodamine red) and 488 nm (GFP). The acquired images were processed with Adobe Photoshop. Determination of Phosphorylation Sites by Tandem MS (MS/MS)—Electrophoretically separated phosphorylated GST-PAX6 protein was excised and stain-stripped in 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Proteolytic peptides were recovered from the gel by in-gel digestion using 12 ng/μl sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Protein digests were separated using an Agilent 1100 Series Capillary LC system (Agilent Technologies) running at a flow rate of 1.2 μl/min on a microcapillary analytical column (150-μm inner diameter × 150 mm). The column was prepared by packing fused silica capillary with 200-Å Magic C18AQ resin (Michrom BioResources Inc.). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient from solution A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% acetonitrile, 95% water) to solution B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 40% acetonitrile, and 60% water) over 60 min. Eluent was delivered to an on-line AccuSpot micro-fractionation system (Shimadzu Corp.), mixed coaxially with a solution of MALDI matrix (7 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), and deposited as discrete spots on 576-well MALDI target plates. Each spot represented a 10-s fraction of a 1-h reversed phase gradient. MALDI-MS/MS analyses were performed using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), a tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire positive ion MS survey scans over the mass range of 700-3500 Da. Once the MS survey scans had been completed, data were processed to generate a list of precursor ions for interrogation by tandem MS. MS/MS was performed with air as the collision gas at a pressure of 10-6 torr. The resultant data were first quality-filtered such that spectra lacking neutral loss of 98 Da were removed prior to manual inspection. Phosphorylation of Pax6 by HIPK2—We have previously demonstrated that DHIPK2 interacted with and phosphorylated Eyeless, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian Pax6, and augmented the transactivation of Eyeless, according to the results of transient transcription assays (30Choi C.Y. Kim Y.H. Kim Y.O. Park S.J. Kim E.A. Riemenschneider W. Gajewski K. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21427-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In order to gain further insight into HIPK2-mediated Pax6 regulation in the mammalian system, we first examined the interaction between HIPK2 and Pax6 in vivo and in vitro. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type GFP-HIPK2 or deletion mutants (Fig. 1C) along with plasmid encoding Myc-Pax6. Immunoprecipitation of the lysates of transfected cells revealed that both the N- and C-terminal HIPK2 as well as full-length HIPK2 were associated with Pax6 in cultured cells (Fig. 1A). Pax6 was shown to strongly interact with the kinase-dead N-terminal domain (KDKR), but not with catalytically active N-terminal domain (KD), suggesting that Pax6 is a phosphorylation target of HIPK2. Direct physical interactions between HIPK2 and Pax6 were confirmed by GST pull-down analysis with GST-Pax6 in vitro (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of Pax6 by HIPK2 was also assessed in cultured cells, in which Pax6 and various HIPK2 deletion mutants were co-expressed (Fig. 1C). The migrations of Pax6 in Western blot were delayed by the co-expression of wild-type or the kinase domain of HIPK2 (lanes 2 and 4) but not by the co-expression of C-terminal or kinase-dead HIPK2 (lanes 3, 5, and 6). These results suggest that Pax6 is a phosphorylation target of HIPK2 in cultured cells. In order to delineate the site(s) at which Pax6 is phosphorylated by HIPK2, the affinity-purified GST-Pax6 deletion mutants were assessed with regard to whether it could be phosphorylated by HIPK2 in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1966313809,"There is considerable evidence for the role of carboxyl-terminal serines 355, 356, and 364 in G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs). In this study we used receptors in which these serines were changed to alanines (SA3) or to aspartic acids (SD3) to determine the role of these sites in β-arrestin-dependent β2AR internalization and desensitization. Coupling efficiencies for epinephrine activation of adenylyl cyclase were similar in wild-type and mutant receptors, demonstrating that the SD3 mutant did not drive constitutive GRK desensitization. Treatment of wild-type and mutant receptors with 0.3 nm isoproterenol for 5 min induced ∼2-fold increases in the EC50 for agonist activation of adenylyl cyclase, consistent with protein kinase A (PKA) site-mediated desensitization. When exposed to 1 μm isoproterenol to trigger GRK site-mediated desensitization, only wild-type receptors showed significant further desensitization. Using a phospho site-specific antibody, we determined that there is no requirement for these GRK sites in PKA-mediated phosphorylation at high agonist concentration. The rates of agonist-induced internalization of the SD3 and SA3 mutants were 44 and 13%, respectively, relative to that of wild-type receptors, but the SD3 mutant recruited enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane, whereas the SA3 mutant did not. EGFP-β-Arrestin2 overexpression triggered a significant increase in the extent of SD3 mutant desensitization but had no effect on the desensitization of wild-type receptors or the SA3 mutant. Expression of a phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin 1 mutant (R169E) significantly rescued the internalization defect of the SA3 mutant but inhibited the phosphorylation of serines 355 and 356 in wild-type receptors. Our data demonstrate that (i) the lack of GRK sites does not impair PKA site phosphorylation, (ii) the SD3 mutation inhibits GRK-mediated desensitization although it supports some agonist-induced β-arrestin binding and receptor internalization, and (iii) serines 355, 356, and 364 play a pivotal role in the GRK-mediated desensitization, β-arrestin binding, and internalization of β2ARs.

The rates of agonist-induced internalization of the SD3 and SA3 mutants were 44 and 13%, respectively, relative to that of wild-type receptors, but the SD3 mutant recruited enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane, whereas the SA3 mutant did not. EGFP-β-Arrestin2 overexpression triggered a significant increase in the extent of SD3 mutant desensitization but had no effect on the desensitization of wild-type receptors or the SA3 mutant. Expression of a phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin 1 mutant (R169E) significantly rescued the internalization defect of the SA3 mutant but inhibited the phosphorylation of serines 355 and 356 in wild-type receptors. Our data demonstrate that (i) the lack of GRK sites does not impair PKA site phosphorylation, (ii) the SD3 mutation inhibits GRK-mediated desensitization although it supports some agonist-induced β-arrestin binding and receptor internalization, and (iii) serines 355, 356, and 364 play a pivotal role in the GRK-mediated desensitization, β-arrestin binding, and internalization of β2ARs.

As with other cell membrane signaling receptors, the signaling capacity of β2ARs is rapidly attenuated after activation by agonist. This process, termed desensitization, is initiated by receptor phosphorylation by a variety of protein kinases including protein kinase A (PKA) and by members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family (GRKs). At low agonist concentrations, β2ARs undergo phosphorylation at serine 262 within the third intracellular loop (1Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas under conditions of high occupancy by agonist, receptor phosphorylation is mediated by one or more GRKs in addition to PKA. GRK-mediated phosphorylation of residues within the receptor cytoplasmic tail triggers the translocation of nonvisual arrestins (β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2) to the cell surface where they interact with phosphorylated receptors, causing receptor uncoupling from stimulatory G protein (2Lefkowitz R.J.

A small region between positions 355 and 364 in the cytoplasmic tail of the β2AR has been shown to be essential for agonist-mediated β2AR internalization, phosphorylation, and desensitization (8Hausdorff W.P.

Using a phosphoserine-specific antibody (β2AR Ser(P)-355,356), it recently has been demonstrated that serines 355 and 356 are phosphorylated in an agonist concentration-dependent manner and that these residues are substrates for phosphorylation by both GRK2 and GRK5 in vivo, consistent with recently published mass spectrometry data (1Tran T.M.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6133-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutation of serines 355, 356, and 364 to alanines almost completely eliminates receptor level desensitization and reduces GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation by at least 90% (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, receptor internalization is significantly impaired, suggesting that phosphorylation of these sites is essential for high affinity β-arrestin interaction. However, in these studies we utilized β2ARs in which the PKA consensus sites were mutated and a 6-histidine tag was added to the carboxyl terminus (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), modifications that may independently alter receptor desensitization or cellular localization (12Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although we have shown that modification of the PKA consensus sites does not effect GRK site phosphorylation (1Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it is not known if the GRK sites have a hierarchal effect on PKA site phosphorylation. The goal of the current study was to determine the specific effects of GRK site mutations on β2AR desensitization and internalization and to explore the role of arrestin in these processes without other potentially confounding receptor modifications. We used receptors in which only the putative GRK sites (Ser-355, -356, and -364) have been mutated to either alanine (β2AR-SA3) to eliminate phosphorylation or to aspartic acid (β2AR-SD3), a substitution that may mimic the phosphorylated state. To accomplish these goals we studied the effects of GRK site mutations on receptor desensitization, internalization, cellular trafficking, and EGFP-β-arrestin 2 translocation. Furthermore, we determined if a phosphorylation-independent mutant of β-arrestin 1 (R169E) altered the internalization of mutant receptors or the GRK-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type receptors. Our data provide insights into the β2AR domains governing β-arrestin interaction, receptor internalization, and desensitization. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (purchased from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mutations were introduced into serines 355, 356, and 364 of human β2ARs expressing an amino-terminal FLAG epitope using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. The mutants were sequenced throughout the entire coding region and epitope tag to ensure accuracy of the mutagenesis. Plasmids were stably transfected into HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), and multiple stable clones were selected using 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and analyzed with similar results. EGFP-β-arrestin 2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. M. Caron, and the untagged wild-type β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 1-(R169E) cDNAs were gifts from Dr. V. Gurevich. HA-dynamin-1 K44A cDNA was a gift from Dr. S. Schmid. Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2), the HA epitope, and β-arrestin 1 were obtained from Sigma, Berkeley Antibody Co. (Berkeley, CA), and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies against the β2AR cytoplasmic tail and β2AR phosphoserines 355 and 356 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Species-appropriate fluorescently tagged goat secondary antibodies and transferrin-Alexa594 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Measurement of Equilibrium Binding Constants for Epinephrine and 125I-Labeled Cyanopindolol—The Kd values for 125I-labeled cyanopindolol and epinephrine (EPI) binding were determined for wild-type and mutant β2ARs as previously described (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13January B. Seibold A. Allal C. Whaley B.S. Knoll B.J. Moore R.H. Dickey B.F. Barber R. Clark R.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in triplicate using 0.2 or 1 μg of membrane protein for determinations of Kd and EPI displacement, respectively, and a range of 125I-labeled cyanopindolol concentrations from 1 to 200 pm. To determine the Kd for EPI binding, assays included 50 pm 125I-labeled cyanopindolol and 10 μm GTPγS, and the concentrations of EPI ranged from 0.1 to 100 μm. Nonspecific binding was measured by adding 1 μm alprenolol. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) and fitted to a one-component sigmoid curve using a Hill coefficient of 1. Adenylyl Cyclase Assays—Adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity was determined as previously described (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Clark R.B. Kunkel M.W. Friedman J. Goka T.J. Johnson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In brief, 5 μg of membrane protein was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 100 μl of buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm ATP, 1 μm GTP, 0.1 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 16 units/ml creatine kinase, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). AC activities for six to eight concentrations of EPI were assayed in triplicate, and the EC50 and Vmax values were determined using GraphPad Prism software. Coupling efficiencies for EPI activation and β2AR desensitization were determined from the measurements of Kd and EC50 as previously described in detail (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). The fractional activity remaining is the extent of receptor desensitization determined from the ratio of receptor coupling capacity in the desensitized relative to the naïve state and is calculated using equation 3 from Seibold et al. (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether EGFP-β-arrestin 2 overexpression enhances the desensitization of wild-type or mutant β2ARs, cells stably expressing wild-type β2ARs or the SA3 or SD3 mutants were grown for 24 h on 100-mm dishes and then transfected with 15 μg of empty EGFP vector or with plasmid DNA encoding EGFP-β-arrestin 2 using 22.5 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours later the efficiencies of transfections were determined by direct visualization using epifluorescence microscopy, and plates with a transfection efficiency of at least 70% were used for experimentation. The extent of arrestin overexpression was determined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody (3.0 μg/ml) that recognizes both β-arrestin 1 and 2 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) and quantified by densitometry. Cells were treated with AT (0.1 mm ascorbate/1 mm thiourea) with or without 1 μm isoproterenol (ISO) for 5 or 30 min before measurement of AC activity. Measurement of β2AR Internalization—HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant β2ARs were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well clusters. Cells were exposed to 5 μm ISO at 37 °C for varying times up to 30 min to promote β2AR internalization. In some experiments cells were pretreated for 60 min with either filipin (1 μg/ml) or Me2SO (1:1000). After agonist treatment, the cells were chilled, washed extensively with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (DMEM-H), and surface receptors were measured by incubation in DMEM-H containing 6 nm [3H]CGP12177 at 0 °C for 2 h followed by washing with cold DMEM-H. The monolayers were then harvested with 0.1% SDS and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the lysates were counted by scintillation spectroscopy. For every experiment, binding at each time point was measured in triplicate. The fraction of receptors left on the surface was plotted versus time of exposure, and the curves were fitted by nonlinear regression as previously described (16Morrison K.J. Moore R.H. Carsrud N.D.V. Millman E.E. Trial J. Clark R.B. Barber R. Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 692-699PubMed Google Scholar). First-order rate constants for receptor endocytosis were determined as previously described (16Morrison K.J. Moore R.H. Carsrud N.D.V. Millman E.E. Trial J. Clark R.B. Barber R. Tuvim M. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 692-699PubMed Google Scholar), and the level of statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's t test. Endocytic rate constants are presented as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. To determine the effects of β-arrestin 1 overexpression on receptor internalization, HEK293 cells growing on 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected using 0.6 μg of cDNA encoding wild-type β2ARs, β2AR-SD3, or β2AR-SA3 and 2.4 μg of either empty vector, wild-type β-arrestin 1, or the β-arrestin 1-(R169E) mutant using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent with a DNA to FuGENE 6 ratio of 3 μg to 4.5 μl. After 24 h cells were split into 24-well clusters and allowed to grow an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated with AT alone or 10 μm ISO for 30 min, and receptor internalization was measured using [3H]CGP12177, as described above. The data shown are the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments performed in triplicate. Fluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells growing on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well clusters were treated as indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments cells were fed transferrin-Alexa594 (50 μg/ml) as indicated. After treatment the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1.2% sucrose (PBSS) and fixed with 3.6% paraformaldehyde in PBSS at 4 °C for 10 min. For studies of EGFP-β-arrestin 2 translocation, coverslips were immediately mounted after fixation. For other studies, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and labeled with antibodies as previously described (17Moore R.H. Millman E.E. Alpizar-Foster E. Dai W. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3107-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We used the following concentrations of antibodies: monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2), 5 μg/ml; monoclonal anti-HA, 5 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-β2AR carboxyl terminus, 2 μg/ml; Alexa488-anti-mouse IgG, 1:200 dilution; Alexa594 anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500 dilution. The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and viewed using a DeltaVision deconvolution microscopy system (Applied Precision Inc., Issaquah, WA) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss 100× (1.4 numerical aperture) oil immersion lens, and sections were collected at an optical depth of 150 nm in the z-plane. Images were optimized using DeltaVision deconvolution software and transferred to Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) for the production of final figures. Measurement of β2AR Phosphorylation—To measure PKA-mediated phosphorylation, HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type β2ARs, β2AR-SD3, or β2AR-SA3 were grown to confluence in 12-well plates and stimulated with either AT alone or AT with 1 μm ISO for varying times up to 30 min. Cells were solubilized, and aliquots were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted (without receptor purification) as described in Tran et al. (1Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Blots were probed first with monoclonal antibody against Ser-262 at 0.5 μg/ml and then stripped and probed with an antibody to the receptor carboxyl tail at a 1:5000 dilution to determine receptor levels. The blots were imaged using a CCD camera system (Syngene GeneGnome, Frederick, MD) and quantified using Syngene software. To compare data from different gels, an internal standard of PKA-phosphorylated β2AR was run with each gel. The data from one experiment were normalized to the internal standard of gel and corrected for receptor levels by normalizing to the carboxyl-tail antibody. For studies of Ser-355 and -356, HEK293 cells growing in 6-well clusters were transfected with 0.6 μg of β2AR cDNA and 2.4 μg of either empty vector, wild-type β-arrestin 1, or the β-arrestin 1-(R169E) mutant using FuGENE 6 transfection as described above. The transfection mixture remained on cells for 48 h, at which time the cells were treated with 10 μm ISO or vehicle for 5 min. Cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation, and solubilized in lysis buffer as previously described (1Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The solubilized cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman 50Ti rotor, and the lysates were digested with 1500 units of N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 2 h at 37 °C before heating at 60 °C for 15 min in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved on identically loaded SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The membranes were probed with a rabbit β2AR phosphoserine 355- and 356-specific antibody at a dilution of 1:500 or with the anti-carboxyl-tail antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 to determine total receptors and quantified by densitometry using SigmaGel software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Separate blots with identical protein loads were probed with a monoclonal antibody against β-arrestin 1 at a dilution of 1:1000. The resulting figure depicts the extent of receptor phosphorylation at serines 355 and 356 normalized to total receptor load for each transfection as determined using the anti-receptor carboxyl-tail signal and compared with ISO-treated cells expressing receptors alone. Determination of Coupling Efficiencies for Wild-type β2ARs and GRK Site Mutants—Because the introduction of mutations within the β2AR may alter its coupling to Gs-adenylyl cyclase, we measured the coupling efficiencies for wild-type and mutant receptors as previously described (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We thought it possible that aspartic acid substitution of the GRK sites (β2AR-SD3) would increase agonist-independent β-arrestin binding to receptors and increase the EC50 for AC activation. Alternatively, we expected that β2AR-SA3 mutants would be normally coupled to AC. In testing multiple stable clones with varying expression levels, we found that both mutant receptors were as well coupled to Gs-AC as wild-type receptors and that there were no significant differences in their Kd values for EPI binding. The coupling efficiencies, Kd values for EPI binding, and EC50 values for AC activation are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Characterization of β2ARs stably expressed in HEK293 cellsCell lineEC50 for epinephrineEpinephrine KdCoupling efficiency ±S.E.nmnmWild type2.19 ± 0.290693.0 ± 152.00.031 ± 0.006SD32.40 ± 0.459364.8 ± 54.10.034 ± 0.006SA31.80 ± 0.208639.3 ± 53.00.029 ± 0.003 Open table in a new tab Desensitization of Wild-type and Mutant β2ARs—Next we tested the capacity of GRK site mutants to undergo receptor-level desensitization in response to agonist, which is defined experimentally by a rightward shift in the EC50 for AC activation after agonist treatment (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that treatment with low concentrations (0.1-0.3 nm) of agonist for 5 min induces the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-262, whereas higher concentrations (1 μm) are needed to stimulate GRK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-355 and -356 (1Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study we exposed cells to low and high concentrations of ISO to determine whether mutant β2ARs are impaired in PKA- or GRK-mediated desensitization. Cells expressing wild-type or mutant receptors were treated with 0.3 nm or 1 μm ISO for 5 min and washed, and membranes were purified over sucrose step gradients. These membrane preparations were then exposed to increasing concentrations of EPI, and dose response curves for AC activation were constructed (Fig. 1A). Treatment with 0.3 nm ISO triggered ∼2-fold increases in the EC50 values for AC activation for wild-type receptors and SA3 and SD3 mutants, consistent with PKA-mediated desensitization. Wild-type receptors were significantly further shifted in their EC50 values (10-fold EC50 increase compared with base line) when treated for 5 min with a high concentration of ISO (1 μm). Alternatively, the additional increase in EC50 for both the SA3 and SD3 mutants was only 0.6-fold, indicating a marked impairment in receptor desensitization after a high concentration of agonist. The Vmax was reduced after a 5-min treatment with 1 μm ISO for wild-type and mutant receptors. However, we previously have shown that this decrease is downstream of receptor activation and does not reflect receptor-mediated events under conditions of receptor overexpression (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B.

Open table in a new tab To directly assess the effects of the GRK mutants on PKA-mediated desensitization, we measured the phosphorylation of Ser-262 using a specific monoclonal antibody (1Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of this site was not impaired in SA3 or SD3 mutant receptors after exposure to both low (0.1 nm, data not shown) and high (1 μm, Fig. 1B) concentrations of ISO. From 0 to 5 min, the level of phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant receptors was similar. However the phosphorylation of Ser-262 for both mutants remained fairly constant over time, whereas that of wild-type receptors decreased with prolonged agonist exposures such that by 30 min the fold stimulation in the wild-type, SA3, and SD3 receptors was 2-, 3-, and 4-fold over basal, respectively. Effect of GRK Site Mutations on β2AR Internalization—The finding that the β2AR-SD3 mutant is severely defective in its capacity to undergo receptor-level desensitization while the coupling efficiency remained unchanged suggests that acidic substitutions at positions 355, 356, and 364 do not mimic the phosphorylated state. To further address this question, we measured agonist-induced internalization, which also is dependent on phosphorylation of these sites by GRK (9Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

One of the major challenges for a virus during the early stages of infection is to escape recognition by the host immune system. Viruses have adopted many novel strategies to evade the host immune response or to create an immune suppressed environment. An earlier study in our laboratory has demonstrated that the ORF3 protein of the hepatitis E virus expedites the secretion of α1 microglobulin, an immunosuppressant molecule. Based on this observation, we proposed that enhanced secretion of α1 microglobulin may help maintain an immunosuppressed milieu around the infected hepatocyte (Tyagi, S., Surjit, M., Roy, A. K., Jameel, S., and Lal, S. K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 29308–29319). In the present study, we discovered that the ability of the ORF3 protein to expedite α1 microglobulin secretion is attributed to the PSAP motif present at the C terminus of the former. The ORF3 protein was able to associate with the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) through the PSAP motif. Further, a PSAP motif-mutated ORF3 protein was unable to associate with TSG101 and also lost its ability to enhance the secretion of α1 microglobulin. In addition, the ORF3 protein was found to associate simultaneously with TSG101 and α1 microglobulin because all three of them were co-precipitated as a ternary complex. Finally, a dominant negative mutant of the VPS4 protein was shown to block the enhanced α1 microglobulin secretion in ORF3-expressing hepatocytes. These results suggest a mechanism by which the ORF3 protein exploits the endosomal sorting machinery to enhance the secretion of an immunosuppressant molecule (α1 microglobulin) from the cultured hepatocytes.

These results suggest a mechanism by which the ORF3 protein exploits the endosomal sorting machinery to enhance the secretion of an immunosuppressant molecule (α1 microglobulin) from the cultured hepatocytes. The endosomal protein sorting pathway is a highly dynamic system in cells. It coordinates protein transport from both the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways and hence plays an important role in sorting proteins destined to be degraded, recycled, or secreted. The machinery responsible for this tightly regulated protein sorting process in the endosomal pathway consists of a series of proteins including three protein complexes: endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) 4The abbreviations used are: ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; AD, activation domain; BD, binding domain; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. TSG101, tumor susceptibility gene 101; α1m, α1 microglobulin; HEV, hepatitis E virus; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; HRS, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; SD, synthetic dextrose complete medium. 4The abbreviations used are: ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; AD, activation domain; BD, binding domain; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.

I, II, and III (1Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In recent years, several RNA viruses have been demonstrated to reprogram the host endosomal protein sorting machinery to their benefit (2Pornillos O. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For example, viruses such as HIV-1 and Ebola do not encode their own machineries for budding. Instead they bear two proline-rich motifs in their late domain: P(S/T)AP and PPXY (where X is any amino acid), which have been proved to be essential for viral budding (3Licata J.M. Simpson-Holley M. Wright N.T. Han Z. Paragas J. Harty R.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Goff A. Ehrlich L.S. Cohen S.N. Carter C.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9173-9182Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The P(S/T)AP motif of the HIV-1 Gag late domain has been shown to bind to TSG101 in a manner analogous to that of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) and hijacks the ESCRT complex for virus budding (5Amara A. Littman D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, the VP40 gene product of Ebola virus binds TSG101 via the PSAP motif (6Timmins J. Schoehn G. Ricard-Blum S. Scianimanico S. Vernet T. Ruigrok R.W. Weissenhorn W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) for virus budding. TSG101 is a central mediator of the endosomal trafficking process. It associates with HRS through the PSAP motif (HRS recognizes ubiquitinated cargo in normal cellular context). This association enables the cargo to be targeted to the late endosomes and subsequently get sorted into lysosomes or recycled back. Therefore, TSG101 has been an attractive target for viruses to exploit the host endosomal trafficking machinery to bud off the host cell. Like P(S/T)AP, the PPXY motif present in the late domain of capsid proteins has also been shown to be important for viral budding. This motif is a preferred binding motif for WW domains found in the Nedd4 family of HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligases (7Harty R.N. Brown M.E. Wang G. Huibregtse J. Hayes F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13871-13876Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Both HIV-1 Gag and the VP40 protein of Ebola virus bind Nedd4 and get ubiquitinated, which aids in recognition by HRS/TSG101 and virus budding (3Licata J.M. Simpson-Holley M. Wright N.T. Han Z. Paragas J. Harty R.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Pornillos O. Alam S.L. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2397-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Another crucial function for which viruses hijack the endosomal sorting machinery is to subvert the immune surveillance process. An example of this phenomenon is provided by the k3 gene product of Kaposi sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus. The k3 protein is an ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, thus targeting them for lysosomal degradation in a TSG101-dependent manner (10Hewitt E.W. Duncan L. Mufti D. Baker J. Stevenson P.G. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similarly, the M153R gene product of myxoma virus ubiquitinates CD4 molecules and causes its lysosomal degradation (11Mansouri M. Bartee E. Gouveia K. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Barrett J. Thomas L. Thomas G. McFadden G. Fruh K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, viral exploitation of the endosomal sorting machinery for immune evasion appears to be a prevalent strategy. In this report we provide yet another example of a viral protein exploiting the endosomal sorting pathway that may help create an immunosuppressed milieu surrounding the infected cell. The ORF3 protein of hepatitis E virus was observed to associate with TSG101 through the PSAP motif present at its C terminus and expedite the secretion of an immunosuppressant molecule called α1 microglobulin (α1m). α1m is a member of the lipocalin superfamily, found both in blood and in most tissues (12Beggard T. Oury T. Thogersen I.B. Akerstrom B. Enghild J.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence shows 80% homology from rodents to humans (13Akerstrom B. Logdberg L. Berggard T. Osmark P. Lindquist A. Biochem. Biophy. Acta. 2000; 1482: 172-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). α1m is a general immunosuppressant and inhibits the antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes, interleukin-2 production of T cells, and the migration and chemotaxis of granulocytes (14Logdberg L. Akerstrom B. Scand. J. Immmunol. 1981; 13: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Mendez E. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Grubb A. Leyva-Cobian F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 88: 1472-1475Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Wester L. Johansson M.U. Akerstrom B. Prot. Exp. Pur. 1997; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previous studies done in our laboratory have shown that ORF3 interacts with α1m and expedites its export and secretion from hepatocytes. This enhanced transport of α1m in ORF3-expressing cells was sensitive to both brefeldin A and monensin. The above observation coupled with subcellular co-localization studies further confirmed that the transport is expedited from the trans-Golgi region of hepatoma cells (17Tyagi S. Surjit M. Roy A.K. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29308-29319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the mechanism by which the ORF3 protein might be expediting the secretion of α1m, we found the former to interact with TSG101. A PSAP mutant form of the ORF3 protein was unable to associate with TSG101; neither could it expedite the secretion of α1m. Moreover, a dominant negative mutant of the VPS4 protein could also block the enhanced α1m secretion in wild type ORF3-expressing cells, further confirming the above observation. Further, ORF3 was found to simultaneously associate with both α1m and TSG101 in a ternary complex from hepatocyte extracts. All of these observations suggest that the ORF3 protein associates with TSG101 in a manner analogous to late domain-bearing proteins and expedites the secretion of α1m. The possible significance of this phenomenon during viral pathogenesis is discussed. Plasmid Constructs—Full-length ORF3 gene of HEV was excised from pSGORF3 (18Jameel S. Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 207-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using NdeI and PstI and cloned into the pGBKT7 vector cut with the same. pAS2 1–79 ORF3 and pAS2 81–123 ORF3, Mexican ORF3, and S80A ORF3 have been described earlier (19Tyagi S. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Tyagi S. Korkaya H. Zafrullah M. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22759-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of the DNA manipulations were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pGADT7 ORF3 RLIA construct was prepared by two rounds of cloning. First, oligonucleotide bearing the mutant sequence were cloned into pGADT7 at the ClaI/XhoI site. Upper strand and lower strand sequences are 5′-CGATTGATCGCTCCGCTGCCTCACGTCGTAGACCTACCACAGCTGGGCCGCGCCGCTAAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTTAGCGGCGCGGCCCCAGCTGTGGTAGGTCTACGACGTGAGGCAGCGGAGCGATCAAT-3′, respectively. This construct was denoted as pGADT7 309–370 RLIA ORF3. Next, ORF3 sequence from amino acids 1 to 308 was PCR-amplified using pSGI ORF3 as template. The PCR product was excised and ligated into the SmaI/ClaI site of pGADT7 309–370 RLIA ORF3 to get pGADT7 RLIA ORF3. The forward and reverse primer sequences are 5′-CCCGGGAGAGCTCGATTC-3′ and 5′-ATCGATCCTGGTCGCGCCAAGCG-3′, respectively. pGADT7 101, pGADT7 101 M95A, pGBKT7 101, pGBKT7 101 M95A, wild type, and dominant negative VPS4a and 4b were kind gifts from Dr. Wesley I.

Yeast Two-hybrid Techniques—The Matchmaker GAL-4-based yeast two-hybrid system III (Clontech) was used. The yeast two-hybrid study was performed as described previously (24James P. Haliaday J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, competent AH109 cells were transformed with respective activation domain and binding domain constructs, and co-transformed cells were selected by growing them on Leu- medium for 3 days. Next, for each sample, 10 clones were selected at random and checked for their ability to grow on Leu-, Trp-, Trp-, and His- plates with up to 50 mm 3-AT. Colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by both filter lift and liquid assays as described previously (17Tyagi S. Surjit M. Roy A.K. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29308-29319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Huh7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin, streptomycin. The cells were transfected at 60% confluency with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were transfected in either a 60-mm culture dish (for immunoprecipitation) or a 6-well culture plate on glass coverslips (for immunofluorescence microscopy). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—At 44 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 1 h in cysteine/methionine-deficient medium and were then labeled with 100 μCi/ml of [35S]Cys/Met promix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. After 4 h, labeling medium was collected (in case secreted α1m was to be detected). The cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were collected and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. For immunoprecipitation, an equal amount of protein was incubated with 1 μg of corresponding antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 100 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose suspension for 1 h. The beads were washed three times in the lysis buffer, boiled in 2× SDS dye, and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting or fluorography. Immunoblotting—The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then incubated with respective primary antibodies, again washed and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The proteins were then detected by the ECL detection method (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence Assay—Immunofluorescence staining was done as described by Tyagi et al. (17Tyagi S. Surjit M. Roy A.K. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29308-29319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ORF3 protein was stained with anti-mouse Texas Red, and α1m or TSG101 was stained by anti-rabbit FITC. The nucleus was stained by 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole where indicated. The images were acquired using a NIKON TE 2000U immunofluorescence microscope. Superimposition of images was done using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. ORF3 Protein of Hepatitis E Virus Interacts with TSG101—Earlier studies in our laboratory have proved that the ORF3 protein of HEV binds to α1m and expedites its anterograde transport from the trans-Golgi region of cultured hepatoma cells. The observed phenomenon was sensitive to both brefeldin A and monensin, indicating that the ORF3 protein executes its effect at some step beyond the Golgi region (17Tyagi S. Surjit M. Roy A.K. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29308-29319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ORF3 might be associating with some crucial intermediate factor of the cellular cargo transport machinery and manipulating the entire pathway toward the benefit of the virus, as has been observed for many other viral gene products. Thus, we analyzed the ORF3 protein sequence for any known motifs that might interact with a cellular protein trafficking factor. Interestingly, we observed the presence of a PSAP motif between 104 and 107 amino acids of the ORF3 protein. A homology search revealed that the PSAP motif is conserved among different isolates of HEV. It was also conserved in avian HEV isolate, which shows maximum diversity from all other HEV isolates (Fig. 1). The PSAP motif has earlier been reported to be present in the late domain containing proteins of many RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and Ebola (2Pornillos O. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PSAP motif present in these late domain proteins has been shown to interact with TSG101 and usurp the host ESCRT machinery for budding of viral particles. Hence, we tested whether the ORF3 protein also associated with TSG101. A yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted to check the interaction between ORF3 and TSG101. Results of this assay revealed that a Gal4 DNA BD or AD fused ORF3 interacted with AD or BD fused TSG101, respectively. In addition, the M95A mutant TSG101 (designated as 101A) that has been well documented to lose its ability to bind the PSAP motif (23Stuchell M.D. Garrus J.E. Muller B. Stray K.M. Ghaffarian S. McKinnon R. Krausslich H.G. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36059-36071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was unable to interact with ORF3 (Fig. 2A). Among the human HEV isolates, the Mexican strain shows maximum diversity from others in the amino acid sequence of ORF3 protein. Thus, we also tested the Mexican ORF3 protein interaction with TSG101 in the yeast two-hybrid system (BD-MexO3), which showed a positive result. Further, the Mexican ORF3 protein was unable to associate with the M95A mutant TSG101, thus indicating that the observed interaction was a specific property of the former. This result came as no surprise because the PSAP motif was found conserved in the Mexican isolate of the ORF3 protein as well (Fig. 1). As a positive control for the assay, self-association of TSG101, which has been reported earlier (25Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), was observed in a parallel set of experiments. Co-transformed empty BD/AD vectors and ORF3 co-transformed with M95A mutant TSG101 served as negative controls in the experiment. A quantitative estimation of the relative strengths of interaction between ORF3 and TSG101 in comparison with controls as judged by liquid β-galactosidase assay is also shown graphically in Fig. 2A. As seen in the graph, ORF3 was found to strongly interact with wild type TSG101, which was evident from ∼7–8-fold more β-galactosidase activity in cells co-transformed with both ORF3 and TSG101. Further, strength of interaction between the M95A mutant TSG101 with ORF3 protein was significantly lower than that of wild type TSG101 with ORF3 and comparable with that of controls. To confirm the results obtained from the yeast two-hybrid assay, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to check the association of the ORF3 protein with TSG101 in a mammalian cell environment. Huh7 cells were transfected with pSGI (Fig. 2B, lane 1) or pSGI ORF3 (lanes 2–4). 44 h post-transfection, the cells were labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]Cys/Met labeling mix for 4 h and harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer. Equal amount of samples were immunoprecipitated using anti-ORF3 or anti-TSG101 antibody. Half of the sample was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-TSG101 antibody (Fig. 2B, upper panel), and the remaining half was resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography to detect ORF3 expression (Fig. 2B, lower panel). TSG101 was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with ORF3 antibody (upper panel, lane 2). Similarly TSG101 antibody could co-precipitate ORF3 protein (lower panel, lane 4). As a negative control, mock (denoted by M) transfected cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF3 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-TSG101 antibody (lane 1). To further confirm that ORF3 antibody specifically co-precipitated TSG101 protein, one set of lysate was subjected to two rounds of immunodepletion using anti-ORF3 antibody, and the resulting supernatant was again immunoprecipitated using anti-ORF3 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-TSG101 antibody. As expected, both ORF3 and TSG101 band intensity was significantly reduced (lane 3), thus indicating that both of them existed as a complex in the cell lysate. This experiment confirmed that the ORF3 protein associates with TSG101 in a cellular milieu. The PSAP Motif of ORF3 Is Essential for Interaction with TSG101—In an effort to further prove the involvement of the PSAP motif for interaction with the ORF3 protein; we adopted a site-directed mutagenesis approach. All four amino acids PSAP were modified to RLIA so as to destroy the PSAP motif. Care was taken to minimize nucleotide alteration during mutagenesis. The modified gene was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors as a fusion with the GAL4 activation domain. Expression of the mutant protein was verified using an in vitro transcription-translation system (TnT kit; Promega). Transcription of the PSAP mutant ORF3 gene in the TnT reaction was driven by the T7 promoter located between the GAL4 activation domain and the ORF3 coding sequence, thus producing a hemagglutinin-tagged protein. Wild type ORF3 in pSGI vector was used as a control. Translation in the TnT system was driven by the protein synthesis machinery present in the reticulocyte lysate. The protein thus produced was radiolabeled with [35S]Cys/Met. Reticulocyte lysates expressing pGADT7, pSGI wild type ORF3, or pGADT7 PSAP mutant ORF3 protein (ORF3M) were immunoprecipitated using anti-ORF3 antibody, and the expression of ORF3 protein was detected by fluorography (Fig. 3A). Both wild type and ORF3M protein were efficiently expressed (lanes 2 and 3) and recognized by the anti-ORF3 antibody. The ORF3M protein migrated at a higher position than the wild type protein because of the presence of the hemagglutinin tag attached to the former. Mock translated lysate did not show any band corresponding to the ORF3 protein (lane 1), thus confirming that the observed bands were specific to the ORF3 protein. The ORF3M protein was tested for interaction with TSG101 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. As expected, this protein lost its ability to interact with TSG101 (Fig. 3B). As a further proof, we also tested the ability of two deletion mutants of ORF3 gene to interact with TSG101. These constructs were used earlier in yeast two-hybrid assays (19Tyagi S. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In agreement with our proposed hypothesis, the ORF3 deletion expressing amino acids 1–79 of the ORF3 protein did not show interaction with the TSG101 protein, whereas the deletion expressing 81–123 amino acids was capable of interacting with TSG101 as efficiently as the full-length wild type ORF3 protein (Fig. 3B). However, none of the mutants showed any significant interaction with the TSG101 M95A mutant protein. We next investigated whether phosphorylation of the ORF3 protein was a determinant factor for its association with TSG101. It has been reported earlier that the ORF3 protein is phosphorylated at a single serine residue located at the 80th amino acid from the N-terminal of the protein. Changing this serine to alanine abolishes phosphorylation of ORF3 (26Zafrullah M. Ozdener M.H. Panda S.K. Jameel S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this S80A ORF3 mutant yeast two-hybrid construct (pAS2 S80AORF3) (20Tyagi S. Korkaya H. Zafrullah M. Jameel S. Lal S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22759-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as a bait to check its interaction with TSG101. The S80A ORF3 protein showed efficient interaction with TSG101 as judged by the histidine prototrophy exhibited by co-transformants, as well as relative liquid β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the interaction of the ORF3 protein with TSG101 is independent of the phosphorylation status of ORF3. The yeast two-hybrid data were further confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The PSAP mutant ORF3 (ORF3M) gene was cloned into the pSGI expression vector (here no epitope tag is present). Expression of the ORF3M protein in Huh7 cells was verified by immunoprecipitation analysis of the transfected cell lysate (data not shown). Next, Huh7 cells were transfected with pSGI (Fig. 3C, M, lane 1), pSGI wild type ORF3 (O3, lane 2), or pSGI PSAP mutant ORF3 (O3 M, lane 3); labeled with [35S]Cys/Met promix; and immunoprecipitated using anti-ORF3 antibody followed by immunoblotting using anti-TSG101 antibody. As expected, the ORF3M protein was unable to associate with TSG101, whereas wild type could efficiently pull out the TSG101 product (Fig. 3C, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). The lower panel shows the expression of the ORF3 protein in corresponding samples. This observation was further confirmed by reversing the assay condition, i.e. detecting the level of ORF3 protein that can be pulled down using anti-TSG101 antibody. As seen in Fig. 3D, TSG101 antibody could effectively pull down the wild type ORF3 protein (lane 3), whereas it failed to pull down detectable amount of ORF3M protein (lane 2). Lane 1 shows a rabbit preimmune serum immunoprecipitated sample as a control to verify the specificity of anti-TSG101 antibody. Together, these experiments confirm that the PSAP motif of the ORF3 protein is functionally active and confers upon the ORF3 protein the ability to associate with TSG101. Wild Type ORF3 Protein Co-localizes with the Cellular TSG101 Protein—Having proved that wild type ORF3 and the TSG101 protein could associate with each other in a cellular environment, we subsequently checked whether the two proteins co-localize with each other. Huh7 cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with the wild type ORF3 or ORF3M expression constructs. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence assay. Expression of the ORF3 protein was visualized by staining with Texas Red (Fig. 4, panels IV and VII) and that of TSG101 was visualized by staining with FITC (Fig. 4, panels II, V, and VIII). As expected, the wild type ORF3 protein co-localized with TSG101, whereas the ORF3M mutant was unable to do so (Fig. 4, compare panels VI with IX). Effective co-localization resulted in the production of a golden yellow color upon superimposition of Texas Red over FITC, as seen in the case of wild type ORF3 protein (panel VI). However, in the case of the ORF3M protein, no yellow color was observed (panel IX). In wild type ORF3-expressing cells, TSG101 was found prominently in the cytoplasm, whereas in mock transfected cells the distribution was diffused and a significant fraction was present in the nucleus (panel II). However, in mutant ORF3M-expressing cells, no difference was observed from that of mock transfected cells. The PSAP Motif of ORF3 Is Essential for Enhanced Secretion of α1 Microglobulin from ORF3-expressing Hepatocytes—The above experiments confirmed that association with TSG101 is a specific property of the ORF3 protein. Because TSG101 is a key component in assembly of the ESCRT complex, we reasoned that by associating with it, ORF3 might be promoting the assembly of the ESCRT complex, which may carry α1m as a cargo, leading to its secretion. This assumption was based on previous reports that association of a viral late domain protein (e.g. HIV-1 Gag) with TSG101 is able to recruit ESCRT machinery to promot"

It is known that LTD4 affects the expression of many proteins that influence survival and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells. We demonstrate here that after LTD4 exposure, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it signals activation of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors. These events are mediated via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser-9 residue of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. We also show that in the presence of LTD4, free β-catenin translocates to the mitochondria where it associates with the cell survival protein Bcl-2. We hypothesize that LTD4 may enhance cell survival via activation of β-catenin signaling, in particular, by promoting the association of β-catenin with Bcl-2 in the mitochondria. Similar to Wnt-1 signaling, LTD4 signals an increased level of free β-catenin and elevated TCF/LEF promotor activity. This work in intestinal epithelial cells further lends credence to the idea that inflammatory signaling pathways are intrinsically linked with potential oncogenic signals involved in cell survival and apoptosis.

Harvey Lect. 1979; 75: 1-40PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is the common precursor of a group of mediators, collectively called eicosanoids (2Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). LTD4 is known to mediate its effects through specific cell surface receptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family. Two such receptors have been cloned, CysLT1 (3Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P.

O'Dowd B.F. Figueroa D.J. Sawyer N. Nguyen T. Im D.S. Stocco R. Bellefeuille J.N. Abramovitz M. Cheng R. Williams Jr., D.L. Zeng Z. Liu Q. Ma L. Clements M.K. Coulombe N. Liu Y. Austin C.P.

Earlier results from our group demonstrated that the CysLT1 receptor signals through at least two different G proteins (5Thodeti C.K. Adolfsson J. Juhas M. Sjölander A. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2005; 302: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). LTD4 is associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (7Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). The IBDs, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are characterized by an increased infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes into the intestinal wall where they have the capacity to cause nonspecific tissue injury. In addition, these inflammatory cells, in particular the neutrophils, are a significant source of mediators with important regulatory roles in the inflammatory process. Consequently, the IBD-effected intestine contains a significant source of eicosanoids, readily available for interaction with the CysLT receptors expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (8Öhd J.F. Nielsen C.K. Campbell J. Landberg G. Löfberg H. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Nielsen C.K. Campbell J.I. Öhd J.F. Morgelin M. Riesbeck K. Landberg G. Sjölander A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 732-742PubMed Google Scholar). During the last decade intense research has focused on identifying effective inhibitors of soluble eicosanoid mediators (10Sharon P. Stenson W.F. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 453-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 11Hawkey C.J. Dube L.M. Rountree L.V. Linnen P.J. Lancaster J.F.

Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1991; 42: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Most clinical trials with such inhibitors, often short term studies, have so far not revealed any advantageous effects on the inflammatory component of IBD compared with presently available treatments (11Hawkey C.J. Dube L.M. Rountree L.V. Linnen P.J. Lancaster J.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 718-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Nielsen O.H. Ahnfelt-Ronne I. Thomsen M.K. Kissmeyer A.M. Langholz E. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1991; 42: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Not only is there a well established connection between IBD and increased frequency of neoplastic transformation (13Smalley W.E. DuBois R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), but a more general link between chronic inflammation and increased risk of developing cancer has been suggested (14Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10797) Google Scholar). Therefore, the findings from our group that exposure to LTD4 increases survival and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (15Paruchuri S. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45577-45585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are highly interesting. Moreover, we have shown that LTD4 causes up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and the multifunctional protein β-catenin (16Öhd J.F. Wikström K. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that the CysLT1 receptor is up-regulated in colon cancer tissue and that LTD4 signaling facilitates the survival of cancer cells (8Öhd J.F. Nielsen C.K. Campbell J. Landberg G. Löfberg H. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a protein with many distinct roles. It is found at the cell membrane, where it forms part of the adherens-type junctions, by linking the intracellular domain of the classical type cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (17Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 18Cullen D.A. Killick R. Leigh P.N. Gallo J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 354: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is also an effector molecule of the Wnt signaling pathway. The presence of a Wnt signal allows β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription together with members of the transcription factor family TCF/LEF (19Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). Normally, in mature cells the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein maintains intracellular β-catenin homeostasis by the formation of a cytosolic complex, which also includes axin and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β), (20Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 21Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Binding of β-catenin to this complex facilitates its phosphorylation at serine residues 33, 37, and 41 by GSK-3β, leading to subsequent ubiquitination and degradation (22Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). However, in most cases of colon cancer, the function of the APC protein is altered, the extent of which can vary from incorrect function to total loss of the protein (19Korinek V. Barker N.

The uncontained β-catenin is free to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of potentially oncogenic target genes (25Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi M. Fukuda K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 42-46PubMed Google Scholar), such as c-myc (27He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (28Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Wnt signaling might also be involved in the regulation of cell survival by protecting cells from cytochrome c leakage (29Shin S.Y. Kim C.G. Jho E.H. Rho M.S. Kim Y.S. Kim Y.H. Lee Y.H. Cancer Lett. 2004; 212: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thus indirectly suggesting a role for β-catenin in this process. Bcl-2 is the founding member of a family of proteins that are regulators of apoptosis. Bcl-2 itself was originally found in lymphoma and is believed to protect cells from programmed cell death (30Park J.R. Hockenbery D.M. J. Cell Biochem. 1996; 60: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J.

This protective action occurs largely through its effect on mitochondrial membrane integrity (33Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). One way by which Bcl-2 mediates its effect is through altered levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic free calcium (34Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A novel functional interaction between Bcl-2 and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors, with a role in modulating survival of cells, was also recently uncovered (34Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In this context it is noteworthy that we found extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2-dependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 in intestinal epithelial cells responding to LTD4 (35Wikström K. Öhd J.F. Sjölander A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to investigate further our previous finding that LTD4 induces an increased expression of β-catenin and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in epithelial cells. Our aim was to understand better the link between eicosanoid inflammatory signaling and carcinogenesis.

The Bcl-2 sequence was further amplified by PCR using sense 5′-GGA ACG TCG ACA TGG CGC ACG CTG GGA GAA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGA ACG TCG ACT CAC TTG TGG CTC AGA TAG-3′ primers. The Bcl-2 sequence was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 expression vector using SalI, and the correct orientation of the insert was checked using the PstI restriction enzyme. HA-S33Y-β-catenin and HA-wt-β-catenin constructs were generously provided by Dr. Ben-Zeév (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). The constitutively active mutant of GSK-3β 9A constructs were generously provided by Dr. Birnbaum (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania). Cell Culture—Human intestinal epithelial nontransformed (Int 407) cells, which exhibit typical epithelial morphology and growth (36Henle G. Deinhardt F. J. Immunol. 1957; 79: 54-59PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured as a monolayer to approximately 80% confluence for 5 days in Eagle's basal medium (15Paruchuri S. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45577-45585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were tested regularly to ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination. Cell Lysates and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were cultured for 5 days and serum starved for 2 h before stimulation with 80 nm LTD4 for 0.5-24 h in the absence of serum. Treatment was terminated by the addition if ice-cold buffer A (9Nielsen C.K. Campbell J.I. Öhd J.F. Morgelin M. Riesbeck K. Landberg G. Sjölander A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 732-742PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Flasks were kept on ice for 30 min, and the remaining cell debris was scraped loose into the lysis buffer and homogenized 10 times on ice with a Dounce glass grinder. The cell suspension was cleared by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove whole cells and cell debris. Finally, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were evaluated for, and compensated to, equal protein content. Before immunoprecipitation, membrane fractions were precleared with 1 μg of mouse IgG and 15 μl of protein G-agarose. The samples were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of β-catenin or Bcl-2 antibody for 90 min at 4 °C. Thereafter 20 μg of protein G-agarose beads were added, and the samples were rotated for an additional 45 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed multiple times with buffer A. Isolation of a Nuclear Fraction—Cells were cultured as described above. After the indicated treatments with 80 nm LTD4 and other supplements, cells were washed twice with buffer A and kept on ice in the same buffer for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were scraped loose and subjected to nitrogen decompression at 1,000 p.s.i. for 10 min, using a cell disruption bomb (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL). The nuclear fractions were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min and washed twice with buffer A prior to analysis. Isolation of a Mitochondrial Fraction—Cells were cultured as described above and left in serum-free culture medium for 2 h prior to initiation of an experiment. After the indicated treatments with 80 nm LTD4, the experiments were terminated by the addition of a buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the flasks were left on ice for 10 min. The cells were scraped loose, homogenized 10 times (Dounce), and then lysis buffer was added (20 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by two short centrifugations at 750 ×× g, and then the mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Cell samples were solubilized by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min in the sample buffer (15Paruchuri S. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45577-45585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The solubilized proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred electro-phoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min. Subsequently, it was incubated overnight at 4 °C as indicated with specific antibodies against, (diluted 1:500) Bcl-2, β-catenin, phospho-specific GSK-3β, COX-2, Wnt-1, (diluted 1:1,000) total GSK-3β, voltage-dependent anion channel (porin) or actin. Thereafter, the membrane was washed extensively, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-linked antibodies (1:5,000), washed, incubated with ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence), and exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL to visualize immunoreactive protein. Densitometric analysis was performed with a Fluor-S quantitative imaging system (Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence—The cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown for 5 days and serum-starved for 2 h before stimulation with 80 nm LTD4 for 0.5-24 h in the absence of serum. When applicable, for the last 30 min of stimulation 100 nm Mitotracker Red was added. The medium was removed and the dishes washed several times with PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS or 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS (β-catenin) for 5 min. Blocking was carried out in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and the primary antibody was diluted 1:50 (Bcl-2), 1:250 (β-catenin), and 1:500 (Lamin B) in a solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 60 min. After several washes in PBS, the secondary antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution in 3% bovine serum albumin, and the incubation lasted 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by extensive washing with PBS. Finally, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with fluorescent mounting medium. Confocal images were recorded using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning system with a Nikon microscope (model TE300) equipped with a 60 × 1.4 Plan-APOCHROMAT oil immersion objective. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—The luciferase assays were carried out employing the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI). Each plasmid was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, except for the control Renilla luciferase vector, which was present at all times at 0.2 μg/ml to standardize transfection efficiency. Vector DNA was allowed to form complexes with Lipofectamine (0.0001 μg/ml was used). Meanwhile, 50-60% confluent cells in 12-well plates were washed once in serum-free medium, and the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture was added. The transfection continued at 37 °C for 4 h, after which the medium was changed to normal growth medium, and the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Before the addition of 80 nm LTD4, cells were left in serum-free medium for 2 h. During this time, when applicable, they were pretreated with 500 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 2 h, 50 μm LY294002 for the last 30 min, 20 μm ZM198,615, or 25 μm MK571 for the last 15 min, or 100 nm wortmannin for the last 10 min. After stimulation with LTD4 for the indicated periods of time, cells were washed in PBS and lysed using 100 μl/well of the DRL passive lysis buffer included in the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Lysed samples were then collected and briefly centrifuged to precipitate any debris. A 20-μl portion of each lysate was transferred to a luminometer test tube predispensed with 50 μl of Luciferase Assay Buffer II, and the luciferase reaction was immediately recorded using a MiniLumat LB 9506 (Berthold Technologies, Germany). The control Renilla luciferase signal was recorded after the subsequent addition of 50 μl of Stop & Glow buffer, and the level of expression is given as a ratio. Triplicate samples were prepared and analyzed for each condition in every set of experiment. Assessment of Caspase-3 Activity—Cells, transfected or not with wild type or S33Y mutated β-catenin, were cultured in 12-well plates, and during the last 4 h they were exposed or not to 100 μm NS-398 in the presence or absence of 80 nm LTD4. Thereafter, the cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in 300 μl of buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl. 50-μl samples from such lysates were suspended in 200 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and added to Nunc Polysorb 96-well white fluorescence measurement plates. 5 μl of caspase-3 fluorometric substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC was subsequently added. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the fluorescence of each well was then measured at 390 and 460 nm (excitation and emission wavelengths) using a BMG plate reader (Offenburg, Germany). Triplicate samples were prepared and analyzed for each condition in every set of experiments. Hoechst Staining and Trypan Blue Exclusion—The cells were cultured for 2 days on glass coverslips for Hoechst staining and directly in 35 × 10-mm Petri dishes for trypan blue exclusion analysis. Cell transfected or not with S33Y-β-catenin or GSK-3β 9A were exposed for 3 days to 100 μm NS-398 in the absence or presence of 80 nm LTD4. The experiments were terminated by washing the cells on the coverslips (Hoechst staining) three times with PBS, fixing them with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, and then staining them for 15 minin10 μm/ml Hoechst 34580 suspended in PBS. The coverslips were then washed again and mounted on glass slides. The cells were examined, and representative images were taken. To determine viability, the cells growing in the Petri dishes were harvested and stained with 0.2% (w/v) trypan blue suspended in PBS. After washing the percentages of viable cells were calculated. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. All comparisons between mean values were performed by use of analysis of variance statistics with subsequent post hoc testing according to Tukey-Kramer at α 0.05; p values of <0.05 were considered significant. LTD4-induced Phosphorylation of GSK-3β—GSK-3β is known to phosphorylate β-catenin directly and induce its ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. Because GSK-3β can be inactivated through phosphorylation at its Ser-9 residue via a PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt (37Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), such events have the potential of increasing the amount of free β-catenin (38Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). Earlier results from our group show that LTD4 stimulation induces an increase in β-catenin protein levels (16Öhd J.F. Wikström K. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Akt activation (39Paruchuri S. Broom O. Dib K. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13538-13544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether LTD4-mediated β-catenin up-regulation involves changes in GSK-3β phosphorylation status. Int 407 cells were stimulated with LTD4 for different periods of time and the level of phosphorylated GSK-3β evaluated by immunoblotting. The level of Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β was increased significantly (5-fold that of basal) after 30 min of LTD4 treatment and still remained elevated after 24 h (Fig. 1A, representative blot and accumulated densitometric data). The membranes were always reprobed with an antibody against total GSK-3β to ensure equal loading (Fig. 1, A-C). Subsequent experiments revealed that LTD4 stimulation (1 h) caused a parallel increase in the cellular level of β-catenin (Fig. 1B, representative blot and accumulated densitometric data). These LTD4-induced changes in GSK-3β phosphorylation status and in the level of β-catenin were both reduced by the CysLT1 receptor antagonist ZM198,615 and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 1B). As a control, we inhibited GSK-3β with 10 mm LiCl, a procedure known to be mediated via phosphorylation of Ser-9 (40Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that treatment with LiCl results in phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser-9, and importantly in an increase in the level of β-catenin (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we show that both LiCl and LTD4 increased the level of COX-2 expression (Fig. 1C). Because β-catenin-mediated TCF/LEF activity can regulate transcription of the COX-2 gene, these results lend further support to the notion that LTD4-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β (Ser-9) and the accumulation of free β-catenin could be interrelated. To test this possibility further, we transfected cells with the constitutively active GSK-3β 9A. In the GSK-3β 9A-transfected cells we found a clear reduction of the LTD4-induced increase in β-catenin expression compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 1D). In parallel we observed a reduction in the level of GSK-3β (Ser-9) phosphorylation in the GSK-3β 9A-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Although the majority of Wnt-1 in the intestine is believed to come from nonepithelial mesenchymal cells or, more specifically, intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (41Bienz M. Clevers H.

https://openalex.org/W1983779487,"Class A amphipathic helical peptides have been shown to mimic apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein component of high density lipoproteins and have been shown to inhibit atherosclerosis in several dyslipidemic mouse models. Previously we reported the NMR structure of Ac-18A-NH2, the base-line model class A amphipathic helical peptide in a 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol-d3/water mixture, a membrane-mimic environment (Mishra, V. K., Palgunachari, M. N., Anantharamaiah, G. M., Jones, M. K., Segrest, J. P., and Krishna, N. R. (2001) Peptides 22, 567–573). The peptide Ac-18A-NH2 forms discoidal nascent high density lipoprotein-like particles with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Because subtle structural changes in the peptide·lipid complexes have been shown to be responsible for their antiatherogenic properties, we undertook high resolution NMR studies to deduce detailed structure of recombinant peptide·1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine complexes. The peptide adopts a well defined amphipathic α helical structure in association with the lipid at a 1:1 peptide:lipid weight ratio. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy revealed a number of intermolecular close contacts between the aromatic residues in the hydrophobic face of the helix and the lipid acyl chain protons. The pattern of observed peptide-lipid nuclear Overhauser effects is consistent with a parallel orientation of the amphipathic α helix, with respect to the plane of the lipid bilayer, on the edge of the disc (the belt model). Based on the results of chemical cross-linking and molecular modeling, we propose that peptide helices are arranged in a head to tail fashion to cover the edge of the disc. This arrangement of peptides is also consistent with the pKa values of the Lys residues determined previously. Taken together, these results provide for the first time a high resolution structural view of the peptide·lipid discoidal complexes formed by a class A amphipathic α helical peptide.

Lipoproteins are macromolecular complexes of lipids and proteins (apolipoproteins) that serve to transport lipids and lipid-soluble and water-insoluble molecules in blood throughout the body. Epidemiological studies have established an inverse correlation between the plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) 4The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.4The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. cholesterol and the risk of coronary artery disease. In support of a protective role of human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein accounting for 70% of the total protein present in HDL, it has been shown that expression of human apoA-I in atherosclerosis-sensitive mouse models leads to inhibition of atherosclerosis (1Rubin E.

In addition, recently it has been shown that infusion of recombinant HDL particles consisting of apoA-I Milano regressed already existing lesions in humans (5Nissen S.E. Tsunoda T. Tuzcu E.M.

Assoc. 2003; 290: 2292-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a great deal of interest in understanding structure-function relationships of HDLs. The common lipid-associating motif identified in apoA-I and other exchangeable apolipoproteins is the amphipathic α helix with opposing polar and apolar faces (6Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the amphipathic α helices present in exchangeable apolipoproteins possess positively charged amino acid residues at the polar and nonpolar interface and negatively charged amino acid residues at the center of the polar face (7Segrest J.P. De Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Such amphipathic helices were grouped into class A (apolipoprotein class) motif (8Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past several years, our laboratory has been involved in the de novo design and studies of relatively small synthetic apolipoprotein-mimic peptides. An 18-residue peptide, namely 18A, was designed to mimic the class A amphipathic helical motif (9Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones J.L. Brouillette C.G. Schmidt C.F. Chung B.H. Hughes T.A. Bhown A.S.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10256-10262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide 18A has the following amino acid sequence: Asp-Trp-Leu-Lys-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Asp-Lys-Val-Ala-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Ala-Phe. It has been shown that acetylating the N-terminal end and amidating the C-terminal end of 18A to produce Ac-18A-NH2 results in helix stabilization and increased lipid affinity of the peptide (11Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Phillips M.C. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Tytler E.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The peptide Ac-18A-NH2 has been shown to mimic certain properties of human apoA-I. For example, it has been shown that Ac-18A-NH2 is able to disrupt multilamellar vesicles of DMPC to form discoidal peptide·lipid complexes analogous to apoA-I (11Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Phillips M.C. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Tytler E.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The global secondary structure of Ac-18A-NH2 under different environments has been studied using CD (11Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Phillips M.C. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Tytler E.M. Segrest J.P.

Biol. 1999; 290: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) spectroscopy. In addition, we have determined the solution NMR structure of Ac-18A-NH2 in 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol-d3/H2O mixture, a membrane-mimic environment (14Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Krishna N.R. Peptides. 2001; 22: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not distinguish subtle variations in lipid-associated structures of peptides that may distinguish them from atheroprotective and inactive complexes (15Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26509-26517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, the orientation of the peptide with respect to lipid in discoidal peptide·lipid complexes has to be understood before we can understand the subtle changes in the structure of peptide·lipid complexes that lead to atheroprotective or inactive complexes. With a view to establish a sensitive and high resolution method to understand subtle differences in peptide·lipid complexes, we used two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure of Ac-18A-NH2 bound to DMPC discs. The present studies for the first time show that the peptide helix axis is oriented parallel to the bilayer plane on the edge of the disc. The results also reveal several intermolecular interactions of the hydrophobic amino acid side chains with lipid acyl chains. Based on the results of chemical cross-linking of the Lys residues in the peptides on the disc and molecular modeling, we propose that two amphipathic α helices arranged in an antiparallel fashion cover the lipid acyl chains on the edge of the disc. This is in agreement with our earlier 13C NMR studies of the discoidal complexes of Ac-18A-NH2 and DMPC that indicted that Lys9 and Lys13 residues located on the same side (right side, viewing through the axis of the helix from the N terminus) of the amphipathic α helix have reduced pKa values because of their exposure to a basic microenvironment (16Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Mishra V.K. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9219-9226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis, Purification, and NMR Sample Preparation—The peptide Ac-18A-NH2 was synthesized and purified as described earlier (11Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Phillips M.C. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Tytler E.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Three separate sets of samples were prepared for the NMR studies: (a) perdeuterated DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-d54-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine-1,1,2,2-d4-N,N,N-trimethyl-d9, Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) and peptide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O (100% deuterium oxide, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), (b) protonated DMPC and peptide in 100% D2O, and (c) perdeuterated DMPC and peptide in 100% D2O. To prepare these samples, lyophilized dry peptide was dissolved in methanol. DMPC (either protonated or perdeuterated) was dissolved separately in methanol. Appropriate amounts of peptide and DMPC solutions in methanol were mixed together to obtain a peptide:lipid ratio of 1:1 (w/w). Methanol was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the mixture was lyophilized to remove any residual methanol. To the dry peptide and lipid film, 0.6 ml of 5 mm KH2PO4 (prepared either in H2O or 100% D2O) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The pH of the final solution was 5.5. The final peptide concentration in solution was 3 mm. Size of the Discoidal Peptide·DMPC Complex—Apparent size of the discoidal peptide·DMPC complex was determined using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (BioLogic, DuoFlow, Bio-Rad) and Superose 6 10/300 GL and Superdex 200 10/300 GL columns (Amersham Biosciences) linked in tandem and run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% sodium azide (pH 7.4). Complex elution was monitored using absorbance at 280 nm. The apparent Stokes diameter of the complex was estimated using high and low molecular weight calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences). The void and total volumes of the columns were determined using blue dextran and K3[Fe(CN)6], respectively. The amounts of lipid and peptide in the eluted peak fraction were measured using an enzymatic colorimetric method (Phospholipids B, Wako Chemicals USA, Inc.) and absorbance at 280 nm in the presence of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, respectively. Chemical Cross-linking of the Lys Residues and Tryptic Digestion of Cross-linked Ac-18A-NH2—To the peptide·lipid complex, freshly prepared solution of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) was added to obtain a peptide to cross-linker ratio of 1:4 (mol/mol). After overnight incubation at room temperature, the cross-linked peptide was purified using reverse-phase HPLC. An analytical C18 reverse-phase column (4.6 mm × 25 cm; particle size, 5 μm, Vydac), with a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min using a linear gradient of 25–90% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) during 65 min, was used for separation. Individual fractions collected from HPLC were digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science, 12.5 ng/μl) at 37 °C for 16 h. The peptide fragments were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Perspective Biosciences, Model Voyager-DE2 PRO) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry sequencing (Micromass Q TOF-2). These analyses were performed at the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mass Spectrometric Shared Facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. NMR Measurements and Structure Calculations—All one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance-600 and -500 NMR spectrometers at 37 °C. One-dimensional 31P experiments were run at 202.45 MHz on Avance-500 with sodium phosphate buffer as an external reference set at 0.0 ppm. 50-, 100– and 200-ms mixing times were used in NOESY, and a 100-ms spin-lock time was used in total correlation spectroscopy measurements. Total correlation spectroscopy artifacts in rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy with 200-ms spin-lock time were suppressed by using a train of 180° pulses (17Hwang T.-L. Shaka A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3157-3159Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar). All two-dimensional data sets were collected with 2048 complex t2 points with 512 t1 increments. Time proportional phase incrementation as described by States et al. (18States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) was used for frequency discrimination in the indirect dimension. Chemical shifts were referenced with respect to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (0.0 ppm) used as an internal standard. The NMR data were transferred to a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo work station and processed using the program FELIX (version 2004) (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA). NMR structures were calculated on a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo work station using X-PLOR (on-line) version 3.851. The structure calculation protocol (19Lee W. Moore C.H. Watt D.D. Krishna N.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 218: 89-95Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) involved (a) generation of a “template” coordinate set; (b) bound smoothing, full structure embedding, and regularization to produce a family of 100 distance geometry structures (20Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Brünger A.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 33-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Nilges M. Kuszewski J. Brünger A.T. Hoch J.C. Computational Aspects of the Study of Biological Macromolecules by NMR. Plenum Press, New York1991: 451-455Google Scholar); (c) simulated annealing regularization and refinement for embedded distance geometry structures (20Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Brünger A.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 33-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Nilges M. Kuszewski J. Brünger A.T. Hoch J.C. Computational Aspects of the Study of Biological Macromolecules by NMR.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar); and (d) simulated annealing refinement (20Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Brünger A.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 33-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Average coordinates of the accepted structures were energy-minimized using 200 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization. All the NMR constraints were enforced during energy minimization. Distance and Dihedral Angle Constraints—On the basis of cross-peak intensities in the NOESY spectra, recorded with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms, the NOE distance constraints were classified as follows (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). For NOEs involving intraresidue and sequential NH, αH, and βH protons, a distance constraint of 2.0–2.5 Å for strong, 2.0–3.0 Å for medium, and 2.0–4.0 Å for weak NOEs was used; for medium or long range NOEs involving NH and αH protons, a distance constraint of 2.0–4.0 Å was used; for NOEs involving medium or long range side chain protons, a distance constraint of 2.0–5.0 Å was used. Pseudoatom corrections, where appropriate, were added to the upper distance bounds as described previously (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 24Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Based on the difference (Δδ) in the observed and “coil” NH proton chemical shifts, H-bond (H–O) distances were calculated as described earlier (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 25Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). These H-bond distances were included as additional constraints (26Gibbs A.C. Kondejewski L.H. Gronwald W. Nip A.M. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Wishart D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) during structure calculation. Dihedral angles Φ and Ψ were based on the difference in the observed and coil CαH proton chemical shifts (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 25Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar); a minimum deviation of 40° was allowed in the dihedral constraints. Molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo work station using the program SYBYL (version 7.0) (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The size exclusion profile of the peptide·DMPC complex is shown in Fig. 1. The peptide elutes predominantly as a DMPC complex at the peptide:DMPC ratio used (1:1, w/w or 1:3.3, mol/mol) (Fig. 1). The apparent Stokes diameter of the complex, estimated using high and low molecular weight calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences), is 69 Å (Fig. 1). The lipid to peptide ratio in the peak fraction was determined to be 1.2:1 (w/w). Trypsin digestion of the cross-linked Ac-18A-NH2 on the DMPC discoidal complexes yielded two major products: one in which Lys9 and Lys13 were intramolecularly cross-linked (mass spectral value corresponded to the fragment AFYDKVAEKLK of Ac-18A-NH2 with the addition of 138, corresponding to one cross-linker/molecule of the peptide) and the other in which Lys9 and Lys13 of two neighboring peptides were intermolecularly cross-linked by two bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate molecules as shown in the supplemental material. A combination of total correlation spectroscopy (spectrum not shown) and NOESY spectrum was used to make sequence-specific resonance assignments of the individual amino acids in Ac-18A-NH2 (27Basus V.J.

Sequential dNN(i, i + 1) NOESY cross-peaks for all the residues in Ac-18A-NH2 are identified in Fig. 2A. In addition, dNN(i, i + 2) cross-peaks were observed for Leu3/Ala5 and Lys13/Lys15 pairs and are indicated in Fig. 2A. In Fig. 2B intraresidue HN/CαH NOEs for all the residues in Ac-18A-NH2 are labeled. A number of other long range (i, i + 3 and i, i + 4) NOEs involving side chain protons of the nonpolar amino acid residues (Trp2/Ala5, Trp2/Phe6, Leu3/Tyr7, Phe6/Val10, Tyr7/Val10, Tyr7/Ala11, and Leu14/Phe18) were observed (Fig. 2, A and B). The methyl protons of the N-terminal acetyl protecting group showed NOEs to Asp1 and Trp2 backbone NH protons as well as to the Trp2 aromatic ring proton [2H] (Fig. 2B). In addition, a NOE was observed between the aromatic ring protons of Phe6/Tyr7 (Fig. 2A). The observed (i, i + 1), (i, i + 2), (i, i + 3), and (i, i + 4) NOEs are schematically shown in Fig. 3. For the sequential NOEs, the thickness of the line is in proportion to their intensity (Fig. 3). The NOEs that could not be assigned unambiguously because of the resonance overlap are shown with empty rectangles (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Schematic representation of the observed sequential and long range NOEs. Line thickness for the sequential NOEs is proportional to their measured intensity. Long range NOEs were not classified as strong, medium, or weak.

A periodic (3–4-residue) variation is evident in the case of NH proton chemical shifts (Δδ) (Fig. 4B). The distance and dihedral constraints were used to calculate NMR structures of the peptide associated with DMPC disc. Starting from a set of initial 100 extended structures of Ac-18A-NH2, 62 structures were accepted based on the following criteria: (a) no NOE violations >0.5 Å, (b) no dihedral angle violations >5°, (c) r.m.s. difference for bond deviations from ideality <0.01 Å, and (d) r.m.s. difference for angle deviations from ideality <2°. To obtain the average NMR structure, average coordinates of the 62 accepted structures were energy-minimized. All the distance and the dihedral angle constraints were enforced during the energy minimization of the average coordinates. The structural statistics for the 62 accepted NMR structures and the energy-minimized average structure of Ac-18A-NH2 are summarized in Table 2. The 62 accepted structures were superimposed onto the energy-minimized average structure using MATCH (SYBYL, version 7.0). The program MATCH performs an automatic least squares fit of two molecules that differ only in the coordinates of their atoms. Fig. 5 shows superposition of the Cα atoms of all the 62 accepted structures on the energy-minimized average NMR structure of Ac-18A-NH2.TABLE 2Structural statistics for the 62 accepted (SA) and the energy-minimized average (SAr) NMR structures of Ac-18A-NH2 associated with DMPC discExperimental restraintsIntraresidue NOEs83Sequential NOEs33Medium and long range NOEs (i, i + 2; i, i + 3; and i, i + 4)21Interresidue side chain NOEs66Hydrogen bonds (H–O distance)15Φ angles17ψ angles16Total251Mean r.m.s. deviations from experimental restraints (SA ± S.D.)Distance restraints (Å)0.061 ± 0.002Dihedral angle (°)0.0 ± 0.0Mean r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometry (SA ± S.D.)Bonds (Å)0.0047 ± 0.0004Angles (°)0.711 ± 0.017Impropers (°)0.766 ± 0.021Ramachandran statistics from PROCHECK-NMRaRef. 40Residues in most favored α helical region (%)93.7Residues in additional allowed α helical region (%)6.3R.m.s. deviations from the average structure (Å)Backbone N, Cα, C0.427All heavy atoms1.223Pairwise r.m.s.d.bRoot mean square deviation analysisAverage backbone pairwise r.m.s.d (Å)0.609 ± 0.213cStandard deviationAverage non-hydrogen atom pairwise1.617 ± 0.204cStandard deviationR.m.s.d.

To observe intermolecular NOEs between peptide and lipid protons, NOESY and rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy spectra using three different mixing times of 50, 100, and 200 ms were obtained with the peptide and protonated lipid in 100% D2O. The NOESY spectra were compared with those obtained using perdeuterated DMPC in H2O. Fig. 7 shows an overlay view of the two NOESY spectra obtained using a mixing time of 200 ms. The spectrum obtained with protonated DMPC is shown in black, and that with perdeuterated DMPC is in red. The NOEs that are seen only with protonated DMPC are enclosed in rectangles. The assignments of the observed lipid protons are marked next to the observed NOESY cross-peaks (Fig. 7). Fig. 8A shows the one-dimensional horizontal slices of the NOESY spectrum obtained in the presence of protonated DMPC using a mixing time of 100 ms. The corresponding lipid protons are indicated next to the horizontal slices (Fig. 8A). It was shown previously that peptides homologous to Ac-18A-NH2 also give NOESY cross-peaks between aliphatic protons of the lipid and aromatic protons from the peptide side chains (29Epand R.M.

https://openalex.org/W1989306337,"In Bordetella bronchiseptica, the functional type III secretion system (TTSS) is required for the induction of necrotic cell death in infected mammalian cells. To identify the factor(s) involved in necrotic cell death, type III-secreted proteins from B. bronchiseptica were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. We identified a 69-kDa secreted protein designated BopC. The gene encoding BopC is located outside of the TTSS locus and is also highly conserved in both Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella pertussis. The results of a lactate dehydrogenase release assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling assay demonstrated that BopC is required for necrotic cell death. It has been reported that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (PY) of host cells are dephosphorylated during B. bronchiseptica infection in a TTSS-dependent manner. We found that BopC is also involved in PY dephosphorylation in infected host cells. It appears that the necrotic cell death triggered by BopC occurs prior to the PY reduction in host cells, because Bordetella-induced cell death was not affected even in the presence of a dephosphorylation inhibitor. Furthermore, a translocation assay showed that the signal sequence for both secretion into culture supernatant and translocation into the host cell is located in 48 amino acid residues of the BopC N terminus. This report reveals for the first time that a novel type III effector, BopC, is required for the induction of necrotic cell death during Bordetella infection.

Bordetella pertussis is a causative agent of whooping cough (pertussis) in humans (1Yeh S.H. Expert Rev. Vaccines. 2003; 2: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Heininger U. Stehr K. Schmitt-Grohe S. Lorenz C. Rost R. Christenson P.D. Uberall M. Cherry J.D. Pediatr. Infect Dis. J. 1994; 13: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Bordetella parapertussis is also a cause of whooping cough, and its pathology is generally milder than that of B. pertussis (2Heininger U. Stehr K. Schmitt-Grohe S. Lorenz C. Rost R. Christenson P.D. Uberall M. Cherry J.D. Pediatr. Infect Dis. J. 1994; 13: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Bordetella bronchiseptica is known to be the evolutionary progenitor of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis (3van der Zee A. Mooi F. Van Embden J. Musser J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. bronchiseptica has been isolated from a large number of four-legged animals (4Goodnow R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 722-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and causes kennel cough in dogs (5Foley J.E. Rand C. Bannasch M.J. Norris C.R. Milan J. Prev. Vet. Med. 2002; 54: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and atrophic rhinitis in swine (6Magyar T. King V.L. Kovacs F. Vaccine. 2002; 20: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), although most cases of B. bronchiseptica infection are asymptomatic (7Yoda H. Nakayama K. Nakagawa M. Jikken Dobutsu. 1982; 31: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar). These three Bordetella species colonize the host's respiratory tract.In Bordetella, most virulence factors, such as adhesion factors and toxins, are expressed under the control of a two-component regulatory system composed of BvgA and BvgS (BvgAS system) (8Stibitz S. Aaronson W. Monack D. Falkow S. Nature. 1989; 338: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). BvgS is a sensory histidine kinase and is localized in the bacterial membrane (9Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When the bacteria are situated in conditions resembling the extracellular environment of the host tissue during colonization, BvgS is auto-phosphorylated and transfers its phosphate group to BvgA (10Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated BvgA binds to the upstream of the promoters of specific genes that encode mainly virulence factors, and acts as the transcriptional activator (11Boucher P.E. Stibitz S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6486-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Boucher P.E. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Stibitz S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1755-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Karimova G. Bellalou J. Ullmann A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this way, the activation of the BvgAS system leads the bacteria to the virulent phase. The BvgAS system also positively regulates the expression of a virulence factor secretion system called the type III secretion system (TTSS) 2The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; SS, Stainer and Scholte; BG, Bordet and Gengou;MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; ORF, open reading frame; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PY, tyrosine-phosphorylated protein; F-actin, filamentous actin; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase.2The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; SS, Stainer and Scholte; BG, Bordet and Gengou;MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; ORF, open reading frame; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PY, tyrosine-phosphorylated protein; F-actin, filamentous actin; aa, amino acid(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase. (14Yuk M.H. Harvill E.T. Miller J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The TTSS is highly conserved in a number of Gram-negative bacteria and functions as the injector of virulence proteins, so-called effectors, to the host cell (reviewed in Ref. 15Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, functional TTSS is required for the formation of the pedestal-like structure beneath the bacterial adhesion site in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (16Frankel G. Phillips A.D. Rosenshine I. Dougan G. Kaper J.B. Knutton S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and for the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells in Shigella (17Sasakawa C. Kamata K. Sakai T. Makino S. Yamada M. Okada N.

If these pathogens are deficient in the TTSS function, their virulence is greatly reduced, indicating that TTSS is one of the major mechanisms for exerting their pathogenicity. In general, the bacteria possessing TTSS exploit several effectors to achieve infection. In EPEC, seven effectors, Tir, EspG, Orf3, EspF, EspH, Map, and Cif, have been identified (19Kaper J.B.

Thus, effector variations provide different pathological features among bacterial infection.In B. bronchiseptica, the functional TTSS is required for the induction of cytotoxicity, including necrotic cell death, in cultured mammalian cells during infection (25Stockbauer K.E. Foreman-Wykert A.K. Miller J.F. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, B. bronchiseptica with TTSS deficiency failed at long term colonization of trachea of rats (14Yuk M.H. Harvill E.T. Miller J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and mice (26Yuk M.H. Harvill E.T. Cotter P.A. Miller J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting that TTSS also has important roles in Bordetella pathogenicity. Four type III-secreted proteins, BopB, BopD, BopN, and Bsp22, have been identified in Bordetella (26Yuk M.H. Harvill E.T. Cotter P.A. Miller J.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Kuwae A. Ohishi M. Watanabe M. Nagai M. Abe A. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that BopB and BopD make a complex and form pores on the host plasma membrane as a conduit of effectors (28Nogawa H. Kuwae A. Matsuzawa T. Abe A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3806-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, no proteins have been characterized as definite type III effectors in Bordetella. Here, we identified and characterized a novel type III effector, BopC, in Bordetella.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Cell Culture, and Media—The wild-type strain used in this study was B. bronchiseptica S798 (27Kuwae A. Ohishi M. Watanabe M. Nagai M. Abe A. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The type III secretion mutant (type III-) and BopB mutant (ΔBopB) were derived from S798 (27Kuwae A. Ohishi M. Watanabe M. Nagai M. Abe A. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bordetella strains were cultured in Stainer and Scholte (SS) liquid medium with a starting A600 of 0.2, and the inoculum was prepared from fresh colonies grown on Bordet and Gengou (BG) agar as described previously (29Cotter P.A.

For the infection assay, B. bronchiseptica strains cultured for 18 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking were used. E. coli DH10B, MC1061, and SM10λpir were used as hosts for the construction of various plasmids. L2 cells (ATCC CCL-149) were maintained in F-12K (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, and HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were maintained in minimum essential medium Eagle (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651) and 293T (32Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11766-11777Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, after SDS-PAGE, protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and excised from the gels. The resulting gel pieces were treated with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol. After alkylation by iodoacetamide, the proteins were digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the resulting samples were analyzed by the Voyager-DE PRO MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) or Q-Tof 2 (Micromass). To retrieve the amino acid sequence of proteins analyzed by mass spectrometry, all speculative open reading frames (ORFs) were picked up from the genomic sequence obtained from the B. bronchiseptica Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute (ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/bb/) (34Parkhill J.

The resulting PCR product was cloned into pDONR201 to obtain pDONR-bopC using the adaptor PCR method in the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). Then, inverse PCR was carried out with the primers R1-bopC (5′-CGGGATCCTTACCGCGGCCTGTCCGGCGTTC-3′) and R2-bopC (5′-CGGGATCCGCCTGCTCGAGCCGAACAACGAC-3′) using circular pDONR-bopC as the template.

The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and self-ligated to obtain pDONR-ΔbopC, which contained a 178-bp deletion around the 5′ region of the bopC. pDONR-ΔbopC was mixed with pABB-CRS2 to obtain pABB-ΔbopC using the Gateway cloning system. pABB-ΔbopC was then introduced into E. coli SM10λpir and was transconjugated into the B. bronchiseptica S798 (streptomycin-resistant), as described previously (36Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4310-4317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting mutant strain was designated ΔBopC.Construction of Plasmid for Gene Expression in Bordetella and Mammalian Cells—A vector used for the gene expression in Bordetella, pRK415 R4-R3-F, was constructed as follows. A 1.8-kbp fragment containing attR4, ccdB, the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene, and attR3 was amplified by PCR with the primers HindIII-R4-R3-F (5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′) and HindIII-R4-R3-R (5′-CCCAAGCTTGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTT-3′) using pDEST R4-R3 (Invitrogen) as the template. The underlined portions indicate the HindIII sites. This fragment was digested with HindIII and then inserted into the HindIII site in pRK415 (37Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene. 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, in which the ccdB is oriented in the opposite direction from the lac promoter in pRK415, was designated pRK415 R4-R3-F. To insert the fha promoter region into pDONR P4-P1R (Invitrogen), a 0.5-kbp fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers B4F-fhaP (5′-ATAGAAAAGTTGTCCTTTTCCATCAGGACCCG-3′) and B1R-fhaP(5′-TGTACAAACTTGATTCCGACCAGCGAAGTGAA-3′) using B. bronchiseptica S798 genomic DNA as the template. This PCR product was cloned into the vector by means of adaptor PCR and site-specific recombination techniques using the Gateway cloning system. The resulting plasmid was designated pDONR-fhaP. Likewise, to insert the rrnB terminator region into pDONR P2R-P3 (Invitrogen), a 0.4-kbp fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers B2F-rrnB (5′-TGTACAAAGTGGGGCTGTTTTGGCGGATG-3′) and B3R-rrnB (5′-ATAATAAAGTTGAAACAAAAAGAGTTTGTAGAAACG-3′) using pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) as the template. This PCR product was cloned into the vector, and the resulting plasmid was designated pDONR-rrnB.For the complementation of the bopC defect in ΔBopC, pBopC was constructed as follows. A 2.3-kbp fragment encoding BopC was amplified by PCR with the primers B1-bopC-comp (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGGTCACATATGCTGACCT-3′) and B2-bopC-comp (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCCGTGTTCTGGATTCCC-3′) using B. bronchiseptica S798 genomic DNA as the template. The resulting fragment was cloned once into pDONR201, designated pDONR-bopC-comp. To control the transcription of the bopC gene by the fha promoter and rrnB terminator in Bordetella, pDONR-fhaP, pDONR-bopC-comp, pDONR-rrnB, and pRK415 R4-R3-F were mixed and treated with LR Clonase Plus (Invitrogen) to clone the fha promoter, bopC gene, and rrnB terminator into pRK415 R4-R3-F using the MultiSite Gateway system (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid was designated pBopC.To construct the plasmids encoding the TEM-1-fused protein, we cloned bopC, bcrH2, and map genes into pCX340 (38Charpentier X. Oswald E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Then, 2.2-, 0.5-, and 0.7-kbp fragments encoding BopC, BcrH2, and Map, respectively, were amplified by PCR with the following primer sets. For bopC: bopC-pCX340-NdeI (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGTCACATATGCTGACCTC-3′) and bopC-pCX340-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCTGCGCGTAGATTCAGCGCCG-3′); for bcrH2: bcrH2-pCX340-NdeI (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCAGGCGGTGTAGCGCCG-3′) and bcrH2-pCX340-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCCTCCGGATGTGAAACTGAAATAAG-3′); the primer sets for both of these genes used B. bronchiseptica S798 genomic DNA as the template. Finally, for map: map-pCX340-NdeI (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCGTTTTATTTTTATAGGTG-3′) and map-pCX340-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCCAGCCGAGTATCCTGCACATTG-3′) using EPEC E2348/69 (39Levine M.M. Nataro J.P. Karch H.

The underlined portions indicate the cleavage sites of the restriction enzyme (NdeI or KpnI). These three fragments were digested with NdeI and KpnI. They were then ligated with pCX340 digested with NdeI and KpnI. The resulting plasmids were designated as pCX-BopC, pCX-BcrH2, and pCX-Map, respectively. To obtain a fragment containing a different gene fused with bla (encoding β-lactamase; TEM-1) and bla alone, 3.1-, 1.4-, 1.5-, and 0.9-kbp fragments were amplified by PCR with the following primer sets: B1-bopC-comp (see above) and B2-bla-pCX340 (5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTG-3′); B1-bcrH2-comp (5′-AAAAGCAGGCTCAGGCGGTGTAGCGCCGGG-3′) and B2-bla-pCX340; B1-map-bla (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTCGTTTTATTTTTATAGGTGTAAATG-3′) and B2-bla-pCX340; and B1-bla-pCX340 (5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTCATATGGGAAGCTTGGGTAC-3′) and B2-bla-pCX340 using pCX-BopC, pCX-BcrH2, pCX-Map, and pCX340 circular DNA as the template, respectively. The resulting fragments were cloned once into pDONR201 and designated as pDONR-bopC-bla, pDONR-bcrH2-bla, pDONR-map-bla, and pDONR-bla, respectively. To obtain the plasmid encoding truncated versions of BopC fused with TEM-1, inverse PCR was performed with the primer sets bopC-N1-bla-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCGCCCGAGACCTCGGCGCTGG-3′) for 448 aa residues of the BopC N terminus fused with TEM-1, bopC-N2-bla-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCTTCCTGCGCCCGCTGCAAAGC-3′) for 248 aa residues of the BopC N terminus fused with TEM-1, or bopC-N3-bla-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCGCTGGCCACGCTGCGCACG-3′) for 48 aa residues of the BopC N terminus fused with TEM-1; and bla-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCTCCGCGGAGAATTCGCACCC-3′) using pDONR-bopC-bla circular DNA as the template. The underlined portions indicate the KpnI sites. The resulting fragments were digested with KpnI and were then these fragments were self-ligated. The resulting plasmids were designated pDONR-bopC-N1-bla, pDONR-bopC-N2-bla, and pDONR-bopC-N3-bla, respectively. pDONR-bopC-bla, pDONR-bopC-N1-bla, pDONR-bopC-N2-bla, pDONR-bopC-N3-bla, pDONR-bcrH2-bla, pDONR-map-bla, or pDONR-bla was mixed with pDONR-fhaP, pDONR-rrnB, and pRK415 R4-R3-F, and then genes encoding TEM-1-fused protein were cloned into pRK415 R4-R3-F by means of the MultiSite Gateway system as described above. The resulting plasmids were designated pBopC-FL-TEM-1, pBopC-N1-TEM-1, pBopC-N2-TEM-1, pBopC-N3-TEM-1, pBcrH2-TEM-1, pMap-TEM-1, and pTEM-1, respectively.To clone the bopC gene into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1/His(-)A (Invitrogen), 2.0-kbp fragments encoding BopC were amplified by PCR with the primers pcDNA-BopC-U (5′-GAAGATCTGACATGGTGAGCAACAACGTCAATCC-3′) and pcDNA-BopC-L (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCATGCGCGTAGATTCAGCG-3′) using B. bronchiseptica S798 genomic DNA as the template. The underlined portions indicate the cleavage sites of the restriction enzyme (BglII or HindIII). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BglII and HindIII and then ligated with pcDNA3.1/His(-)A digested with BamHI and HindIII to obtain pcDNA-BopC.Preparation of Proteins from Culture Supernatant and Whole Bacterial Cells—The proteins released into bacterial culture supernatants and whole bacterial cell lysates were prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The culture supernatants were filtered, and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in distilled water. Trichloroacetic acid was then added to each sample at a final concentration of 10%. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min. The resulting precipitated proteins were dissolved in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Preparation of Antibodies—To prepare the anti-BopC antibodies, the peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 62–80 (CKHDVRQFQASGDRSLQQLR) or 569–586 (CSQLDHDAKTSGNESQLNR) of BopC (a cysteine residue was added to each peptide at the N terminus for cross-link with the carrier protein) were conjugated separately with hemocyanin from keyhole limpets (Sigma) by using 3-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma). These cross-linked peptides were used to immunize rabbits, and the resulting antisera were incubated with each peptide immobilized on epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain specific immunoglobulin fractions. The mixture of these purified anti-BopC antibodies was used for immunoblot assays.Infection Assays—L2 cells seeded on coverslips were infected with bacteria at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 200 and then were centrifuged for 5 min and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in methanol. Fixed cells were stained with Giemsa solution. In the case of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, 4% paraformaldehyde was used as the reagent for fixation. The TUNEL assay was performed by using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science). To examine the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from B. bronchiseptica-infected cells, 7.5 × 104 HeLa cells seeded on 24-well plates were infected at an m.o.i. of 100. They were then centrifuged for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The amounts of LDH were measured spectrophotometrically using a CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega). To calculate the percentage of non-viable cells, 3 × 105 HeLa cells seeded on 6-well plates were infected as in the LDH assay described above. After 60 min of infection, cells were washed with cold PBS twice, and then PBS containing 1 mm EDTA was added to the wells. After 15 min of incubation at 4 °C, the cells were detached from substrata using a Pasteur pipette, and then the cell suspensions were centrifuged. The cells were resuspended with PBS containing 0.04% trypan blue and the resulting stained cells were counted under a microscope using a hemocytometer. Staurosporine (Sigma) was used for inducing apoptosis at a final concentration of 2.5 mm.Hemolytic Assay—The measurement of type III-dependent hemolytic activity was carried out as described previously (35Sekiya K. Ohishi M. Ogino T. Tamano K. Sasakawa C. Abe A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11638-11643Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial pellets from overnight cultures and rabbit red blood cells were washed with PBS and adjusted to 5 × 1010 bacteria/ml and 3 × 109 cells/ml with PBS, respectively. The suspensions were mixed together (50-μl aliquots per suspension) on a 96-well plate and centrifuged for 5 min for close contact; the combined suspension was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. The bacteria-red blood cell suspensions were gently resuspended with an additional 100 μl of PBS, and then the plate was centrifuged. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh plate, where the optical density at 492 nm was measured.Detection of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins (PY) in Host Cells—The protocol of immunofluorescence staining has been described elsewhere (40Suzuki T. Miki H. Takenawa T. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2767-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected with bacteria as mentioned above. When sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) was used to inhibit of phosphatase activity, this reagent was added to the extracellular medium at a final concentration of 1 mm during infection. After the fixation, PY were stained with anti-PY monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). As a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was used. Filamentous actin (F-actin) was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Bacteria were stained with anti-B. bronchiseptica antisera (Denka Seiken). To detect PY in HeLa cells infected with bacteria by immunoblot assay, infected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times, and then the cells were treated with lysis buffer (41Kuwae A. Yoshida S. Tamano K. Mimuro H. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32230-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were sonicated for 30 s and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were then separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% gel and immunoblotted with anti-PY antibody RC20 (BD Biosciences) or anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon).Effector Translocation Assay—HeLa cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate, and then the plate was incubated at 37 °C overnight in a CO2 incubator. HeLa cells were exposed to B. bronchiseptica for 60 min at an m.o.i. of 1000. The infected cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma), and then cells were stained with CCF2-AM solution according to the manufacturer's protocol for the GeneBLAzer In Vivo Detection Kit (Invitrogen). The stained cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope using a filter set for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Zeiss).Transfection Assay—HeLa, COS-7, or 293T cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate, and then the plate was incubated at 37 °C overnight in a CO2 incubator. Mock vector or pcDNA-BopC was introduced into the cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation for 18 h in a CO2 incubator, the amounts of LDH released into the extracellular media were measured as described above.RESULTSBopC Is a Novel Secreted Protein via the Bordetella TTSS—The B. bronchiseptica wild-type and type III- strains were cultured in SS medium for 18 h, and the supernatant proteins were recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. These samples were separated by SDS-PAGE with 6% or 12% gel, then"

The Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins, the eukaryotic RecA orthologs, promote strand exchange and may function in the extensive matching of homology within paired DNA molecules. In the present study, we purified the human TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 complex and found that it significantly stimulates the Dmc1- and Rad51-mediated strand exchange. The human Hop2-Mnd1 complex preferentially binds to a three-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate. These findings are consistent with genetic data, which showed that the Hop2 and Mnd1 proteins are required for homology matching between homologous chromosomes. Therefore, the human TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 complex may ensure proper pairing between homologous chromosomes through its stimulation of strand exchange during meiosis.

In meiosis, a high level of homologous recombination occurs only between homologous chromosomes but not between sister chromatids. This meiotic homologous recombination is initiated by the formation of a double strand break (DSB), 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; h, human; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; JM, joint molecule; NC, nicked circular dsDNA; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. which is introduced by the SPO11 protein (1Keeney S.

On the other hand, in mitosis, homologous recombination functions to repair DSBs, which are introduced by DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation, DNA cross-linking reagents, oxidative stress, and replication errors. This mitotic homologous recombination repair mainly occurs between sister chromatids or between the abundant intra- and inter-chromosomal homologous repeat sequences. After the DSB formation, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail derived from a DSB site invades the homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). This strand-invasion step, called homologous pairing, primes heteroduplex formation, in which new Watson-Crick base pairs are formed between the invading strand and its complementary strand of parental dsDNA. Then, the heteroduplex region is expanded by the subsequent strand-exchange step. This strand-exchange step may be important for the extensive matching of homology between paired chromosomes to ensure that homologous recombination occurs between the proper partners. The Escherichia coli RecA protein is known to catalyze the homologous pairing and strand-exchange steps (4Shibata T. DasGupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetic studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Arabidopsis thaliana have identified the HOP2, meu13+, and AHP2 genes, respectively, as being essential for meiotic homologous recombination (15Leu J.-Y.

The hop2 deletion mutant in S. cerevisiae fails to sporulate, due to a uniform arrest at the pachytene stage of meiosis I (15Leu J.-Y. Chua P.R. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The TBPIP/Hop2 knock-out mice also display meiotic cell cycle arrest, due to the failure of DSB repair (20Petukhova G.V. Romanienko P.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the hop2 deletion mutant cells, most of the chromosomes are engaged in synapsis with nonhomologous partners but not with homologous chromosomes (15Leu J.-Y. Chua P.R. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Hop2 protein functions to align homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The S. cerevisiae Hop2 protein reportedly forms a complex with the Mnd1 protein, which has been identified as a multicopy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive hop2 mutant allele (21Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae MND1 gene and its S. pombe ortholog, mcp7+, are also required for meiotic recombination (21Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Mol. Cell.

Biochemical analyses also revealed that the yeast and mouse Hop2 (TBPIP/Hop2) and Mnd1 proteins form a complex that can stimulate the strand-invasion step promoted by their cognate Dmc1 proteins (24Chen Y.-K.

In the present study, we found that the purified human TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 complex (hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1) significantly stimulates the Dmc1- or Rad51-mediated strand exchange, which may be required for the extensive matching of homology within homologous chromosomes. Therefore, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 may function in the strand-exchange step, which occurs just after homologous pairing, to ensure that the correct partner is involved in meiotic homologous recombination. Overexpression and Purification of the Human TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 Complex—The human TBPIP/Hop2 gene was previously cloned as a homologue of the mouse TBPIP gene (18Ijichi H. Tanaka T. Nakamura T. Yagi H. Hakuba A. Sato M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka T. Nakamura T. Takagi H. Sato M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The human Mnd1 gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_032117) was cloned from a human testis cDNA pool (Clontech). The human TBPIP/Hop2 and Mnd1 genes were ligated into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the pET15b and pET11a vectors, respectively. Then, the pET11a vector containing the Mnd1 gene was digested with BglII and BamHI, and the resulting Mnd1-containing fragment was ligated into the BamHI site of the TBPIP/Hop2-containing pET15b vector. In this construct, the human Mnd1 protein (hMnd1) and the N-terminally His6-tagged human TBPIP/Hop2 protein (hTBPIP/Hop2) were coexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). The cells expressing both hMnd1 and hTBPIP/Hop2 were grown at 37 °C in 10 liters of LB medium, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At the logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.6), both hTBPIP/Hop2 and hMnd1 were produced in the presence of 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). Then, the cells were harvested after a 4 h incubation at 37 °C and were disrupted by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics)) on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 27,700 × g for 20 min, and then the proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with 0.24 g/ml ammonium sulfate (40% saturation). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 27,700 × g for 20 min, and the proteins in the supernatant were further precipitated by the addition of 0.13 g/ml ammonium sulfate (60% saturation). The precipitate was dissolved in 30 ml of buffer A and was gently mixed with 4 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C. The Ni-NTA-agarose beads bound to the His6-tagged hTBPIP/Hop2 protein were packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 20-column volumes of buffer A containing 7 mm imidazole, at a flow rate of about 0.3 ml/min. The His6-tagged hTBPIP/Hop2 protein complexed with the hMnd1 protein was eluted in a 15-column volume linear gradient from 7 to 400 mm imidazole in buffer A. The His6 tag was uncoupled from the hTBPIP/Hop2 portion by a digestion with 1 unit of thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) per mg of the hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins. After the thrombin treatment, the hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins were immediately dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) for more than 12 h at 4 °C. The hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins were loaded onto a 6-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column previously equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 10-column volumes of buffer B, and the proteins were eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.2 m NaCl in buffer B. The peak fractions of the hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins were dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 mm EDTA). The hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column were loaded onto a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer C. The purified hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins were eluted from the Superdex 200 column with buffer C, at a flow rate of about 0.8 ml/min. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The Human Replication Protein A (RPA), Dmc1, and Rad51 Proteins—The human replication protein A (RPA) was purified as described previously (26Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human Dmc1 and Rad51 proteins (hDmc1 and hRad51, respectively) were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and were purified to homogeneity as described previously (27Kinebuchi T.

The His6 tags of these proteins were removed by thrombin protease digestion during the purification process. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. DNA Substrates—In the D-loop formation assay, alkaline treatment of the cells harboring the plasmid DNA was avoided, to prevent the dsDNA substrates from undergoing irreversible denaturation. Instead, the cells were gently lysed using Sarkosyl, as described previously (29Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35201-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pGsat4 DNA was created by inserting a 198-base pair fragment of the human α-satellite sequence into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) (30Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto-Sasanuma M. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods (Orlando). 2004; 33: 3-11Google Scholar). For the ssDNA substrate used in the D-loop assay, the following high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified oligonucleotide was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. SAT-1 (50-mer, 5′-ATT TCA TGC TAG ACA GAA GAA TTC TCA GTA ACT TCT TTG TGC TGT GTG TA-3′). The 5′ ends of the oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. The DNA substrates used in the competitive DNA binding assay were identical to those in the synthetic Holliday junction (I) designed by Iwasaki et al. (31Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The DNA substrates containing the three-stranded DNA branch, the Y-form DNA, and the single-stranded oligonucleotide were produced with three 49-mer single-stranded oligonucleotides, 1, 2, and 3, with the sequences 5′-ATCGA TGTCT CTAGA CAGCT GCTCA GGATT GATCT GTAAT GGCCT GGGA-3′, 5′-GTCCC AGGCC ATTAC AGATC AATCC TGAGC ATGTT TACCA AGCGC ATTG-3′, and 5′-TGATC ACTTG CTAGC GTCGC AATCC TGAGC AGCTG TCTAG AGACA TCGA-3′, respectively. The three-stranded DNA branch substrate contained a 12-bp mobile region at the center, and the Y-form DNA substrate was composed of a 30-bp duplex region and two single-stranded tails (18 and 19 bp). All of the oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC, and the DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. The DNA Binding Assay with ssDNA and dsDNA—The φX174 circular ssDNA (40 μm; 5,386 bases) and the PstI-linearized φX174 dsDNA (40 μm; 5,386 base pairs) (New England Biolabs) were mixed with hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μm) in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA) buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 2 h. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Competitive DNA Binding Assays with the Three-stranded DNA Branch, the Y-form DNA, and the Single-stranded Oligonucleotides— The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 1 (0.16 μm) was mixed with the unlabeled oligonucleotides 2 (0.16 μm) and 3 (0.16 μm), and the 32P-labeled DNA substrates containing the three-stranded DNA branch, the Y-form DNA, and the single-stranded oligonucleotide were produced by annealing. The DNA sample used in this assay contained the three-stranded DNA branch, the Y-form DNA, and the single-stranded oligonucleotide at 1:2.2:2.9 ratios. The indicated amounts of hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 were incubated with the DNA substrates (total 64 nm) at 37°C for 10 min in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm creatine phosphate, and 75 μg/ml creatine kinase. The products were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1 × TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA) and were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-1 instrument. The hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 proteins (0.5 mg/ml) were spun in a Beckman An-50Ti rotor with a 6-sector centerpiece. Equilibrium distributions were analyzed after 20 h of centrifugation at 9,000 rpm and 20 °C. For the molecular weight analysis, a partial specific volume of 0.675 cm3/g and a solution density of 1 g/cm3 were used. Size Exclusion Chromatography— hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 (100 μm, 500 μl), hDmc1 (50 μm, 500 μl), and hRad51 (24 μm, 300 μl) were subjected to Superdex 200 HR 10/300 GL chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. In the experiments with hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 and hDmc1, or hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 and hRad51, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 was incubated with hDmc1 or hRad51 at 4 °C with a hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1:hDmc1 or hRad51 ratio of 2:1. The ATPase Assay—The ATPase activities of the proteins were analyzed by the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP. The proteins were mixed with 40 μm φX174 linear dsDNA or 40 μm φX174 circular ssDNA, in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 0.1 mm ATP, 5 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The protein concentrations were 6.5 μm for hDmc1 and hRad51 and 0.2 or 1.3 μm for hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the products were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose in a 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid solution. The D-loop Formation Assay—The hDmc1 protein (6.5 μm) and 32P-labeled SAT-1 ssDNA (1.4 μm) were incubated in 80 μl of the standard reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm creatine phosphate, and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase), at 37 °C for 3 min, and the supercoiled pGsat4 (3,218 bp) (181 μm) DNA, which had been incubated with hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 (0.2 μm) at 37 °C for 3 min, was added to the reaction mixture. After incubations at 37 °C for the indicated times, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5% SDS and 883 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics), followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. After 6-fold loading dye was added, and the products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA) at 3.3 V/cm for 2 h. The bands were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. The Strand-exchange Assay—The hDmc1 (15 μm) or hRad51 (10 μm) protein was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with 30 μm φX174 circular ssDNA in the presence of the indicated amounts of hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1, in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm creatine phosphate, and 75 μg/ml creatine kinase. After this incubation, 2 μm RPA and 0.2 m KCl were added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then, the reactions were initiated by the addition of 30 μm φX174 linear dsDNA and were continued for 1 h. To eliminate the salt effect from the storage buffer for the proteins, in the protein titration experiments, the salt concentrations (NaCl and KCl) of the reaction mixtures were adjusted to be the same in all reactions. For the time course experiments, the concentrations of hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 were 0.5 μm for hDmc1 and 2 μm for hRad51. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS and 1.82 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) and were further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After 6-fold loading dye was added, the deproteinized reaction products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 3 h. The products were visualized by ethidium bromide, which was added to the gel and the running buffer (0.5 μg/ml). Purification of the Human TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 Complex—To obtain the purified human TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 complex, we constructed a hTBPIP/Hop2 and hMnd1 co-expression system, in which the human TBPIP/Hop2 and Mnd1 genes were tandemly ligated into the pET15b vector (Novagen). In this system, hTBPIP/Hop2 was produced as a fusion protein, with an N-terminal His6 tag containing a cleavage site for thrombin protease, while hMnd1 was expressed without any additional sequence. Both hMnd1 and His6-tagged hTBPIP/Hop2 were overexpressed in the E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) strain by an induction with IPTG (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). hMnd1 co-eluted with His6-tagged hTBPIP/Hop2 from a Ni2+ chelating column (Ni-NTA-agarose, Qiagen) (Fig. 1A, lane 6), indicating that hMnd1 and hTBPIP/Hop2 formed a complex, like the yeast and mouse homologues (24Chen Y.-K. Leng C.-H. Olivares H. Lee M.-H. Chang Y.-C. Kung W.-M. Ti S.-C. Lo Y.-H. Wang A.H.-J. Chang C.-S. Bishop D.K. Hsugh Y.-P. Wang T.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Petukhova G.V. Pezza R.J. Vanevski F. Ploquin M. Masson J.Y. Camerini-Otero R.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The His6 tag was uncoupled with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) from the hTBPIP/Hop2 portion (Fig. 1A, lane 7), and the hTB-PIP/Hop2 and hMnd1 proteins were further purified by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9). The hTBPIP/Hop2 and hMnd1 proteins co-purified through all of the purification steps in about 1:1 stoichiometry, and no fraction containing hTBPIP/Hop2 or hMnd1 alone was found in any chromatographic step, indicating that these proteins formed a stable complex. Purified hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 bound to both ssDNA and dsDNA (data not shown). A competitive DNA binding experiment with circular ssDNA and linearized dsDNA showed that hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 preferentially bound to dsDNA (Fig. 1B). This DNA binding property of hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 is the same as that of the yeast (S. cerevisiae) Hop2-Mnd1 complex containing the C-terminally His6-tagged Mnd1 protein (24Chen Y.-K. Leng C.-H. Olivares H. Lee M.-H. Chang Y.-C. Kung W.-M. Ti S.-C. Lo Y.-H. Wang A.H.-J. Chang C.-S. Bishop D.K. Hsugh Y.-P. Wang T.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the mouse TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 complex containing the C-terminally His6-tagged TBPIP/Hop2 protein reportedly binds to ssDNA and dsDNA without any preference (25Petukhova G.V. Pezza R.J. Vanevski F. Ploquin M. Masson J.Y. Camerini-Otero R.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that the DNA binding properties of the human and mouse TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 complexes may be somewhat different. The apparent molecular mass of hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 was estimated by analytical ultracentrifugation (∼49 kDa) and gel filtration chromatography (∼47 kDa) (Fig. 1, C and D). Therefore, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 is a heterodimer, with a molecular mass of 49 kDa (25 kDa for hTBPIP/Hop2 and 24 kDa for hMnd1). The gel filtration analyses also indicated that hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 did not affect the Dmc1- and Rad51-polymer formation, when it was mixed with Dmc1 or Rad51 (Fig. 1D). hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 Stimulates Homologous Pairing Mediated by hDmc1—Next, we tested whether hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 stimulates the homologous pairing promoted by hDmc1, like the yeast and mouse orthologs (24Chen Y.-K. Leng C.-H. Olivares H. Lee M.-H. Chang Y.-C. Kung W.-M. Ti S.-C. Lo Y.-H. Wang A.H.-J. Chang C.-S. Bishop D.K. Hsugh Y.-P. Wang T.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Petukhova G.V. Pezza R.J. Vanevski F. Ploquin M. Masson J.Y. Camerini-Otero R.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The D-loop formation assay was employed to test the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing (Fig. 2A). In this assay, hDmc1 formed D-loops within 5 min, and the D-loops were dissociated by the subsequent strand exchange promoted by hDmc1 (Fig. 2, B and D). hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 itself did not promote D-loop formation (Fig. 2C, lane 3, and D) but significantly stimulated the Dmc1-mediated D-loop formation (Fig. 2, B–D). In the experiments presented here, 0.2 μm hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 was used to detect stimulation of the Dmc1-mediated D-loop formation in the presence of 6.5 μm hDmc1. Therefore, the stimulation of the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing by hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 may be catalytic. Interestingly, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 significantly enhanced the D-loop yield, but it did not inhibit the D-loop dissociation (Fig. 2, C and D). This observation suggests that the hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 complex may stimulate strand exchange, in addition to homologous pairing. hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 Stimulates the Strand-exchange Reaction Mediated by hDmc1 and hRad51—We next performed a strand-exchange assay to test whether hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 stimulates strand exchange, which occurs just after homologous pairing. The φX174 phage circular ssDNA (5,386 bases) and the linearized φX174 dsDNA (5,386 base pairs) were used as DNA substrates (Fig. 3A). The strand-exchange reactions were conducted in the presence of human RPA (2 μm). In this assay, two reaction products were detected: a joint molecule between ssDNA and dsDNA (JM) and a nicked circular DNA (NC). The JM is a reaction intermediate containing an incomplete strand-exchange product (Fig. 3A, left to center). On the other hand, the NC is a complete strand-exchange product, whose formation is mediated by the extensive strand-exchange activity of Dmc1 or Rad51 (Fig. 3A, center to right). The strand exchange must be promoted over a span of five thousand base pairs, to form the NC product with the DNA substrates used in this assay. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 significantly enhanced the NC yield in the Dmc1-mediated strand-exchange reaction, indicating that this complex stimulates the strand exchange promoted by hDmc1. Robust enhancement of the NC yield was detected in the presence of 0.5 or 1 μm hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 with 15 μm hDmc1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6, and C). At this optimal hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 concentration, the decrease in the JM yield was concomitant with the increase in the NC yield, suggesting that hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 stimulates the conversion from JM to NC in the Dmc1-mediated strand-exchange reaction (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 also stimulated the strand-exchange promoted by hRad51 (Fig. 3, D and E). In both the Dmc1-mediated and Rad51-mediated reactions, NC formation was inhibited in the presence of an excess amount of hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 (Fig. 3, B–E). Time course experiments showed that the NC yield by the Dmc1- and Rad51-mediated reactions was significantly stimulated by hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 at the early reaction times (10–30 min) (Fig. 3, F and G). Since the Dmc1- and Rad51-mediated strand exchange is an ATP-dependent reaction, we tested whether hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 enhances the ATP hydrolyzing abilities of hDmc1 and hRad51. As shown in Fig. 4, the ATP hydrolyzing abilities of Dmc1 and Rad51 were observed in the presence of ssDNA or dsDNA. However, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 did not enhance the DNA-dependent ATP hydrolyzing abilities of hDmc1 and hRad51 (Fig. 4). hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 Preferentially Binds to a Three-stranded DNA Branch—We next tested the DNA binding specificity of hTB-PIP/Hop2-hMnd1. A competitive DNA binding assay with a 49-mer three-stranded DNA branch, which mimics an intermediate for strand exchange, a 49-mer Y-form DNA (a two-stranded DNA branch), and a 49-mer ssDNA, was performed. Intriguingly, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 preferentially bound to the three-stranded DNA branch rather than the Y-form DNA (Fig. 5, A and B). hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 also preferred to bind the Y-form DNA rather than the canonical dsDNA (data not shown), indicating that it has a binding preference for the branched DNA structure. These findings support the idea that hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 preferentially binds to the three-stranded DNA branch to stimulate the JM-NC conversion during the strand-exchange process promoted by the Dmc1 and Rad51 proteins. At the beginning of homologous recombination, an ssDNA tail derived from a DSB site invades the homologous dsDNA. This initial strand-invasion step is called homologous pairing. Just after homologous pairing, the heteroduplex region produced by homologous pairing is expanded by strand exchange. These two homologous pairing and strand-exchange steps may play distinct roles. Homologous pairing mediates the initial contact in a short tract and may be important for finding homologous sequences between chromosomes. Only short homologous sequences are required for homologous pairing. In fact, bacterial RecA promotes homologous pairing with short oligonucleotides (32Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S.

Biol. 1993; 229: 328-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and as shown in the present and previous studies, Rad51 and Dmc1 also promote homologous pairing with short oligonucleotides (34Maeshima K. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Gupta R.C. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These short homologous sequences are frequently found between nonhomologous chromosomes, such as repetitive DNA sequences (39Kato A. Lamb J.C. Birchler J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). On the other hand, strand exchange is required to search for extensive spans of homology between paired DNA molecules, by extension of the heteroduplex region. Rad51 is known to promote strand exchange between circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA substrates in the presence of RPA and ATP (12Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 13Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the human Dmc1 protein also promotes strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA and ATP (14Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The strand-exchange activities of Dmc1 and Rad51 may function to search for extensive DNA homology around the homologous pairing site and may play an essential role to ensure the correct pairing between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In the present study, we found that hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 significantly stimulates the strand exchange mediated by hDmc1 or hRad51. This finding suggests that hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 functions in the search for extensive homology between homologous chromosomes, through its strand-exchange stimulation activity. This idea is consistent with the genetic analysis of the S. cerevisiae hop2Δ strain. In this strain, the absence of the Hop2 protein leads to pairing between nonhomologous chromosomes, but not between homologous chromosomes, during meiosis (15Leu J.-Y. Chua P.R. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This inappropriate chromosome pairing in the hop2Δ strain may be due to a defect in the extensive homology search along paired chromosomes by the Dmc1- and/or Rad51-mediated strand exchange. These biochemical and genetic studies indicated that TBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 is important for the proper alignment of homologous chromosomes, probably through its stimulation of strand exchange. The hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 complex also stimulates the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing. Previously, the yeast and mouse Hop2 (TBPIP/Hop2)-Mnd1 complexes were shown to promote the stimulation of the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing (24Chen Y.-K. Leng C.-H. Olivares H. Lee M.-H. Chang Y.-C. Kung W.-M. Ti S.-C. Lo Y.-H. Wang A.H.-J. Chang C.-S. Bishop D.K. Hsugh Y.-P. Wang T.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2005; 12: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our previous study indicated that the mouse TBPIP/Hop2 protein itself enhances the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing without Mnd1, but a large amount of the TBPIP/Hop2 protein was required (40Enomoto R.

In contrast to the TBPIP/Hop2 protein alone, hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 significantly enhances the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing, with a small amount of protein (0.2 μm hTBPIP/Hop2-Mnd1 for 6.5 μm hDmc1). This fact suggests that the hTBPIP/Hop2-hMnd1 complex functions in a catalytic manner. We found that the human TBPIP/Hop2 protein was extremely unstable in the absence of the hMnd1 protein (data not shown). This is consistent with genetic results that the overexpression of the Mnd1 gene suppressed a temperature-sensitive hop2 mutant allele in S. cerevisiae (22Gerton J.L. DeRisi J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enhancement of the Dmc1-mediated homologous pairing by the mouse TBPIP/Hop2 protein was only detected in the presence of an excess amount of the protein, probably due to its extreme instability in the absence of the Mnd1 protein.

Disruption of chicken thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), a mitochondrial redox-regulating protein, results in apoptosis in DT40 cells. To investigate the mechanism of this apoptosis, we prepared transfectants expressing control (DT40-TRX2-/-), human thioredoxin 2 (TRX2) (DT40-hTRX2), or redox-inactive TRX2 (DT40-hTRX2CS) in conditional Trx2-deficient DT40 cells containing a tetracycline-repressible Trx2 gene. Production of ATP was not significantly changed by down-regulation of Trx2 expression. The generation of reactive oxygen species was enhanced by the down-regulation of Trx2 expression in DT40-TRX2-/-. Unexpectedly, the change was blocked in both DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS cells. The down-regulation of Trx2 expression caused the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor on day 3, and apoptosis on day 5. These changes were also suppressed in both DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS cells, suggesting that TRX2 regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis by redox-active site cysteine-independent mechanisms. The down-regulation of Trx2 expression caused a decrease in the protein level of Bcl-xL on day 3, whereas the protein level of Bcl-2 did not change until day 4, and the mRNA level of Bcl-xL was unchanged. The decrease in Bcl-xL was not blocked by a caspase 3 inhibitor but blocked in both DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS. These findings indicate a link between the redox active site cysteine-independent action of TRX2 and the level of Bcl-xL in the regulation of apoptosis.

Mitochondria play an essential role in the control of apoptotic death. In the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, there is frequently a dissipation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), 3The abbreviations used are: MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; TRX, thioredoxin; TRX2, thioredoxin 2; Trx2, chicken thioredoxin 2; Dox, doxycycline; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; mPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TRXR2, thioredoxin reductase 2; Prdx-3, peroxiredoxin 3; DiOC6, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; Ac-DEVD-MCA, acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid-α-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide); DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA. accompanied by the release of apoptogenic proteins (cytochrome c (1Liu X.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, MOMP is considered to be directly controlled by factors such as the Bcl-2 family. Among Bcl-2 family proteins, pro-apoptotic members such as Bax and Bak increase MOMP during apoptosis, whereas anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit the change in membrane permeability (9Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL is reported to be able to bind to and close the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), one of the components of permeability transition (PT) pores on the outer membrane, while blocking Bax/VDAC interaction, VDAC opening, and subsequent cytochrome c release (10Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulating evidence indicates a model of regulation through the protein-conduction pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (9Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar, 11Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms are still not completely understood. Thioredoxin 2 (TRX2) is a small redox protein containing the thioredoxin-active site Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (-WCGPC-). TRX2 is encoded by a nuclear gene and localized to the mitochondria by a mitochondrial leader sequence (12Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). TRX2 has two cysteines in its active site. Whereas the thioredoxin (TRX) system in the cytosol is composed of TRX, thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin, TRX2, mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TRXR2), and mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 3 (Prdx-3) constitute a redox-reducing system in mitochondria (12Spyrou G.

TRX plays an important role in defense against oxidative stress and performs a wide variety of biological functions, such as regulation of gene expression, control of growth, and apoptosis (16Masutani H. Ueda S. Yodoi J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Studies show that the mitochondrial TRX2 system is essential for cell viability. We previously showed that chicken DT40 cells conditionally deficient in Trx2 undergo apoptosis in the absence of exogenous stress, accompanied by an accumulation of intracellular ROS, the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (17Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TRX2 confers resistance to tert-butyhydroperoxide-induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells (143B) (18Chen Y. Cai J. Murphy T.J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33242-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The overexpression induced an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced resistance to etoposide in HEK-293 cells (19Damdimopoulos A.E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33249-33257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). An absence of TRX2 causes massive apoptosis, exencephaly, and early embryonic death in homozygous mice, suggesting a crucial role for TRX2 in cell survival in vivo (20Nonn L. Williams R.R. Erickson R.P. Powis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated inactivation of TRXR2 is also associated with embryonic death. TRXR2-deficient embryos are smaller and severely anemic and show increased apoptosis in the liver (21Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These previous results collectively show the role of the mitochondrial TRX2 system in the regulation of apoptosis. TRX2 is an important example of how a deficiency in a single gene product causes the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis without any stimuli. Therefore, the investigation of how a deficiency in TRX2 results in apoptosis may provide an insight into the mechanism behind mitochondrial apoptotic events. Our previous study shows that disruption of Trx2 results in apoptosis in chicken DT40 cells. We here took advantage of this model to investigate the mechanism of the mitochondrial apoptosis, analyzing ATP synthesis, ROS production, membrane permeability transition based on changes in flow cytometric staining with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6), and the level of Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2. Because TRX2 is considered to play an important part in regulating the redox status of mitochondria, we also analyzed the role of the redox reaction in the regulation of apoptosis by introducing human wild-type TRX2 (hTRX2) or mutant TRX2 (hTRX2CS) in which cysteines in the active site were replaced with serines (-WSGPS-), into conditional Trx2-deficient chicken DT40 cells. Reagents—Oligomycin was purchased from Sigma. Doxycycline (Dox) was obtained from Clontech. Annexin V-FITC was obtained from Medical & Biological Laboratories, Co., Ltd. Z-VAD-FMK and acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid-α-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) (Ac-DEVD-MCA, a fluorogenic substrate for caspase 3 protease) were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka). MitoTracker Red CMXRos, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), and DiOC6 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies—Anti-FLAG mAb and anti α-tubulin mAb were purchased from Sigma. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from DAKO. Anti-chicken Trx2 polyclonal antibody was prepared as described previously (17Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Anti-cytochrome c mAb (Clone 7H8.2C12), anti-Bcl-x mAb (Clone 4), and anti-Bcl-2 mAb were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Anti-AIF polyclonal antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling. Plasmids—The open reading frame of human TRX2 (hTRX2) was amplified by PCR using a human placental cDNA library and primers (5′-CAGCTGACCATGGCTCAGCGACTTCTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GCTAGCTCAGCCAATCAGCTTCTTCAGG-3′). The cDNAs were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Using the vector as a template, cDNA lacking a stop codon was obtained by PCR using primers (5′-GGAATTCGCCCTTCAGCTGACCATGGCT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCGCCAATCAGCTTCTTCAGGAAGGCCTC-3′). The products were then digested by EcoRI/BamHI and subcloned into the vector pFP-N3 (Clontech) to produce pFP-N3-TRX2. The pCMV-hTRX2-FLAG expression vector was prepared by deleting the EGFP sequence and inserting a FLAG fragment sequence in the BamHI/NotI site of pFP-N3-TRX2. hTRX2CS cDNA was obtained by site-specific mutation by PCR using primers sets (5′-CAGCTGACCATGGCTCAGCGACTTCTTCTG-3′ and 5′-GATCTTGGAGGGTCCAGACCACTGTGC-3′; 5′-GCACAGTGGTCTGGACCCTCCAAGATC-3′ and 5′-GCTAGCTCAGCCAATCAGCTTCTTCAGG-3′). The products were then subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, digested by EcoRI/BamHI, and subcloned into pFP-N3 vectors (Clontech) to produce pFP-N3-TRX2CS. The pCMV-hTRX2CS-FLAG expression vector was prepared by deleting the EGFP sequence and inserting a FLAG fragment sequence in the BamHI/NotI site of pFP-N3-TRX2CS. pCMV-FLAG control vector was prepared by self-ligation. All the constructs were controlled by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Trx2-deficient chicken DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum (Clontech) and 1% chicken serum (JRH, Biosciences) at 39 °C under 5% CO2. We used the conditional Trx2-knock-out DT40 system (tet-off) in which the expression of a transgenic chicken Trx2 is suppressed by treatment with doxycycline (Dox) (17Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The expression of the transgenic chicken Trx2 is suppressed by adding Dox (2 μg/ml) into the culture medium at every cell passage. Transfection of vectors (pCMV-hTRX2-FLAG, pCMV-hTRX2CS-FLAG, or control pCMV-FLAG) into Trx2-deficient chicken DT40 cells was performed by electroporation as described previously (22Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Drug-resistant colonies were selected with the same medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai). Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence Staining—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Ueda S. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Sasada T. Yonehara S. Takabayashi A. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6689-6695PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with 200 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos for 30 min at 39 °C, washed with PBS, and attached to a microscope slide by centrifugation on Cytospin 3 (Shandon). After fixation and permeabilization, the cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Images were acquired with a confocal laser microscope (Leica). Detection of Apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC Staining—Annexin V-FITC staining was performed with or without Dox treatment for 5 days. The cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2), incubated for 15 min with 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC in the dark, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis (FACS-Calibur, BD Biosciences). Caspase 3 Activation Assay—The activation of caspase 3 was measured as previously described (24Hasegawa J. Kamada S. Kamiike W. Shimizu S. Imazu T. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1713-1718PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS(-), and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 50 μm digitonin). They were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 min, and supernatants were collected. A total of 10 μg of protein was incubated with 50 μm Ac-DEVD-MCA at 37 °C, and the release of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) was monitored with a spectrofluorometer (Spectra Fluor, TECAN) using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. As a negative control, 10 μl of ICE reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA) was incubated with 50 μm Ac-DEVD-MCA at 37 °C and monitored in the same way. Preparation of Cytosolic Fraction—For the cytochrome c and AIF release assay, a soluble cytosolic fraction was prepared as follows. Cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS(-). The cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with 30-50 strokes. Unbroken cells and nuclei were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting supernatant and precipitates were stored as the soluble cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction, respectively. ATP Production Assay—Cellular ATP levels were assayed using ATPlite (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and LumiCount according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice, then resuspended with cell lysis solution. The amount of protein was assayed and adjusted to 0.1 μg/μl with cell lysis solution. Next, 50 μl of cell lysate was added to 100 μl of PBS per well of a microplate, and the plate was shaken for 5 min in an orbital shaker at 700 rpm. The substrate solution (50 μl) was added to the plate, and the microplate was shaken for 5 min. The plate was left in the dark for 10 min, and the luminescence was measured using an ARVO SX counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The standard curve for ATP was made with a series of dilutions. Flow Cytometric Estimation of Intracellular ROS—The level of intracellular ROS was monitored by flow cytometric analysis with DCFH-DA, as described previously (23Ueda S. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Sasada T. Yonehara S. Takabayashi A. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6689-6695PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the medium with 5 μm DCFH-DA for 15 min at 39 °C, washed with PBS, and suspended in 1 ml of PBS. The intensity of fluorescence was analyzed using a flow cytometer. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using DiOC6. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, then cultured with 40 nm DiOC6 for 15 min in 5% CO2 at 39 °C, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Cell Quest Software. siRNA-mediated Silencing of Bcl-xL Expression—Knockdown of the chicken Bcl-xL protein was performed using the RNA interference technique. Cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 40 nm oligonucleotide duplex (Qiagen) using DMRIE-C Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 48 h before being subjected to analyses. siRNA duplexes targeting three different sites of Bcl-xL were as follows: 1#, 5′-r(UGGAGGAAGAGGAUGAGAA)dTdT-3′; 2#, 5′-r(CAGGACUGACACUGCAGCU)dTdT-3′; 3#, 5′-r(UGGCGGCUGGGAGCGCUUU)dTdT-3′; control (non-silencing) (1#, 2#, 3#, and Con., see Fig. 6E) siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells with a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed with a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen). PCRs were carried out using the following oligonucleotide primers: chicken Bcl-xL sense (5′-CGTACCAGAGCTTTGAGCAGGT-3′) and antisense (5′-GACCAAGCACAAGCACAATCAC-3′) and chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sense (5′-ATGGTGAAAGTCGGAGTCAACGG-3′ and antisense (5′-ACAGTGCCCTTGAAGTGTCC-3′). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 96 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s; 63 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 30 s; and a final elongation at 72 °C for 8 min to amplify the chicken Bcl-xL gene; 96 °C for 3 min, 20 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 30 s; and a final elongation at 72 °C for 8 min to amplify the GAPDH gene. The amplification of the product is not saturated at this number of cycles. Cell Death Induced by Trx2 Deficiency Is Rescued by Reconstitution with Human TRX2 or TRX2CS—To investigate the mechanism of death in Trx2-deficient cells, we used the conditional Trx2-knock-out DT40 system (tet-off) in which the expression of a transgenic chicken Trx2 is suppressed by treatment with Dox (17Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We transfected the control vector or the expression vector for FLAG-tagged human TRX2 (hTRX2) or double mutant human TRX2 (hTRX2CS), which encodes mutated cysteines (-WSGPS-) in the active site (Fig. 1A) into chicken Trx2-deficient DT40 cells to produce stable transfectants: DT40-TRX2-/-, DT40-hTRX2, or DT40-hTRX2CS, respectively (Fig. 1B). With Dox treatment, the expression of transgenic chicken Trx2 was hardly detectable on day 3, whereas that of hTRX2-FLAG or hTRX2CS-FLAG remained unchanged (Fig. 1C). Confocal microscopic images showed that both hTRX2-FLAG and hTRX2CS-FLAG proteins are expressed in mitochondria (Fig. 1D). The proliferative nature of the transfectants was then monitored as shown in Fig. 1E. The Trx2-knock-out cells (DT40-TRX2-/-) transfected with the control vector showed a reduction in viability after Dox treatment. In contrast, the hTRX2-transfected cells (DT40-hTRX2) did not show any change in viability after Dox treatment. The hTRX2CS-transfected cells (DT40-hTRX2CS) did not show a change upon Dox treatment either. These results suggested that human TRX2 can substitute for chicken Trx2 and that not only hTRX2 but also hTRX2CS is capable of supporting the survival of conditional Trx2-deficient DT40 cells. Suppression of Apoptosis in hTRX2- or hTRX2CS-transfected Cells—We previously reported that a deficiency of Trx2 promotes apoptosis. Therefore, we analyzed the mechanism of the apoptosis, comparing DT40-TRX2-/-, DT40-hTRX2, and DT40-hTRX2CS. We first analyzed the staining of Annexin V-FITC in cells cultured with Dox for 5 days using a flow cytometer. Although the staining was enhanced in DT40-TRX2-/- after Dox treatment, it was unchanged in DT40-hTRX2 or DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 2A). Down-regulation of Trx2 expression on Dox treatment clearly induced activation of caspase-3 in DT40-TRX2-/-. In contrast, caspase-3 was not activated in either DT40-hTRX2 or DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 2B). All these results showed that either hTRX2 or hTRX2CS protects cells from apoptosis induced by the knock-out of chicken Trx2. ATP Production Is Unchanged in Trx2-deficient Cells—One of the most important functions of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation during respiration. A previous report suggested that TRX2 interferes with the activity of ATP synthase (19Damdimopoulos A.E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33249-33257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We then investigated the effect of Trx2 deficiency on ATP synthesis by assessing ATP production in the transfectants. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, suppressed ATP production rapidly in control cells (DT40-TRX2-/- without Dox treatment). The down-regulation of Trx2 expression in DT40-TRX2-/- caused by Dox treatment did not result in a significant decrease in the production of ATP. In addition, the level of production did not differ significantly between DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS. These results suggest that the death caused by Trx2 deficiency is not due to a decrease in the production of ATP. Increased Intracellular Levels of ROS on Loss of Trx2—Because TRX2 is important for reducing intramitochondrial levels of ROS, we next examined the basal intracellular level of ROS by conducting flow cytometric analyses using DCFH-DA. Down-regulation of Trx2 expression augmented the level of ROS in DT40-TRX2-/-, whereas no significant increase in ROS was observed in DT40-hTRX2 after 5 days of Dox treatment. We showed the cessation of ROS production also in DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 4). Trx2 Deficiency Caused Disruption of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—A previous report showed that overexpression of TRX2 increases mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in mammalian cells (19Damdimopoulos A.E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33249-33257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the ΔΨm in Trx2-deficient cells on day 5 after Dox treatment using DiOC6. We showed that ΔΨm decreases in DT40-TRX2-/-. In contrast, no significant change in ΔΨm was detected in either DT40-hTRX2 or DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 5A). Moreover, down-regulation of Trx2 expression also induced the release of cytochrome c and AIF into the cytosol in DT40-TRX2-/-, whereas the release was blocked in DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 5B). Trx2 Deficiency Caused the Bcl-xL Level to Decrease—Because members of the Bcl-2 family play a crucial role in the regulation of MOMP, we examined the level of Bcl-xL, an important member of this family, using antibodies available for the detection of chicken proteins. As shown in Fig. 6A, the expression of Bcl-xL protein in total cellular lysates decreased on day 3 after Dox treatment in DT40-TRX2-/-, whereas the level of tubulin did not change. In contrast, the Bcl-xL level was unchanged in DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 6A). The level of Bcl-xL did not change until day 2 after Dox treatment and decreased on day 3, although the expression of chicken transgenic Trx2 was hardly detectable at 24 h after Dox treatment (Fig. 6B). The mRNA level of Bcl-xL did not decrease in DT40-TRX2-/-, DT40-hTRX2, or DT40-hTRX2CS (Fig. 6C). Treatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, did not influence the decrease in the level of Bcl-xL. The level of Bcl-2 did not change until day 4 after Dox treatment and decreased on day 5 (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that Trx2-deficiency causes a decrease in the level of Bcl-xL protein in a manner independent of the reducing activity of TRX2. We further examined whether Bcl-xL plays an important anti-apoptotic role in DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS cells by conducting siRNA experiments. Transfection of siRNA targeting Bcl-xL in DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS cells caused a down-regulation of Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 6E) and resulted in decreased cell numbers, compared with the cells transfected with control siRNA, when these cells were treated with Dox for more than 5 days (Fig. 6F). The chicken Trx2 gene encodes a protein consisting of 151 amino acids, whereas the human TRX2 gene encodes a protein of 166 amino acids. Mature chicken Trx2 is 91.6% identical to its human counterpart (12Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Our results showed that human TRX2 could substitute for chicken Trx2 to rescue DT40 cells from death (Fig. 1E). Considering the importance of maintaining the redox environment in mitochondria, the structure and function of TRX2 should be highly conserved. We showed here that a deficiency of Trx2 causes apoptosis and the activation of caspase 3, accompanied by a decrease in ΔΨm, and the release of AIF and cytochrome c into the cytosol. Intriguingly, these effects were independent of its conserved active site cysteines. As reported in our previous study, Trx2 may interact with cytochrome c to block its release (17Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay using recombinant TRX2 protein, cytochrome c bound to the wild-type TRX2 but not to the mutant TRX2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Because both DT40-hTRX2 and DT40-hTRX2CS displayed resistance against apoptosis, TRX2 may have another regulatory mechanism to prevent apoptosis than the interaction with cytochrome c. The synthesis of ATP is a requisite function of mitochondria and key to cell survival. However, the role of ATP in the control of apoptosis is debatable. In one report, apoptosis was triggered by inhibitors through a reduction in the level of ATP (25Wolvetang E.J. Johnson K.L. Krauer K. Ralph S.J. Linnane A.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), whereas in other reports, a reduction of ATP blocked apoptosis and switched the mechanism to necrosis (26Eguchi Y. Shimizu S.

Recent studies suggest that this elaborate protein network, which acts as a structural and signaling center for striated muscle, harbors factors that function as mechanosensors to ensure coordinated contractile activity. Mutations in genes whose products reside in this region often result in skeletal and cardio myopathies, demonstrating the importance of this macromolecular complex in muscle structure and function. Here, we describe the characterization of a direct, downstream target gene for the MEF2A transcription factor encoding a large, muscle-specific protein that localizes to the costamere in striated muscle.

Our findings demonstrate that myospryn functions directly downstream of MEF2A at the costamere in striated muscle potentially playing a role in myofibrillogenesis. The cytoskeleton of striated muscle is comprised of a complex and highly organized assembly of proteins, which ensures that contraction is appropriately initiated and transmitted in a synchronized fashion while maintaining cellular integrity (1Clark K.A.

Whereas much progress has been made in elucidating the pathways of muscle dysfunction and in identifying essential structural and signaling proteins, a gap remains in our understanding of the true complexity of molecular interactions between known and novel proteins within this cytoarchitectural framework. The discovery of novel muscle-specific cytoskeletal proteins and their specific protein-protein interactions will undoubtedly reveal additional important pathways in the formation and maintenance of the cytoskeleton in muscle cells.The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) 2The abbreviations used are: MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor-2; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; BBC, B-box coiled-coil; CMYA5, cardiomyopathy-associated gene 5; TRIM, tripartite motif; FN, fibronectin; DM, double mutant; TM, triple mutant.2The abbreviations used are: MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor-2; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; BBC, B-box coiled-coil; CMYA5, cardiomyopathy-associated gene 5; TRIM, tripartite motif; FN, fibronectin; DM, double mutant; TM, triple mutant. family of transcription factors regulates the expression of numerous muscle-specific genes that include components of the elaborate cytoskeletal network in striated muscle cells (10Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression, MEF2 loss-of-function mutations exhibit defects in striated muscle development and function with associated alterations in the expression of genes encoding proteins of the contractile apparatus (11Lilly B. Zhao B. Ranganayakulu G. Paterson B.M. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Science. 1995; 267: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 12Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N.

Development. 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the more complex MEF2 knock-out phenotypes is that of MEF2A. MEF2A is one of the four MEF2 genes in vertebrates, MEF2A, -2B, -2C, and -2D expressed in muscle and non-muscle cell lineages and activates genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (14McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A null allele for MEF2A in mice results in cardiac sudden death with cytoarchitectural defects, mitochondrial deficiency, and conduction disturbances (15Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In humans, a dominant negative mutation of the mef2a gene has been linked to cardiovascular disease arising from defects in the coronary arteries (16Wang L. Fan C. Topol S.E. Topol E.J. Wang Q. Science. 2003; 302: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports have failed to demonstrate linkage of this mutation to coronary artery disease (17Weng L. Kavaslar N.

Tago N. Tomoike H. Nonogi H. Goto Y. Iwai N. Circ.

Batalla A. Ordonez A.G. Palop R.L. Lozano I. Montes M. Alvarez V. Coto E. J. Med. Genet. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whereas a considerable amount is known regarding the mechanisms by which MEF2 transcription factors are modified to regulate gene expression (14McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) the downstream pathways that they regulate are not completely understood. Thus, the identification of novel downstream target genes for MEF2A will provide further insight into the cellular pathways regulated by this transcription factor in the cardiovascular system.To investigate the molecular mechanisms of cardiac abnormalities in mef2a mutant mice and identify novel MEF2A target genes we compared gene expression levels between wild type and mef2a knock-out hearts using DNA microarray (15Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This gene expression profiling approach identified numerous dysregulated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) down-regulated in mef2a mutant hearts. One of these mouse ESTs is down-regulated ∼2-fold and is homologous to a partial human cDNA in the NCBI data base named cardiomyopathy-associated gene 5 (CMYA5). CMYA5 was discovered by expression profiling of a human cardiac muscle library but its function has not been reported. Because the expression of this EST is dependent on MEF2A transcriptional activity we focused our efforts on the cloning and characterization of the mouse ortholog of the CMYA5 gene. While this work was in progress, the mouse ortholog of CMYA5, named Myospryn, was identified as a dysbindin-interacting protein (20Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10450-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dysbindin is a ubiquitously expressed, cytoplasmic protein that interacts with α-dystrobrevin, which itself associates with the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (21Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Myospryn encodes a large, novel member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) superfamily of proteins (22Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Myospryn is a direct target for MEF2A and is localized specifically to the costamere of striated muscle cells where it interacts with the sarcomeric Z-disc protein, α-actinin-2. The characterization of this MEF2A-dependent gene will contribute to our understanding of the extensive protein interactions within the costamere and Z-disc complex and its potential role in muscle function and disease.MATERIALS AND METHODSMicroarray Analysis and Bioinformatics—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from wild type and mef2a mutant hearts and used with Mouse GEM1 array (Incyte Genomics) as previously described (15Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The down-regulated EST AA413670 was used to search the NCBI and Celera data bases to assemble the full-length mouse cDNA by PCR from a Marathon skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech) and is identical to Myospryn (GenBank™ accession number AJ575748).Creation of Mef2A Transgenic Mice—The mouse MEF2A cDNA was amplified from a Marathon cardiac muscle cDNA library (Clontech) and cloned into the αMHC-hGH poly(A) vector. The promoter-cDNA cassette was released from the vector backbone by digestion with NotI, gel-purified using QiaQuick columns (Qiagen) and injected into the male pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes. Two transgenic positive founders were obtained and both transmitted the transgene to their offspring.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cardiac muscle using the TRIzol method. First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA with random hexamers using reverse transcriptase. cDNAs were subjected to PCR, fractionated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and visualized with a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant Program (Molecular Dynamics). RT-PCR was performed in the linear range (26 cycles) with primers specific for Myospryn within the 3′-end of the gene. Primers for detecting Myospryn were as follows: 5′-GTTAACCTCCCTCCCAACGACAATTACTT-3′;5′-TCGTCACGTACATGGTACTCCAGAG-3′.Northern Blot Analysis and in Situ Hybridization—A mouse multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (Clontech) was hybridized with a 32P-labeled HindIII fragment (nucleotides 5,391-6,455) of the Myospryn cDNA. An antisense cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 5,391-5,915 was used for radioactive in situ hybridization. Embryos at various developmental time points were fixed according to standard procedures and sagittal mouse sections were hybridized with antisense Myospryn cDNA labeled with 35S-UTP.Antibodies and Immunocytochemistry—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Myospryn antibodies were raised against GST fusion proteins (Cocalico Biologicals) generated from three different regions of the Myospryn cDNA. Antibodies UT266 (GST fusion-containing nucleotides 4,764-5,391), UT264 (nucleotides 5,391-6,455), and UT262 (nucleotides 9,583-9,868) were IgG-purified using MabTrap II (Amersham Biosciences). All three antibodies exhibited specificity for Myospryn in transfected cells. However, the UT266 antibody exhibited the highest specificity with heart cryosections. For immunostaining of heart cryosections, adult mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, hearts were dissected and cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 24-48 h. Cryoprotected hearts were then placed in embedding compound (OCT) and frozen at -80 °C. Hearts were cryosectioned at 15 μm and air-dried on Superfrost Plus Slides (Fisher). Primary antibodies for Myospryn (UT266, IgG fraction, dilution 1:100), mouse monoclonal sarcomeric α-actinin (Sigma, 1:100) and secondary antibodies (1:200) for anti-Myospryn (anti-rabbit Texas Red) and anti-actinin (anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate) were used on heart cryosections. After immunostaining procedure, Vectashield (Vector Labs) was applied to heart cryosections and protected with cover slips.Transient Transfections, Coimmunoprecipitations, and Western Blots—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For reporter assays, COS cells in 6-well plates, each well containing ∼500,000 cells, were transfected with 0.2 μg of the wild-type or mutant forms of the myospryn promoter in pGL3-Basic (Promega) and 0.8 μg of human MEF2A in pcDNA 1 (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences), and were harvested after 36-48 h. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega), and protein concentrations were normalized via Bradford assay. For co-immunoprecipitations, COS cells in 100-mm dishes (at 50% confluency) were transfected with 20 μg of expression plasmids for full-length Myospryn and 5 μg for truncated forms of Myospryn and α-actinin, using FuGENE 6 reagent. Myospryn proteins were fused with an N-terminal Myc epitope, and α-actinin was fused with an N-terminal FLAG epitope. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Sciences). Extracts were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4°C using protein A/G-agarose and 1 μg of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Subsequently, the pellet was washed with ELB buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma).Gel Shift and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—For gel shift assays, whole cell extracts were isolated from adult mouse hearts by homogenization and incubated in the presence of radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the four MEF2 sites in the myospryn promoter as described previously (15Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For ChIP analysis, primary neonatal rat cardiomyoyctes were isolated and seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells in 10-cm dishes. C2C12 myoblasts seeded at a density of 1 × 106 were transfected with 15 μg of FLAG-MEF2A expression vector. Cardiomyocytes and C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin for 48-72 h. Cells were cross-linked with 37% formaldehyde, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and subsequently harvested. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), and procedures were carried out according to the Upstate protocol, with the following modifications. Harvested cells were sonicated in 400 μl of SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Each 400-μl sample was subsequently split into 200 μl, and then diluted ∼6-fold in ChIP dilution buffer containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 2 μg of anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) or 4 μg of anti-FLAG. PCR primers flanking the -1985 site in the myospryn promoter were used for the PCR analysis. The rat, mouse, and human myospryn promoter sequences were aligned using the MatInspector program, and primers were designed using sequences that were found to be identical in both the rat and mouse promoters. 5′ primer sequence: 5′-CCT GGT TTT ATT TTC CTC ATG ATA GG-3′.3′ primer sequence: 5′-CTG TAG GCC TAC AAG AAG TTT G-3′.RESULTSMicroarray Analysis and Identification of Myospryn—In our ongoing effort to gain further insight into the cellular pathways regulated by MEF2A in the postnatal heart we have continued to analyze microarray data previously reported for the characterization of the mef2a knock-out phenotype (15Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). mef2a mutant mice die in the perinatal period and display severe cytoarchitectural and mitochondrial abnormalities in cardiac muscle cells. Aside from the known MEF2 target genes dysregulated in mef2a mutant hearts, numerous novel ESTs also exhibited alterations in gene expression levels in these abnormal hearts. One of these ESTs (accession number AA413760) is down-regulated 1.9-fold. While this work was in preparation, the full-length gene product of mouse EST AA413760, named Myospryn, was identified as a dysbindin-interacting protein (20Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10450-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dysbindin is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein that interacts with α-dystrobrevin, which itself is a component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (21Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Myospryn was subsequently confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with cDNA from postnatal day 5 (P5) hearts of mef2a mutant mice. Transcripts for Myospryn were expressed at 0.41 ± 0.09 (n = 3) of wild-type levels in P5 hearts of mef2a mutant mice (data not shown).MEF2A-dependent Activation of Endogenous Myospryn Gene—To further demonstrate that endogenous myospryn gene expression is sensitive to MEF2A dosage, we generated mice that overexpressed the fulllength mouse MEF2A cDNA in the heart under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter (Fig. 1A). An observed induction of the myospryn gene would strengthen the notion that it is a relevant in vivo target downstream of MEF2A. In combination with the mef2a knock-out microarray data, these transgenic mice will also provide us with an important reagent to identify additional genes most likely to be directly activated by MEF2A. This complementary approach will be useful in dissecting the MEF2A-dependent transcriptional network in the postnatal heart. 3J. Reynolds and F. Naya, manuscript in preparation.Two independent lines of αMHC-MEF2A transgenic mice, MHC2A19 and MHC2A20, were obtained, and expression of the transgene was confirmed by Northern analysis (data not shown). Western analysis using a MEF2A antibody (C-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase in MEF2A protein over basal levels in these transgenic hearts (Fig. 1B). We noted that this increase in MEF2A expression resulted in a modest enlargement of the heart by three months of age (Fig. 1C) and the induction of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) a known MEF2 target and hypertrophic marker gene (data not shown). These results are consistent with the observed phenotype in transgenic mice overexpressing human MEF2A in the heart 4J. D. Molkentin, personal communication.. Additional molecular characterization of this phenotype will be described elsewhere.To examine transcript levels for endogenous myospryn, RNA was isolated from 2-month-old transgenic hearts, prior to any visible cardiac enlargement and subjected to quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR (Applied Biosystems). Measurement of transcripts for myospryn using qRT-PCR revealed a 2.9 ± 1.0 (n = 3) enhancement in basal expression levels (Fig. 1D) demonstrating that forced expression of MEF2A alone induces this gene in the heart. Other well characterized MEF2 target genes and novel ESTs, previously demonstrated to be down-regulated in mef2a knock-out hearts, were induced in transgenic mice overexpressing MEF2A validating that these genes are downstream of MEF2A and are likely to be direct targets for this transcription factor in the heart. These results demonstrate that MEF2A is sufficient to activate the endogenous myospryn gene and supports the notion that it is a bona fide in vivo target for MEF2A in the heart.Regulation of Myospryn Transcription by MEF2A—To test whether myospryn represents a direct transcriptional target for MEF2A we identified the 5′-end of the gene using a combination of the EST data base, 5′-RACE PCR, primer extension, and RNase protection (data not shown). Based on this information, we isolated 3.5 kb of mouse genomic sequence upstream of the first exon and cloned this fragment into the pGL3BASIC-luciferase reporter. MEF2A-responsiveness of this 5′ region was tested in transfected COS cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, this 3.5-kb fragment alone exhibited background levels of activity in COS cells. However, when co-transfected with a MEF2A expression vector, the 3.5-kb fragment was induced 5.2-fold (Fig. 2A) indicating that the myospryn promoter responds to MEF2A activity.FIGURE 2Direct activation of myospryn promoter by MEF2A. A, MEF2A expression vector or pcDNA3 was co-transfected into COS cells with the wild-type myospryn promoter or a series of mutant promoter constructs. The fold activation is relative to the luciferase activity (normalized to 1) of the wild-type or mutant reporter transfected with pcDNA3 vector backbone. DM, -1452/-1985; TM1, +33/-1452/-1985; TM2, -1452/-1985/-2834. Error bars represent S.D. for three experiments. Values obtained for the -1452, -1985, DM, and TM mutants are statistically significant at p < 0.05. B, sequence of the myospryn proximal promoter and additional upstream sequences. The four MEF2 sites and a putative SRF binding site (CArG-like) are underlined. C, MEF2A binds four MEF2 sites present in myospryn promoter. In vitro translated MEF2A or whole cell lysates from adult mouse hearts were subjected to gel shift assays. Protein-DNA complexes were formed with each of the MEF2 sites within the mysospryn promoter. MEF2 DNA binding activity was confirmed by incubation with a MEF2A-specific antibody resulting in a slower migrating supershifted complex. D, sequence alignment of rat, mouse, and human myospryn promoter regions. The conserved -1985 MEF2 site is noted in the boxed region. Also shown are the -1452 and -2834 MEF2 sites aligned with their rat and human counterparts. No significant alignment was obtained with the +33 MEF2 site. Upper right panel, the conserved -1985 MEF2 site of the myospryn promoter is located in a region of acetylated chromatin. Lower right panel, FLAG-MEF2A binds the mouse -1985 site in C2C12 myoblasts. ChIP analysis was performed on cross-linked chromatin isolated from neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes and C2C12 myoblasts (transfected with a FLAG-MEF2A expression vector), and immunoprecipitations were performed using the anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody and anti-FLAG respectively. A no-antibody immunoprecipitation serves as the control. Immunoprecipitated DNA from each sample, as well as aliquots of non-immunoprecipitated DNA used as input controls for each sample, were subjected to PCR using primers flanking the -1985 MEF2 site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given the ability of MEF2A to transactivate this upstream fragment we examined this region for MEF2 binding sites and identified four putative MEF2 sequences exhibiting similarity to the consensus MEF2 site, YTA(A/T)4TAR (Fig. 2B). To determine whether MEF2A could bind these sequences we performed gel mobility shift assays. The MEF2 sequences located at +33 (CTATTTAAAG), -1452 (TTATAATTAG), -1985 (TTATAAATAA), and -2834 (TTATTTTTAA) relative to the putative transcription start site bound to in vitro translated MEF2A (Fig. 2C, left panel), and MEF2A-specific binding was confirmed by supershifting the protein-DNA complex with an anti-MEF2A antibody. To validate that endogenous MEF2A from cardiomyocytes could also bind these sequences protein extracts from adult mouse hearts were subjected to gel shift assays. MEF2 DNA binding activity was readily apparent for each of the four MEF2 binding sites and incubation of these extracts with MEF2A antibodies resulted in a slower migrating supershifted complex (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results confirm that MEF2A protein directly binds to all four MEF2 sites within the myospryn promoter.To determine whether the myospryn promoter was being activated through one or more of the MEF2 sites, mutations that disrupt MEF2 binding were introduced within each of the core sequences in the context of the 3.5-kb proximal promoter. As shown in Fig. 2A, mutations within each of the individual MEF2 binding sites had varying effects on transactivation potential. Mutations of the +33 and the -2834 MEF2 sites had no significant effect and a 20% reduction, respectively, in transcriptional activity directed by MEF2A. In contrast, mutations within the -1452 and -1985 MEF2 sites affected transcriptional activity by 30 and 45%, respectively. Given the greater inhibitory effects of the -1452 and -1985 mutations we generated a double mutation (DM) within the 3.5-kb promoter and determined its ability to be transactivated by MEF2A. This double mutation resulted in an additional inhibitory effect (60% reduction relative to wild type) in transcriptional activity. Because the double mutation did not completely eliminate transcriptional response of this promoter to MEF2A, we asked whether mutations in either the +33 or the -2834 MEF2 sites in the context of the DM construct would result in a more pronounced inhibitory effect. Mutations in the +33 and -2834 MEF2 sites were introduced into the DM construct resulting in two different triple mutations, TM1 (+33/-1452/-1985) and TM2 (-1452/-1985/-2834). Each of these triple mutant promoter constructs were tested for their ability to respond to MEF2A. Both TM1 and TM2 mutations did not result in a further reduction in MEF2A responsiveness."

We analyzed the specificity and mechanism of the opacity reaction using a recombinant form of the amino-terminal opacification domain of SOF, rSOF. Our data indicate that rSOF is neither a protease nor a lipase, but rather it is the binding of rSOF to high density lipoprotein (HDL) that triggers the opacity reaction. rSOF did not opacify plasma from apoA-I–/– mice or purified low or very low density lipoproteins but readily opacified HDL. rSOF binding to HDL was characterized by two high affinity binding sites; it bound to apoA-I (Kd = 6 nm) and apoA-II (Kd = 30 nm), and both apoA-I and apoA-II blocked the binding of rSOF to HDL. Electron microscopic examination and biochemical analyses of HDL treated with rSOF revealed the formation of lipid droplets devoid of apolipoproteins. Thus, SOF interacts with HDL in human blood by binding to apoA-I and apoA-II and causing the release of HDL lipid cargo, which coalesces to form lipid droplets, resulting in opacification. The disruption of HDL may attenuate its anti-inflammatory functions and contribute to the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections.

Rudd G.V. Aust J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 1938; 16: 181-192Crossref Google Scholar). It is expressed by approximately half of the clinical isolates of S. pyogenes (2O'Brien K.L. Beall B. Barrett N.L.

SOF is a large protein with a Mr of ∼110,000 that is found in both culture supernatants and attached to the surface of streptococci via its cell wall-anchoring motif, LPASG. The sof genes from different serotypes of S. pyogenes have ∼60% homology between their deduced amino acid sequences (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Rakonjac J.V. Robbins J.C. Fischetti V.A. Infect Immun. 1995; 63: 622-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kreikemeyer B. Talay S.R. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The N-terminal two-thirds of SOF is composed of alternating variable and conserved regions. The carboxyl terminus of SOF is highly conserved and contains a repeating peptide domain that binds to fibronectin (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Rakonjac J.V. Robbins J.C. Fischetti V.A. Infect Immun. 1995; 63: 622-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kreikemeyer B.

Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 4302-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The binding of fibronectin is an important function for group A streptococci, as indicated by the findings that these bacteria express at least 10 different fibronectin-binding proteins (10Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that have roles in adhesion and invasion (11Courtney H.S. Podbielski A. Bacterial Invasion of Host Cells.in: Lamont R.J. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2004: 239-273Google Scholar). The opacification domain of SOF is contained within amino acid residues 148–843 (Fig. 1) and is clearly distinct from the fibronectin-binding domain, as the deletion of the fibronectin-binding domain had no effect on the opacity reaction of SOF (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Rakonjac J.V. Robbins J.C. Fischetti V.A.

Insertional inactivation of sof reduced the virulence of S. pyogenes in a mouse model of infection (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and reduced the growth of S. pyogenes in human blood (12Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 936-947Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and immunization of mice with SOF provided protection against infections by S. pyogenes (13Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Infect Immun. 2003; 71: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), identifying SOF as a virulence determinant and a vaccine candidate. Various catalytic activities have been proposed to account for the opacity reaction of SOF, including those as a lipoproteinase (14Krumwiede E. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 100: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a cholesterol esterase (15Rowen R. Martin J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 70: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and more recently as an apolipoproteinase that degrades apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein in high density lipoprotein particles (HDL) (16Saravani G.A. Martin D.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 56: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDL functions primarily in the reverse cholesterol pathway by removing cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transporting it to the liver (17Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes.in: Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 495-515Google Scholar). In addition, HDL plays a major role in controlling atherogenesis and inflammation due to infections. HDL neutralizes the proinflammatory activities of lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria (18Parker T.S. Levine D.M. Chang J.C. Laxer J. Coffin C.C. Rubin A.L. Infect Immun. 1995; 63: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Grunfeld C. Marshall M. Shigenaga J.K. Moser A.H. Tobias P. Feingold K.R. J.

A. 1993; 90: 12040-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It is thought that HDL has a prominent role in controlling sepsis and shock because HDL attenuates the cytokine response and reduces the rate of mortality in animal sepsis models, and the concentration of HDL decreases in septic patients (20Wu A. Hinds C.J. Thiemermann C. Shock. 2004; 21: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, bacterial factors that disrupt HDL structure would diminish its ability to modulate host responses to bacterial infections and contribute to the pathogenesis of infections. This report describes the use of recombinant SOF (rSOF; Fig. 1) to investigate its mechanism of interaction with serum lipoproteins that gives rise to the serum opacification phenomenon first described in 1938. Materials—Purified human very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), HDL, apoA-I, and apoA-II were purchased from Calbiochem. A polyhistidine-tagged, truncated form of sof2 encoding amino acids 38–843 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (rSOF) and purified by metal affinity chromatography as described previously (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Opacification Assays—The capacity of SOF to opacify horse and human serum was determined by adding 50 μl of rSOF at various concentrations to 2 ml of serum and recording the absorbance at 405 nm at timed intervals. The human lipoproteins, HDL, VLDL, and LDL, were diluted in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, to ∼2 mg/ml, and 200 μl of this mixture was added to microtiter wells. Ten μl of rSOF was added to the wells to obtain 0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 μg/ml final concentrations. The microtiter plate was incubated at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at timed intervals. Plasma from the mouse strain B6.129P2-Apoa1tm1Unc/J was obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These mice have a targeted mutation in apoAI and do not express apoA-I in their plasma. Control plasma was collected from C5BL/6J mice. Ten μl of buffer or rSOF (1 μg/ml final concentration) was added to 200 μl of plasma from these mice and incubated for 3 h at 37°C, and absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. Absorption of Lipoproteins—Human sera were absorbed with PHM-L Liposorb beads according to the manufacturer’s directions (Calbiochem). The absorbed sera and unabsorbed sera were reacted with rSOF (1 μg/ml) or buffer overnight at 37 °C. Two hundred μlwas added to microtiter wells in quadruplicate, and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. Absorbed and unabsorbed sera reacted with buffer served as blanks. Assays for Inhibitors of SOF—Stock concentrations of inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or Tris-buffered saline as required for solubility. Inhibition assays consisted of the addition of 100 μl of inhibitor to 1.8 ml of horse serum followed by addition of 100 μl of rSOF to obtain a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and then the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Blank controls consisted of Tris-buffered saline or Me2SO without inhibitors. Percent of control was determined by the formula (A405 with test agent/A405 with Tris-buffered saline) × 100. Inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem except for the mixture of protease inhibitors, which was obtained from Sigma. Assays to determine whether 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC) targets SOF or HDL were performed by preincubating rSOF or horse serum with concentrations of DCIC ranging from 22 μm to 2.2 mm for 3 h at 37 °C. Controls included rSOF or serum pretreated with Me2SO or Tris-buffered saline. After pretreatment, the mixtures were dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline using a membrane with a molecular size of 50 kDa. DCIC-treated rSOF was then added to fresh horse serum, and nontreated rSOF was added to DCIC-treated horse serum. In each case, the final concentration of rSOF was 1 μg/ml. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. Percentage of maximum opacification was calculated by the formula (A405 of pretreated sample/A405 of control) × 100. Lipid Analysis—Lipids were extracted using chloroform:methanol as described by Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Lipid class distribution was determined by thin-layer chromatography on thin rods developed with hexane:ethylether:acetic acid (80/20/0.5, v/v) for the neutral lipids and chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50/25/8/3, v/v) for phospholipid separation. The individual classes were quantitated using the Iatroscan MK-6 thin-layer chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector, and classes were identified by comparison with standards. AlphaScreen Binding Assays—The AlphaScreen technique for measuring biological interactions has been described in detail (23Zhang Y.M. Wu B. Zheng J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52935-52943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It measures energy transfer between a donor bead (streptavidin-coated) and acceptor bead (nickel-coated) that have been bound to biotinylated and histidine-tagged compounds, respectively. When the two components interact, excitation energy is transferred from the donor to the acceptor bead resulting in the emission of high amplitude fluorescence, i.e. the AlphaScreen signal. In our experiments, rSOF was engineered with a polyhistidine tag and the lipoproteins, VLDL, LDL, and HDL, as well as the purified apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were biotinylated using the EZ-Link NHS-sulfo-biotin kit from Pierce following the methods recommended by the manufacturer. The parameters of the binding assay for HDL-rSOF interactions were 100 nm rSOF and concentrations of biotinylated HDL ranging from 0 to 0.09 μg/ml. Concentrations of biotinylated VLDL and LDL ranged between 0 and 2.5 μg/ml in binding assays with rSOF. Binding assays between rSOF and purified apolipoproteins used 100 nm rSOF and concentrations of biotinylated apoA-I and apoA-II ranging between 0 and 0.05 μm. For the competitive inhibition experiments, 100 nm rSOF, 0.2 μg/ml biotinylated HDL, and concentrations of unlabeled apoA-I and apoA-II ranging between 0 and 0.8 μm were used. The biotinylated compounds (and unlabeled compounds when present) were mixed with rSOF for 30 min followed by the addition of streptavidin donor beads and nickel chelate acceptor beads (50 μg/ml final concentration for each). The reaction mixtures were then incubated for 1 h before being read by the Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer with excitation at 680 nm and emission at 600 nm. The binding constants were calculated using nonlinear equations for either one-site (Y = Bmax·X/(Kd + X)) or two-site (Y = Bmax1·X/(Kd1 + X) + Bmax2·X/(Kd2 + X)) binding, where Bmax is the maximal binding and Kd is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding. Ultracentrifugation of HDL—Untreated HDL or HDL treated overnight with 1 μg/ml rSOF were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 16 h at 15 °C in a Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge. The top layer (200 μl) of opaque material and the bottom fraction (200 μl) were collected, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. These materials were subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The lipid composition of the layers was determined as described above. Untreated HDL served as a control. Western Blots—The top and bottom layers generated by the ultracentrifugation experiments described above were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with bovine serum albumin and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-rSOF serum. The membrane was washed and incubated with a 1:7,500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After washing, immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL Western blot reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Lipoprotein Specificity of rSOF—We cloned, expressed, and purified rSOF, a recombinant, polyhistidine-tagged, truncated form of SOF in which the fibronectin-binding domain was deleted (Fig. 1). Previous studies show that this construct retains full ability to opacify serum and that the fibronectin-binding domain and the opacification domain of SOF are functionally independent (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The opacity reaction of rSOF was time- and dose-dependent with maximal activity occurring at ∼1 μg/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). The opacity reaction appeared to decrease at high concentrations of rSOF. However, high concentrations of rSOF did not alter the total amount of lipid released but rather reduced the size of the lipid particles (Fig. 2, D–F). The opacification assay, which measures the absorbance at 405 nm, relies on light scattering and is dependent upon particle size. Thus, as particle size decreases, so will the absorbance. To investigate the potential role of lipoproteins in the opacity reaction of rSOF, sera from two donors were absorbed with Liposorb beads to remove lipoproteins. This treatment reduced the opacity reaction of rSOF by 99% (A405 unabsorbed sera = 0.932 ± 0.20, A405 absorbed sera = 0.007 ± 0.011), indicating that one or more of the lipoproteins were the target of rSOF. To resolve which of the lipoproteins was the target, purified lipoproteins were incubated with rSOF overnight at 37 °C, and the opacification was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm (Fig. 2C). There was little or no increase in the absorbance when rSOF was added to LDL or VLDL, but there was a dramatic increase in the absorbance of HDL treated with rSOF. These results show that the opacification activity of SOF selectively targets HDL. Additional support for a role of HDL in these macroscopic reactions came from the finding that plasma from mice that do not express apoA-I was not opacified by rSOF (A405 = 0.035), whereas the plasma from control mice became opaque when treated with rSOF (A405 = 0.807). Thus, the opacity reaction of plasma from apoA-I-negative mice was less than 5% of the response of wild type plasma to rSOF. In addition to the absence of apoA-I, apoA-I–/– mice have dramatically reduced levels of HDL and reduced levels of apoA-II and ApoC, but they have increased levels of ApoE and apoA-IV (24Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 25Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The inability of rSOF to opacify plasma devoid of apoA-I supported the conclusion that HDL was the SOF target. rSOF Catalytic Activity—It has been proposed that SOF is an esterase that potentially would be capable of degrading the lipid components of the HDL particle (26Rowen R. J. Exp. Med. 1961; 114: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lipid compositions of untreated and rSOF-treated HDL were compared to determine whether there was any evidence for lipid degradation following rSOF treatment (Fig. 3A). The lipids of HDL mainly consist of cholesterol esters, cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and a trace of triglycerides (27Lund-Katz S. Liu L. Thuahnai S.T. Phillips M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If there was a significant decrease in the amount of one of the lipids, then there should also be a concomitant increase in its degradation products. For example, phospholipase hydrolysis of the phospholipids would increase the concentrations of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. We incubated HDL with 10 μg/ml rSOF for 18 h in triplicate, and the amount of phosphatidylcholine in the control without rSOF was 396 ± 60 μg/assay compared with 415 ± 57 μg/assay in the SOF-treated samples. Similarly, cholesterol ester was 428 ± 53 μg/assay in the control and 387 ± 73 μg/assay in the 10 μg/ml SOF-treated HDL. We also performed the experiment using 100 μg/ml rSOF and found the phosphatidylcholine levels were 414 ± 51 μg/assay and the cholesterol ester were 355 ± 81 μg/assay after an 18-h incubation. An example of the chromatographic analysis is shown in Fig. 3, A and B, illustrating that incubation of HDL with 100 μg/ml rSOF for 18 h did not result in a significant increase in either lysophosphatidylcholine or free fatty acids. These assays performed in the presence of very high concentrations of rSOF argue strongly against a lipase-like activity for the protein. In addition, a panel of lipase or phospholipase inhibitors did not block the serum opacity reaction (Table 1). Thus, rSOF does not alter the lipid composition of HDL and is not a lipase, phospholipase, or esterase.TABLE 1Effect of enzyme inhibitors on opacification of serum by rSOFTest agentConcentrationTargeted enzymesSerum opacity reaction% of controlTris-HCL0.1 mNA (control)100Me2SO5%NA (solvent control)95EGTA10 mmCalcium-dependent enzymes106Protease inhibitor mixtureaMixture of inhibitors containing (aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin.Various proteases109DCIC4.0 mmSerine proteases, PLA223AEBSF5.0 mmSerine proteases102Benzamidine5.0 mmSerine proteases97EACA4.0 mmSerine proteases93Soybean trypsin inhibitor1 mg/mlSerine proteases102Carboxypeptidase inhibitor2 mg/mlCarboxypeptidases90OBAA1.2 mmPLA296Quinacrine0.4 mmPLA2104D6090.9 mmPLC95Neomycin1.1 mmPLC, PLD109HELSS0.9 mmCalcium-independent PLA293a Mixture of inhibitors containing (aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Open table in a new tab It has also been suggested that SOF is an aspartic protease that induces opacification of serum by cleavage of apoA-I of HDL (16Saravani G.A. Martin D.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 56: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This possibility was examined by incubating rSOF with HDL overnight followed by gel electrophoresis to detect fragmentation or degradation of the apoA-I and apoA-II protein components. The results demonstrated that 10 μg/ml rSOF (10 times the concentration required for optimal opacification) did not produce fragmentation of either apoA-I or apoA-II (Fig. 3C). Various protease inhibitors were also tested for their ability to block the opacity reaction of rSOF (Table 1). The finding that a variety of protease inhibitors, including a mixture of protease inhibitors containing the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin A, had no inhibitory effect on the opacity reaction of rSOF supports the conclusion that rSOF is not a protease. Interestingly, one inhibitor, DCIC, did block 77% of the serum opacity reaction. In the experiments listed in Table 1, the inhibitors were added to a mixture of rSOF and serum. Thus, it was not clear whether DCIC was targeting rSOF directly or inhibiting a component associated with HDL that is activated by rSOF in some manner. For example, phospholipase A2 is associated with HDL (28Petrovic N. Grove C. Langton P.E. Misso N.L. Thompson P.J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1706-1713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, various concentrations of DCIC were added to serum or to rSOF and incubated for 3 h. DCIC has a half-life of 20 min, and less than 1% of the DCIC remained active after 3 h. The residual DCIC was removed by dialysis, and the DCIC-treated samples were analyzed for activity (Fig. 4A). DCIC-treated rSOF did not opacify serum, whereas DCIC-treated serum was readily opacified by rSOF. These data indicate that the inhibitory effect of DCIC was because of its interaction with rSOF. The finding that DCIC blocked the serum opacity reaction of rSOF but that other inhibitors with similar specificity failed to block this reaction raised a question concerning the mechanism of inhibition of rSOF by DCIC. DCIC inhibits phospholipase and serine protease activity by irreversible modification of the serine active site (29Harper J.W. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7200-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, DCIC also alters amino acids outside of the active site (30Rusbridge N.M. Beynon R.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, DCIC may modify a number of amino acid residues of rSOF and interfere with its binding to HDL. To test this hypothesis, rSOF was treated with DCIC, and its binding to HDL measured. DCIC-treated rSOF failed to bind to HDL (Fig. 4B), suggesting that DCIC did not interfere with an enzyme activity of rSOF but inhibited the opacity reaction of rSOF by blocking the interaction of rSOF with HDL. This concept was supported by the findings that none of the other phospholipase or serine protease inhibitors had any effect on the opacity reaction of rSOF and that rSOF did not alter the lipids or proteins of HDL. These data indicated that rSOF is neither a protease nor a lipase and suggested that the binding of rSOF to HDL was required to initiate the opacity reaction. Binding of rSOF to HDL, apoA-I, and apoA-II—Quantitative binding assays indicated that rSOF bound to HDL with high affinity (Fig. 5A). These data fit best to a two-site binding model (R2 = 0.997) with apparent Kd values for rSOF of 0.3 ± 0.1 and 27 ± 3 ng/ml (Fig. 5A). rSOF also bound to LDL and VLDL (Fig. 5B). These binding data fit best to single-site binding equation (R2 = 0.996) with apparent Kd values for rSOF of 0.2 ± 0.25 and 0.15 ± 0.03 μg/ml for LDL and VLDL, respectively. It is likely that the high affinity binding sites in HDL are found on one or more of its protein components, because the lipids of HDL are also found in other lipoproteins, whereas its major proteins are distinct. Competitive inhibition experiments demonstrated that both apoA-I and apoA-II blocked the binding of rSOF to HDL (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, rSOF bound to purified apoA-I (Kd 6 nm) and to purified apoA-II (Kd 30 nm) (Fig. 6, B and C). These data indicated that both apoA-I and apoA-II were the receptors for rSOF on HDL particles.FIGURE 6Binding of rSOF to apoA-I and apoA-II. A, various concentrations of apoA-I (closed circles) and apoA-II (open circles) were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of rSOF to HDL. B, the binding of biotinylated apoA-I to rSOF.

AlphaScreen binding assays and data analysis were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were performed in triplicate, and the standard deviation is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Morphological Changes in HDL—Electron micrographs showed that treatment of HDL with rSOF induced the formation of very large, lipid-like particles that appeared to be the result of the fusion of smaller lipid particles (Fig. 2E). If so, then the density of these particles should be quite different from untreated HDL and should migrate differently during centrifugation. Therefore, HDL was treated with 1 μg/ml rSOF and subjected to ultracentrifugation, and the top and bottom layers were collected and analyzed. In the untreated HDL samples, the lipids and apolipoproteins remained together and sedimented to the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 7A). In the rSOF-treated HDL samples, an opaque layer formed at the surface of the gradient corresponding to ∼75% of the lipids in the sample (Fig. 7A). The apolipoproteins along with 25% of the lipid were found in the bottom layer and only trace amounts of proteins in the top layer (Fig. 7, A and B). Lipid analyses of the top opaque layer indicated that its lipid profile was the same as untreated HDL, providing additional evidence that rSOF did not alter the lipid composition of HDL (data not shown). These findings suggested that rSOF induced changes in HDL that resulted in the formation of lipid particles that were essentially free of apolipoproteins, and it is these protein-deficient particles that are responsible for turning serum opaque because of their insolubility in aqueous media. Western blot analysis using anti-rSOF serum indicated that rSOF was associated with both the apolipoprotein fraction (50%) and the lipid-rich top layer (50%) (not shown). This finding verified the association of rSOF with apolipoproteins but also suggested that rSOF may interact to some extent with lipids. The amount of rSOF in this experiment (1 μg/ml) was 10-fold higher than the amount required for opacification (Fig. 2) and was sufficient to saturate the high affinity apolipoprotein binding sites (Fig. 5). This work establishes that SOF binds to the apolipoprotein components of HDL to trigger the macroscopic serum opacity reaction. Only HDL among the lipoproteins produced the opacity reaction, and rSOF did not opacify plasma from apoA-I-deficient mice. Our results showing that lack of hydrolysis of either lipids or proteins in HDL particles treated with rSOF differed from previous studies and suggested that hydrolytic enzymatic mechanisms do not account for the serum opacification reaction of SOF (14Krumwiede E. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 100: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Rowen R. Martin J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 70: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Saravani G.A. Martin D.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 56: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although DCIC is a hydrolase inhibitor that blocked the opacity reaction of rSOF, this inhibitor is not specific for hydrolase active sites and covalently modifies residues in other regions of proteins (30Rusbridge N.M. Beynon R.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our data show that DCIC-modified rSOF cannot bind to HDL (Fig. 4). rSOF bound to purified apoA-I and apoA-II, and these polypeptides blocked the binding of rSOF to HDL, leading to the conclusion that the SOF opacification domain interacts with HDL through apoA-I/apoA-II. apoA-I subunits span the surface of a mature particle, and HDL assembly is mediated by interactions between lipids and the hydrophobic face of the carboxyl-terminal amphipathic α-helix of apoA-I (27Lund-Katz S. Liu L. Thuahnai S.T. Phillips M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Rye K.A. Clay M.A. Barter P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 145: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). There is a large conformational change that occurs when apoA-I interacts with lipids and is incorporated into an HDL particle, reflecting a transition from 55% α-helical to 75% α-helical content (27Lund-Katz S. Liu L. Thuahnai S.T. Phillips M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We propose that the binding of rSOF to the apolipoproteins of HDL induces a conformational change that reduces their ability to maintain interactions with the lipids, resulting in the disruption of the particle and the release of lipids that fuse to form large, lipid particles that turn serum opaque. Although rSOF interacted with LDL and VLDL particles, this interaction was not accompanied by the dissolution of their structure or the formation of coalesced lipid droplets. The association of rSOF with the protein-deficient lipid particles suggests that rSOF binds to lipids. This property may account for the low affinity binding of rSOF to LDL and VLDL; however, the mechanism of rSOF interaction with these lipoproteins remains to be clarified. It is becoming increasingly apparent that bacterial infections alter the levels and structures of plasma lipoproteins. HDL is an anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic factor that neutralizes the proinflammatory responses caused by lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and acute phase response proteins such as C-reactive protein (20Wu A. Hinds C.J. Thiemermann C. Shock. 2004; 21: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Wadham C. Albanese N. Roberts J. Wang L. Bagley C.J. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Xia P. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2116-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Infections and shock can trigger events that result not only in the loss of the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL but also in the conversion of HDL to a proinflammatory form (33Khovidhunkit W. Kim M.S. Memon R.A. Shigenaga J.K. Moser A.H. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1169-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Exogenous HDL has been used effectively to combat sepsis and shock in animals (20Wu A. Hinds C.J. Thiemermann C. Shock. 2004; 21: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and ablate inflammatory responses in humans (34Pajkrt D. Doran J.E. Koster F. Lerch P.G. Arnet B. van der Poll T. ten Cate J.W. van Deventer S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), illustrating its importance in controlling these events. SOF is an established virulence factor in S. pyogenes (3Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Li Y. Chiang H.C. Thacker J.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Courtney H.S. Hasty D.L. Dale J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 936-947Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Courtney H.S.

Infect Immun. 2003; 71: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and although the importance of its carboxyl-terminal fibronectin-binding properties cannot be dismissed, the opacification domain of SOF disrupts HDL structure and may contribute to the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections by attenuating the anti-inflammatory functions of intact HDL.

https://openalex.org/W2067307015,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking their mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells) respond to this loss of genetic information by induction of a program of nuclear gene expression called the retrograde response. Expression of genes involved in multidrug resistance and sphingolipid biosynthesis is coordinately induced in ρ0 cells by the zinc cluster transcription factor Pdr3p. In this report, we identify a membrane protein involved in control of intracellular levels of a sphingolipid precursor as a transcriptional target of the Pdr3p-mediated retrograde response. These sphingolipid precursors are called long chain bases (LCBs) and increased LCB levels are growth inhibitory. This membrane protein has been designated Rsb1p and has previously been shown to act as a LCB transporter protein and to be a component of the endoplasmic reticulum. These earlier studies used an amino-terminal truncated form of Rsb1p. Here we employ a full-length form of Rsb1p and find that this protein is localized to the plasma membrane and is modified by N-linked glycosylation. Two glycosylation sites are present in the Rsb1p and both are required for normal LCB resistance. Mutational analysis of the RSB1 promoter revealed that two Pdr3p binding sites are present and both of these are required for normal retrograde induction of transcription. LCB tolerance is strongly increased in ρ0 cells but this increase is ablated in ρ0 rsb1Δ cells. Together, these data indicate Pdr3p activation of RSB1 transcription is an important feature of the retrograde response allowing normal detoxification of an endogenous sphingolipid precursor.

Sphingolipids are important lipid constituents of eukaryotic membranes. Key intermediates in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids are the long chain bases (LCBs). 2The abbreviations used are: LCB, long chain base; PHS, phytosphingosine; LCBP, long chain base phosphorylated form; PDRE, Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element; kbp, kilobase pair; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: LCB, long chain base; PHS, phytosphingosine; LCBP, long chain base phosphorylated form; PDRE, Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element; kbp, kilobase pair; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these LCBs are dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine (PHS) (reviewed in Ref. 1Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These LCBs are utilized by ceramide synthase to form ceramide that is a well known bioactive lipid (reviewed in Refs. 2Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar and 3Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). However, LCBs and their phosphorylated forms (LCBPs) have also recently been found to serve as potent signaling molecules. LCBs appear to act as inhibitors of proliferation, whereas increased LCBP levels stimulate growth (recently reviewed in Ref. 4Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Control of the biological levels of these signaling lipids is an essential feature for ensuring both normal lipid composition of membranes and proper metabolic regulation.The central importance of these signaling and structural lipids is likely to explain the multitude of regulatory mechanisms modulating their levels. These include enzymes like ceramidases that break down ceramide (5Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). More recent experiments in the yeast S. cerevisiae have identified a new membrane protein that is thought to efflux LCBs out of the cell. This protein has been designated Rsb1p (resistant to sphingoid bases) as it was identified as a high-copy suppressor of the PHS hypersensitivity of a dpl1Δ strain (8Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments provided evidence that Rsb1p stimulates the transport of radiolabeled dihydrosphingosine out of cells.Further analyses of Rsb1p made an interesting connection between this putative transporter protein and multidrug resistance in S. cerevisiae (9Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Disruption of the ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene PDR5 elevated PHS tolerance and induced transcription of the RSB1 gene. PDR5 is a major determinant of multidrug resistance and is transcriptionally regulated itself by the zinc cluster-containing transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p (see Ref. 10Moye-Rowley W.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 251-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar for a recent review). Previous microarray experiments have indicated that PDR5 and RSB1 (systematic locus name YOR049c) are among the most highly induced transcripts by the presence of hyperactive alleles of either PDR1 or PDR3 (11DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Devaux F. Marc P. Bouchoux C. Delaveau T. Hikkel I. Potier M.C. Jacq C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Analysis of pdr5Δ cells argued that loss of this ABC transporter led to the induction of Pdr1p but not Pdr3p activity with accompanying elevation in RSB1 transcription (9Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This transcriptional activation required the presence of at least one Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) located upstream of RSB1. Sucrose gradient experiments (9Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4949-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) coupled with previous indirect immunofluorescence experiments (8Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) led to the assignment of Rsb1p as an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum.We have previously found that two genes encoding enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis are transcriptionally responsive to loss of the mitochondrial genome (ρ0 cells). The signaling pathway linking nuclear gene expression with mitochondrial status has been designated retrograde regulation (see Ref. 13Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Mol.

Importantly, ρ0 cells also strongly induce expression of both PDR5 and RSB1 in response to loss of the mitochondrial genome in a strictly Pdr3p-dependent fashion (19Devaux F. Carvajal E. Moye-Rowley S. Jacq C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that ρ0 cells are highly resistant to drugs like cycloheximide because of this transcriptional induction of PDR5 (20Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Traven A. Wong J.M. Xu D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47844-47852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether retrograde signaling in ρ0 cells also leads to increased PHS tolerance, we have examined the PHS phenotype of ρ0 cells. Our experiments demonstrate that ρ0 cells induce RSB1 transcription in a Pdr3p-dependent fashion and exhibit a large increase in resistance to exogenous PHS challenge. Analyses of the RSB1 locus and protein indicate that the sequence deposited in the Saccharomyces Genome Data base contains an error in the amino terminus that leads to the production of a truncated protein lacking 28 amino acids from the N terminus. A full-length form of Rsb1p containing these additional 28 residues localizes to the plasma membrane, and fully complements rsb1Δ cells, unlike the truncated membrane protein. Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present in this 28-amino acid region and site-directed mutagenesis of these sites demonstrated that both must be present for normal Rsb1p function. These experiments provide new insight into the likely role of Rsb1p in control of PHS levels as well as illuminating the extensive interaction between the Pdr regulatory system and genes involved in sphingolipid homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media—The genotypes of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Transformants were selected on plates containing geneticin (200 μg/ml) and the genotype confirmed by PCR with the 5′ primer, TGCCGCAAATGGTACACGGTTTAG, and the 3′ primer, CAATGGTAGAAAGACACACACCTGCG.To generate the rsb1-Δ1::natMX4 allele, the plasmid p4339 (from Brenda Andrews) (26Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) was used as a template to amplify the natMX4 cassette. Primers were used that contained 40 nucleotides of RSB1 sequence either upstream or downstream of the RSB1 open reading frame along with 20 nucleotides that bind upstream or downstream of the natMX4 cassette. This cassette was transformed into S. cerevisiae. Transformants were selected on plates containing nourseothricin (200 μg/ml) and screened by PCR analysis.Plasmids—The 0.915-kbp RSB1 promoter fragment was amplified using primers 5′-ctagaattcttagagcgcgtgttgaaatatagtcac-3′ (-1000 RSB1 for) and 5′-cgcgggatccattttgaatttctcaacgt-3′ (rsb1-prom-del-1) having an EcoRI and a BamHI site, respectively. The EcoRI/BamHI-digested amplicon was then cloned into vector pSEYC102, which contains the lacZ gene, digested with the same enzymes. This clone was called pTA2 and was used for the lacZ assays. The RSB1 promoter was obtained from pTA2 by EcoRI/BamHI cleavage and the released promoter fragment was cloned in pRS316, yielding pKGTA1. This clone was used as a template to generate the different versions of the RSB1 open reading frame (ORF) clones. The sequence originally present in the Saccharomyces Genome Data base utilizes the second ATG present in the RSB1 ORF at residue 29 as the initiator codon. The form of Rsb1p expressed from this ATG is referred to as the Δ28 form here. The RSB1 ORF beginning from this downstream ATG (Δ28 form) was amplified using primers 5′-atggatccgtccaacgcaacaaat-3′ and 5′-ccgtagcggccgctgatataggcttcaatc-3′ with BamHI and NotI sites and cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen), yielding pKG Δ28. The BamHI/NotI 1.6-kbp fragment from pKGΔ28 was cloned in pKGTA1 digested with the same enzymes, yielding pSLP5. This construct (pSLP5) was used as a base template for the construction of the RSB1 and the upstream ATG RSB1 (uATG) clones. The uATG clone was constructed by placing a BamHI site at the ATG for the RSB1 ORF using the primer 5′-atggatccggtaccgaaccttcgt-3′ and introducing a NotI site 3′ to the ORF as described above for the Δ28 mutant with the same downstream primer. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO to form pSLP1. A 0.625-kbp fragment released on digestion with BamHI/XbaI was cloned into pSLP5 digested with the same enzymes to construct the full-length ORF and produce pSLP3. This strategy results in both the uATG and Δ28 forms of Rsb1p being expressed from the natural ATG of RSB1 but the Δ28 mutant lacks the wild-type Rsb1p residues corresponding to positions 2-28 in the primary translation product. To construct the wild-type RSB1 clone in pRS316 without the BamHI site, primers 5′-ctagaattcttagagcgcgtgttgaaatatagtcac-3′ and 5′-ccgtagcggccgctgatataggcttcaatc-3′ with EcoRI and NotI sites were used to amplify the entire RSB1 ORF and this PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO to generate pSLP2. The 1.9-kbp fragment released on digestion of pSLP2 with EcoRI was cloned in EcoRI-digested pSLP5, yielding pSLP4. All clones generated were sequenced to confirm their proper construction.The RSB1 clones described above were all tagged at their COOH termini with a 3× hemagglutinin (HA) cassette using the method described by Longtine et al. (27Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). The forward primer contained 50 nucleotides of the COOH-terminal RSB1 coding sequence followed by the F2 sequence (27Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar), the reverse primer contained 50 nucleotides of pRS316 sequence followed by the R1 primer sequence. With these primers the 3× HA-kanMX6 sequence was amplified from the corresponding pFA6a plasmid and co-transformed into wild-type cells along with RSB1 clones pSLP5 (Δ28 RSB1), pSLP3 (uATG RSB1), and pSLP4 (wt RSB1) linearized with NotI at the 3′-end of the RSB1 ORF. Transformants were selected on medium lacking uracil and then tested for geneticin (200 μg/ml) resistance. The 3× HA-tagged versions of the above clones were rescued from the above strain backgrounds and sequenced to confirm the fusion junction. The RSB1 clones (pSLP3, pSLP4, and pSLP5) were also tagged with enhanced GFP (eGFP) using the method described previously by Gerami-Nejad et al. (28Gerami-Nejad M. Berman J. Gale C.A. Yeast. 2001; 18: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Construction of the RSB1 N-Glycosylation Mutants—The aspargine residues at Asn-3 and Asn-6 were mutated to glutamine residues by site-directed mutagenesis using various primers. Primers incorporating the desired point mutations were synthesized and used for PCR amplification using Hi Fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). All the primers used had a BglII site placed immediately downstream of the ATG of the RSB1 ORF. The absence of the BglII site was used to confirm the generation of the final mutant clones. The reverse primer 5′-ATAAGAATgcggccgccCAATAAAGAGAACCTGTGGC-3′, with a NotI site used for amplification, was common for all the mutants. The following forward primers were used to generate the specific mutants: N3Q, 5′-ttcaaaatgagatctgTCCCAAGCAACAAATAATAC-3; N6Q, 5′-ttcaaaatgagatctgTCCAACGCAACACAAAATACGTTAGGCAGT-3′; and N3Q,N6Q, 5′-ttcaaaatgagatctgTCCCAAGCAACACAAAATACGTTAGGCAGT-3′. The wild-type RSB1 control for all the mutants also had a BglII site at the true ATG for RSB1 ORF and was amplified using the forward primer 5′-ttcaaaATGagatctgTCCAACGCAACAAATAATAC and the common reverse primer to generate the clone pSLP29. PCR amplicons (384 bp) generated using the different forward primers in combination with the common reverse primer using pSLP35 as the template DNA were cloned into TOPO 2.1 vector. These clones were then digested with BglII and NotI and the 384-bp fragment was cloned into the BamHI/NotI-digested uATG RSB1-3× HA clone (pSLP35). They were all transferred to pSLP35 finally as a 1.0-kb KpnI fragment to generate the final clones, namely, pSLP28-N3,6Q-3× HA pSLP32-N3Q-3× HA, and pSLP33-N6Q-3× HA. All the clones were sequenced to confirm the incorporation of the mutations. To construct eGFP fusion proteins, pSLP28 and pSL29 were digested with KpnI and cloned into KpnI-digested uATG RSB1-eGFP (pSLP10) to yield pSLP31 and pSLP30, respectively.Construction of the Reporter Plasmids—The wild-type RSB1-lacZ fusion plasmid (pTA2) was generated as described above. Overlap extension PCR mutagenesis was used to alter the PDREs in RSB1 (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR were performed with a wild-type RSB1 template and two different mutagenic primers (mutant bases are in uppercase) for either PDRE 1 (gcacaatcttttacaTCCtCGagagcattcttgctccg) or PDRE 2 (gctcggactctttTCtagaGAaagatatggtctcc) and the primer rsb1-prom-del-1 (see above). These products were purified and mixed with a product generated using the primers-1000 RSB1 for (see above) and PDREcom (CAACTATCGGAGCTGCCACA). Each pair of PCR products was then amplified using the two outside primers (-1000 RSB1 for and rsb1-prom-del-1) with the resulting single mutant RSB1 promoter cloned into pSEYC102 as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment. A point mutation introduced in PDRE 2 generating a XbaI site yielded pTA5. Replacement of PDRE 1 with a XhoI restriction site yielded pGK3. A mutant plasmid lacking both PDREs (pGK2) was produced using pTA5 as a template and the PDRE 1 mutant primer (see above) along with the primer PDRE1XhoIanti (cggagcaagaatgctCTcgAggatgtaaaagattgtgc) in a similar overlap extension strategy.Immunoblotting—Cells were grown to an A600 of 1 and whole cell extracts were prepared by the TWIRL buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8) extraction method. 5 OD units of each sample were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted using monoclonal anti-HA (1:1000) (Covance) and the vacuolar membrane protein Vph1p (1:1000) antibodies (Molecular Probes).Fluorescence Microscopy—Transformants in SEY6210 ρ+ and SEY6210 ρ0 containing the wild-type N3Q,N6Q and Δ28 RSB1-eGFP fusion plasmids were grown to an A600 of 0.5-0.8. 1 ml of cells was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of kill buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% NaN3). Cells were then visualized for eGFP fluorescence and Nomarski optics using an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) BX-60 microscope with a ×100 oil objective. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu (Shizuoka, Japan) ORCA charge-coupled device camera.Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation—Isolation and separation of cell membranes on sucrose density gradients in the presence of 10 mm EDTA from transformants in isogenic ρ+ and ρ0 cells expressing wild-type and Δ28 forms of Rsb1p was performed as described earlier (30Katzmann D.J. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were Western blotted using monoclonal anti-HA (1:1000), polyclonal anti-Kar2p (1:10,000), and monoclonal anti-Pma1p (1:1000, Abcam) antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000) and anti-rabbit antibody (1:12,000) followed by measurement of chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).PNGase F Treatment—Crude cell extracts were prepared as described for sucrose density gradient fractionation from cells expressing various forms of HA-tagged Rsb1p in ρ0 SEY6210. After centrifuging the cell extract at 2,000 × g for 3 min to remove unbroken cells, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane-enriched pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, + 5 μl of denaturation buffer + 5 μl of 10× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After denaturation, 5 μl of G7 buffer + 5 μl of Nonidet P-40 and 250 units of PNGase F were added. All the buffers including Nonidet P-40 were supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Control samples were treated identically except that no PNGase F was added. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 16-24 h. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the blot was probed with anti-HA antibody (1:1000). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000) followed by measurement of chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSPHS Resistance Depends on Mitochondrial Status—Previous DNA microarray experiments have suggested that RSB1 gene expression is strongly induced in S. cerevisiae cells lacking their mitochondrial genome (ρ0 status) (19Devaux F. Carvajal E. Moye-Rowley S. Jacq C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Traven A. Wong J.M. Xu D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4020-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To examine if ρ0 activation of RSB1 transcription can influence PHS tolerance, isogenic ρ+ and ρ0 strains were generated that varied according to the presence of the RSB1 gene. These strains were then compared for their relative PHS resistance by spot test assay (Fig. 1).Wild-type, ρ+cells were able to tolerate up to 10 μm PHS, whereas rsb1Δ strains failed to grow above 5 μm. Cells lacking the mitochondrial genome exhibited robust growth at 20 μm but this phenotype was dependent on the presence of the RSB1 gene. These data are consistent with the idea that transcriptional induction of RSB1 in ρ0 cells leads to PHS resistance. Other genes are likely to participate in this ρ0 elevation of PHS tolerance as the ρ0 rsb1Δ cells continued to grow at 10 μm, a concentration ρ+ rsb1Δ were unable to tolerate.RSB1 Expression Is Induced in ρ0 Cells in a Pdr3p-dependent Manner—The data described above are consistent with a model in which Pdr3p induces RSB1 transcription in ρ0 cells leading to elevated PHS resistance. To test this model, we constructed a lacZ gene fusion to the putative ATG for the RSB1 open reading frame based on sequence information from SGD. This clone was introduced into isogenic ρ+and ρ0 S. cerevisiae cells but we were unable to detect any β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). Comparison of the DNA sequences encoding the amino-terminal protein sequences from other Saccharomyces species suggested that the reported sequence for the S. cerevisiae RSB1 gene might contain an extra adenine residue 16 bp upstream from the predicted ATG. Removal of this adenine residue would extend the amino-terminal domain of Rsb1p by 28 residues that show strong sequence conservation with other fungal Rsb1p homologues. We directly sequenced this region of S. cerevisiae RSB1 and confirmed that the correct sequence lacked this adenine residue (data not shown). Additionally we constructed a lacZ gene fusion to the new ATG present at the start of the RSB1 ORF and found that this fusion expressed β-galactosidase activity. We have used this gene fusion as an indicator plasmid to evaluate RSB1 expression in the studies reported below.This RSB1-lacZ reporter gene was introduced into a series of isogenic strains to evaluate RSB1 expression in response to loss of the mitochondrial genome and different alleles of PDR1 and PDR3. We also tested the PHS tolerance of these same strains (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Phytosphingosine tolerance responds to PDR gene dosage. A, an isogenic series of strains lacking the indicated PDR genes was grown to mid-log phase and then tested by placing on media containing various concentrations of PHS. B, these same strains were transformed with the RSB1-lacZ reporter plasmid and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described (25Guarente L.

Cardiotoxins (CTXs) are major components of cobra venoms that belong to the Ly-6 protein family and are implicated in tissue damage. The interaction of the major CTX from Taiwan cobra, i.e. CTX A3, with sulfatides in the cell membrane has recently been shown to induce pore formation and cell internalization and to be responsible for cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes (Wang, C.-H., Liu, J.-H., Lee, S.-C., Hsiao, C.-D., and Wu, W.-g. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 656-667). We show here that one of the non-cytotoxic CTXs, i.e. CTX A5 or cardiotoxin-like basic polypeptide, from Taiwan cobra specifically bound to αvβ3 integrin and inhibited bone resorption activity. We found that both membrane-bound and recombinant soluble αvβ3 integrins bound specifically to CTX A5 in a dose-dependent manner. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that human soluble αvβ3 bound to CTX A5 with an apparent affinity of ∼0.3 μm. Calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells, which constitutively express αvβ3, showed a CTX A5 binding profile similar to that of membrane-bound and soluble αvβ3 integrins, suggesting that endothelial cells are a potential target for CTX action. We tested whether CTX A5 inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, a process known to be involved in αvβ3 binding and inhibited by RGD-containing peptides. We demonstrate that CTX A5 inhibited both activities at a micromolar range by binding to murine αvβ3 integrin in osteoclasts and that CTX A5 co-localized with β3 integrin. Finally, after comparing the integrin binding affinity among CTX homologs, we propose that the amino acid residues near the two loops of CTX A5 are involved in integrin binding. These results identify CTX A5 as a non-RGD integrin-binding protein with therapeutic potential as an integrin antagonist.

The mechanisms for CTX-induced perturbation of the wound healing process and severe tissue damage are unknown. It is not clear whether there are cellular receptors for CTXs, although other cobra venom components such as secretory phospholipase A2 are known to have diverse targets for their actions by involving glycosaminoglycans, protein receptors, and membrane lipids (13Boilard E.

CTXs are all β-sheet basic polypeptides of 60-62 amino acid residues with a three-fingered loop-folding topology and are members of the Ly-6 protein family. Members of this family share one or several repeat units of the Ly-6 domain, which is defined by a distinct disulfide bonding pattern of between 8 and 10 cysteine residues (15Tsetlin V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This protein family can be divided into two subfamilies. One subfamily includes the secreted single domain snake cytotoxins (e.g. CTXs and neurotoxins), which possess only eight cysteines and no glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring signal sequence. Another subfamily comprises glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein receptors with 10 cysteine residues (e.g. urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor with three Ly-6 domains (16Adermann K.

We have previously reported that the uPA receptor binds to several integrins and that this interaction plays a critical role in signal transduction from uPA and the uPA receptor (39Tarui T.

Based on the structural similarity between CTX and the uPA receptor, we hypothesized that integrins may be involved in the action of CTXs. In the present study, we demonstrate that several CTXs specifically bound to αvβ3 integrins. Of all CTX homologs with known three-dimensional structures tested, non-cytotoxic CTX A5 from Taiwan cobra (Naja atra) exhibited the strongest binding to human αvβ3 at a Kd of ∼0.3 μm. We also show that CTX A5 binding to αvβ3 effectively inhibited bone resorption and differentiation of murine osteoclasts. Comparison of the binding affinity of all studied CTXs for αvβ3 revealed a potential role for the amino acid residues located at the two loops of the three-fingered CTXs. These results suggest a potential role for integrins in the actions of CTXs and that non-RGD CTX A5 has therapeutic potential as an integrin antagonist. Materials—CTXs were purified from the crude venom of N. atra, Naja mossambica, and Naja nigricollis by SP-Sephadex C-25 ion exchange chromatography, followed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C18 column as described previously (40Chien K.-Y.

The fibrinogen γ-chain C-terminal globular domain (γC; amino acids 151-411) was synthesized in bacteria as an insoluble protein and refolded as described previously (42Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble αvβ3 was synthesized in CHO-K1 cells using the soluble αv and β3 expression constructs provided by Dr. Tim Springer (Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described (20Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-human αvβ3 integrin monoclonal antibody LM609 was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Medium 200 (catalog no. M-200-500) and low serum growth supplement (catalog no. S-003-10) were purchased from Cascade Biologics for testing cell proliferation under low serum conditions. Rabbit anti-human β3 integrin polyclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. Recombinant mouse RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The BD BioCoat™ Osteologic™ bone cell culture multitest system was obtained from BD Biosciences. The GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were purchased from American Peptide Co. Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Naphthol AS-MX phosphate and fast red violet LB salt were obtained from Sigma. Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human β3 integrin (designated β3-CHO cells) have been described previously (43Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). β3-CHO cells express a hamster αv/human β3 integrin hybrid. As a control, CHO cells were transfected with the pBJ-1 vector together with the neomycin gene and were selected for G418 resistance (designated mock-transfected CHO cells). Calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells (CCL-209, between passages 17 and 23) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. RAW 264.7 murine monocytic cells (American Type Culture Collection TIB-71) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Binding of Soluble αvβ3 Integrin to CTXs—Binding assays were performed as described previously (43Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 100 μl of 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.4) containing CTXs at 1∼5 μm and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The remaining protein-binding sites were blocked by incubation with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Soluble horseradish peroxidase-conjugated αvβ3 in 50 μl of HEPES/Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 10 mm cation or 5 mm EDTA was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After non-bound soluble integrins were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound integrins were quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm and developed by adding the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate for horseradish peroxidase. Cell Adhesion, Proliferation, and Viability Assays—The 96-well microtiter plates were coated with CTXs as described above. In adhesion assays, cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of HEPES/Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 1 mm cation were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After non-bound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (44Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For CTX-induced cytotoxicity, we defined cell proliferation for the long time effect (24 or 48 h) and cell viability for the short time effect (2 h). CPAE cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with CTXs at the indicated concentrations in 96-well cell culture plates at 37 °C for 48 h. Proliferation of CPAE cells was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, after culture, MTT solution (2 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The precipitated dye was solubilized by dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured. The absorbance measured at 570 nm was proportional to the number of living cells in culture. Inhibition of CTX-αvβ3 Interaction by γC—γC (10 μg/ml) (45Yokoyama K. Erickson H.P. Ikeda Y. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16891-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was immobilized on the 96-well plates. Soluble αvβ3 integrin was added to the wells in the presence of CTXs at various concentrations. Bound integrin was detected in binding assays as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Studies—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on Biacore X instruments (Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). αvβ3 integrin was immobilized on a Biacore CM5 chip at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min by the amine coupling method (46O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Peck K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In general, the dextran surface was activated by injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.39 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride for 7 min αvβ3 (in 10 mm acetate (pH 4.0) and preincubated with 1 mm Mn2+) was injected over the activated surface for 7 min. Finally, 35 μlof 1 m ethanolamine was used to deactivate the surface. The difference in the base line before and after immobilization accounts for the integrin immobilized. One resonance unit corresponds to 1 pg of protein accumulated per mm2. The reference surface was activated by the same activation/deactivation procedure except without injection of the integrin solution. Because of the relatively small size of CTXs (∼7 kDa) compared with integrin (∼200 kDa), a high surface density integrin surface (∼5000 resonance units) was prepared to observe the dominant binding response. All of the observed binding responses were found to be fast; and therefore, there was no significant mass transport effect under the experimental conditions. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C at a continuous flow rate of 40 μl/min with HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20). The equilibrium binding response of CTX, which was the response difference between the integrin-immobilized surface and the reference surface, was used to estimate the binding affinity. Upon titration with various CTX concentrations, the binding response was not a simple Langmuir equilibrium binding isotherm. The binding affinities were determined from the slopes of the Scatchard plots at the reported concentration range. Osteoclast Differentiation Assays—RAW 264.7 cells (2 × 103 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well plates in the presence of RANKL (50 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 5 days with a change to fresh medium every 2 or 3 days. Osteoclast-like cells were evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. TRAP staining was performed according to Evans et al. (47Evans R.A. Dunstan C.R. Baylink D.J. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1979; 2: 179-185Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After the culture period, adherent cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then stained for 30 min for TRAP activity with 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate as a substrate and 0.6 mg/ml fast red violet LB salt as a stain. This staining was performed in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 50 mm sodium tartrate, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. TRAP-positive MNCs with more than three nuclei were considered to be osteoclast-like cells and were counted under a microscope. For measurement of TRAP intensity, the plates were scanned by a transparent light scanner, and the red color image was extracted from the scanned image using ImageJ and is represented here as TRAP intensity (48Hotokezaka H.

Bone Resorption Assays—Bone resorption assays were performed according to Ariyoshi et al. (49Ariyoshi W. Takahashi T. Kanno T. Ichimiya H. Takano H. Koseki T. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18967-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 10 days with RANKL (50 ng/ml), M-CSF (10 ng/ml), and various concentrations of CTX A5 on BD BioCoat™ Osteologic™ multitest slides, which are calcium phosphate ceramic thin film-coated quartz disks, to quantify osteoclastic cell-mediated mineral resorption. After the culture period, cells were removed using 6% NaOCl and 5.2% NaCl. The resorption area was observed under a light microscope and counted using ImageJ. Osteoclastic Cell Viability—Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay. RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 103 cells/well 1 day before the experiment and then stimulated with RANKL and M-CSF. Stimulated cells were cultured in the presence or absence of CTX A5 for 5 days. Confocal Microscopy—Rhodamine-labeled CTX A5 was prepared as described previously (12Wang C.-H. Wu W.-g. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3169-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Macrophages were cultured with RANKL and M-CSF for 5 days. To monitor the location of CTX A5, 5 μm rhodamine-labeled CTX A5 was applied to the culture in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 5 min at 37 °C before fixation in formaldehyde. After CTX A5 was applied and then washed with 1% BSA in HBSS (10Wang C.-H. Liu J.-H. Lee S.-C. Hsiao C.-D. Wu W.-g. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 656-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), β3 integrin was detected using anti-β3 integrin polyclonal antibody dissolved in HBSS with 1% BSA and washed twice with HBSS with 1% BSA and once with HBSS. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was then applied. Co-localization is depicted in yellow. Images were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a full-width half-maximum of 0.6 μm to set a pinhole size. Scanning Electron Microscopy—After removing cells with NaOCl and NaCl as described above, a BD BioCoat™ Osteologic™ multitest slide was treated by ultrasonication in water for 0.5 h. It was then allowed to dry in vacuum before being coated with gold and examined by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4700) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and an emission current of 9500 nA (50Gentzsch C. Delling G. Kaiser E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 72: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We tested whether recombinant soluble αvβ3 integrin binds to immobilized CTXs from Taiwan cobra venom in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, all CTXs, i.e. CTX A1 to A6, exhibited detectable binding compared with the positive control flavoridin and the negative control BSA. Soluble αvβ3 bound to immobilized CTX A5 most efficiently. We determined how strongly the soluble CTXs bound to immobilized αvβ3 in SPR studies. We immobilized soluble αvβ3 by amine coupling on a biosensor chip and measured the CTX binding to the chip surface. SPR measurement (Fig. 1B) confirmed the high affinity of CTX A5 for αvβ3 with an apparent dissociation constant of ∼0.3 μm. As shown in the biosensor response and related Scatchard plots (Fig. 1, B and C), CTXs bound to αvβ3 with different affinities (CTX A5 > A3 > A2 and A4 > A1 and A6) in a dose-dependent manner. For CTX A6, which exhibited the weakest response, the Scatchard plot at low concentration range indicated a binding affinity of ∼15 μm. Therefore, there is a difference of ∼2 orders of magnitude in terms of CTX affinity for αvβ3. Although other CTXs such as CTX A3 target sulfatides and induce CTX pore formation in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes, CTX A5 lacks observable cytotoxicity (40Chien K.-Y. Chiang C.M. Hseu Y.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3252-3259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is thus known as a cardiotoxin-like basic polypeptide. We examined whether CTX A5 acts as an integrin ligand in more biological systems. We first studied whether CHO cells expressing recombinant αvβ3 integrin (designated β3-CHO cells) adhere to the CTX A5-coated surface. We found that β3-CHO cells adhered to the CTX A5-coated surface in a dose-dependent manner at higher levels compared with control CHO cells transfected with vector only (designated mock-transfected CHO cells) (Fig. 2). These results suggest that αvβ3 is involved in the binding of CTX A5 to the cell surface. Because mock-transfected CHO cells showed low level adhesion, it is possible that other integrins or non-integrin receptors may also be involved in the binding of CTX A5 to the cell surface. Soluble αvβ3 integrin bound to immobilized CTX A5, but not significantly to CTX A6 (Fig. 3B; for a sequence comparison between CTXs A5 and A6, see Fig. 3A). Saturated binding was observed for CTX A5 with an apparent affinity of ∼1 μm. Mn2+ (10 mm) or Mg2+ (10 mm) enhanced its binding to CTX A5 by ∼5- and 2-fold, respectively, and EDTA significantly reduced the binding of αvβ3 integrins to CTX (Fig. 3C). Mn2+ and Mg2+ enhanced the binding of soluble αvβ3 to CTX A6 and the flavoridin disintegrin as well. These results suggest that the cation dependence of CTX A5 is similar to that of other known integrin ligands. We tested whether CTXs compete for binding to soluble αvβ3 integrin with γC. As shown in Fig. 4, CTX A5 competed with γC for binding to αvβ3, but CTX A6 did not, consistent with the observation that CTX A6 shows weak binding to αvβ3. These results suggest that CTXs share a common binding site in αvβ3 with γC. We investigated whether the difference in integrin binding among CTXs is related to their cytotoxicity. CPAE cells constitutively express αvβ3 integrin on their surface. As shown in Fig. 5A, CPAE cells bound to a CTX-coated plate in a manner similar to β3-CHO cells. This suggests that αvβ3 is indeed a predominant receptor for CTX binding to CPAE cells. In this experiment, we also included CTX A3 for comparison because we have shown recently that CTX A3-induced cell death of cardiomyocytes depends on the binding of CTX A3 to sulfatides, a glycosph"

In this study, we explored the role of Fyn in haloperidol-induced catalepsy, an animal model of the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics. Haloperidol induced catalepsy and muscle rigidity in the control mice, but these responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Expression of the striatal dopamine D2 receptor, the main site of haloperidol action, did not differ between the two genotypes. Fyn activation and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, as measured by Western blotting, were induced after haloperidol injection of the control mice, but both responses were significantly reduced in Fyn-deficient mice. Dopamine D2 receptor blockade was shown to increase both NR2B phosphorylation and the NMDA-induced calcium responses in control cultured striatal neurons but not in Fyn-deficient neurons. Based on these findings, we proposed a new molecular mechanism underlying haloperidol-induced catalepsy, in which the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist induces striatal Fyn activation and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B alters striatal neuronal activity, thereby inducing the behavioral changes that are manifested as a cataleptic response.

Haloperidol-induced responses are also dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) activity, because prior administration of the NMDA-R antagonist MK-801 attenuates haloperidol-induced catalepsy (3Moore N.A.

Brain Res. 1998; 813: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but infusing the striatum with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, attenuates both the tyrosine phosphorylation and the motor response induced by dopaminergic deprivation (13Oh J.D. Russell D.S. Vaughan C.L. Chase T.N. Russell D. Brain Res. 1998; 813: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs) and is associated with the NMDA-R at postsynaptic densities. Fyn phosphorylates NMDA-R subunits and modifies their channel activity (14Salter M.W. Kalia L.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). One of the NMDA-R subunits, NR2B, is preferentially phosphorylated by Fyn, and its phosphorylation has been implicated in several brain functions, including ethanol tolerance, long term potentiation, and seizure susceptibility (15Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16Yaka R. Phamluong K. Ron D. J.

The Tyr-1472 of NR2B is a particularly key site for Fyn-mediated phosphorylation (17Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol.

To investigate the role of Fyn in the cataleptic behavior induced by haloperidol, we studied these haloperidol effects in Fyn-deficient mice and biochemically analyzed the Fyn-mediated signal transduction initiated by haloperidol. Based on our results, we discuss the significance of Fyn activation in haloperidol-induced catalepsy within the scope of signal transduction from D2-R inhibition to modulation of the extrapyramidal system. Animals—Fyn tyrosine kinase-deficient mice were generated by inserting the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) into the reading frame of the fyn gene as described previously (20Yagi T. Shigetani Y. Okado N. Tokunaga T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3343-3351PubMed Google Scholar). Because the lacZ introduced is expressed in both heterozygous (+/fynZ) and homozygous (fynZ/fynZ) mice, heterozygous mice were mainly used as the controls instead of wild-type mice to compensate for the possible effect of lacZ expression as a foreign gene. The background of this mutant's strain is C57BL/6J. Genotypes were analyzed by the PCR. All animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions as described previously (15Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). All experimental procedures were in accordance with the 1996 National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, and the National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry. Pharmacological Agents—Haloperidol, the dopamine D2-R-selective antagonist L-741,626 (21Kulagowski J.J. Broughton H.B. Curtis N.R. Mawer I.M. Ridgill M.P. Baker R. Emms F. Freedman S.B. Marwood R. Patel S. Ragan C.I. Leeson P.D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1941-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and the D2-R-selective agonist (–)-quinpirole were purchased from Sigma. The drugs were administered by intraperitoneal injection in a volume of 10 μl/g body weight. All solutions were prepared immediately prior to the experiments. To exclude the effect of drug tolerance, no animals were used more than once in the pharmacological experiments. Antibodies—Goat polyclonal anti-D2-R antibody (N19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). A mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Tyr(P)-100) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phosphorylation site-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody against p-Src (Y418) and p-Src (Y529) was obtained from BIO-SOURCE (Camarillo, CA) and against p-NR2B (Y1472) was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NR2B antibody was a gift from Dr. Masahiko Watanabe (22Watanabe M. Fukaya M. Sakimura K. Manabe T. Mishina M. Inoue Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Anti-Src mouse monoclonal antibody (GD11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Fyn rat monoclonal antibody (γC3) was raised by Dr. Masahiro Yasuda (23Yasunaga M. Yagi T. Hanzawa N. Yasuda M. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Miyauchi Y. Nishikawa S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The anti-βIII tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Assessment of Catalepsy—Catalepsy was measured by a bar test (24Boulay D. Depoortere R. Oblin A. Sanger D.J. Schoemaker H. Perrault G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 391: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The test was carried out 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of haloperidol (0–1.0 mg/kg) or L-741,626 (0–10 mg/kg). A 3-mm-diameter wooden bar was fixed horizontally 4 cm above the floor of a Plexiglas cage. The animals were placed inside the test cage and allowed to acclimatize for 5 min prior to performing the bar test. Both forepaws were then gently placed on the bar, and the length of time during which each mouse maintained the initial position was measured (maximum cut-off time, 180 s). Analysis of Rigidity—Muscle rigidity after haloperidol administration was assessed by a mechanographic technique using a modified device designed for rat experiments (25Lorenc-Koci E. Wolfarth S. Ossowska K. Exp. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mouse was placed in a narrow, well ventilated plastic tube to restrict body movement, and one hind leg was bound to a force sensor (AD4937-5N, A & D Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) that records linear reciprocating motion (15-mm distance, 15 cycles/min) via a crank and motor. The raw data from the force sensor were analyzed on a Macintosh computer connected to an A/D converter and software (PowerLab 4s, chart version 3.6 ADInstruments, Mountain View, CA), and the resistance of the flexor and extensor muscles to forced extension and flexion of the knee and ankle joint was measured. The mice were attached to the above device, and the difference in muscle resistance before and after the administration of vehicle or haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) was recorded. The mean amplitude of 10 consecutive waves at each time point was calculated. Spikes that indicated spontaneous movements of the mice were excluded from the count. In Situ Hybridization Histochemistry—The distribution of D2-R gene expression in the striatum of the control and Fyn-deficient mice was compared. The probe was prepared as follows. A cDNA fragment encoding the sequence of mouse D2-R (1.3 kbp, a gift from Dr. T. Kaneko, Kyoto University) was cloned into the pBluescript II/KS–vector, and the clone was digested and used as a DNA template to synthesize an antisense or sense digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe. The probe was prepared with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase and a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Staining was performed as reported previously (26Yuasa S. Anat. Embryol. 1996; 194: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The sense cRNA probe was employed as the control, and no signals in the brain were detected with it. Immunoblot Analysis—One hour after administration of the vehicle, haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg), or L-741,626 (5 mg/kg), the striatum was immediately dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The striatum was placed in buffer containing 10% sucrose, 3% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland). Samples were spun down (20,000 × g, 15 min) to remove insoluble material, and the protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). After the addition of 40 mm dithiothreitol, the samples were boiled for 5 min, and an equal amount of protein (40 μg per lane) from each sample was separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) or 10% skim milk in TBS-T for 1 h and probed with primary antibodies (1:750 dilution for TH, 1:4000 for anti-βIII tubulin, and 1:1000 for other antibodies). After washing three times with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-goat, anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse IgG, 1:20,000 dilution, all purchased from The Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). After washing three times, the signals were detected with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and ATTO Cool Saver (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were then incubated with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min, washed, blocked, and reprobed with other antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The procedures for immunoprecipitation were as described previously (15Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Striatum obtained 1 h after vehicle or haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) administration was placed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. Samples were spun down to remove insoluble material, and the protein concentration was determined. Equal amounts of protein (500 μg) were then used for immunoprecipitation. Samples were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of the anti-Fyn or anti-Src antibody, and then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose. After three washes with lysis buffer, the pelleted protein G-Sepharose was boiled for 5 min in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 15 μl of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were subsequently blotted onto Immobilon, probed with each antibody, and visualized as described above. Primary Cultures of Striatal Neurons—Primary cultures of striatal neurons were prepared from the fetal striata of wild-type and Fyn-deficient mice at embryonic day 17. Striata from 6 to 8 fetal brains were dissected and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and then were transferred into a dissociation medium containing Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.05% DNase I, and 1% trypsin/EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 7 min. After sedimentation, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The tissue was gently placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.05% DNase I and triturated with a plastic pipette until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. After centrifugation at 130 × g for 8 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). The cell cultures were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2 on 0.1% polyethyleneimine-coated cover glasses in 1.9 cm2/well dishes (Nunclon, Nunc). Cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cultured striatal neurons were identified immunocytochemically with anti-GAD65 antibody (Chemicon) and anti-MAP2 antibody (Sigma). More than 95% of both the wild-type and Fyn-deficient neurons were double-labeled by anti-GAD65 and anti-MAP2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Calcium Imaging—Calcium imaging was carried out as described previously (27Uchino S. Watanabe W. Nakamura T. Shuto S. Kazuta Y. Matsuda A. Nakajima-Iijima S. Kudo Y. Kohsaka S. Mishina M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, striatal primary cells were incubated with 10 μm fura-2/AM (Dojindo) for 1 h at 30°C in balanced salt solution (BSS) consisting of (in mm) NaCl 130, KCl 5.4, glucose 5.5, HEPES 10, and CaCl2 2, and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. After washing, the cover glasses that contained cultured neurons were mounted on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX50; Olympus) and perfused with BSS at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The perfusion medium was prewarmed and maintained at 32.6 ± 1.1 °C in the measurement dish. Fluorescence images obtained by alternate excitation with 340 and 380 nm light through the ×20 objective lens and CCD camera (C2400-8; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) were fed into an image processor (Argus 50, Hamamatsu) for ratiometric analysis. The effect of the D2-R antagonist L-741,626 on the channel activity of NMDA receptors was investigated in the presence of the selective D2-R agonist quinpirole in the perfusion medium. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, quinpirole alone had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the channel activity of the NMDA receptors of the striatal primary neurons of the control mice consistent with its inhibitory effect reported in the striatal slice culture (28Cepeda C. Buchwald N.A. Levine M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9576-9580Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Quinpirole was observed to have almost the same degree of the inhibitory effect on Fyn-deficient neurons (49% decrease at 50 μm). Preparation of Protein Samples from the Cultured Neurons—Striatal neurons were cultured in 1.9 cm2/well dishes (Nunclon, Nunc) as described above. Each solution used in the following experiments was pre-warmed to 37 °C in a water bath. Culture dishes were warmed on a heat block to 37 °C. The culture medium was removed, and the cultured cells were incubated with BSS for at least 5 min. The cells were then incubated with the following: 1) BSS for 7 min followed by incubation in quinpirole (50 μm) in BSS for 7 min, or 2) in quinpirole (50 μm) in BSS for 7 min followed by a mixture of quinpirole (50 μm) and L-741,626 (10 μm) in BSS for 7 min. The solution was removed, and the cells were immediately lysed in 150 μl of SDS sample buffer. Statistical Analyses—The results of the catalepsy assessment and calcium imaging were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney U test. The results of the muscle rigidity analysis were evaluated by a two-way repeated measure ANOVA. The results of Western blotting were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Bartlett's test. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Haloperidol induced catalepsy in the +/fynZ mice, and the duration of the catalepsy increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). By contrast, the duration of the catalepsy in the fynZ/fynZ mice was significantly shorter (Fig. 1). At the 1.0 mg/kg dose, there was no difference in the cataleptic response between the +/fynZ mice and the wild-type mice (154.5 ± 47.1 s). The D2-R-selective antagonist L-741,626 was confirmed to induce catalepsy in the control mice (supplemental Fig. S3), as reported previously in rats (29Millan M.J. Dekeyne A. Rivet J.M. Dubuffet T. Lavielle G. Brocco M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1063-1073PubMed Google Scholar), but the duration of the catalepsy was significantly reduced in fynZ/fynZ mice (supplemental Fig. S3). Because there was no significant difference in the temporal patterns of the locomotor activity between +/fynZ mice and fynZ/fynZ mice (30Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kagiyama A. Niki H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the altered cataleptic response in the fynZ/fynZ mice was concluded not to be due to a locomotion defect. Because Fyn-deficient mice are more fearful than control mice (31Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Watanabe S. Niki H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we suspected that they might avoid a procedure like the “bar test” and that the duration of catalepsy would be misleadingly short as a result. We therefore also measured muscular rigidity to minimize any such emotional influence on the response to haloperidol. Haloperidol induced a marked increase in hind limb muscle rigidity in the +/fynZ mice that was detectable as early as 45 min after administration (1.0 mg/kg) and persisted for more than 2 h, but no increase in muscle rigidity was detected in the fynZ/fynZ mice (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). To exclude the possibility that the failure to respond to haloperidol was because of a difference in D2-R expression, in situ hybridization of D2-R mRNA and Western blotting of D2-R protein were performed on the striatum of +/fynZ and fynZ/fynZ mice. As shown in Fig. 3, no clear difference was observed in either striatal D2-R gene expression (Fig. 3A) or the protein level (Fig. 3B). Western blotting analysis of striatal TH was also performed to determine whether there was any difference between the two genotypes in the abundance of the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, but little difference in the amount of TH protein was found (Fig. 3C). The effect of haloperidol on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the striatum of the +/fynZ and fynZ/fynZ mice was compared by Western blotting. One hour after haloperidol administration (1.0 mg/kg), a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including 60-, 110-, and 180-kDa proteins, was observed in the striatum of the +/fynZ mice but not of the fynZ/fynZ mice (Fig. 4A). Because the 60-kDa protein corresponds in size to SFKs, we measured tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation-related Tyr-418 residue on SFKs. As shown in Fig. 4B, phospho-Tyr-418 increased after haloperidol injection of the +/fynZ mice, but no such effect was observed in the fynZ/fynZ mice. Basal Tyr(P)-418 immunoreactivity was much lower in the fynZ/fynZ mice. Because the anti-pY418 antibody recognizes both Fyn and Src, we immunoprecipitated Fyn and Src, and we examined the phosphorylation of the activation-related residue, Tyr-418, and of the inhibition-related residue, Tyr(P)-529, by Western blotting in the +/fynZ mice. As shown in Fig. 4C, Fyn but not Src was activated at Tyr-418 by haloperidol, and no change was observed in the phosphorylation at Tyr-529. Because the 180-kDa protein corresponds in size to the NR2B subunit, we also measured the phosphorylation of the Tyr-1472 of NR2B, the key phosphorylation site, by Fyn. The results showed that phospho-Tyr-1472 increased in the +/fynZ mice but not in the fynZ/fynZ mice (Fig. 4D). The basal level of Tyr(P)-1472 in the fynZ/fynZ mice was not significantly different from the basal level in the +/fynZ mice. Marked increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 60-, 110-, and 180-kDa proteins and up-regulation of Tyr(P)-418 and Tyr(P)-1472 were also observed following L-741,626 administration to the control mice, but no such effects were observed in the fynZ/fynZ mice (supplemental Fig. S5). There were no sex differences in the results of either the behavioral or biochemical studies (data not shown). The same findings in regard to the haloperidol-induced enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation were also observed in the wild-type mice, and no clear difference was detected between +/fynZ mice and wild-type mice (data not shown). To investigate whether the Fyn-mediated increase in NMDA receptor phosphorylation by D2-R blockade affects NMDA receptor activity, we prepared striatal primary cultures and assessed the channel activity of NMDA receptors by the calcium imaging method. After 4–7 days of culture, we loaded 10 μm fura-2/AM into the primary cells and measured the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by calcium fluorimetry. Exposure to 3 μm NMDA/10 μm glycine for 30 s induced a robust response in more than 95% of the cells analyzed, and repeated applications of NMDA/glycine at 5-min intervals evoked reproducible responses (data not shown), indicating little desensitization of the NMDA receptors under our experimental conditions. We first examined the effect of a D2-R-selective antagonist, L-741,626, on the channel activity of NMDA receptors of wild-type neurons in the presence of a D2-R-selective agonist, quinpirole (50 μm). After confirming that the responses evoked were reproducible by two successive applications of 3 μm NMDA, 10 μm glycine (control responses), we added 10 μm L-741,626 to the perfusion buffer BSS. After 5 min, we measured the 3 μm NMDA, 10 μm glycine-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and compared them with the control responses. As shown in Fig. 5A, larger responses than the control responses were detected in the presence of L-741,626, but in some neurons, almost identical responses were observed both in the presence and absence (control) of L-741,626. The distribution of changes in [Ca2+]i responses after the addition of L-741,626 is shown in Fig. 5B (open bars). After the addition of L-741,626, a large number of neurons (74.7%) showed larger responses than the control responses (mean change, 125.7 ± 34.1%). To determine whether the larger NMDA/glycine-induced responses induced by L-741,626 were mediated by Fyn, we performed the same experiments on primary cultures prepared from Fyn-deficient mice. After the addition of L-741,626, only 46.6% of the Fyn-deficient neurons showed larger responses than the control responses, and L-741,626 addition had little enhancing effect on the responses (mean change, 106.8 ± 26.9% of the control responses; see Fig. 5B, filled bars). A subset of Fyn-deficient neurons exhibited larger responses after L-741,626 addition, and their responses peaked at around 120% of the control responses. In addition, the numbers of neurons exhibiting larger responses after L-741,626 addition was lower in the presence of the Src family inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) (mean change, 99.9 ± 15.7% of the control responses). We then examined the effect of L-741,626 on Fyn activation and NMDA receptor phosphorylation in the presence of quinpirole (50 μm) by Western blot analysis, as shown in Fig. 6. Primary cells were exposed or not exposed (control) to 10 μm L-741,626 for 7 min prior to sample preparation. In the wild-type cells, immunoreactivity for anti-pY1472 antibody and anti-pY418 antibody in the L-741,626-treated cell extracts was stronger than in the control cell extracts. By contrast, when Fyn-deficient cells were used, there were no significant differences in immunoreactivity for anti-pY1472 antibody and anti-pY418 antibody between the L-741,626-exposed cell extracts and the control cell extracts.

https://openalex.org/W2107418859,"The tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 is expressed in the majority of human adenocarcinomas but is rarely expressed in most normal tissues, which makes it a potential target for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of human cancers. Here we describe the construction, affinity maturation, and biological characterization of an anti-TAG-72 humanized antibody with minimum potential immunogenicity. The humanized antibody was constructed by grafting only the specificity-determining residues (SDRs) within the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) onto homologous human immunoglobulin germ line segments while retaining two mouse heavy chain framework residues that support the conformation of the CDRs. The resulting humanized antibody (AKA) showed only about 2-fold lower affinity compared with the original murine monoclonal antibody CC49 and 27-fold lower reactivity to patient serum compared with the humanized antibody HuCC49 that was constructed by CDR grafting. The affinity of AKA was improved by random mutagenesis of the heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3). The highest affinity variant (3E8) showed 22-fold higher affinity compared with AKA and retained the original epitope specificity. Mutational analysis of the HCDR3 residues revealed that the replacement of Asn97 by isoleucine or valine was critical for the affinity maturation. The 3E8 labeled with 125I or 131I showed efficient tumor targeting or therapeutic effects, respectively, in athymic mice with human colon carcinoma xenografts, suggesting that 3E8 may be beneficial for the diagnosis and therapy of tumors expressing TAG-72.

Herzenberg L.A. Oi V.T. Proc. Nat1 Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 21: 6851-6855Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Although chimeric antibodies proved to be less immunogenic than murine mAbs, human anti-chimeric antibody responses have been observed (4Bell M. Kamm M. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To further reduce the immunogenicity of the mouse variable regions, a humanized antibody has been constructed by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of a murine mAb onto the human framework regions (FRs) by a procedure commonly referred to as CDR grafting (5Jones P.T. Dear P.H. Foote J. Neuberger M.S. Winter G. Nature. 1986; 321: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Simple grafting CDRs, however, often decreased the affinity, because some FR residues directly contact the antigen or support the conformation of the CDR loops (6Queen C. Schneider W.P. Selick H.E. Payne P.W. Landolfi N.F. Duncan J.F. Avdalovic N.M. Levitt M. Junghans R.P. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, humanized antibody is currently constructed primarily by CDR grafting, while retaining those rodent FR residues that influence antigen-binding activity (8Winter G. Harris W.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 243-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Since the FR residues often differ from one humanized antibody to another, the identification of key rodent FR residues is a crucial part of the humanization (9Reichert J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have indicated that such humanized antibodies are, in general, less immunogenic than murine or chimeric antibodies and are tolerated by humans (10Stephens S. Emtage S. Vetterlein O. Chaplin L. Bebbington C. Nesbitt A. Sopwith M. Athwal D. Novak C. Bodmer M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 668-674PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mateo C. Moreno E. Amour K. Lombardero J. Harris W. Perez R. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the non-human CDRs of humanized antibodies can induce human anti-humanized antibody responses in patients (12Hwang W.Y.K. Foote J. Methods. 2005; 36: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Comprehensive analyses of the three-dimensional structures of the antibody-combining sites have revealed that only 20–33% of the CDR residues participate in antigen-binding (13Glaser S.M. Vasquez M. Payne P.W. Schneider P.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2607-2614PubMed Google Scholar, 14Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 15Padlan E.A. Abergel C. Tipper J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Most of the variable positions of CDRs are directly involved in the interaction with antigen (i.e. specificity-determining residues (SDRs)), whereas most of the conserved residues mainly serve to stabilize the structure of the combining site (15Padlan E.A. Abergel C. Tipper J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The SDRs are observed primarily in the C-terminal part of light chain CDR1 (LCDR1), the first and sometimes also the middle positions in LCDR2, the middle portion of LCDR3, most of the heavy chain CDR1 (HCDR1), the N-terminal and middle parts of HCDR2, and most of HCDR3 except the terminal position. The SDRs form the center of the antibody-combining site. Therefore, one possible way to minimize the human anti-humanized antibody response is to graft only the SDRs of a murine antibody onto human FRs while maintaining the conformations of the CDRs of the murine antibody. Tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 is expressed by the majority of human adenocarcinomas in the colon, ovary, pancreas, breast, prostate, and lung but not in most normal tissues, except the endometrium in the secretory phase (16Thor A. Ohuchi N. Szpak C.A. Johnston W.W. Schlom J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3118-3124PubMed Google Scholar, 17Thor A. Viglione M.J. Muraro R. Ohuchi N. Schlom J. Gorstein F. Int. J. Gynecol.

Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3118-3124PubMed Google Scholar) that specifically binds to TAG-72 is approved for in vivo imaging in patients with ovarian and colorectal cancers. A second generation antibody to B72.3, CC49 (18Muraro R. Kuroki M. Wunderlich D. Poole D.J. Colcher D. Thor A. Greiner J.W. Simpson J.F. Molinolo A. Noguchi P. Schlom J.

Scott A.M. Gulec S. Broussard E.K. Levy N. Young C. Capitelli P. Daghighian F. Williams J.M. Finn R.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1503-1510PubMed Google Scholar, 21Divgi C.R. Scott A.M. McDermott K.

Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1447-1454PubMed Google Scholar). The epitope for B72.3 or CC49 has been identified as sialyl-Tn (i.e. α-sialyl 2–6αGalNAc), O-linked to Ser/Thr on mucin-type glycoproteins (23Kjeldsen T. Clausen H. Hirohashi S. Ogawa T. Iijima H. Hakomori S-I. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2214-2220PubMed Google Scholar). However, CC49 elicits human anti-mouse antibody responses in patients (24Divgi C.R. Scott A.M. Dantis L. Capitelli P. Siler K. Hilton S. Finn R.D. Kemeny N. Kelsen D. Kostakoglu L. J. Nucl. Med. 1995; 36: 586-592PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, a humanized CC49 antibody (HuCC49) has been constructed by CDR grafting while retaining the buried FR residues that affect the structure of the antibody and those involved in VL-VH interaction or antigen binding (25Kashmiri S.V.S. Shu L. Padlan E.A. Milenic D.E. Schlom J. Hand P.H. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Subsequently, to reduce the immunogenicity of HuCC49, the mouse CDR and FR residues have been replaced individually with corresponding human residues, and the antigen-binding activity and potential immunogenicity of each variant have been analyzed (26Iwahashi M. Milenic D.E. Padlan E.A. Bei R. Schlom J. Kashmiri S.V.S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Tamura M. Milenic D.E. Iwahashi M. Padlan E. Schlom J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5521-5531PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, humanized antibody was constructed by grafting only the SDRs onto a human Ig germ line segment with CDRs of the same canonical structures as those of the murine antibody while retaining two key murine FR residues. The resulting humanized antibody AKA showed only about 2-fold lower affinity compared with CC49. Subsequently, antibody affinity was increased by random mutagenesis of HCDR3 residues followed by affinity selection. The resulting humanized antibody (3E8) showed 27-fold lower sera reactivity compared with HuCC49 and higher affinity compared with original CC49. The antibody showed specific tumor targeting and anti-tumor therapeutic effects in athymic mice bearing human adenocarcinoma xenografts expressing TAG-72. Construction of Humanized Antibody—To select human FRs for SDR grafting, the VH and VL sequences of CC49 were compared with those of human Ig variable and joining region germ line segments. It was found that DP25-JH4 and DPK24-JK4 were the most homologous to the VH and VL of CC49, respectively (Fig. 1). To construct the VL of the humanized light chain (HzK), only Tyr94 in the LCDR3 of CC49 was grafted onto human DPK24-JK4 (Fig. 1A). The numbering follows Kabat et al. (30Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th. NIH Publication 91-3242, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991: 103-511Google Scholar). The VL sequence of HzK was synthesized by recombinant PCR using a humanized VL (pCLS2-hygro) (31Park S.S. Nam K.-Y. No K.T. Ryu C.J. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Hong H.J. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which is also based on the DPK24-JK4, as a template and six mutagenic PCR primers (primer 1, 5′-GAGCCGCACGAGCCCGAGCTCGTGATGAC(C/T)CAGTCTCC; primer 2, 5′-CTTATTGTTGCTGCTGTATAAAAC; primer 3, 5′-CAGCAGCAACAATAAGAACTACTT; primer 4, ATATTGCTGACAGTAATAAAC; primer 5, 5′-TATTACTGTCAGCAATATTATTCCTATCCGTTGACGTTCGGCCAAGGGACC; primer 6, 5′-GCGCCGTCTAGAATTAACACTCTCCCCTGTTGAAGCTCTTTGTGACGGGCGAACTCAG). Primers 1 and 6 contain HindIII and SalI sites, respectively. The final PCR products were digested with HindIII and SalI and then subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) to yield pBL/HzK. After confirming the sequence, the humanized VL was fused to human Cκ in pCLS2-hygro by recombinant PCR. The final PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and then subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI sites of pdCMV-dhfr (Aprogen) to yield pdCMV-dhfr-HzK. To construct a humanized VH, initially, the HCDR1, the SDRs in the HCDR2 (HSDR2), the HCDR3, and two FR3 residues (Ala71 and Lys73) of CC49 were grafted onto DP25-JH4 to construct the VH of a humanized heavy chain (aka). The sequences of the mouse, human, and humanized VH are shown in Fig. 1B. The humanized VH was synthesized by recombinant PCR using a humanized VH (pCHS-neo) (32Ryu C.J. Padlan E.A. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Yoo O.J. Hong H.J. Human Antibodies Hybridomas. 1996; 7: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which is also based on human DP25-JH4, as a template and eight mutagenic PCR primers (primer 9, 5′-CTGCTCGAGTCTGGGGCTGAAGT; primer 10, 5′-AATTGCATGGTCAGTGAAGGTGTAGCCAGA; primer 11, 5′-ACTGACCATGCAATTCACTGGGTGCGCCAG; primer 12, 5′-ATCATCGTTGCCAGGAGAAAAATATCCCATCCACTCAAG; primer 13, 5′-TTTTCTCCTGGCAACGATGATTTTAAATACTCCCAGAAGTTC; primer 14, 5′-GTCTGCAGTGATTGTCACGC; primer 15, 5′-ACTGCAGACAAATCCGCGAG; primer 16, 5′-CATATTCAGAGATCTTGTACAG(A/T)AATAGACCGCCGTGTC; primer 17, 5′-ACAAGATCTCTGAATATGGCTTACTGGGGCCAAGGGACT; primer 18, 5′-GCATGTACTAGTTTTGTCACAAGATTTGG). Primers 9 and 18 contained EcoRI and SalI sites, respectively. The humanized VH was fused to human Cγ1 in pCHS2-neo (31Park S.S. Nam K.-Y. No K.T. Ryu C.J. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Hong H.J. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by recombinant PCR. The final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and then subcloned into pdCMV-dhfr to yield pdCMV-dhfr-akt. Another humanized heavy chain aka was constructed from akt by recombinant PCR using pdCMV-dhfr-akt as a template and mutagenic PCR primers; this was then subcloned into the EcoRI-ApaI sites of pdCMV-dhfr-akt to construct pdCMV-dhfr-aka. Expression and Purification of Humanized Antibody—The humanized antibody was transiently expressed in COS7 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the culture supernatant was subjected to ELISA to determine its antigen-binding activity and affinity. For the stable expression of humanized antibody, expression plasmid DNA was transfected into a dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, DG44. After selection in minimal essential medium α containing G418 in 96-well plates, the resistant cell clones were screened for the production of assembled antibody by an indirect ELISA and were subjected to stepwise methotrexate adaptation, as described previously (33Kim S.J. Jang M.H. Stapleton J.T. Yoon S.O. Kim K.-S. Jeon E.-S. Hong H.J. Virology. 2004; 318: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the production and purification of antibody, the CHO cell line that stably expressed the antibody was grown in serum-free medium (CHO-SFM II, Invitrogen), and the culture supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography on a Protein G-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (32Ryu C.J. Padlan E.A. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Yoo O.J. Hong H.J. Human Antibodies Hybridomas. 1996; 7: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The integrity and purity of the purified antibody were determined by SDS-PAGE. For quantification of the purified antibody, an optical density of 1.43 at 280 nm was used for a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (34Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991: 2.7.1-2.7.5Google Scholar). ELISA—For an indirect ELISA, antibody samples were added to each well that had been coated with 1 μg of TAG-72-positive bovine submaxillary mucin (Type I-S; Sigma), as described previously (27Tamura M. Milenic D.E. Iwahashi M. Padlan E. Schlom J. Kashmiri S.V.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 432-441Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and were incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing, 100 μl of goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 (v/v); Sigma) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, 100 μl of 0.2 m citrate-PO4 buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.04% o-phenylenediamine (Invitrogen) and 0.03% H2O2 were added to each well and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 m H2SO4, and the optical density was measured at 492 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Titertek Multiskan Plus). To determine antigen-binding affinity, a competition ELISA was carried out as described previously (32Ryu C.J. Padlan E.A. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Yoo O.J. Hong H.J. Human Antibodies Hybridomas. 1996; 7: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, solutions containing 3 ng of each antibody and various concentrations (10–11–10–5 m) of bovine submaxillary mucin as a competing antigen were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and were then added to each well that had been previously coated with 200 ng of the antigen. The bound antibody was detected by an indirect ELISA. The dissociation constant (KD) of each antibody was calculated from a Scatchard plot (35Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). To analyze the epitope specificity of 3E8, a competition binding assay between CC49 and 3E8 was performed as described previously (33Kim S.J. Jang M.H. Stapleton J.T. Yoon S.O. Kim K.-S. Jeon E.-S. Hong H.J. Virology. 2004; 318: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, CC49 or biotinylated 3E8 was incubated with bovine submaxillary mucin (250 ng/well; Sigma) in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of a competing antibody, 3E8. The bound CC49 or biotinylated 3E8 was detected by goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), respectively. As a negative control of the competing antibody, humanized KR127, which specifically binds to the preS1 antigen of hepatitis B virus (36Hong H.J. Ryu C.J. Hur H. Kim S. Oh H.K. Oh M.S. Park S.Y. Virology. 2004; 318: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was used. Serum Reactivity Assay—The potential immunogenicity of AKA in humans was assessed by measuring the reactivity of the humanized antibody to the serum from patient EA, who received 177Lu-mCC49 in a phase I radioimmunotherapy trial (22Mulligan T. Carrasquillo J.A. Chung Y. Milenic D.E. Schlom J. Feuerstein I. Paik C. Perentesis P. Reynolds J. Curt G. Goeckeler W. Fordyce W. Cheng R. Riseberg D. Cowan K. O'Shaughnessy J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1447-1454PubMed Google Scholar). Since the serum from patient EA contained anti-murine variable region antibodies, it was used to compare the reactivity of AKA with that of HuCC49. However, the serum also contained circulating TAG-72 antigen and anti-murine Fc antibodies, which may have interfered with the binding of the humanized antibody to the anti-variable region antibodies in the serum. Therefore, prior to the serum reactivity assay, TAG-72 antigen and anti-murine Fc antibodies were removed from the serum by immunoadsorption to another TAG-72-specific murine mAb, CC92, that recognizes an epitope of TAG-72 that is distinct from the one recognized by CC49 (37Kuroki M. Fernsten P.D. Wunderlich D. Colcher D. Simpson J.F. Poole D.J. Schlom J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4872-4879PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CC92 was coupled to Reactigel (HW65F; Pierce). The patient serum was added to the CC92 gel and was incubated overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were saved and stored at –20 °C for the serum reactivity assay. To test the serum reactivity of antibodies, a surface plasmon resonance-based competition assay was carried out using a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore), as described previously (38Gonzales N.R. Schuck P. Schlom J. Kashmiri S.V.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were immobilized on the carboxymethylated dextran chip (CM5) by amine coupling. The dextran layer of the sensor chip was activated by injecting 35 μl of a mixture of N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Proteins diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml were injected until surfaces of 5000 resonance units were obtained. The remaining reactive groups on the surfaces were blocked by injecting 35 μlof1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). To determine the serum reactivity of HuCC49 and AKA, AKA or HuCC49 at different concentrations was incubated with the patient serum cleared of TAG-72 and anti-murine Fc antibodies at 25 °C, and then the mixture was applied to the HuCC49-immobilized CM5 chip in flow cell 1 and a rabbit γ-globulin-immobilized chip in flow cell 2 as a reference to compete for binding to serum anti-variable region antibodies. After the binding was measured for 1000 s, the unbound samples were washed from the surface with running buffer using a flow rate of 100 μl/min, and the surfaces were regenerated with a 1-min injection of 10 mm glycine (pH 2.0). The percentage of binding at each antibody concentration was calculated as follows. Percentage of binding = (slope of the signal obtained with competitor (serum + antibody)/slope of the signal obtained without competitor (serum only)) × 100. The IC50 for each antibody was calculated as the concentration required for 50% inhibition of the binding of the serum to immobilized HuCC49. Affinity Maturation of AKA—To improve the affinity of AKA, the HCDR3 of AKA Fab was randomly mutated, and the resulting Fab library was subjected to a modified colony lift assay (39Radosevic K. Voerman J.S.A. Hemmes A. Muskens F. Speleman L. de Weers M. Rosmalen J.G.M. Knegt P. van Ewijk W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 272: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To begin, the Fab expression vector, pC3Q-dgIII, was constructed by deletion of the geneIII from pComb3H (40Barbas III, C.F. Bain J.D. Hoekstra D.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and by replacement of the first amino acid residue, glutamic acid, by glutamine. Next, the VH of aka and the VL of HzK were subcloned into the XhoI-ApaI and SacI-XbaI sites, respectively, of pC3Q-dgIII to construct pC3Q-dgIII-AKA. This plasmid DNA was used as a template for random mutagenesis of the HCDR3 by recombinant PCR. The first PCR was performed using the 5′ and 3′ primers, VH135 and HCDR3 BACK, respectively, or HCDR3 FORWARD and LHS11, respectively. The HCDR3 FORWARD primer was mutagenic and introduced random mutations at the first five amino acid residues of the HCDR3 of AKA. The nucleotide sequences of the primers were as follows: VH135, 5′-AGGTGCAGCTGCTCGAGTCTGG; HCDR3 BACK, 5′-TCTTGCACAGTAATAGACCGCCGTGTC; HCDR3 FORWARD, 5′-GTCTATTACTGTGCAAGA(G/A/T/C)N-(G/C)NNSNNSNNSNNSTACTGGGGCCAAGGCACTCTG; LHS11, 5′-CACCGGTTCGGGGAAGT. The two first PCR products were then subjected to recombinant PCR. The final PCR product was digested with XhoI and ApaI and was cloned into the XhoI-ApaI sites of pC3Q-dgIII-AKA to create a mutant Fab library. After the transformation of Escherichia coli TG1 with the library, 106 cells were pipetted onto a nitrocellulose membrane placed on a 2× YTA plate and were grown overnight at 37 °C (master membrane). A nitrocellulose membrane was coated with antigen by incubation in PBS containing 10 μg/ml bovine submaxillary mucin at 37 °C for 6 h, rinsed twice with PBS, and blocked with 5% skim milk at 37 °C for 2 h. The blocked membrane was rinsed twice with PBS and soaked in 2× YT broth with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 μg/ml ampicillin (capture membrane). This capture membrane was placed on a2× YTA plate containing 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the master membrane was placed, cell-coated side up, on top of the capture membrane; the membranes were then incubated at room temperature overnight. The capture membrane was rinsed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), blocked with 5% skim milk at 37 °C for 6 h, and incubated with goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)2-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 (v/v); Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence, and the spots generated on the film were used to identify the corresponding colonies on the original bacterial plate. Each positive colony was grown in 2× YTA and subjected to another round of selection as described above. Finally, 180 positive colonies were isolated, and the antigen-binding activity of soluble Fab was measured by an indirect ELISA. The Fabs with high affinity were selected, and the nucleotide sequences of the HCDR3 were determined. Conversion of Fab to Whole IgG—The VH of selected Fab and Ig heavy chain leader sequences (32Ryu C.J. Padlan E.A. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Yoo O.J. Hong H.J. Human Antibodies Hybridomas. 1996; 7: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were fused by recombinant PCR. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and ApaI and were subcloned into the EcoRI-ApaI site of pdCMV-dhfr-AKA. The resulting expression plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells, and the antibody secreted in the culture supernatant was analyzed by ELISA to determine the antigen-binding affinity. Radioiodination of Humanized Antibody—The IODO-BEAD method (Pierce) was used for radiolabeling the purified AKA and 3E8 with 125I (Amersham Biosciences) or 131I (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute). The radiolabeled antibody was purified by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and was sterilized by filtration (0.22 μm; Millipore Corp.). The radiolabeling yield and radiochemical purity were determined with instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel (Gelman Scientific) in the stationary phase and 70% methanol in the mobile phase. Biodistribution Study—Female athymic mice (BALB/c-nu/nu; 5–6 weeks old; 17–23 g) were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. Tumors were grown after a subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (LS174T) in the left thigh. After 14 days, 125I-3E8 or 125I-AKA (20 μg/740 KBq) were injected into the tail vein of the athymic mice bearing LS174T tumors. For each time point, a group of three mice was sacrificed to collect and weigh blood, tumors, and organs. Radioactivity was measured in a γ-scintillation counter. The percentage of the injected dose/g of tissue was calculated. Radioimmunotherapy Studies—The radioimmunotherapeutic efficacy of 131I-3E8 was evaluated in the athymic mice bearing LS174T tumors. For the tumor growth inhibition study (n = 8), LS174T cells (5 × 106) were subcutaneously injected into the back of athymic mice"
https://openalex.org/W1966321788,"The glutamic acid-rich protein-2 (GARP2) is a splice variant of the β-subunit of the cGMP-gated ion channel of rod photoreceptors. GARP2 is believed to interact with several membrane-associated phototransduction proteins in rod photoreceptors. In this study, we demonstrated that GARP2 is a high affinity PDE6-binding protein and that PDE6 co-purifies with GARP2 during several stages of chromatographic purification. We found that hydrophobic interaction chromatography succeeds in quantitatively separating GARP2 from the PDE6 holoenzyme. Furthermore, the 17-kDa prenyl-binding protein, abundant in retinal cells, selectively released PDE6 (but not GARP2) from rod outer segment membranes, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction between GARP2 and PDE6. Purified GARP2 was able to suppress 80% of the basal activity of the nonactivated, membrane-bound PDE6 holoenzyme at concentrations equivalent to its endogenous concentration in rod outer segment membranes. However, GARP2 was unable to reverse the transducin activation of PDE6 (in contrast to a previous study) nor did it significantly alter catalysis of the fully activated PDE6 catalytic dimer. The high binding affinity of GARP2 for PDE6 and its ability to regulate PDE6 activity in its dark-adapted state suggest a novel role for GARP2 as a regulator of spontaneous activation of rod PDE6, thereby serving to lower rod photoreceptor “dark noise” and allowing these sensory cells to operate at the single photon detection limit. The glutamic acid-rich protein-2 (GARP2) is a splice variant of the β-subunit of the cGMP-gated ion channel of rod photoreceptors. GARP2 is believed to interact with several membrane-associated phototransduction proteins in rod photoreceptors.

The visual transduction pathway in vertebrate photoreceptors is remarkable in many respects, including single photon detection capability (in rod photoreceptors), photoresponse kinetics on the millisecond time scale, and the ability to adapt to background illumination levels ranging from very dim illuminance levels (scotopic vision in rods) to bright sunlight (photopic vision in cones) (1Rodieck R.W. The First Steps in Seeing. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar). The very first steps in vision occur in the photoreceptor outer segment when photo-isomerized rhodopsin activates the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin, which proceeds to bind to and displace the inhibitory γ-subunit (Pγ) 2The abbreviations used are: Pγ, inhibitory 10-kDa γ-subunit of PDE6; GARP, glutamic acid-rich protein; PDE6, photoreceptor phosphodiesterase; PrBP/δ, 17-kDa prenyl-binding protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ROS, rod outer segment; HIC, hydrophobic interaction chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. of the photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6). Activated PDE6 rapidly lowers the cGMP concentration, resulting in closure of cGMP-gated channels in the plasma membrane and cell hyperpolarization (2Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev.

Several feedback mechanisms operate to actively terminate the photoresponse and restore the dark-adapted state, of which regulation of the lifetime of activated transducin is considered rate-limiting (2Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 779-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Rebinding of Pγ to the PDE6 catalytic subunits following transducin deactivation returns PDE6 to its nonactivated state and allows cGMP levels to return to their dark-adapted levels. Electrophysiological evidence supports the hypothesis that factors in addition to transducin deactivation are involved in regulating the life-time of light-activated PDE6 during light adaptation of rod photoreceptors (5Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. Makino C.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J.

The catalytic activity of PDE6 in its dark-adapted state also must be tightly controlled to prevent any spontaneous activation of PDE6 that would consume metabolic energy unnecessarily and impair the ability of rod cells to reliably detect very dim flashes of light. Physiological measurements of “dark noise” reveal a component that represents spontaneous activation of PDE6 and which is much greater in magnitude in cones than in rods (10Rieke F. Baylor D.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2553-2572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Rieke F. Baylor D.A.

Subtle differences in the highly homologous rod and cone isoforms of PDE6 might account for the different dark noise in rods and cones, although this is not evident from biochemical comparisons of purified rod and cone PDE6 (13Baehr W.

An alternative possibility is that a rod- or cone-specific PDE6-binding protein suppresses the spontaneous activation of PDE6 by enhancing the affinity of Pγ at the PDE6 catalytic site. One candidate protein that might serve to regulate PDE6 in both its nonactivated and activated states is the glutamic acid-rich protein-2 (GARP2), a protein that exists in rod outer segments but is absent in cones (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Colville C.A.

GARP2 is a product of alternative splicing of the β-subunit of the rod cGMP-gated ion channel (CNGB1) and contains a unique 8-amino-acid C-terminal extension (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F.

Potential binding partners for GARP2 include proteins involved in phototransduction and disk membrane structural integrity (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of these interactions is unclear. In one previous study, it was reported that the addition of GARP2 to preparations of PDE6 reversed its activation by transducin, whereas GARP2 had no effect on the nonactivated PDE6 holoenzyme or on the catalytic dimer of PDE6 lacking bound Pγ (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It was proposed that GARP2 down-regulation of PDE6 activation in the vicinity of the plasma membrane might conserve metabolic energy during daylight when rod function is saturated. In this paper, we have examined the interaction of GARP2 with PDE6 and characterized the effect of GARP2 on PDE6 function. We show that GARP2 binds PDE6 with high affinity and co-purifies with the enzyme through several stages of purification. We have been unable to confirm the previously reported inhibitory effect of GARP2 on transducin-activated PDE6 (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Instead, we observed that purified, native GARP2 has a strong effect in suppressing the basal activity of PDE6 in its nonactivated state. The implications of GARP2 modulation of basal PDE6 activity in dark-adapted rods are discussed. Materials—Bovine retinas were purchased from W. L. Lawson, Inc. Chromatography supplies were purchased from G. E. Healthcare and Pierce. Supplies for immunoblotting were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell, Pierce, and Bio-Rad. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The bovine recombinant GST-PrBP/δ fusion protein was a kind gift of Dr. Joe Beavo (University of Washington). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GARP2 antibody to the unique C-terminal sequence of GARP2 (17Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

Chicken and rabbit polyclonal anti-GARP antibodies to bovine sequences common to GARP1, GARP2, and the rod β-subunit CNGB1 were kind gifts of Dr. Steven Pittler (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and Dr. Benjamin Kaupp (Institut für Biologische Informationsverarbeitung, Jülich, Germany). Affinity-purified anti-peptide rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed to the PDE6 GAFb domain (termed NC) and to the C terminus of the Pγ-subunit of PDE6 (CT-9710) were produced in our laboratory. The ROS1 monoclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitations (21Hurwitz R.L. Bunt-Milam A.H. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8612-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Richard Hurwitz (Baylor College of Medicine). ROS Membrane Isolation and Purification—ROS membranes from bovine retina were prepared as described previously (22Pentia D.C. Hosier S. Collupy R.A. Valeriani B.A. Cote R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 125-140PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ROSs were isolated from frozen bovine retinas on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. ROS membranes were homogenized in an isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a glass, handheld homogenizer. The soluble proteins were separated from membranes by centrifugation. Native GARP2 Purification—GARP2 was isolated from ROS membranes and purified to homogeneity as follows. First, ROS membranes were homogenized in a hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The soluble proteins were separated from membranes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The hypotonic extraction was repeated three times. The pooled hypotonic extract was then adjusted to 500 mm ammonium sulfate and applied to a 15-ml butyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed of unbound proteins using two column volumes of 500 mm ammonium sulfate in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and bound proteins were eluted by a step gradient (400 mm ammonium sulfate, 150 mm ammonium sulfate, and no ammonium sulfate in a solution containing 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The GARP2-containing fractions were pooled, adjusted to 500 mm ammonium sulfate, and rechromatographed on butyl-Sepharose. To concentrate and further purify GARP2 from other contaminating proteins, anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q was used exactly as described for PDE6 purification. In some instances, the GARP2-containing fractions from the first butyl-Sepharose column were chromatographed on a Mono Q column prior to a final purification using a reversed phase HPLC column (Vydac 214TP54) with a gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Under these conditions, GARP2 eluted at 48% acetonitrile, Pγ was found at 43% acetonitrile, and PDE6 catalytic subunits were undetectable by immunoblot analysis. HPLC-purified GARP2 behaved identically to butyl-Sepharose-purified GARP2 in its effects on PDE6 catalysis. PDE6 Purification—Purified PDE6 was prepared as described elsewhere (22Pentia D.C. Hosier S. Collupy R.A. Valeriani B.A. Cote R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 125-140PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a hypotonic extract of purified ROS membranes was loaded onto a Mono Q column. The proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 100 mm NaCl to 1 m NaCl in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The PDE6 peak was collected, concentrated, and further purified on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column using the following buffer: 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The gel filtration column was calibrated using the following: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (43 kDa), ovalbumin (29 kDa), blue dextran for the void volume, and adenosine triphosphate for the included volume. Immunoprecipitation of PDE6 with the Monoclonal Antibody ROS1—The ROS1 antibody to PDE6 (21Hurwitz R.L. Bunt-Milam A.H. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8612-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to Sulfolink beads (Pierce) was used for immunoprecipitation of PDE6 and its binding partners. Hypotonic extracts from bovine ROS or Mono Q-purified PDE6 (containing 5–10 pmol of PDE6) were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 20 μl of prewashed ROS1 beads in a total volume of 100 μl. The samples were centrifuged to separate bound from unbound proteins, and the beads were washed extensively before the proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer. As a control for nonspecific binding of GARP2 to the beads, purified GARP2 was also tested with the ROS1-Sulfolink beads. Portions of the starting material, bound proteins, and unbound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for PDE6 (NC antibody) and GARP (chicken anti-GARP antibody). PrBP/δ Expression and Purification—Recombinant bovine PrBP/δ was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (23Norton A.W. Hosier S. Terew J.M. Li N. Dhingra A. Vardi N. Baehr W. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to log phase cultures. Bacterial cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, lysed by sonication, and soluble proteins were recovered following centrifugation. GST-PrBP/δ was purified on a glutathione-agarose column. GST-PrBP/δ concentration was determined by a colorimetric protein assay (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Protein Quantification—The amount of rhodopsin in dark-adapted ROS membranes was determined by difference spectroscopy (25Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide Huguenin A.C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The PDE6 concentration was routinely determined by measurements of trypsin-activated PDE6 maximum activity (Vmax) (26Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and knowledge of the turnover number (kcat = 5600 cGMP/s/PDE6; [PDE6] = Vmax/kcat) (27Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Independent determinations of the ratio of rhodopsin to PDE6 in purified bovine ROS gave a value of 310 ± 20 rhodopsins per PDE6 (n = 5), very similar to the values for amphibian ROS of 270 (28Dumke C.L. Arshavsky V.Y. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 1071-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to 330 (29Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rhodopsins per PDE. The amount of purified GARP2 was routinely estimated by immunoblot analysis. Samples of purified GARP2 and known amounts of ROS membranes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. GARP2 was detected using a GARP2-specific antibody. The intensities of GARP2 immunoreactive bands were determined using Quantiscan (Biosoft) and then compared with GARP2 immunoreactivity in ROS membranes containing known amounts of rhodopsin and PDE6. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 10, 12, or 15% acrylamide gels. The immunoblotting procedure followed the protocols in Gallagher (31Gallagher S. Current Protocols in Protein Science Unit 10.10.in: Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Note that GARP2 typically migrates at ∼60 kDa (roughly 2-fold higher than predicted based on its amino acid sequence) and shows size heterogeneity, in accord with previous observations (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Korschen H.G.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This anomalous behavior was recently explained as being due to GARP2 existing in solution as a natively unfolded protein (32Batra-Safferling R. Abarca H.K. Korschen H.G. Tziatzios C. Stoldt M. Budyak I. Willbold D. Schwalbe H. Klein-Seetharaman J. Kaupp U.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1449-1460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GARP2 Is a High Affinity PDE6-binding Protein—Because there is uncertainty about the proteins with which GARP2 interacts in rod photoreceptors (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Poetsch A. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we first re-examined whether PDE6 interacts in a specific manner with GARP2. Following homogenization of purified ROS from bovine retina and removal of soluble proteins with isotonic washes, PDE6 and GARP2 both remained associated with ROS disk membranes (Fig. 1A). Release of PDE6 from ROS membranes by exposure to a hypotonic buffer also caused the release of almost all detectable GARP2 (Fig. 1A). Subsequent purification of PDE6 by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column resulted in co-elution of PDE6 and GARP2 at 400 mm NaCl. Gel filtration chromatography of the Mono Q-purified GARP2-PDE6 also failed to separate GARP2 from PDE6 (Fig. 1A). The results in Fig. 1A conclusively demonstrate that PDE6 and GARP2 are both associated with ROS membranes, are co-eluted by exposure to a hypotonic buffer, and co-purify by two different chromatographic procedures. To directly show that GARP2 is associated with PDE6, we immunoprecipitated PDE6 with the ROS1 antibody (21Hurwitz R.L. Bunt-Milam A.H. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8612-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to Sulfolink beads. Fig. 1B shows that unpurified PDE6 obtained from hypotonic extraction of ROS membranes was pulled down in a complex with GARP2 and that very little GARP2 remained unbound under these conditions. Mono Q-purified PDE6 was also immunoprecipitated in tight association with GARP2, whereas purified GARP2 failed to bind to the ROS1 antibody in the absence of PDE6 (Fig. 1B). To estimate whether a significant amount of the PDE6 exists free of bound GARP2, we performed gel filtration chromatography on proteins solubilized from dark-adapted ROS membranes with a hypotonic buffer. A single peak of PDE6 hydrolytic activity (Fig. 1C) and immunoreactivity (Fig. 1D) was observed at an apparent molecular mass of 330 kDa. (The higher than predicted molecular mass for the PDE6-GARP2 complex by gel filtration chromatography may be due to its asymmetric shape (14Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) Qualitatively, the observed ratio of PDE6 and GARP2 immunoreactivity did not vary in the fractions containing PDE6, indicating that there is not a large fraction of the total PDE6 that exists free of bound GARP2. Further, only small amounts of GARP2 immunoreactivity could be detected at an apparent molecular mass of ∼30–60 kDa (Fig. 1D). This result indicated that PDE6 is tightly associated with GARP2 and that there is no evidence for a significant amount of unbound GARP2 or PDE6. To assess whether GARP2 binding to PDE6 might be an artifact of the initial hypotonic extraction of ROS membrane proteins, we also solubilized PDE6 and GARP2 from dark-adapted ROS membranes with 1% Triton X-100. After removing the ROS membranes by centrifugation and immunoprecipitation of the detergent-solubilized PDE6 with the ROS1 antibody, we detected both PDE6 and GARP2 in the immunoprecipitates; control samples with beads lacking the ROS1 antibody failed to pull down either protein (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that most of the GARP2 in ROS co-purifies with PDE6 through several stages of purification. The fact that GARP2 remained bound to PDE6 after repeated washing of the ROS1 immune complex (Fig. 1B) and that little unbound GARP2 was observed during gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1D) demonstrates that GARP2 binds PDE6 with high affinity. GARP2 Content in Rod Photoreceptors—If GARP2 is to regulate PDE6 activity during phototransduction, it would need to be present in ROS in molar equivalence to PDE6. A previous study by Kaupp and colleagues (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) has suggested that GARP2 is actually ∼3-fold more abundant than PDE6 (1 GARP2 per 100 rhodopsins). Another GARP2-interacting protein, peripherin, is believed to bind only 10% of the total GARP2 in ROS (20Poetsch A. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our observation that practically all GARP2 in bovine ROS co-purified with PDE6 (Fig. 1) suggested that GARP2 was not significantly more abundant than PDE6 in ROS. To directly address the question of the GARP2 content in ROS, we purified native GARP2 from bovine ROS, as described in the next section, and compared the immunoreactivity of known amounts of GARP2 to that of intact ROS whose rhodopsin and PDE6 concentration were measured. The precision of our measurements were hampered by uncertainties in the concentration of purified GARP2 used for quantitative immunoblots, because the poor staining of GARP2 by Coomassie and other protein stains limited our ability to assess its purity on SDS-PAGE (see next section). Taking this into consideration, we estimate that there are 1–2 GARP2 molecules per PDE6 holoenzyme in bovine ROS (data not shown). This value agrees well with two other reports (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32Batra-Safferling R.

Purification of Native GARP2 Free of Contamination with PDE6—To study the effects of GARP2 on PDE6 catalytic activity, we needed to purify GARP2 free of PDE6 subunits. We discovered that the association of GARP2 with PDE6 could be disrupted using high concentrations of ammonium sulfate. This permitted separation of the two proteins by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). A hypotonic extract containing PDE6 and GARP2 was mixed with 500 mm ammonium sulfate, and the sample was applied to a butyl-Sepharose column. A decreasing, discontinuous ammonium sulfate gradient permitted the separation of PDE6 (at higher ammonium sulfate concentrations) from the GARP2 (which eluted only when ammonium sulfate was omitted from the buffer) (Fig. 2A). Examination of the PDE6 peak by immunoblot analysis revealed no detectable GARP2 (Fig. 2B, HIC-PDE). The disruption of GARP2 binding to PDE6 by ammonium sulfate suggested that hydrophobic domains in GARP2 (which contains 27% hydrophobic amino acids) may be important in promoting its binding to PDE6 catalytic subunits. The GARP2 peak eluting from the butyl-Sepharose column in the absence of ammonium sulfate still contained traces of the inhibitory Pγ-subunit immunoreactivity at ∼12 kDa as well as a faint band of GARP1 immunoreactivity at ∼130 kDa (Fig. 2B, HIC1). By exposing the partially purified GARP2 sample to 500 mm ammonium sulfate and running the sample on butyl-Sepharose again, most of the residual Pγ was removed from the GARP2 (Fig. 2B, HIC2). Alternatively, the GARP2-enriched fractions from the butyl-Sepharose could be completely separated from PDE6 subunits by reversed phase HPLC. On Coomassie-stained gels of purified GARP2, >50% of the total staining was observed at ∼60 kDa, corresponding to GARP2 (Fig. 2C). No detectable protein was observed at molecular masses corresponding to PDE6 catalytic or inhibitory subunits. The GARP2 purity was likely to be much higher, because this glutamate-rich protein binds Coomassie protein stain very poorly relative to other proteins. It is therefore unlikely that the effects of GARP2 on PDE6 activity reported in this paper could be ascribed to a contaminating protein in our purified GARP2. The 17-kDa Prenyl-binding Protein (PrBP/δ) Releases PDE6, but Not GARP2, from ROS Membranes—The 17-kDa prenyl-binding protein (PrBP/δ), originally described as the δ-subunit of PDE6 (33Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is able to solubilize membrane-associated rod PDE6 in vitro (23Norton A.W.

Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) by binding to the hydrophobic prenyl groups attached to the C termini of the PDE6 catalytic subunits (35Cook T.A. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Florio S.K. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13516-13523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because hydrophobic interactions may stabilize GARP2-PDE6 interactions (see previous section), we wondered whether PrBP/δ binding to PDE6 would solubilize the enzyme as a complex with GARP2 or, alternatively, compete with GARP2 for binding to a hydrophobic region on PDE6. Fig. 3 shows an experiment in which increasing amounts of PrBP/δ were added to ROS membranes (containing bound PDE6 and GARP2) and the solubilization of PDE6 monitored by centrifugal separation of bound and soluble PDE6. Although PDE6 catalytic and Pγ-subunits were released from ROS membranes by PrBP/δ in a concentration-dependent manner, GARP2 remained completely associated with ROS membranes (Fig. 3). The ability of PrBP/δ to disrupt GARP2-PDE6 interactions was not restricted to PDE6 associated with ROS membranes. If PDE6 and GARP2 were first released from ROS membranes by hypotonic extraction and then PrBP/δ was added, some of the GARP2 that normally co-migrated with PDE6 at ∼300 kDa during gel filtration chromatography was now observed eluting at an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (data not shown). The disruption of GARP2-PDE6 interactions by PrBP/δ suggests that one site of interaction may be at the hydrophobic isoprenyl groups at the C termini of PDE6 catalytic subunits. It is possible that this same binding interface may be disrupted during hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified, Native GARP2 Suppresses Basal PDE6 Catalytic Activity but Does Not Inhibit Activated PDE6—It has been previously reported (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that GARP2 potently inhibited PDE6 hydrolytic activity when purified PDE6 was activated by transducin in solution; in contrast, trypsin-activated PDE6 (lacking Pγ) or nonactivated enzyme (αβγγ) were not greatly affected by GARP2. However, Korschen et al. (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) used a recombinant GARP2 fusion protein for these experiments, and unpublished results from the same group have called into question the ability of native GARP2 to inhibit transducin-activated PDE6 (36Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transducin activates PDE6 more effectively when both proteins are associated with the disk membrane compared with activation in solution (37Fung B.K.K. Nash C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bruckert F. Catty P. Deterre P. Pfister C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12625-12634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to examine whether native, purified GARP2 exerted an effect on nonactivated or activated PDE6 under more physiological conditions in which PDE6 remains associated with the disk membrane. As seen in Fig. 4, the addition of purified, native GARP2 to nonactivated PDE6 attached to ROS membranes (which contain endogenous GARP2) inhibited the basal rate of PDE6 activity by 80%. The suppression of PDE6 activity by GARP2 was maximal when an amount of purified GARP2 was added equal to its endogenous level in ROS (as determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis). A similar result was obtained with purified PDE6 that had been extracted from ROS membranes and chromatographically purified (data not shown). In contrast, no significant effect of GARP2 on either transducin-activated PDE6 (attached to ROS membranes) or trypsin-activated PDE6 was seen (Fig. 4). Even following the addition of a 10-fold excess of purified GARP2 relative to its endogenous concentration in ROS membranes, the PDE6 activity of both transducin- and trypsin-activated PDE6 remained within 20% of its activity in the absence of GARP2. Although the results in Fig. 4 for trypsin-activated PDE6 are in accord with those of Korschen et al. (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we failed to observe the inhibitory effect of GARP2 on transducin-activated PDE6 that they reported. To more sensitively test whether GARP2 influences the ability of transducin to activate PDE6, we first supplemented light-exposed ROS membranes with either GARP2 or nothing and then added increasing amounts of GTPγS to persistently activate transducin in a concentration-dependent manner. Fig. 5 shows that, in the presence of GARP2 (at a concentration 2-fold greater than required to maximally suppress PDE6 basal activity), the ability of transducin to activate PDE6 was only slightly impaired; the small decrease in activation at any given GTPγS concentration was not statistically significant. Once sufficient GTPγS was added to activate all of the transducin present (the transducin:PDE6 ratio in bovine ROS being 30:1), adding more GTPγS had no further effect on PDE6 activation in the absence or presence of GARP2. This result shows that the activity-lowering effect of GARP2 on the nonactivated PDE6 holoenzyme is distinct from the molecular events by which the activated α-subunit of transducin binds to PDE6 and displaces its Pγ-subunit, thereby causing light activation of PDE6. Proposed Physiological Role for GARP2 Regulation of PDE6 in Rod Photoreceptors—In this study, we have shown that GARP2 is a high affinity PDE6 regulatory protein capable of suppressing the basal activity of nonactivated PDE6 but with negligible effects on transducin-activated PDE6. The exclusive localization of GARP2 to rod outer segments (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32968-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggests that this protein may regulate rod PDE6 in a way that helps distinguish the rod and cone phototransduction pathways. One feature that differentiates rods from cones is the amplitude of fluctuations in the dark current (dark noise) in the photoreceptor outer segment (10Rieke F. Baylor D.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2553-2572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Rieke F. Baylor D.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 181-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The low dark noise of rods permits reliable signaling at the single photon level (39Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.-W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 288: 613-634Google Scholar), whereas cones require several photons to generate a detectable signal (40Schnapf J.L. Nunn B.J. Meister M. Baylor D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 427: 681-713Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because the rates of PDE6 activation/inactivation determine the characteristics of photoreceptor dark noise (12Holcman D. Korenbrot J.I. The J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 641-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), GARP2 is an attractive candidate for regulating rod PDE6 to lower its spontaneous activation. This study suggests that the binding of GARP2 to nonactivated rod PDE6 will lower its catalytic activity, most likely by enhancing the affinity of Pγ for the active site of the enzyme. The observed localization of GARP2 to the rim of the disk membrane in ROS (8Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Müller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Colville C.A. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32968-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) may serve as a mechanism to reduce spontaneous PDE6 activation and thereby minimize fluctuations in cGMP concentrations in the vicinity of the cGMP-gated ion channel. The lack of an effect of GARP2 on transducin-activated PDE6 is also consistent with the need for rod PDE6 to be rapidly and stoichiometrically activated upon binding of activated transducin. The single photon sensitivity of rod photoreceptors would likely be impaired if GARP2 were to reduce the efficiency of PDE6 activation by transducin. In summary, our results support a role for GARP2 in maintaining a very low spontaneous activation of PDE6 without interfering with the efficiency of the visual excitation pathway in rod photoreceptors in response to photic stimuli. Reports that GARP2 is associated with the disk rim protein peripherin (20Poetsch A. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48009-48016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Batra-Safferling R. Abarca H.K. Korschen H.G. Tziatzios C. Stoldt M. Budyak I. Willbold D. Schwalbe H. Klein-Seetharaman J. Kaupp U.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1449-1460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) leave open the intriguing possibility that GARP2 might preferentially regulate PDE6 in the vicinity of the cGMP-gated channel, where cGMP metabolic flux might be most stringently controlled. Summary—This work has demonstrated that GARP2 is a novel PDE6 interacting protein that is capable of regulating the basal activity of the PDE6 holoenzyme in rod outer segments. The high affinity with which it binds nonactivated PDE6 suppresses catalytic activity without adversely affecting the ability of transducin to activate PDE6. This novel regulatory mechanism may be of fundamental importance in establishing the high signal-to-noise ratio needed for single photon detection in rod photoreceptors. Future studies will be directed toward determining the molecular mechanism of GARP2 interaction with the catalytic and/or inhibitory subunits of dark-adapted and light-activated PDE6. We thank Dr. U.

These and other findings related to the activation of CDK5 are critically reviewed from a molecular perspective. In addition, the results obtained on the behavior of CDK5 are compared with data on CDK2 to assess the differences and similarities between the two kinases in terms of (i) roscovitine binding, (ii) regulatory subunit association, (iii) conformational changes in the T-loop following CDK/regulatory subunit complex formation, and (iv) specificity in CDK/regulatory subunit recognition. An energy decomposition analysis, used for these purposes, revealed why the binding of p25 alone is sufficient to stabilize the extended active T-loop conformation of CDK5, whereas the equivalent conformational change in CDK2 requires both the binding of cyclin A and phosphorylation of the Thr160 residue. The interaction energy of the CDK5 T-loop with p25 is about 26 kcal·mol-1 greater than that of the CDK2 T-loop with cyclin A. The binding pattern between CDK5 and p25 was compared with that of CDK2/cyclin A to find specific regions involved in CDK/regulatory subunit recognition.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 3The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CMGC, a class of protein kinases according Hanks and Quinn nomenclature (4Hanks S. Quinn A.M.

Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 2Golsteyn R.M. Cancer Lett. 2005; 217: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Murray A.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). CDKs consist of two subunits, one catalytic and the other regulatory. The catalytic subunit is a Ser/Thr kinase from the CMGC kinase family (4Hanks S. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar); the associated regulatory proteins are called cyclins (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Cyclins are highly specific for individual kinases, resulting in the formation of distinct complexes, e.g. CDK1/cyclin B1 and CDK2/cyclin E1. The primary biological function of these complexes is related to regulation of the cell cycle. However, certain CDKs do not participate in cell cycle control, instead they are involved in controlling cell differentiation in neuronal and muscle cells. This class of CDKs is exemplified by CDK5, which plays a critical role during neuronal development (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Mapelli M. Musacchio A.

Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Several CDKs (CDK1–4 and CDK6) show a dual mechanism of activation based on the binding of the cyclin box fold (CBF) region of the regulatory subunit to the kinase and phosphorylation of the activation loop (also known as the T-loop) of the kinase (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). However, this mode of activation is not observed in CDK5, despite sequence identities of almost 60% for CDK2-CDK5 pairs in different species (Scheme 1). CDK5 is a unique member of the CDK family, because it is not activated by a cyclin. It binds to cyclins D and E, but they fail to induce its kinase activity (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Instead, CDK5 activity is triggered by p35NCKA and p39NCKAI (henceforth referred to as p35 and p39, respectively; see Scheme 2), proteins expressed only in neurons and a few other cell types (6Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Kesavapany S. Li B.S. Amin N. Zheng Y.L. Grant P. Pant H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Neither p35 nor p39 exhibit any detectable similarity to cyclins. The association of CDK5 with p35 or p39 is sufficient to induce full activation of CDK5. Furthermore, CDK5 is not activated by phosphorylation of the activation loop, although the loop contains a residue (Ser159, equivalent to Thr160 of CDK2) that could potentially be phosphorylated (5Tarricone C.

By contrast, association with either the p35 or p39 activator proteins alone is sufficient to fully induce CDK5 activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although CDK5 is expressed in a number of tissues, its activity is restricted to neurons by the localization of its activators. Unregulated CDK5 activity has been implicated in the pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Deregulation of CDK5 activity is induced by the proteolytic cleavage of p35 by calpain, forming the active fragment p25. The p25 fragment induces hyperactivation of CDK5. Furthermore, unlike p35, it is not localized in the cell membrane. The CDK5/p25 complex can thus translocate from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and nucleus, where it hyperphosphorylates a number of substrates, leading to neuronal cell death (8Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 9Kesavapany S. Li B.S. Amin N. Zheng Y.L. Grant P. Pant H.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Because the deregulation of CDK5 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, there is significant interest in the development of new chemical inhibitors of CDK5 to treat these serious brain illnesses (6Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Weishaupt J.H. Neusch C. Bahr M. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 312: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Structural aspects of CDK5 activation by p25 have been revealed by analysis of the crystal structure of the CDK5/p25 complex (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The structure of the unphosphorylated complex confirms that the cyclin box fold (CBF) is a structural feature of p25. p25 has eight α-helices, five of which (α1 to α5) adopt a topology similar to that of the CBF (Fig. 1A). The p25 CBF binds to the activation loop and the C-α helix of CDK5, the latter of which contains the PSAALRE sequence motif (residues 45–51). Overall, the structural features of the CDK5/p25 complex are similar to those of the CDK2/cyclin A complex (Fig. 1B) (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). However, there are also some noteworthy structural and regulatory differences between the two complexes. One such difference is that even in the absence of a phosphate group on Ser159, the CDK5 activation loop adopts the correct conformation for substrate binding (a conformation typical of active proline-directed kinases) (6Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This conformation (Fig. 1, C and D) resembles that observed in the fully active Thr(P)160-CDK2/cyclin A complex (16Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Thus, p25 acts as a one-step activator in that its binding to CDK5 induces in a single step the conformational changes that CDK2 undergoes only after two independent regulatory events: cyclin A binding and the phosphorylation of Thr160 (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (see Scheme 2). The Thr(P)160 (phosphothreonine) of CDK2 acts as an organizing center that interacts with three neighboring arginine residues (Arg50, Arg126, and Arg150), stabilizing the active, extended conformation of the T-loop (16Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the CDK5/p25 complex, the structural requirement for phosphorylation is bypassed by an extensive network of interactions between p25 and the CDK5 activation loop, a feature that is not observed in the phospho-CDK2/cyclin A complex. The phosphorylation of the activation loop (Ser159) may even have an inhibitory effect on the CDK5/p35 interaction. This is suggested by the fact that substituting Ser159 with glutamic acid impairs the interaction of CDK5 with p35, and even the apparently conservative substitution of Ser159 by threonine causes a significant decrease in p35 binding ability (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas the Ser159 → Ala-CDK5/activator complex is fully active. The phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 in the glycine-rich loop (G-loop; residues 11–16) that forms the “ceiling” of the ATP-binding site is important in the regulation of CDK activity (18Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Certain structural aspects of CDK2 were recently proposed on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations (19Bártová I. Otyepka M. Kříž Z. Koča J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Bártová I. Otyepka M. Kříž Z. Koča J.

Inhibitory phosphorylation of specific residues (Thr14 and Tyr15) in CDK2 results in ATP misalignment and a shift of ∼5 Å in the position of the G-loop, “opening” the substrate-binding site. Phosphorylation of Thr14 of CDK5 by an unidentified kinase results in similar inhibition. However, this has only been observed in vitro, and the significance of Thr14 phosphorylation in vivo remains unclear. The phosphorylation of Tyr15 of CDK5, on the other hand, occurs both in vitro and in vivo. The Tyr15 is phosphorylated by Abl tyrosine kinase, and this increases CDK5 activity to some extent (5Tarricone C. Dhavan R. Peng J. Areces L.B. Tsai L.H. Musacchio A. Mol.

By contrast, the phosphorylation of Tyr15 and Thr14 by kinases of the Wee1 family inhibits CDK1 and CDK2 (18Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). It is not yet known why the phosphorylation of Tyr15 in CDK5 has an opposite effect to that of phosphorylation of the adjacent Thr14. As the key regulatory enzymes of the cell cycle, CDKs have become important pharmaceutical targets for inhibitor design. The purine derivative roscovitine (2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxy-ethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine; Scheme 3) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of CDKs, with IC50 values of 0.16 μm for CDK5 (23De Azevedo W.F. Gaspar R.T. Canduri F. Camera J.C. da Silveira N.J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 11: 1154-1158Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 0.70 μm for CDK2 (24De Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlíček L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the CDK2/roscovitine complex indicates that the inhibitor binds in the ATP-binding pocket of CDK2 but that its mode of binding is different from that of ATP (24De Azevedo W.F.

Recently, Mapelli et al. (27Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Crovace C. Seeliger M.A. Tsai L.H. Meijer L. Musacchio A. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) described the crystal structure of CDK5D144N/p25/roscovitine. The (R)-enantiomer (CYC202) of the inhibitor roscovitine, which is discussed in this paper, is particularly interesting because of its importance in medicinal chemistry; it is now entering phase II cancer clinical trials and phase I clinical tests against glomerulonephritis, following encouraging results from preclinical tests (28Meijer L. Raymond E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations of CDK5/p25 and CDK5/p25/roscovitine complexes and of versions of these complexes phosphorylated “in silico” on the Tyr15 residue of the G-loop were carried out using the program PMEMD-3.01 (29Duke R.E. Pedersen L.G. PMEMD, Version 3.01. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill2003Google Scholar) with the parm99 force field (30Wang J.M. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3530) Google Scholar). The CDK5/p25 starting structure was taken from the Protein Data Bank (code 1H4L), and the starting structure for CDK5/p25/roscovitine was created by superposition of the CDK5/p25 and CDK2/roscovitine complexes. The residues not observed (residues 1, 11–14, and 39–42) in the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1H4L) were added to the simulated proteins using Insight II (using the CDK2/roscovitine x-ray crystal structure as a template structure (24De Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlíček L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar)) and annealed and minimized before running the MD simulation protocol with constraints on those residues whose position was specified in the crystal. The missing terminal residues of CDK5 (residues 288–292) were not included in the simulations. The MD simulation protocol applied was as follows. First, the protonation states of all histidines were checked using WHATIF (31Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar) to create an optimal H-bond network. All hydrogens were added using the Xleap program from the AMBER 6.0 package (32Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G.L. Kollman P.A. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1999; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). The structures were neutralized by adding 6 Cl- counter ions to the unphosphorylated systems and 4 Cl- counter ions to the systems phosphorylated at Tyr15. Each system was solvated in a rectangular water box with a layer of water molecules 10 Å thick. The energy of each system was then minimized as follows prior to the main molecular dynamics simulation run. The protein was frozen, and the solvent molecules and counterions were allowed to move during a 1000-step minimization and a 2-ps long molecular dynamics run under NpT conditions. The side chains were then relaxed using several sequential minimizations with the force constants applied to the backbone atoms being decreased in each run. Following this relaxation, the system was heated to 250 K for 10 ps and then to 298.15 K for 40 ps. The production phases were run for 10 ns for both unphosphorylated systems and for 5 ns for the Tyr15-phosphorylated systems. Each individual system studied consisted of ∼55,000 atoms. The simulation period was chosen as a compromise between the quality of configuration space sampling and the calculation length. Time integration steps of 2 fs were used, together with particle-mesh Ewald methods for electrostatic interactions. All simulations were run under periodic boundary conditions in the NpT ensemble at 298.16 K and at a constant pressure of 1 atm. The SHAKE algorithm with a tolerance of 10-5 Å was applied to fix all bonds containing hydrogen atoms. Nonbonding interactions were subject to a 10.0-Å cutoff. Coordinates were stored every 2 ps. All analyses of the MD simulations were carried out using the CARNAL, ANAL, and PTRAJ modules of AMBER-6.0 (32Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G.L. Kollman P.A. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1999; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar), and with GROMACS (33Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys.

Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and threonine residues. The results obtained were compared with previously obtained data on the fully active form of CDK2 (Thr(P)160-CDK2/cyclin A/ATP) and the fully active form of CDK2 complexed with the peptide substrate HHASPRK (Thr(P)160-CDK2/cyclin A/ATP/HHASPRK) (19Bártová I.

Table 1 shows global characteristics of the MD trajectories. The CDK5/p25 and CDK5/p25/roscovitine complexes were stable during the production runs of the molecular dynamics simulations, as confirmed by analysis of the root mean square deviation from the x-ray crystal structure, radius of gyration (Rg), secondary structure elements (data not shown), and total energy.TABLE 1Global characteristics of the trajectories from the whole production part of the MD simulationsTrajectorytr.m.s.ar.m.s. is root mean square deviations of backbone atoms compared with initial x-ray crystal structures (CDK5)r.m.s.

In both cases, the simulated relaxed G-loop conformation agreed well with that in the recently published x-ray crystal structure of the CDK5D144N/p25/roscovitine complex (27Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Crovace C. Seeliger M.A. Tsai L.H. Meijer L. Musacchio A. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The position and conformation of the G-loop were not affected by the presence of roscovitine in the active site, but the flexibility of the G-loop was reduced somewhat in the presence of the inhibitor; this was confirmed by analysis of the temperature B-factors and visual inspection. Interactions of Roscovitine with CDK5—Four hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) were observed between CDK5 and roscovitine in the CDK5/p25/roscovitine complex (Fig. 2). The network of H-bonds involves the residues Cys83 (which is involved in two H-bonds), Ile10, Glu12, and Gln130. The Cys83 amide N–H interacts with the roscovitine N-7 atom, whereas the Cys83 carbonyl C=O forms an H-bond with the roscovitine N-6 atom. In the CDK2/roscovitine complex, Leu83 also forms H-bonds with the N-6 and N-7 atoms of roscovitine (see Scheme 3 for atom numbering). The hydroxyl group of the chiral hydroxyethyl substituent of (R)-roscovitine is H-bonded to the Glu12 carbonyl oxygen at the beginning of the CDK5/p25/roscovitine simulation but shifts to the Gln130 carbonyl oxygen during the course of the simulation. By contrast, in the CDK2/roscovitine simulation, the roscovitine hydroxyl group alternately formed bonds with the Ile10 carbonyl oxygen, the Asp86 O-δ atom, and Gln131 carboxyl oxygen at various points during the molecular dynamics run. The amino group containing the N-2 atom of (R)-roscovitine (i.e. the amino group of the C-2 substituent) forms an H-bond with the Ile10 carbonyl oxygen of CDK5 (Table 2).TABLE 2Hydrogen bonds between roscovitine (ROC) and CDK5 (see Scheme 3 for atom labeling)TrajectoryDonorAcceptorDurationMean distanceMean angle%ÅdegreeCDK5/p25/roscovitineCys83 NROC N-750.43.18 ± 0.1519.78 ± 7.04ROC N-6Cys83 O88.62.92 ± 0.1320.20 ± 5.78ROC N-2Ile10 O39.03.17 ± 0.1814.62 ± 7.04ROC O-1Glu12 O15.32.90 ± 0.2016.04 ± 7.13ROC O-1Gln130 O5.62.91 ± 0.2015.11 ± 6.72Tyr(P)15-CDK5/p25/roscovitineCys83 NROC N-743.73.24 ± 0.1420.02 ± 7.01ROC N-6Cys83 O85.52.95 ± 0.1520.32 ± 5.72ROC O-1Asp-86 O-D17.42.78 ± 0.1811.46 ± 6.34ROC O-1Gln130 O9.32.79 ± 0.1514.25 ± 6.83 Open table in a new tab To quantify the interactions between roscovitine and CDK5/CDK2, the energies of interaction between the inhibitor and the respective kinase were calculated using the AMBER force field (parm99) and averaged over the MD trajectories (Table 3). The AMBER force field appears, on average, to reproduce satisfactorily the interaction energies calculated using highly accurate quantum mechanical methods (MP2/Complete-Basis-Set-Limit with CCSD(T) correction) 5P.

B. 2004; 108: 5466-5471Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is therefore a suitable method for semi-quantitative comparisons. The AMBER force field used evaluates two terms for noncovalent interactions, (i) an electrostatic term, Eels, described by Coulomb's law, and (ii) a van der Waals term, Evdw, evaluated as a Lennard-Jones potential. The van der Waals interaction term provides a good approximation of dispersion forces and repulsive interactions (37Muller-Dethlefs K. Hobza P. Chem.

The interaction patterns of roscovitine with CDK5 and CDK2 are almost identical except for two minor differences in the interactions formed by N-7 and C-8 (Fig. 3A). The differences in the interactions of roscovitine with CDK5 or CDK2 arise from the facts that the position of Cys83 in CDK5 is occupied by Leu83 in CDK2, and where the inhibitor interacts with Leu133 in CDK5, it interacts with Leu134 in CDK2 (Fig. 3B). Conformational Behavior and Energetics of Tyr(P)15-CDK5—Phosphorylation of the Tyr15 residue of the G-loop of the CDK5/p25/roscovitine complex causes the position of the G-loop to shift relative to that in the unphosphorylated complex and also increases the flexibility of the loop. The loop moves away from the roscovitine-binding site, but the Tyr(P)15 (phosphotyrosine) side chain still points toward the C2 group of roscovitine. Tyr15 phosphorylation shifts the position of the G-loop by about ∼8 Å compared with that in the unphosphorylated CDK5/p25/roscovitine complex (the distance quoted is that between the relative positions of the C-α atoms of Thr14 in the two complexes) (Fig. 4A). However, Tyr15 phosphorylation in the CDK5/p25 and CDK5/p25/roscovitine complexes does not affect the se"

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator and receptor form complexes that aid inflammatory cell invasion at sites of arterial injury. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is a mammalian serpin that binds and regulates the urokinase receptor complex. Serp-1, a myxomaviral serpin, also targets the urokinase receptor, displaying profound anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity in a wide range of animal models. Serp-1 reactive center site mutations, mimicking known mammalian and viral serpins, were constructed in order to define sequences responsible for regulation of inflammation. Thrombosis, inflammation, and plaque growth were assessed after treatment with Serp-1, Serp-1 chimeras, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, or unrelated viral serpins in plasminogen activator inhibitor or urokinase receptor-deficient mouse aortic transplants. Altering the P1-P1' Arg-Asn sequence compromised Serp-1 protease-inhibitory activity and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models; P1-P1' Ala-Ala mutants were inactive, P1 Met increased remodeling, and P1' Thr increased thrombosis. Substitution of Serp-1 P2-P7 with Ala6 allowed for inhibition of urokinase but lost plasmin inhibition, unexpectedly inducing a diametrically opposed, proinflammatory response with mononuclear cell activation, thrombosis, and aneurysm formation (p < 0.03). Other serpins did not reproduce Serp-1 activity; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 increased thrombosis (p < 0.0001), and unrelated viral serpin, CrmA, increased inflammation. Deficiency of urokinase receptor in mouse transplants blocked Serp-1 and chimera activity, in some cases increasing inflammation. In summary, 1) Serp-1 anti-inflammatory activity is highly dependent upon the reactive center loop sequence, and 2) plasmin inhibition is central to anti-inflammatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2067423853,"We have identified carbon catabolite repression (CCR) as a regulator of amino acid permeases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, elucidated the permeases regulated by CCR, and identified the mechanisms involved in amino acid permease regulation by CCR. Transport of l-arginine and l-leucine was increased by ∼10–25-fold in yeast grown in carbon sources alternate to glucose, indicating regulation by CCR. In wild type yeast the uptake (pmol/106 cells/h), in glucose versus galactose medium, of l-[14C]arginine was (0.24 ± 0.04 versus 6.11 ± 0.42) and l-[14C]leucine was (0.30 ± 0.02 versus 3.60 ± 0.50). The increase in amino acid uptake was maintained when galactose was replaced with glycerol. Deletion of gap1Δ and agp1Δ from the wild type strain did not alter CCR induced increase in l-leucine uptake; however, deletion of further amino acid permeases reduced the increase in l-leucine uptake in the following manner: 36% (gnp1Δ), 62% (bap2Δ), 83% (Δ(bap2-tat1)). Direct immunofluorescence showed large increases in the expression of Gnp1 and Bap2 proteins when grown in galactose compared with glucose medium. By extending the functional genomic approach to include major nutritional transducers of CCR in yeast, we concluded that SNF/MIG, GCN, or PSK pathways were not involved in the regulation of amino acid permeases by CCR. Strikingly, the deletion of TOR1, which regulates cellular response to changes in nitrogen availability, from the wild type strain abolished the CCR-induced amino acid uptake.

The preferred mode of metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is fermentative, and the preferred carbon source is glucose; other carbohydrates such as galactose or maltose and non-fermentable carbon sources such as ethanol and glycerol could also be utilized by yeast (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution, reduction, or removal of glucose from the laboratory growth medium, however, is known to have important physiological and genomic consequences in yeast (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol.

Two nutrient signaling transducers, namely SNF1 and GCN2, are known to play a major role in global gene regulation by CCR. SNF1 is a yeast homologue of the AMP-activated protein kinase that regulates CCR through the MIG1 protein (5Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). During the conditions of low glucose and starvation of amino acids, GCN2 kinase is also involved in nutrient signaling in yeast (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TOR is another important nutritional transducer that regulates various cellular processes including protein synthesis and autophagy (6Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) but in response to the availability of nitrogen. The TOR pathway has been implicated in the up-regulation of GAP1 and down-regulation of TAT2 and HIP1 (7Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in response to nitrogen starvation. Our aim, in starting this study, was to establish S. cerevisiae as a system for the functional expression of mammalian amino acid transporters. A commonly used strategy for protein overexpression is to transform yeast with foreign genes (in this case mammalian amino acid transporters) under the control of GAL1 promoter (8West Jr., R.W. Yocum R.R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2467-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), followed by growth in a medium with galactose (substituted for glucose as a carbon source in the medium), for 12–24 h to induce the expression of the foreign gene followed by a measurement of function of the expressed protein (in our case measurement of the transport of l-14C-labeled amino acids). Thus before this work could commence it was first necessary to characterize the endogenous transport of l-amino acids in yeast grown in media containing glucose and galactose in relatively long term cultures. We were surprised to discover that very little information exists on the effects of glucose substitution with galactose on the functional activity of yeast amino acid permeases. Some information is available regarding short term glucose starvation (i.e. in yeast grown in 2% glucose medium, shifted for 60 min into medium containing up to 0.2% or no glucose) that causes a down-regulation in GAP1 and TAT2 permease (7Beck T.

In metabolic terms, when glucose is limiting or substituted, oxidative metabolism is preferred over fermentative metabolism and there is an increase in respiration and electron transport (10Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Under these conditions amino acids, through trans- and deamination, may be used to replenish the increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (11Coschigano P.W. Miller S.M. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) leading to an increased requirement in their uptake from the medium. One way of fulfilling this requirement would be to increase the import of amino acids via the various yeast amino acid permeases (12Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, we report the characterization of cationic, neutral and anionic amino acid uptake in WT and progeny strains (deleted of various amino acid permeases and genes of various nutritional transducers), following growth in glucose, galactose, or glycerol media. We provide the first evidence of regulation of yeast amino acid permeases by CCR and identify TOR1 (not SNF1 or GCN2) as the nutritional transducer for this phenomenon. Our study provides new insights into coordination between glucose and nitrogen metabolism in yeast.

For certain experiments, alternative wild type S. cerevisiae strain namely Bio101 strain (MATα, ade–; from Bio101) or the diploid INVSc1 (leu2 ura3-52 trp1-289 his3Δ1 from Invitrogen) were used. Various yeast amino acid permeases were deleted from M3750 by using a one-step PCR deletion method described previously (13During-Olsen L. Regenberg B. Gjermansen C. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Hansen J. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. J. Hansen, Copenhagen, Denmark). Details of the genotype of the amino acid permease-deleted strains used in this study are given in Table 1.

Glucose was replaced with galactose (2%) for yeast cell growth in galactose medium. Overnight cultures of yeast cells grown in glucose YNB were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to A600 = 0.4 in either glucose YNB or galactose. Cultures were grown to a cell density corresponding to A600 1–2 on the indicated media overnight (16–20 h cultures) prior to measurement of oxygen consumption or radiolabeled l-14C-amino-acid uptake. (Significant amount of glucose remained in the overnight culture medium when measured using a glucose oxidase/horseradish peroxidase-based luminescence assay). Oxygen Consumption—For oxygen assays the cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.2 and grown at 30 °C for a further 6–8 h until the final A600 was 0.8 for both cultures. Cells were then harvested, washed, and resuspended in 500 ml of fresh YNB-CSM complete medium containing either 2% glucose or galactose. Oxygen consumption was measured using a YSI Model 5300 Biological Oxygen Monitor equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument), and readings were recorded every 15 s. Amino Acid Transport Assay—Yeast cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed in 0.6 ml of transport buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8), and finally resuspended to A600 = 0.7–0.8 in the same buffer. Radiolabeled amino acid uptake was initiated by adding an equal volume (100 μl) of transport buffer containing 5 μm (2.8kBq) l-14C-labeled amino acid to the yeast cell suspension and incubating at room temperature for timed periods. After a specified period, the uptake reaction was stopped by a rapid filtration technique (16Ahmed A. Sesti F. Ilan N. Shih T.M. Sturley S.L. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly 100-μl aliquots of the radioactive cell suspension were filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (0.45-μm pore size) and washed immediately four times with 4 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. Filters were placed in liquid scintillation vials and counted on a Beckman LS6000 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman-Coulter). To determine the background activity cells were filtered and washed at time 0, and the resultant value was subtracted from that obtained after timed incubations. In certain experiments, non-radiolabeled amino acids were added to the uptake buffer at the specified concentrations. All uptake measurements were made in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. RNA Isolation and Semiquantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from wild type yeast cells following 24 h growth in glucose or galactose YNB using RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated total RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription (using an Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit from Qiagen) prior to semiquantitative PCR. The following pairs of oligonucleotide primers (5′–3′, S is the sense strand, forward primer; AS is the antisense strand, reverse primer) were used in the PCR reaction to detect the indicated amino acid permease genes: AGP1, ATGTCGTCGTCGAAGTCTCT(S), GGTCGATCTTGTCTCCCTG(AS); BAP2, TAGAAATGCTATCTTCAGAA(S), ACACCAGAAATGATAAGCTT(AS); GNP1, ACATTATGACGCTTGGTAAT(S), ACACCAGAAATCAAGAACTC(AS); TAT1, TAAAAATGGACGATAGTGTC(S), GCACCAGAAATTGGTCATCC(AS); CAN1, TAGCAATGACAAATTCAAAA(S), TGCTACAACATTCCAAAATT(AS). Following amplification using Qiagen Taq polymerase with the following cycling parameters: 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 50 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min and 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 7 min, PCR products were run on a 1.4% agarose gel and visualized using standard molecular biological techniques. An internal control reaction using oligonucleotide primers to detect the actin gene was run in parallel. Immunofluorescence of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged Yeast Strains—Yeast with GFP-tagged amino acid permeases were grown under conditions described above in glucose- or galactose-containing media. Immunofluorescence was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system (Bio-Rad) coupled to a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon 60× oil-immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4) with an argon laser line (488 nm) and a transmitted light detector for bright field images. Fluorescence and bright field images were acquired sequentially and analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. We measured the uptake of neutral, cationic, and anionic amino acids in WT (M3750) strain grown in glucose or galactose media. The transport of all l-14C-amino-acids tested was linear for at least 40 min (Fig. 1) in both glucose or galactose media; subsequent uptake experiments were performed at 15 or 20 min. l-Leucine, a neutral amino acid, is transported by all major neutral amino acid permeases (BAP2, BAP3, GNP1, TAT1, AGP1, and GAP1) in S. cerevisiae (17Regenberg B. During-Olsen L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The uptake of l-[14C]leucine in WT (M3750) yeast grown in galactose medium was ∼10-fold greater compared with those grown in glucose medium (Figs. 1 and 2). The addition of 5 mm unlabeled l-leucine almost completely abolished (90 ± 3%, n = 3) the l-[14C]leucine uptake measured in cells grown in galactose medium, indicating saturability. l-[14C]Alanine, another neutral amino acid, whose main carriers in S. cerevisiae are likely to be AGP1, PUT4, and DIP5 (17Regenberg B. During-Olsen L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), showed a much smaller increase in uptake (∼3-fold) in WT (M3750) grown in galactose compared with those grown in glucose (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Uptake of neutral, cationic, and anionic l-14C-labeled amino acid (5 μm) is increased in wild type yeast (M3750) cells grown in 2% galactose YNB (shaded bar) compared with those grown 2% glucose YNB (solid bar) medium. Results are mean uptake ± S.E. from 5–20 preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The uptake of cationic amino acid l-[14C]arginine (5 μm) was also time-dependent (Fig. 1); a 25-fold increase in l-arginine uptake was observed (Figs. 1 and 2) in WT strain grown in galactose medium compared with glucose, which was also saturable, as addition of 5 mm l-arginine inhibited this uptake by 93 ± 2% (n = 3). Transport of l-[14C]lysine, another cationic amino acid, increased ∼10-fold in the M3750 yeast grown in galactose medium compared with those in glucose medium (Fig. 2). The level of uptake of l-[14C]glutamate (5 μm) was relatively lower than that for l-leucine or l-arginine transport in M3750 grown in glucose (0.008 ± 0.002 pmol/106/h cells, Fig. 2). However, there was a significant (5-fold) increase in l-[14C]glutamate uptake in M3750 grown in galactose medium (Fig. 2). Concurrent with the increase in uptake of amino acids, there was a 15 ± 1-fold increase in the oxygen consumption in yeast grown in 2% galactose compared with those grown in 2% glucose (n = 3). Is the increase in amino acid transport in S. cerevisiae grown in galactose medium compared with those in glucose because of CCR or galactose induction? To answer this question we measured l-[14C]leucine and arginine uptake in M3750 grown in a non-fermentable carbon source, namely glycerol. There was an 8 ± 0.5 and 15.2 ± 0.3-fold (n = 3) increase in the uptake of l-[14C]leucine and arginine, respectively, in M3750 grown in glycerol compared with glucose medium. A 5.3 ± 0.5-fold increase (n = 3) was also observed for L[14C]alanine uptake in glycerol compared with glucose medium. These results indicate that the increase in amino acid transport is because of carbon catabolite repression. We then tested other strains to determine the universality of CCR of neutral and cationic amino acid permeases in yeast. In another MATa strain BY4741, there was an 8- and 10-fold increase in leucine and arginine uptake, respectively, in yeast grown in galactose compared with glucose medium (Fig. 3); there was also an increase of 6 ± 0.4-fold in l-[14C]lysine and 3.2 ± 0.2-fold in l-[14C]glutamate uptake in yeast grown in galactose compared with glucose-containing medium in the BY4741 strain (similar results were obtained for the WT M3750 strain, Fig. 2). In a MATα type (Bio 101 strain) the uptake of both l-leucine and l-arginine showed increases of between 5–10-fold (Fig. 3) in yeast grown in galactose compared with glucose medium. In the diploid, INVSc1 strain there was a 5-fold increase in the uptake of both l-leucine and l-arginine (Fig. 3). These results indicate that there is an increase in the uptake of l-leucine and l-arginine when yeast are grown in galactose compared with glucose containing medium for MATa and MATα and haploid and diploid strains of S. cerevisiae. Yeast amino acid permease expression and activity are thought to be regulated via nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) or nitrogen catabolite inactivation (12Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol.

Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 35-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A survey of the literature suggested that virtually no information exists on regulation of yeast amino acid permeases through CCR. After establishing that amino acid transport in S. cerevisiae is activated by CCR, we performed experiments to identify the permeases regulated by CCR and the mechanisms by which CCR transduces this activation. To identify which neutral amino acid permeases might be functionally activated by CCR, we used the progeny of the WT M3750 strain sequentially deleted of all major neutral amino acid permeases (agp1, bap2, bap3, gap1, gnp1, tat1, and tat2). Subsequent to growth of these strains in glucose or galactose medium and measurement of l-[14C]leucine transport (as it is a common substrate for these permeases (17Regenberg B. During-Olsen L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)), we have been able to ascribe the neutral amino acid permeases activated because of CCR. Fig. 4 shows l-[14C]leucine (5 μm) uptake measured in wild type and progeny strains deleted of the following seven major yeast amino acid transporters: AGP1 and GAP1 (transport all common 20 l-α-amino acids), GNP1, BAP2, and BAP3 (also transport leucine but display a narrower substrate specificity to that observed for AGP1 or GAP1), and TAT1 and TAT2 (transport aromatic amino acids in addition to leucine) (17Regenberg B. During-Olsen L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). l-[14C]Leucine uptake in the gap1Δ agp1Δ strain showed no difference compared with the wild type indicating that these permeases did not contribute to the observed increase in amino acid transport. However additional gene deletions reduced galactose-induced leucine transport in comparison to the wild type by 36% gnp1Δ, 62% (bap2Δ), and 83% (Δ(bap2-tat1)). Deletion of bap3 from the gap1ΔΔ(bap2-tat1) background did not cause any further decrease of l-[14C]leucine uptake, indicating that these two permeases are not regulated by CCR. Considered in their entirety, these results indicate that the bulk of the increase in l-leucine uptake by CCR occurs via BAP2, GNP1, and TAT1, whereas AGP1, GAP1, or BAP3 are not regulated by CCR. The CCR-regulated l-[14C]leucine uptake was also abolished in the ssy1Δ yeast (Fig. 4). SSY1 is an amino acid permease homologue that mediates amino acid-induced transcription of leucine transporters (e.g. BAP2 and TAT1) by “sensing” amino acids (particularly leucine) in the yeast growth medium (21Didion T. Regenberg B. Jorgensen M.U. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Abolition of the CCR-regulated l-[14C]leucine uptake in ssy1Δ yeast indicates that the mechanism of CCR of amino acid transporter activity is downstream of the Ssy1p regulation of the transcription of leucine permeases in yeast. The increase in the transport of cationic amino acid l-[14C]arginine in the galactose medium was largely maintained in the ssy1Δ yeast (8.5 ± 1.3-fold increase in galactose compared with glucose medium, n = 3). These results are consistent with the idea that Ssy1p is not implicated in the regulation of the major l-arginine transporter CAN1 (21Didion T. Regenberg B. Jorgensen M.U. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the increase in amino acid permease activity occurs under CCR, we first tested the hypothesis that this may be because of increase in gene transcription for the amino acid permeases. Semiquantitative PCR (Fig. 5) showed there was a small (∼1.5–3-fold) increase in the RNA transcripts of BAP2, GNP1, TAT1, and CAN1, whereas no differences were observed for AGP1 or the actin control genes. However, this small increase in transcription is not likely to explain the large increases observed in the activity of amino acid permeases. We therefore used the BAP2 and GNP1 strains (the two major permeases responsible for CCR-induced increase in amino acid uptake) from the yeast-GFP clone collection (15Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar) to assess whether their protein expression was increased under CCR. The yeast-GFP clone collection is designed to express full-length proteins, tagged at the carboxyl-terminal end with GFP, from their endogenous promoters. A very faint GFP signal was observed for Bap2-GFP and Gnp1-GFP yeast grown in glucose YNB medium, although this is not visible under optimal imaging conditions (Fig. 6, A and E). However, following growth in galactose YNB medium there was a large increase in the expression of Bap2-GFP (Fig. 6B) and Gnp1-GFP (Fig. 6F). These results indicate that translation of BAP2 and GNP1 messages is greatly enhanced under CCR. It is also apparent from a comparison of Fig. 6, B and F (Bap2-GFP and Gnp1-GFP, respectively, both grown in galactose-containing medium) that the GFP signal is greater for Bap2. This increase (2.5 ± 0.3-fold) in the GFP signal for Bap2 compared with Gnp1 largely reflects their respective functional contribution to the CCR-induced increase in l-leucine uptake.FIGURE 6Direct immunofluorescence was measured in yeast strains with GFP-tagged BAP2 and GNP1 using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system.

Representative pictures of experiments performed in triplicate are presented. Identical image acquisition and analysis parameters were applied when acquiring and analyzing images from yeasts grown in glucose- or galactose-containing medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Distinct signaling pathways have been delineated in response to CCR in S. cerevisiae (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We next considered the signaling mechanisms that may be involved in the functional activation of amino acid permeases in response to CCR. We tested the hypothesis that functional activation of amino acid permeases by CCR was controlled via the SNF1/MIG1 signaling pathway by measuring l-[14C]leucine and arginine uptake in the mig1Δ (BY4741 background) strain. As shown earlier (Fig. 3), neutral and cationic amino acid uptake increased by 10–15-fold when the parent BY4741 was grown in galactose compared with glucose. However, CCR-induced amino acid uptake was similar in both mig1Δ and the parent (BY4741) strains grown in galactose medium (Fig. 7), indicating that the SNF1/MIG1 pathway is not involved in the regulation of amino acid permeases under CCR. Other nutrient-regulated intracellular protein kinases involved in signaling during conditions of low glucose or amino acids are GCN2 (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and PAS kinases (22Rutter J. Probst B.L. McKnight S.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We next tested whether GCN2 and PAS kinase pathways were involved in the CCR-induced increase in amino acid permease activity. The uptake of both l-[14C]arginine and leucine was measured in gcn2Δ and psk2Δ strains. There was no reduction in the uptake of either amino acid in gcn2Δ or psk2Δ compared with parent BY4741 yeast grown in galactose medium (Fig. 7). The TOR pathway is another important nutrient-regulated signaling pathway in yeast. Unlike SNF, GCN2, or PAS kinases, TOR (a member of the phosphatidylinositide kinase family) is linked to the availability of nitrogen (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F. Ai W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apart from TAT2 and HIP1 that were shown to be down-regulated in response to short term nitrogen starvation, no other amino acid permease is known to be regulated by the TOR1 signaling pathway in yeast (7Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). After exhausting the possibility of the involvement of the nutritional transducers known to regulate CCR in yeast, we tested the idea that TOR1 might be involved in the functional up-regulation of amino acid permease activity observed when yeast were grown in galactose medium. In the tor1Δ strain, grown in glucose medium, uptake of l-14C-labeled arginine and leucine was increased between 2 and 4-fold compared with the parent BY4741 strain (Fig. 7). However, deletion of TOR1 from the parent BY4741 strain eliminated the CCR-induced l-[14C]leucine and arginine uptake (Fig. 7). These results demonstrate that the phosphatidylinositide kinase signaling pathway regulates the functional activation of neutral and cationic amino acid permease genes under CCR. We have made the novel discovery that transport of neutral, cationic, and anionic amino acids is regulated by CCR at the protein expression and functional levels. By measuring l-leucine uptake in a series of strains sequentially deleted of amino acid permease genes, we have been able to assign the neutral amino acid permeases whose activity is increased as a result of CCR. Thus we have shown for the first time that BAP2, GNP1, and TAT1 are all under the regulation of CCR, as are the cationic amino acid permeases. Our results indicate that the most likely mechanism of the increased amino acid permease activity under CCR is the increase in the translation of the permease mRNA. We have further discovered that regulation of amino acid permeases by CCR is not via the SNF1 nutritional transduction pathway, generally associated with CCR, but a transducer more commonly associated with NCR, namely the TOR pathway (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Possible Metabolic Consequences of Increased Amino Acid Intake under CCR—Amino acid uptake from the medium through the yeast permeases is an important determinant of the behavior of the yeast and plays an important role in protein synthesis and other processes of cell metabolism (12Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the uptake of all three classes of amino acids, neutral, cationic, and anionic is increased by CCR. These amino acids form common intermediates for the major catabolic pathways such as acetyl CoA (leucine, isoleucine, lysine), pyruvate (alanine, serine), or 2-oxoglutarate (arginine, glutamine, and glutamate). Thus amino acid supply and utilization could be paramount when yeast metabolism shifts from fermentative, in high glucose, to respiratory in glucose-substituted medium. In the light of the above observations, a prima facie case for the utility of the observed increase in the amino acid uptake could be made. During the conditions of CCR the yeast metabolism shifts from fermentative to respiratory (as demonstrated by a 15-fold increase in oxygen consumption in yeast grown in galactose compared with glucose), and carbon is shunted to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, thus increasing the electron transport and respiration (2Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 10Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A concomitant increase in the uptake and degradation of amino acids could fuel the production of direct and indirect substrates (e.g. fumarate, α-ketoglutarate, and pyruvate) for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The three major neutral amino acid permeases identified as candidates for regulation by CCR are all involved in the transport of a wide variety of substrates (12Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Didion T. Regenberg B. Jorgensen M.U. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For example, GNP1 is the most efficient l-glutamine transporter in yeast (12Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Grenson M. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 121: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that also transports amino acids such as l-leucine and threonine. In S. cerevisiae, amino acids with a nitrogen side chain, e.g. glutamine and asparagine, serve as an important source of nitrogen, critical for cell growth and viability. Also, branched chain amino acids such as l-leucine and l-isoleucine, both substrates for BAP2 and TAT1, can be utilized in amino acid oxidation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Regulation of Gene Expression under CCR—CCR in yeast is a well known regulator for a variety of genes such as MLS1 (malate synthase (24Caspary F. Hartig A. Schuller H.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), ACS1 (acetyl-CoA synthetase (25Kratzer S. Schuller H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), and ICL1 (isocitrate lyase (26Scholer A. Schuller H.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3613-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Of the genes known to be regulated by CCR in yeast, all have a nucleotide motif (CCRTYSRNCCG, the CSRE motif) that acts as a signal for genes under the control of CCR. Our search of the Saccharomyces genome data base did not return any matches for this motif on amino acid permease genes, indicating that the carbon catabolite repression of amino acid permeases is perhaps mediated by other mechanisms. The presence of a novel regulatory motif, specific for amino acid permeases remains open and would require further analysis of the upstream promoter regions. Nutrient-sensing Protein Kinases and Regulation of Amino Acid Permeases—Our results also eliminate the involvement of various nutrient-sensing protein kinases in yeast (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the activation of amino acid permease activity due to CCR. Deletion of MIG1, responsible for repression of many genes that are dispensable to yeast cells growing on high levels of glucose (27Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) via the SNF pathway, did not alter activation of amino acid permease activity because of CCR, eliminating the involvement of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. Similarly, the GCN2 pathway, activated in the presence of low nutrients (glucose or amino acids) (4Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is not likely to play a role in the amino acid permease activation due to CCR (Fig. 7). Furthermore, deleting PSK2, one paralogue of the two genes encoding the PAS kinase recently implicated in galactose utilization in yeast (22Rutter J. Probst B.L. McKnight S.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), did not alter the increase amino acid permease activation because of CCR. Galactose fails to support yeast growth in PSK1/PSK2 double mutants (although PSK2 mutants are also challenged but to a lesser extent) presenting a temperature-sensitive galactose utilization phenotype (22Rutter J. Probst B.L. McKnight S.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of psk2Δ upon amino acid permease activation because of CCR suggests, minimally, that this phenomenon is not likely to be because of metabolic changes initiated by alteration in galactose metabolism. By this process of elimination we have made the novel discovery that the signaling of the activation of neutral and cationic amino acid permeases because of CCR is via TOR1 and not through the SNF1/MIG1, GCN2, or PAS kinase pathways. It has been known for some time that a number of amino acid permeases, both neutral (GAP1, TAT2) and cationic (HIP1, CAN1, LYP1), are regulated by NCR (6Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A considerable amount of information also exists on the mechanisms of NCR-mediated transcriptional regulation as well as sorting and degradation of these permeases (7Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roberg K.J. Rowley N.

GAP1 is up-regulated upon nitrogen starvation via a Ser/Thr nitrogen permease reactivator kinase (NPR1) (6Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, no information is available on the effects of long term glucose substitution or starvation on yeast amino acid permeases, particularly in the context of nutrient signaling mechanisms. That TOR1 is involved in the regulation of NCR-mediated regulation of amino acid permease is well established (6Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F. Ai W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Cutler N.S. Pan X. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4103-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); what is surprising is that amino acid permeases may also be regulated through the TOR1 pathway as a result not of NCR but of CCR. The precise sequence of events involved in the TOR-mediated CCR-induced increase in amino acid transporter activity remain to be discovered. The fact that the CCR-induced amino acid uptake is abolished in tor1Δ strain, however, clearly implicates TOR1 in this process. It is also clear that a major contributory mechanism that may explain the increase of amino acid transport activity under CCR is increase in the protein translation for the permeases involved. A TOR-mediated functional up-regulation of amino acid permeases in yeast as a result of CCR may therefore provide a useful experimental model to investigate the coordination of nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism and the likely complex interaction of various nutritional transducers.

https://openalex.org/W2119827607,"In the bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, a family of seven secreted and calcium-dependent mannuronan C-5 epimerases (AlgE1-7) has been identified. These epimerases are responsible for the epimerization of β-d-mannuronic acid to α-l-guluronic acid in alginate polymers. The epimerases consist of two types of structural modules, designated A (one or two copies) and R (one to seven copies). The structure of the catalytically active A-module from the smallest epimerase AlgE4 (consisting of AR) has been solved recently. This paper describes the NMR structure of the R-module from AlgE4 and its titration with a substrate analogue and paramagnetic thulium ions. The R-module folds into a right-handed parallel β-roll. The overall shape of the R-module is an elongated molecule with a positively charged patch that interacts with the substrate. Titration of the R-module with thulium indicated possible calcium binding sites in the loops formed by the nonarepeat sequences in the N-terminal part of the molecule and the importance of calcium binding for the stability of the R-module. Structure calculations showed that calcium ions can be incorporated in these loops without structural violations and changes. Based on the structure and the electrostatic surface potential of both the A- and R-module from AlgE4, a model for the appearance of the whole protein is proposed.

Alginates are unbranched copolymers of 1→4-linked β-d-mannuronic acid (M) 3The abbreviations used are: M, β-d-mannuronic acid; G, α-l-guluronic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; RTX, repeats in toxins.3The abbreviations used are: M, β-d-mannuronic acid; G, α-l-guluronic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; RTX, repeats in toxins. and its C-5 epimer α-l-guluronic acid (G) (1Fischer F.G.

Alginates are initially produced as a linear polymer of M-subunits only. Thereafter, single M-subunits in the polymeric chain are converted to G-subunits by enzymes called mannuronan C-5 epimerases. The mechanical and chemical properties of alginates depend on the composition and sequence of the two subunits, in particular, whether they are arranged in MM-, MG-, or GG-blocks. GG-blocks are rigid and form gels with divalent cations such as calcium. Recently, MG-blocks were suggested also to form gels with calcium (3Donati I. Holtan S. Morch Y.A. Borgogna M. Dentini M. Skjåk-Bræk G. Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Poly(M) regions, however, are more flexible without the ability to form gels with cations (4Grant G.T. Morris E.R. Rees D.A. Smith P.J.C. Thorn D. FEBS Lett. 1973; 32: 195-198Crossref Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 5Stokke B.T. Smidsrød O. Bruheim P. Skjåk-Bræk G. Macromolecules. 1991; 24: 6637-6645Google Scholar). The relative amounts and distribution of M and G vary extensively among different species of both brown algae (6Haug A. Larsen B. Smidsrød O. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 32: 217-225Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Hellebust J.A. Haug A. Can. J. Bot. 1972; 50: 177-184Crossref Google Scholar, 8Smidsrød O. Draget K.I. Carbohydr.

Gacesa P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 135: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)Alginate is for brown algae essentially the same as cellulose is for trees and plants. The stripes of the algae are mainly G-rich, giving them the stiffness to work as a skeleton, whereas leaves are M-rich showing flexibility (11Frei E. Preston R.D. Nature. 1962; 196: 130-134Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In Azotobacter sp., alginate is used as a capsular polysaccharide (12Gorin P.A.J. Spencer J.F.T. Can. J. Chem. 1966; 44: 993-998Crossref Google Scholar, 13Cote G.L. Krull L.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 181: 143-152Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), likewise in Pseudomonas sp. (14Linker A. Jones R.S. Nature. 1964; 204: 187-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Govan J.R. Fyfe J.A. Jarman T.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 125: 217-220PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fett W.F. Osman S.F. Fishman M.L. Siebles T.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 52: 466-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Azotobacter vinelandii, the composition and function of the alginates vary significantly depending on the environmental conditions.Vegetatively growing cells produce alginates that form a loose capsule structure that is easily released into the growth medium. These alginates are typically M-rich (17Sadoff H.L. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 516-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but under certain conditions of environmental stress, the cells enter a resting stage designated the “cyst” stage. The cysts are surrounded by a rigid alginate-containing protective coat, and due to the expression of a family of mannuronan C-5 epimerases (the AlgE family, see next paragraph), this coat also contains alginates with GG-blocks and strong gel-forming properties (17Sadoff H.L. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 516-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Høidal H.K. Svanem B.I.G. Gimmestad M. Valla S. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In all known alginate-producing organisms, the alginates are modified at the polymer level by mannuronan C-5 epimerases converting M- to G-residues (19Valla S. Li J. Ertesvåg H. Barbeyron T. Lindahl U. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The periplasmic epimerase AlgG is a part of alginate biosynthesis and is conserved in all known alginate-producing bacteria (20Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the AlgG epimerase structure from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was suggested to contain a right-handed β-helix (21Douthit S.A. Dlakic M. Ohman D.E. Franklin M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4573-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This protein has, in addition, been shown to be essential for the protection of the alginate polymer against degradation by an alginate lyase, AlgL (22Gimmestad M. Sletta H. Ertesvåg H. Bakkevig K. Jain S. Suh S.J. Skjåk-Bræk G. Ellingsen T.E. Ohman D.E. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Additionally, the bacterium A. vinelandii encodes a family of seven secreted and calcium ion-dependent mannuronan C-5 epimerases (AlgE1-7) (23Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Schjerven H. Svanem B.I.G. Valla S. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These epimerases consist of two types of structural modules, designated “A” (∼385 amino acids each, with one or two copies) and “R” (∼155 amino acids each, with one to seven copies), and additionally, a C-terminal signal peptide in the last of the R-modules (24Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The A-modules alone are catalytically active, but their reaction rates are significantly increased when covalently bound to at least one R-module (26Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R-module of AlgE4 is not catalytically active on its own (26Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of each R-module consists of four to seven copies of a nonapeptide with the consensus sequence LXG-GAGXDX, which is involved in calcium binding (24Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The individual sequence, number, and distribution of A- and R-modules give the individual epimerases their characteristic modes of action on this substrate. The R-module appears to have a significant role in the reaction catalyzed by the A-module by reducing the Ca2+ concentration needed for full activity and by enhancing the reaction rate (26Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments have also shown that the R-module influences the product specificity of the attached A-module, i.e. the degree of GG- or MG-blocks produced (27Bjerkan T.M. Bender C.L. Ertesvåg H. Drabløs F. Fakhr M.K. Preston L.A. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28920-28929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Therefore, it is essential to study the structure of such an alginate epimerase and its modules in detail to achieve insight into its function. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of these proteins opens a range of further investigations concerning the metal binding properties and the substrate binding of alginate epimerases. Of special interest is the role of the R-module(s) after secretion and its/their influence on the function of the A-module(s).Unsuccessful attempts have been made to crystallize the smallest epimerase (AlgE4 consisting of one A- and one R-module). However, the A-module has been produced and crystallized separately, and recently the structure of this module was solved by x-ray crystallography (28Bjerkan T.M. Structure-Function Analyses of Mannuronan C-5 Epimerases. Department of Biotechnology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway2003Google Scholar). The A-module belongs to the family of pectate lyase folds. It folds as a single-stranded, right-handed parallel β-helix. This β-helix consists of 12 complete turns, made up of four β-strands each, except for the last turn at the C terminus, where the helix narrows down to three β-strands per turn. An N-terminal amphiphatic α-helix forms a cap to this part of the protein (28Bjerkan T.M. Structure-Function Analyses of Mannuronan C-5 Epimerases. Department of Biotechnology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway2003Google Scholar). Here, we report the structure of the R-module containing the C-terminal signal sequence and its possible calcium and alginate binding sites.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample Preparation—Cloning, production, and purification of the uniformly 13C/15N-labeled R-module (167 amino acids) and the sample conditions for the NMR measurements were described previously (29Aachmann F.L. Svanem B.I.G. Valla S. Petersen S.B. Wimmer R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Samples for NMR studies contained 1.6 mm R-module in 20 mm HEPES buffer with 50 mm CaCl2 at pH 6.9 in 95% H2O/5% D2O or 99.9% D2O. All NMR experiments were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm xyz-gradient TXI(H/C/N) probe.NMR Spectroscopy—The sequence-specific resonance assignments and the triple resonance NMR experiments used to obtain them are described in Ref. 29Aachmann F.L. Svanem B.I.G. Valla S. Petersen S.B. Wimmer R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar. Three-dimensional 13C- and 15N-edited 1H,1H-NOESY spectra were recorded in D2O and H2O, respectively. The 15N-1H heteronuclear NOEs were calculated from two independently measured and integrated 15N-HSQC spectra as the ratio of the peak volumes with and without 1H saturation. Nuclear magnetic relaxation (T1 and T2) measurements of 15N were obtained by exponential fitting of the peak intensities in 15N-HSQC spectra acquired with different relaxation delays (30Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 31Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar).Metal Binding—The displacement of calcium ions in the R-module by paramagnetic thulium was achieved by adding small amounts of the aliquots of a 4.7 mm TmCl3 solution for the first three steps until an R-module:calcium:thulium molar ratio of 1:25:0.5 was reached. Thereafter, aliquots of 47 mm TmCl3 were added for the next thirteen steps until a (R-module:calcium:thulium) molar ratio of 1:25:10.5 was reached. Finally, aliquots of 470 mm TmCl3 solution were added in three steps to a final ratio of (R-module:calcium:thulium) 1:25:30.75. In all titration steps, thulium was added directly to the uniformly 15N-labeled R-module solution in the NMR sample tube in small volumes so that the increase in sample volume could be neglected. A 15N-HSQC spectrum was recorded for each of the 19 titration steps.Chemical shift changes in two-dimensional HSQC spectra were quantified by calculation of an absolute change in chemical shift as,ΔHSQC=ΔνH2+ΔνN2(Eq. 1) where ΔνH is the chemical shift change of HN atoms expressed in Hz, and ΔνH is the chemical shift change of N atoms expressed in Hz.Alginate Binding—The interaction between the R-module and alginate was investigated by adding small amounts of a 10 mm solution of pentameric β-d-mannuronic acid (M5), dissolved in a buffer identical to the NMR sample, to a solution of 0.15 mm U-15N-labeled R-module in 50 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9. M5 was added in six portions until an R-module:alginate molar ratio of 1:1.2 was reached. In all titration steps, alginate was added in small volumes so that the increase in sample volume could be neglected. A 15N-HSQC spectrum was recorded for each titration step, and spectral changes were quantified according to Equation 1.Structure Calculation—NOESY cross-peaks were identified, integrated, and assigned in the aforementioned NOESY spectra using the program XEASY (32Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). The CALIBA (33Güntert P. Qian Y.Q. Otting G. Müller M. Gehring W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) subroutine in CYANA was used to convert cross-peak intensities from NOESY spectra into distance constraints. Backbone torsion angle restraints were obtained from secondary chemical shifts using the program TALOS (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). On the basis of this input, the structure was calculated using the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA (35Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Weak restraints on (ϕ,Ψ) torsion angle pairs and on side chain torsion angles between tetrahedral carbon atoms were applied temporarily during the high temperature and cooling phases of the simulated annealing schedule to favor allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and staggered rotamer positions, respectively. Structure calculations were started from 100 conformers with random torsion angle values. The 20 conformers with the lowest final CYANA target function values were embedded in a water shell of 8 Å thickness and energy-minimized against the AMBER force field (36Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem.

Commun. 2000; 124: 139-147Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Incorporation of Calcium Ions into the Structure Calculation—Additional structure calculations were performed with calcium ions incorporated into the structure. The calcium binding loops were determined from the thulium titration experiments. The binding geometry was inferred from alkaline metalloproteases from P. aeruginosa (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1KAP) and Serratia marcescens (PDB code 1SAT) (38Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. Mckay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), two proteins with highly similar calcium binding motifs.The calcium ion van der Waals radius was set to 1.12 Å (40Shannon R.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 751-767Crossref Scopus (52815) Google Scholar). The positions of the Ca2+ ions were restrained by upper limit distance constraints between the respective Ca2+ ions and protein atoms using the calcium binding β-roll motifs from P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens (38Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. Mckay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) as templates. One-half of the octahedral coordination is made up by the backbone oxygen atoms of G2 (2.5 Å upper distance limit), G4 (2.5 Å), and the side chain oxygen Oδ1 of D6 (2.5 Å). The coordination sphere is completed by the backbone oxygen atoms from G1′ (2.5 Å) and X3′ (2.5 Å) and the side chain oxygen Oδ2 of D6′ (3.2 Å) of the neighboring GGXGXD loop. To define the two last calcium binding sites, only distance constraints to the first half of the coordination sphere and D6′ were incorporated, because it was found in the x-ray structure of P. aeruginosa that the rest of the coordination sphere was made up by water ligands (39Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. Mckay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Our structure calculations including Ca2+ ions are not intended to serve as a direct determination of the structural details of calcium binding, but merely to demonstrate the compatibility of our data with the known calcium binding mode of the nonapeptide motif.RESULTSThe solution structure of the R-module was calculated on the basis of NOE upper distance limits and TALOS-derived (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) backbone torsion angle restraints (Table 1).

The structured N-terminal end of the R-module is a β-roll defined by three amino acids forming a short β-strand and six amino acids forming a loop to the next short β-strand followed by six amino acids forming the next loop, resulting in an 18-amino-acid β-roll unit. This is reflected by 19.5% of all long range NOEs being observed between atoms that are 18 residues apart in the sequence. This structure is repeated three times (β1 6-8, β2 15-17, β3 24-26, β4 33-35, β5 42-44, β6 51-53) making up three turns of the β-roll (Figs. 1 and 3). Thereafter, a loop-out forms an anti-parallel β-hairpin (β7 61-63, β8 66-68). The polypeptide chain folds back and makes a new turn elongating the β-roll (β9 71-73, β10 81-83). Thereafter, a longer loop bulges out, followed by a less well defined region (91-100). The structure ends with two anti-parallel β-strands (β11 100-104, β12 111-114). The last β-strand (β13 127-129) is situated in between the roll and the anti-parallel β-sheet (β11-β12), parallel to the first and anti-parallel to the latter. Finally, the polypeptide again forms a somewhat less well ordered loop structure from residue 130 onward. From amino acid residue 145 to the C terminus (residue 167), no ordered secondary structure exists. This is in agreement with heteronuclear NOE measurements (data not shown) pointing at a more mobile polypeptide chain.FIGURE 2The NMR structure of the AlgE4 R-module. A, ribbon drawing of the energy-refined R-module structure with the lowest residual CYANA target function, viewed from the front and side of the β-roll. The secondary structure elements are parallel strands β1 (6-8), β2 (15-17), β3 (24-26), β4 (33-35), β5 (42-44), β6 (51-53), β9 (71-73), β10 (81-83), and β13 (125-129), and the anti-parallel strands β7 (61-63), β8 (66-68), β11 (100-104), and β12 (111-114) all shown in cyan.

ΔHSQC values were calculated according to Equation 1. Structure models were prepared with the program MOLMOL (60Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Shown are ΔHSQC values (calculated according to Equation 1) at R-module:calcium:thulium ratios of 1:25:3.75 (top) and 1:25:25.75 (bottom) plotted as a function of the amino acid sequence. Amino acids for which shifts could not be observed after thulium titration are as follows: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 30, 31, 34, 35, 47, 48, 51, 55, 58, 59, 74, 76, 78, 79, 80, 86, 94, 120, 121, 134, 153, 154, 156, 157, 159, 160, and 167. Underlined amino acid numbers indicate residues in a turn or coil structure. Doubly underlined amino acid numbers indicate residues in one of the loops of the repeat region. Secondary structure elements in the polypeptide chain are plotted along the top of the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Remarkably, only 27% of the amino acids of the R-module are in regular secondary structure elements (17% in parallel and 10% in anti-parallel β-strands), whereas 73% of the residues form a coil structure. This is corroborated by circular dichroism measurements (results not shown). Altogether, the protein forms an elongated structure along the axis of the β-roll with a small groove at the front side. The electrostatic surface potential of the R-module shows a positively charged patch formed by arginine and lysine side chains along the small groove at the front side of the β-roll. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues form negatively charged patches along the turns of the β-roll (Fig. 2D, right).To obtain further information about the intramolecular dynamics of the R-module, 15N-1H-NOEs as well as T1 and T2 of 15N were measured (data not shown). The 15N-1H-NOEs show increased flexibility for the N-terminal residues 1-7 and a highly mobile chain from residue 145 onward. The same tendency is reflected in the 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times. For the structured part of the R-module, the T1:T2 ratio is a direct measure of the correlation time of the overall rotational tumbling of the molecule. The average T1:T2 ratio for the protein was 12.1 ± 1.1, which, assuming a spherical particle, corresponds to an overall rotational correlation time τc = 10.7 ± 0.5 ns (30Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar).The R-module has been shown to bind calcium ions (26Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3033-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain further information about calcium binding sites, it was attempted to prepare a metal-free apo-form of the R-module by adding EDTA. However, this resulted in immediate precipitation, so that no sample of apo-R-module could be obtained. The importance of Ca2+ ions for the stability of the R-module is also underlined by the fact that NMR samples of the R-module at 5 mm CaCl2 showed visible signs of degradation in the NMR spectra after 48 h at room temperature, whereas the NMR samples at 50 mm CaCl2 were stable for months. Thus, because an apo-R-module was beyond reach, a titration was performed substituting Ca2+"
https://openalex.org/W2029178098,"A series of histidine-containing peptides (LAH4X6) was designed to investigate the membrane interactions of selected side chains. To this purpose, their pH-dependent transitions from in-plane to transmembrane orientations were investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared and oriented solid-state NMR spectroscopies. Peptides of the same family have previously been shown to exhibit antibiotic and DNA transfection activities. Solution NMR spectroscopy indicates that these peptides form amphipathic helical structures in membrane environments, and the technique was also used to characterize the pK values of all histidines in the presence of detergent micelles. Whereas one face of the amphipathic helix is clearly hydrophobic, the opposite side is flanked by four histidines surrounding six leucine, alanine, glycine, tryptophan, or tyrosine residues, respectively. This diversity in peptide composition causes pronounced shifts in the midpoint pH of the in-plane to transmembrane helical transition, which is completely abolished for the peptides carrying the most hydrophilic amino acid residues. These properties open up a conceptually new approach to study in a quantitative manner the hydrophobic as well as specific interactions of amino acids in membranes. Notably, the resulting scale for whole residue transitions from the bilayer interface to the hydrophobic membrane interior is obtained from extended helical sequences in lipid bilayers.

Notably, the resulting scale for whole residue transitions from the bilayer interface to the hydrophobic membrane interior is obtained from extended helical sequences in lipid bilayers. To date, high resolution three-dimensional structural information on membrane proteins remains sparse. Therefore, prediction and computational methods that allow identifying membrane-spanning segments from their amino acid sequence remain an important tool to establish a first topological model. To this purpose, a number of “hydrophobicity scales” have been developed and later improved using computational algorithms (1Chen C.P. Rost B. Appl. Bioinform. 2002; 1: 1-15Google Scholar). These are either based on experimental data (2Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 3Hessa T. Kim H. Bihlmaier K. Lundin C. Boekel J.

Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, from the few known three-dimensional structures as well as from biochemical experiments that determine the topology of membrane proteins (8Moller S. Kriventseva E.V. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1159-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), knowledge-based statistical scales have been established (9Degli E.M. Crimi M. Venturoli G. Eur. J.

A good algorithm should reliably identify all transmembrane helices and differentiate membrane-spanning domains from sequences that compose a hydrophobic helix within the interior of a soluble protein (13Promponas V.J.

Furthermore, the membrane exhibits very different properties in the interior, at the interface or within the regions directly next to the surface (11Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 18von Heijne G. J. Mol.

Science. 2005; 307: 1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These marked differences in physico-chemical environment are also important for the alignment of polypeptide sequences either parallel or perpendicular to the membrane surface (22Bechinger B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). How peptides orient relative to the membrane normal is of considerable importance for the activity and regulation of helical sequences such as antibiotic peptides, DNA transfectants, or signal sequences (23Vogt T.C.B. Bechinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29115-29121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Kichler A. Leborgne C. März J. Danos O. Bechinger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biophysical studies indicate that some membrane-inserted proteins may exhibit a more loosely folded structure, thereby resembling a tethered assembly of individual helices. These include some of the colicin channel domains (25Zakharov S.D. Lindeberg M. Griko Y. Salamon Z. Tollin G. Prendergast F.G. Cramer W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4282-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein (26Losonczi J.A. Olejniczak E.T. Betz S.F. Harlan J.E. Mack J. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11024-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The interactions of these proteins with the membrane are therefore governed by the same mechanisms as those important for smaller peptide sequences. A reliable prediction of membrane-spanning protein domains requires good knowledge of the free energies (or a parameter that is correlated to that) that are involved when placing amino acid side chains in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Bilayer insertion involves the transfer from the aqueous buffer to the membrane interface and then on into the hydrophobic interior. Most hydrophobicity scales therefore monitor the transition from the aqueous to a low dielectric environment (4von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17086) Google Scholar, 6Rees D.C. DeAntonio L.

Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). A series of model peptides is presented in this paper that provide experimental access to the free energies associated with the transitions from in-plane to transmembrane helical alignments and thus from residue localizations at the membrane interface to the bilayer interior. The LAH4 peptide (27Bechinger B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which was used as a design template, exhibits pronounced antimicrobial activity (23Vogt T.C.B. Bechinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29115-29121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and functions as a potent DNA transfectant (24Kichler A. Leborgne C. März J. Danos O. Bechinger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, “mutagenesis” experiments indicate that this latter activity is strongly dependent on the capacity of the peptide to change its alignment relative to the membrane normal (24Kichler A. Leborgne C. März J. Danos O. Bechinger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Kichler A. Bechinger B. Danos O. Med. Sci. 2003; 19: 1046-1047Google Scholar). Here we investigate in a more systematic manner how the amino acid composition of LAH4-type peptides can be used to modulate the transition pH. The LAH4-derived sequences are composed of four histidines interrupted by a hydrophobic stretch of alanines and leucines. Furthermore, several lysines at each terminus act as membrane anchors and increase the solubility of the peptides in polar solvents. Whereas the central core of the peptide sequence is sufficiently long and hydrophobic to be able to span the lipid bilayer, the histidines are arranged in such a manner as to allow the formation of an amphipathic α-helical structure (Fig. 1). The histidine side chains exhibit pKa values close to 6.0 when in an aqueous environment, thus being positively charged at acidic pH and polar but uncharged at pH ≥7 (Table 1). Histidines have been used previously to control the membrane interactions of model peptides (27Bechinger B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Ladokhin A.S. White S.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).TABLE 1pK and c values of the histidine residues in LAH4X6 peptides in the presence of 386 mm DPC (see “Results” for details)XpK valuesc valuesGly6.0, 6.1, 6.1, 6.10.71, 0.64, 0.74, 0.92Ala5.9, 6.0, 5.9, 6.00.63, 0.85, 0.73, 0.85Leu5.8, 5.8, 5.9, 5.80.85, 0.77, 0.72, 0.86 Open table in a new tab The helical wheel diagram of LAH4X6 indicates how six amino acids of variable composition (labeled X) are interspersed between the histidines (Fig. 1). In this design, hydrophobic residues at the X positions exert a strong driving force for membrane insertion. This is counter-acted by the preference of the histidine side chains to remain in the water phase, an interaction that is strongly dependent on the pH of the surrounding medium. Therefore, the transmembrane insertion of the peptides is a function of both the pH of the environment and the “hydrophobicity” of the X amino acids within the amphipathic α-helix. The pH-dependent in-plane to transmembrane transition can thus be used to directly test for the relative hydrophobicity of the X residues. Previously, it has been shown that oriented solid-state NMR or ATR-FTIR 3The abbreviations used are: ATR, attenuated total reflection; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl; DPC, dodecyl phosphocholine; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. 3The abbreviations used are: ATR, attenuated total reflection; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl; DPC, dodecyl phosphocholine; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. spectroscopy can be used to follow the alignment of helical peptides in membranes. The 15N chemical shift (30Bechinger B. Sizun C. Concepts Magn. Reson. 2003; 18A: 130-145Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the dichroic ratio (31Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) provide sensitive indicators of helical tilt angles when α-helices are incorporated in oriented phospholipids bilayers. When the 15N NMR technique is applied to membranes oriented with the normal parallel to the magnetic field direction, the measurement of 15N chemical shifts of <100 ppm is indicative of helix orientations parallel to the membrane surface, whereas resonances of >180 ppm agree with transmembrane helix alignments (30Bechinger B.

Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dichroic ratio of the amide I band is a direct indicator of the average tilt angle of helical polypeptides. Whereas in-plane oriented peptides exhibit R values around 1.3, this parameter augments by a factor of 2–3 for transmembrane helix orientations. Here we have used both approaches to investigate several peptides of the LAH4X6 series. In order to analyze the data in quantitative detail, dynamic equilibria between membrane-associated states are considered. The underlying model and theory have been described in detail elsewhere (38Aisenbrey, C. (2003) Étude Topologique de Polypeptides Membranaires par RMN du Solide et Spectroscopie Infrarouge par Réflexion Totale Attenuée. Ph.D. thesis, University Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, FranceGoogle Scholar). In short, the following membrane-associated states are considered: IPch ↔ IPo ↔ TM. Here IP indicates the in-plane oriented peptide helices, with the histidines charged (ch) or neutral (o), respectively, and TM indicates the transmembrane inserted configuration. Bulk water being absent in these samples, other states, such as peptides dissolved in the aqueous phase, are neglected in this model. Due to the high energy of placing a charged residue in the membrane environment (39Israelachvilli J.N. Marcelja S. Horn R.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 121-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), it is assumed that all four histidines have to discharge prior to transmembrane insertion. Whereas this condition is already fulfilled at neutral and high pH, discharge of the histidine side chains is possible under acidic conditions only in the presence of other forces that favor membrane insertion (including hydrophobic energies). At acidic pH, the processes of membrane insertion (reorientation into the transmembrane configuration) and discharge are therefore tightly connected processes. When the X amino acids exhibit a low degree of hydrophobicity, the in-planar state remains populated even when the histidines are uncharged. In order to take into account the gradual protonation of four histidine side chains, the in-planar states IP1+,IP2+,IP3+, and IP4+ are taken into consideration (38Aisenbrey, C. (2003) Étude Topologique de Polypeptides Membranaires par RMN du Solide et Spectroscopie Infrarouge par Réflexion Totale Attenuée. Ph.D. thesis, University Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, FranceGoogle Scholar). The equilibrium constant for the transition from IPo to TM is related to the Gibbs free energy ΔG gained by inserting the peptide into the membrane. The equilibrium constant is therefore defined as follows. kTM=[TM][IPo]=e-ΔGRT(Eq. 1) Furthermore, the uncharged in-planar configuration is in equilibrium exchange with the series of charged in-planar states, none of these being able to insert in a transmembrane fashion. When combined into a single state, [IP*] = [IP1+] + [IP2+] + [IP3+] + [IP4+], the constant (1/kCh) for the transition IPo ↔ IP* is the sum of the individual equilibrium constants. 1/kCh=[IP*][IPo]=∑1/kj(Eq. 2) By taking into consideration the number of possible states IPj+ and some algebraic transformation, the experimentally accessible ratio of the transmembrane over total peptide concentration, pTM, is given by the following (38Aisenbrey, C. (2003) Étude Topologique de Polypeptides Membranaires par RMN du Solide et Spectroscopie Infrarouge par Réflexion Totale Attenuée. Ph.D. thesis, University Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, FranceGoogle Scholar), pTM=11+eΔGRT(1+e2.3c(pKa-pH))4(Eq. 3) with the meaning of c being discussed below. The resulting line shapes are shown in supplemental Fig. 8. The degree of hydrophobicity of the X amino acids and thus the ΔG of transfer from the in-plane to the transmembrane state is reflected by three properties of this function. First, the slope of the transition changes with ΔG, being steeper for high negative ΔG (very hydrophobic X). Second, the maximal amount of transmembrane orientation that is observed varies with ΔG. For moderately hydrophobic or hydrophilic peptides, the transmembrane state is never fully populated. Third, the transition midpoint is shifted toward pH values higher than the pKa values of the histidines. During the analysis of pH titration experiments, it should be considered that the local pH on the surface of a membrane can differ significantly from the pH in bulk solution. In addition, the protonation of the four histidines in the peptide are dependent on each other due to electrostatic interactions. We have, therefore, investigated the (de)protonation reactions of the LAH4X6 histidines in membrane environments by monitoring the pH-dependent 1H chemical shift changes of the histidines using solution NMR spectroscopy (see “Results” and Fig. 4). When analyzing the data, it becomes obvious that due to constraining the charges at biomolecular surfaces, the slope of the sigmoidal transition is reduced when compared with the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. The fitting procedure provides the averaged correction factor c, which is also used during the line-fitting analysis of the experimental transition curves using Equation 3. Whereas the fraction of transmembrane-oriented peptide can be evaluated by integration of the appropriate spectral ranges of the 15N solid-state NMR spectra, the ATR-FTIR data were analyzed using Equation 4 (31Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 2pTM(RaATR-RbATR)+RbATR(RaATR+2)pTM(RbATR-RaATR)+RaATR+2(Eq. 4) Here RATRa and RATRb are the maximal and minimal dichroic ratio, respectively. The LAH4X6 peptides of the primary structure KKKKALXHLHXLAXHLHXLAXXALKKK-COOH were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Millipore Corp. 9050 automatic peptide synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry (40Atherton E. Logan C.J. Sheppart R.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1981; : 538-546Crossref Google Scholar, 41Carpino L.A. Han G.Y. J. Org. Chem. 1972; 37: 3404Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The six X-amino acids at positions 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, and 22 represent alanine (LAH4A6), glycine (LAH4G6), leucine (LAH4L6), tyrosine (LAH4Y6), or tryptophan (LAH4W6), respectively. The underlined alanine 13 position indicates the use of the 15N-labeled derivative of Fmoc-alanine (Promochem, Wesel, Germany) during the coupling step. Whenever the crude product was considered inadequate, the synthetic products were purified using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using an acetonitrile/water gradient and a Prontosil 300-5-C4 5.0-μm column (Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). The purity and composition of the peptides were controlled by reversed phase HPLC and MALDI mass spectroscopy. For solution NMR spectroscopy, 5 mg of peptide and 70 mg of perdeuterated DPC (Promochem, Wesel, Germany) were dissolved in 450 μl of 11 mm citrate-d5 (Campro, Emmerich, Germany) and 5 mm NaCl. The pH was adjusted using a 1 m NaOH stock solution. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer at 300 K. For the determination of the pH-dependent behavior of the histidine resonances, TOCSY (42Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1193) Google Scholar) and NOESY spectra (43Macura S. Ernst R.R. Mol. Phys. 1980; 41: 95-117Crossref Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) were acquired using data matrices of size 2048 × 512 or 4096 × 512. Water suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE sequence (44Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar). Typically, the applied mixing times were 85 ms for NOESY and 60 ms for TOCSY spectra. Before Fourier transform, phase-shifted sine-square apodization functions and polynomial base-line corrections were applied. The processed matrix size was chosen between 2048 × 1024 and 4096 × 4096. Published methods were used to assign the resonances of the histidine side chains (45Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). For solid-state NMR spectroscopy, 20 mg (∼6.5 μmol) of peptide was dissolved in water/trifluoroethanol and mixed with 300 mg (∼400 μmol) of POPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL). Prior to the addition of organic solvent, the pH of the peptide solution was adjusted by the addition of 1 n NaOH. The mixtures were slowly applied onto 30 thin cover glasses (11 × 22 mm), dried in air, and exposed to high vacuum overnight. After the samples had been equilibrated in an atmosphere of 93% relative humidity, the glass plates were stacked on top of each other and sealed. The uniaxially oriented stacks of membranes were introduced into the flat coil of a home-built solid-state NMR probe head (46Bechinger B. Opella S.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 585-588Google Scholar) with the bilayer normal parallel to the magnetic field direction. Proton-decoupled 15N solid-state NMR spectra were acquired on a wide bore Bruker AMX400 spectrometer using a cross-polarization pulse sequence (47Pines A. Gibby M.G. Waugh J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 569-590Crossref Scopus (2344) Google Scholar). Typical acquisition parameters were as follows: spin lock time, 1.3 ms; recycle delay, 3 s; 1HB1-field, 1 millitesla; 254 data points; spectral width, 40 kHz. An exponential apodization function corresponding to a line broadening of 300 Hz was applied before Fourier transformation. The chemical shifts were referenced using 15N ammonium sulfate (27 ppm). ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of oriented membrane samples was performed using a Bruker IFS 55 infrared spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector, as described previously (31Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Aisenbrey, C. (2003) Étude Topologique de Polypeptides Membranaires par RMN du Solide et Spectroscopie Infrarouge par Réflexion Totale Attenuée. Ph.D. thesis, University Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, FranceGoogle Scholar). In short, using trifluoroethanol/water solutions, 50 μg of peptide and 500 μg of POPC were spread onto an area of 5 × 1 cm of a carefully cleaned planar germanium plate (ACM, Villiers St. Frédéric, France). The crystal is characterized by an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections. The organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Oriented lipid bilayers spontaneously form along the surface of the crystal, as discussed in detail in Refs. 33Ivanov D. Dubreuil N. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1307-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and 34Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar. The pH was adjusted by covering the membranes with 200 μl of 66 mm phosphate buffer. After a few minutes, the buffer was carefully removed, and the sample was washed with 200 μl of MilliQ-water (Millipore). Although it remains possible that some of the peptide is washed away, thereby modifying the effective lipid-peptide ratio, this procedure has proven essential in order to obtain a well defined pH value without interference from the remaining salt. A fresh sample was prepared for every pH value. After the samples had been dried under a stream of nitrogen, the crystal was introduced into the ATR-FTIR spectrophotometer. During the measurements, the samples were kept dehydrated with a stream of nitrogen. During spectral acquisition, the spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air. For each spectrum, 64 scans were accumulated at a nominal spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. The peptides of the LAH4X6 series were designed to form α-helical secondary structures in membrane environments, as has been observed for many other sequences of related composition (27Bechinger B.

This feature was confirmed by the large number of NH-NH nuclear Overhauser effect cross-peaks observed for the LAH4G6 peptides in the presence of detergent micelles (Fig. 2). Furthermore, when reconstituted into oriented POPC phospholipid bilayers, the LAH4X6 peptides exhibited absorptions at 1657 cm–1 (amide I) and at 1542 cm–1 (amide II) characteristic of helical structures (52Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Molecular Description of Biological Membranes by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis.in: Brasseur R. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-332Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Some spectra of LAH4A6 showed small additional resonances at 1688 cm–1, suggestive of the presence of tiny amounts of β-sheet conformations.FIGURE 3The amide region of ATR-FTIR spectra of LAH4W6 reconstituted into oriented POPC membranes is shown for pH 6 (A) and pH 4 (B). The incident light was polarized in a parallel (dotted lines) or in a perpendicular orientation (dashed lines). The difference spectra (solid lines) are obtained by subtracting the perpendicular polarized spectrum from the parallel polarized spectrum after multiplication of the parallel polarized spectrum by 1.4. This factor corrects for the difference of strength of the evanescent power for the parallel and perpendicular polarizations as discussed in detail in Ref. 31Bechi"
https://openalex.org/W2064118841,"Abstract Solution NMR studies of a 15N-labeled G-protein α-subunit (Gα) chimera (15N-ChiT)-reconstituted heterotrimer have shown previously that G-protein βγ-subunit (Gβγ) association induces a “pre-activated” conformation that likely facilitates interaction with the agonist-activated form of a G-protein-coupled receptor (R*) and guanine nucleotide exchange (Abdulaev, N. G., Ngo, T., Zhang, C., Dinh, A., Brabazon, D. M., Ridge, K. D., and Marino, J. P. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 38071-38080). Here we demonstrated that the 15N-ChiT-reconstituted heterotrimer can form functional complexes under NMR experimental conditions with light-activated, detergent-solubilized rhodopsin (R*), as well as a soluble mimic of R*. NMR methods were used to track R*-triggered guanine nucleotide exchange and release of guanosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate (GTPγS)/Mg2+-bound ChiT. A heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of R*-generated GTPγS/Mg2+-bound ChiT revealed 1HN, 15N chemical shift changes relative to GDP/Mg2+-bound ChiT that were similar, but not identical, to those observed for the -bound state. Line widths observed for R*-generated GTPγS/Mg2+-bound 15N-ChiT, however, indicated that it is more conformationally dynamic relative to the GDP/Mg2+- and -bound states. The increased dynamics appeared to be correlated with Gβγ and R* interactions because they are not observed for GTPγS/Mg2+-bound ChiT generated independently of R*. In contrast to R*, a soluble mimic that does not catalytically interact with G-protein (Abdulaev, N. G., Ngo, T., Chen, R., Lu, Z., and Ridge, K. D. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39354-39363) is found to form a stable complex with the GTPγS/Mg2+-exchanged heterotrimer. The HSQC spectrum of 15N-ChiT in this complex displays a unique chemical shift pattern that nonetheless shares similarities with the heterotrimer and GTPγS/Mg2+-bound ChiT. Overall, these results demonstrated that R*-induced changes in Gα can be followed by NMR and that guanine nucleotide exchange can be uncoupled from heterotrimer dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1964813585,"The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is a critical component of replication initiation. We have previously reported generation of an Orc2 hypomorph cell line (Δ/–) that expresses very low levels of Orc2 but is viable. We have shown here that Chk2 is phosphorylated, suggesting that DNA damage checkpoint pathways are activated. p53 was inactivated during the derivation of the Orc2 hypomorphic cell lines, accounting for their survival despite active Chk2. These cells also show a defect in the G1 to S-phase transition. Cdk2 kinase activation in G1 is decreased due to decreased Cyclin E levels, preventing progression into S-phase. Molecular combing of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled DNA revealed that once the Orc2 hypomorphic cells enter S-phase, fork density and fork progression are approximately comparable with wild type cells. Therefore, the low level of Orc2 hinders normal cell cycle progression by delaying the activation of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases.

DNA replication requires the action of numerous protein complexes to accurately and completely duplicate the genome in a timely fashion. In most organisms, a series of steps must occur to load the replication machinery onto the chromatin. This sequence of events has been examined in several model systems and is fairly well conserved (for review, see Ref. 1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), 2The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; RC, replicative complex; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase.2The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; RC, replicative complex; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase. a complex of six subunits, is thought to bind DNA, thus marking a replication origin (2Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). ORC recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1 to the chromatin, both of which are required for loading the Mcm2–7 complex (3Liang C.

The Mcm2–7 complex is thought to be the helicase responsible for unwinding the double-stranded DNA (8Ishimi Y. J. Biol.

The loading of Mcm2–7 completes formation of the pre-Replicative Complex (pre-RC), which must occur before the end of G1. At this stage, origins are “primed” and are awaiting the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and Dbf4/Cdc7 kinase. These kinase activities are required to load downstream factors that make up the Pre-initiation Complex, Cdc45/Sld3, Mcm10, Dpb11/Sld2, and GINS. These proteins are thought to be important for polymerase loading by mechanisms that are not fully understood (reviewed in Refs. 1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar and 13Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ORC itself is of great interest, as it defines the region in the genome where replication will begin. This function is vital, as evenly spaced initiations are important to complete replication of the entire genome as quickly as possible. In fact, ORC was initially identified in budding yeast based on its ability to interact with the yeast origin sequence (ARS) (2Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). ORC is formed of six subunits, Orc1– 6, that range in size from 97 to 28 kDa. It has been shown that the ORC subunits interact with each other, albeit with different affinities (14Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) are all essential in yeasts. Although ORC is expected to be essential for human chromosomal replication, a detailed study of chromosomal replication with low levels of human ORC has not yet been published. Recent reports using small interfering RNA indicate that acute depletion of an ORC subunit leads to cell cycle arrest, making it impossible to study chromosomal replication under such conditions (20Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Siddiqui K. Spector D.L. Stillman B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2651-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 21Machida Y.J. Teer J.K. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27624-27630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To study ORC in human cells, we have previously generated an Orc2 hypomorph cell line, in which Orc2 is only being expressed from one allele at 10% of wild type levels (22Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A. Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This Orc2 Δ/– cell line (containing one hypomorph Orc2 allele and one null Orc2 allele) was found to be viable, presumably because of compensatory changes in other genes, and was able to proliferate for many generations. The low levels of Orc2 did, however, prevent replication of an exogenous plasmid containing a single Epstein-Barr virus origin. We believe that this difference in replication ability stems from a threshold effect; the levels of Orc2 were high enough to support chromosome replication, but not episome replication. In this study, we have examined the effects of low Orc2 on the replication of the cellular chromosomes, as well as the cell as a whole. Cell Culture—HCT116, HCT116 p53–/–, and Δ/– (HCT116 Orc2 Δ/–) cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Cellgro), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Standard tissue culture growth conditions and methods were used. Western, Northern, and RT-PCR—Western blots were performed as described. In this case, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 150 or 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1/100 Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). Orc3, -4, and -6, Cdt1, and RPA34 and RPA70 antibodies have been previously described (23Pinto S. Quintana D.G. Smith P. Mihalek R.M. Hou Z.H. Boynton S. Jones C.J. Hendricks M. Velinzon K.

Rabbit antibodies against Orc5 were raised using His6-tagged recombinant Orc5-(75–686). p27 (C-19), p21 (C-19), and MCM7 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Orc2 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. p53 antibody (D0–1) was purchased from Oncogene Science. Cdk2, Cyclin E, Cdk4, and Cdc25A (F-6) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rb, pSer780-Rb, pSer807/811-Rb, pThr68-Chk2, and p-Ser216 Cdc25C were from Cell Signaling. pTyr15 Cdk2 was detected by immunoprecipitation against Cdk2, followed by Western using pTyr15 Cdc2 from Cell Signaling (recognizes pTyr15 on Cdc2 and Cdk2.) Chk2 was purchased from Sigma, and E2F1 was purchased from Upstate. Total cellular RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy Midi or Mini kit (Qiagen) or TRIzol extraction. Pulse-Chase—Logarithmic cells were starved of methionine for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were then labeled with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine for 4 h. Cells were washed to remove unincorporated methionine and were chased with McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum for the indicated lengths of time. Cells were lysed in the same buffer as described above, but with 300 mm NaCl. Orc3 was immunoprecipitated with the above antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging plate for visualization and analysis. FACS Analysis—Cells were prepared as previously described (27Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The analysis was carried out on a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur using Cellquest and FloJo software. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—In vivo cross-linking was performed as described in Ref. 28Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar with some modifications. In brief, 80% confluent HeLa, HCT116, or HCT116 Δ/– cells were grown as described above and then treated with formaldehyde (1%). Cross-linked cell nuclei were sonicated 10 times for 30 s each time, and the chromatin size was monitored by electrophoresis (29Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This treatment generated fragments of ∼20 kb. To further reduce the chromatin size to smaller fragments of 1.5–3.5 kb, DNA was digested with SphI, HindIII, PstI, and EcoRI restriction endonucleases in NEB2 buffer (100 units of each; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 6 h. Sheared chromatin-lysed extracts were incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) to reduce background caused by nonspecific adsorption of irrelevant cellular proteins/DNA to proteins. These cleared chromatin lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 6 h on a rocker platform with either 50 μl of preimmune rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μg of anti-Orc2, anti-Orc3, anti-Orc4, or anti-Orc6 antibodies. Protein G-agarose (50 μl) was added, and the incubation was continued for 12 h. The precipitates were successively washed two times for 5 min with 1 ml of each buffer, lysis buffer, WB1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate), WB2 (as WB1 with no NaCl), and 1 ml of TE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The precipitates were finally resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (1% SDS/TE). The samples were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the protein/DNA cross-links, followed by a 2-h incubation at 37 °C with 100 μg of proteinase K (Roche Applied Science). Finally, the samples were processed for DNA purification by passing them through QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR reactions were carried out in 20 μl with 1/200th of the immunoprecipitated material with the use of LightCycler capillaries (Roche Applied Science) and the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). The real-time PCR quantification was performed as described in Ref. 30Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, using primer sets LB2 and LB2 C1. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were arrested in 40 ng/ml of nocodazole for 16 h. To release the cells from mitosis, they were washed three times in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and replated in fresh warmed medium. After the desired incubation time, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h and then prepared for FACS or Western blot analysis as above. Alternately, after the desired incubation time, cells were treated with 1.25 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with cold stop solution (10% trichloroacetic acid, 200 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Cells were washed with 95% ethanol and solubilized (1% SDS, 10 mm NaOH.) The resulting solution was spotted on Whatman paper, dried, and counted on a Beckman LS 6000 scintillation counter. To examine cells in S-phase, cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 12 h, released into untreated medium for 12 h, and further treated with 1 μg/ml of aphidicolin for 12 h. Chromatin Fractionation—Chromatin fractions were isolated as described previously (31Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 100 μl of CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (S1) was removed, and pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again. Pellets were incubated in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 120 units of micrococcus nuclease (Worthington) for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged. Supernatant (S2, chromatin-bound fraction) was removed, and pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again. Pellets were boiled in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer (P2). DNA Combing and Detection by Fluorescent Antibodies—Cells were synchronized at very early S-phase by treatment with 2 mm thymidine for 12 h, release into untreated medium for 12 h, and further treatment with 1 μg/ml of aphidicolin for 12 h. Cells were released into medium containing 50 μm BrdUrd for the indicated time points. Cells were then washed in medium containing 100 μm thymidine and incubated in 10 μm thymidine until 8 h post release. Cells were then harvested with trypsin/EDTA and suspended in 1% agarose. Agarose blocks were incubated with ESPK (0.5 m EDTA, 1% sarkosyl, 2 mg/ml proteinase K (Fisher)) for 24 h twice. Blocks were then washed with TE/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored in 0.5 m EDTA. DNA from whole cells was extracted and combed on silanised coverslips as described (32Michalet X. Ekong R. Fougerousse F. Rousseaux S. Schurra C. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Wolfe J. Povey S. Beckmann J.S. Bensimon A. Science. 1997; 277: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Combed DNA was dehydrated in a series of ethanol (70, 90, and 100%), denatured with 1N NaOH for 30 min, again dehydrated, and blocked in a blocking solution (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. BrdUrd was detected with an anti-BrdUrd antibody (Abcys), followed by an anti-rat antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 and an anti-goat AlexaFluor 488 antibody (33Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28071-28081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Total DNA was visualized afterward by an anti-guanosine antibody (Argene), followed by an anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Antibody incubations were in general for 30 min and were separated by three-four washes with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield® solution. To analyze data, images of the combed DNA molecules were acquired by a Leitz DC300F camera associated with the LeicaFW4000 software and measured by ImageGauge 4.2 software. Fields of view were chosen at random in the AlexaFluor 594 channel and then photographed under the AlexaFluor 594 and AlexaFluor 488 filters. The replication extent of each sample was defined as the sum of all eye lengths divided by the total length of the molecules. Fork density is the total number of forks divided by total DNA length (kb) in each sample, as detailed in Ref. 33Marheineke K. Hyrien O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28071-28081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar. Total DNA length in each case was normalized using the number of cells entering S-phase as shown in Fig. 5D). Absence of Orc2 Affects Core ORC Complex Stability—A hypomorph mutation of Orc2 in HCT116 cells (which we designate the Δ/– cell line) decreases Orc2 protein level by 90% (22Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A. Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We also observed decreased levels of Orc3 and Orc5 protein even though their genomic loci remained unaltered (Ref. 22Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A. Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar and data not shown.) Orc1, Orc4, Orc6, and Cdt1 protein levels are unaffected in Δ/–, indicating that the Orc2,3,5 subcomplex alone is affected by the lack of Orc2. mRNA levels of Orc3 and Orc5 were unchanged in the Δ/– cells (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that the protein decrease is due to another mechanism after transcription. Orc3 and Orc5 proteins might be destabilized due to low levels of the Orc3 binding partner. To examine this, Orc3 stability was determined by a [35S]methionine-labeling pulse-chase experiment. Orc3 was less stable in the Δ/– cells (Fig. 1A), and quantification of the fluorogram revealed a marked decrease in half-life: 11 h in HCT116 cells, compared with 6 h in the Δ/– cells (Fig. 1B). It is possible that the destabilization results from proteasomal degradation. However, Orc3 was not stabilized in either cell line after MG132 treatment, in contrast to p27, a known target of the proteasome (34Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Therefore, Orc3 is not targeted for proteasomal degradation. Similar results were observed for Orc5 (data not shown). These results suggest that the decrease in Orc3 protein level is due to destabilization in the absence of the partner protein Orc2 by mechanisms that do not depend on the proteasome. This destabilization of the Orc2,3,5 subcomplex may adversely affect pre-RC loading in the Δ/– cells. ORC and Pre-RC Loading Is Decreased in Orc2 Hypomorph Cells—In yeast, Orc2 is required for DNA replication initiation (35Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To investigate ORC loading at a specific origin, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using several ORC subunits. The associated chromatin was assayed by quantitative PCR using primers in the Lamin B2 region, a previously reported human origin (36Giacca M. Zentilin L. Norio P. Diviacco S. Dimitrova D. Contreas G. Biamonti G. Perini G. Weighardt F. Riva S. Falaschi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7119-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Orc2, 3, 4, and 6 associated with the Lamin B2 origin in HeLa cells, but not a nearby control region, whereas normal rabbit serum did not associate with either region (Fig. 2A). The experiment was then performed on HCT116 +/+ and Δ/– cells, which revealed a decrease of ORC loading on Lamin B2 in Δ/– cells (Fig. 2B). The amount of cross-linked DNA molecules pulled down in HCT116 cells was 3- to 7.7-fold higher than in the Δ/– cells. This indicates that origin association of the entire ORC (including Orc4 and Orc6, whose levels are not changed) is dependent on the presence of Orc2. This extends our earlier observation that Orc4 loading decreases in a chromatin fractionation experiment (22Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A. Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Interestingly, origin specificity (the ratio of ORC signal at Lamin B2 versus the control region) was retained in Δ/– cells despite the low levels of ORC binding. ORC association with origins recruits Cdt1 and Cdc6, which in turn recruit the MCM2–7 complex to complete a functional pre-RC (5Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To investigate pre-RC loading, we fractionated cells and examined MCM7 levels in the chromatin fractions. Chromatin-bound MCM7 was drastically decreased in the Δ/– cells (Fig. 2c), which indicates that MCM7 loading, and thus pre-RC formation, is dependent on ORC loading. (The use of p53–/– cells as a further control is explained later.) The decrease in pre-RC loading suggests that replication may be affected in the Δ/– cells, as chromatin-loaded MCM2–7 is required not only to recruit additional factors for replication but also to unwind the DNA for fork firing. Chk2 Is Phosphorylated in Δ/– Cells—The low levels of pre-RC are expected to lead to replication stress. This could cause fork stalling (and checkpoint activation) as forks extend from more sparsely firing origins. To test for checkpoint activation, we looked at phosphorylation of Chk1 at serine 317, a target of the DNA damage modulator ATR (37Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). We also looked at phosphorylation of Chk2 at threonine 68, a target of the other major modulator, ATM (38Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Chk1 phosphorylation, although induced by hydroxyurea, is not increased in Δ/– cells (data not shown.) However, we found that Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr-68 is increased in the Δ/– cells (Fig. 3A). It therefore appears that a DNA damage checkpoint is activated in these cells. To determine the downstream effects of Chk2 phosphorylation, we examined several known targets. Cdc25C is phosphorylated by Chk2 at serine 216 (39Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 40Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which serves to inhibit its normal role in activating Cyclin B/Cdc2 (41Blasina A. de Weyer I.V. Laus M.C. Luyten W.H. Parker A.E. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), thus preventing mitotic entry. Phosphorylation of Cdc25C was slightly decreased in Δ/– cells, indicating it is not a target of the active Chk2 (supplemental Fig. S2a). Cdc25A is also phosphorylated by Chk2, causing its degradation (42Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), which, in turn, would lead to increased Tyr-15 phosphorylation on Cdk2 (43Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 44Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We did not, however, observe any decrease in the amount of Cdc25A in the Δ/– cells (it was actually increased) (supplemental Fig. S2a). Likewise, the total amount of Tyr-15 phosphorylation on Cdk2 was less in Δ/– cells, the opposite of what is expected if Cdc25A were inactive (supplemental Fig. S2b). Therefore, Cdc25A and the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk2 do not seem to be affected by activated Chk2 in the Δ/– cells. Perhaps the most well studied target of Chk2 is p53. Chk2 stabilizes p53 by phosphorylating it at serine 20 (45Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hirao A. Kong Y.Y.

These enzymes transfer the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to the 3′-hydroxyl of the antibiotics, whereby the biological activity of the drugs is lost. Pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics with two of these enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria, APH(3′)-Ia and APH(3′)-IIa, were performed. It is demonstrated that these enzymes in both ternary and binary complexes facilitate an ATP hydrolase activity (ATPase), which is competitive with the transfer of phosphate to the antibiotics. Because these enzymes are expressed constitutively in resistant bacteria, the turnover of ATP is continuous during the lifetime of the organism both in the absence and the presence of aminoglycosides. Concentrations of the enzyme in vivo were determined, and it was estimated that in a single generation of bacterial growth there exists the potential that this activity would consume as much as severalfold of the total existing ATP. Studies with bacteria harboring the aph(3′)-Ia gene revealed that bacteria are able to absorb the cost of this ATP turnover, as ATP is recycled. However, the cost burden of this adventitious activity manifests a selection pressure against maintenance of the plasmids that harbor the aph(3′)-Ia gene, such that ∼50% of the plasmid is lost in 1500 bacterial generations in the absence of antibiotics. The implication is that, in the absence of selection, bacteria harboring an enzyme that catalyzes the consumption of key metabolites could experience the loss of the plasmid that encodes for the given enzyme.

The most common mechanism for bacterial resistance to antibiotics is the acquisition of resistance genes. The enzymes encoded by these genes modify the structures of antibiotics, such that the modified drugs bind poorly to their targets. Among these antibiotic resistance enzymes, those for aminoglycoside antibiotics are widespread in pathogens (1Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Mobashery S. Adv. Exp. Med.

Of these enzymes, the aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferases (APH(3′)s) 2The abbreviations used are: APH(3′), aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LB, Luria-Bertani broth.2The abbreviations used are: APH(3′), aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LB, Luria-Bertani broth. are the most common, and they are responsible for the demise of kanamycin, among other aminoglycosides, as a treatment option. The phosphorylation reaction of kanamycin A (structure 1) catalyzed by this enzyme is shown in Fig. 1. These enzymes are present in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Bacteria pay an initial price in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. The price is in the replication and maintenance of the additional genetic material in a naïve organism; that is, one previously not exposed to the given resistance gene (6Gillespie S.H. McHugh T.D.

Wiley, Chichester, NY1997: 131-151Google Scholar). It is believed that over many generations of growth, the resistant organism acquires additional compensatory mutations such that the cost of harboring the resistance gene diminishes and ultimately is eliminated. The implication is that the strains should be able to stably keep resistance genes in the absence of selective pressure with antibiotics (8Schrag S. Perrot V. Levin B.R. Proc. R. Soc.

Whereas the bona fide function of APH(3′)s is the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to the aminoglycoside antibiotics, we observed that APH(3′)s from Gram-negative bacteria also catalyze hydrolysis of ATP (12Siregar J.J. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Siregar J.J. Miroshnikov K. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12681-12688Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At the time we deemed this reaction as insignificant, believing the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to the aminoglycosides as considerably more favorable. That these enzymes were capable of ATP hydrolysis was not a surprising finding, as the enzyme binds MgATP for the purpose of facilitating γ-phosphoryl transfer as its normal function. This phosphoryl group is merely being transferred to a water molecule in the ATPase activity. The pre-steady-state kinetics for transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to kanamycin, neamine, and water, investigated in this report, proved surprising. We disclose that the cost of this ATPase activity is seemingly significant, but at first glance at the phenotypic level, the organisms appear to absorb this cost. However, in the absence of selection, bacteria harboring APH(3′)s experience the loss of the plasmid that encodes for the enzyme. It would appear that these resistance enzymes place an additional burden on the bacterial host above and beyond the standard replicational burden. This goes counter to the aforementioned concept on stable retention of the resistance determinants in the long run, at least for the case of APH(3′)s (8Schrag S. Perrot V. Levin B.R. Proc. R. Soc. London. 1997; 264: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Salyers A.A. Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Antimicrob.

Plasmid Construction—To construct plasmid pUC-APH, the aph(3′)-Ia gene was excised from plasmid pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) with BamHI endonuclease and inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pUC19. Then, the blaTEM-1 gene encoding TEM-1 β-lactamase was removed from the construct by digestion with restriction endonucleases AatII and DraI and religation. Plasmid pUC-TEM was constructed by substituting the aph(3′)-Ia gene in the plasmid pUC-APH with the blaTEM-1 gene from the plasmid pUC19. This was performed by PCR-amplification of the pUC-APH plasmid with primers, PUC-S (5′-AACACCCCTTGTATTACTGTTTATG-3′) and PUC-E (5′-CTGGCAGATCTTTACGCTGACTTGACGGGA-3′; BglII site underlined) that would amplify the entire plasmid except for the aph(3′)-Ia gene. The blaTEM-1 gene was subsequently amplified from the plasmid pUC19 with two primers TEM-S (5′-ATGAGTATTCAACATTTCCGTGTCG-3′) and TEM-E (5′-AAACTAGATCTGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAA-3′; BglII site underlined). PCR products were digested with the BglII, gel-purified, and ligated to produce plasmid pUC-TEM. Plasmids pACYC-APH and pACYC-TEM were prepared in a similar way. The plasmid pACYC-APH containing only the aph(3′)-Ia gene was constructed by removing the blaTEM-1 gene with endonucleases AatII and DraI from the commercial plasmid pACYC177 harboring both the aph(3′)-Ia and blaTEM-1 genes (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The plasmid pACYC-TEM was completed by the ligation of two PCR-generated fragments. The first fragment was produced by PCR-amplification of the plasmid pACYC-APH with the following oligonucleotide primers, PACYC-S (5′-AACACCCCTTGTATTACTGTTTATG-3′) and PACYC-E (5′-GGCAGATCTTTACGCTGACTTGACGGGACG-3′; BglII site underlined). The second fragment was the same PCR-amplified blaTEM-1 gene that was used to construct the plasmid pUC-TEM (see above). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In all constructs both the blaTEM-1 and the aph(3′)-Ia genes were controlled by the same aph(3′)-Ia gene promoter. Plasmid pACYCD216W, which harbors the gene for the D216W mutant variant of APH(3′)-Ia, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid pUC-APH was amplified by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase and two mutagenic primers, D216WD (5′-GGAAATTAATAGGTTGTATTTGGGTTGGACGAGTCGGAATCG-3′; mutation site underlined) and D216WR (5′-CGATTCCGACTCGTCCAACCCAAATACAACCTATTAATTTCC-3′; mutation site underlined). The PCR products were cleaned with the gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and treated with restriction enzyme DpnI to remove methylated template plasmids. The amplified plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli JM83. The nucleotide sequence was verified for the entire gene. The mutated plasmid, pUC-mAPH, was digested with BamHI and HindIII. The fragment containing the mutation site was ligated into the corresponding site of pACYC177, and the product of ligation (pACYCD216W) was used to transform E. coli K-12. Determination of the Concentration of APH(3′)-Ia in Vivo—Using the following parameters: cell length (L), 2 μm; cell diameter (D), 0.8 μm; outer membrane thickness (O), ∼10 nm; inner membrane thickness (I), 8 nm; periplasm thickness (P), 10 nm; nuclear volume (N), 0.16 × 10–15 L, we first calculated that the cytoplasmic volume (C) for a single E. coli cell at 0.67 × 10–15 L. Calculations were made according to Equation 1 (15Goodsell D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 16Nanninga N.

E. coli K-12 strain carrying no plasmids was used as a negative control. Strains were grown until the A600 of 0.2. One milliliter of each strain was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 and 1 mm EDTA) and 150 μl of each was used for protein separation on a 12% SDS-PAGE; several concentrations of purified APH(3′)-Ia were used as standards (0.6, 1.2, 3.1, 6.2, and 12.5 μg/lane). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned, and the amount of the APH(3′)-Ia was quantified by using the ImageQuant 5.2 program. The quantity of APH(3′)-Ia from E. coli K-12 strains producing APH(3′)-Ia was calculated by subtracting the band corresponding to the small amount of protein of E. coli K-12 strain not harboring any plasmid from that of corresponding location in the gel for APH(3′)-Ia from the same organism harboring plasmid pACYC-APH or pUC-APH. Simultaneously, several dilutions of cultures were made, and cells were plated onto LB (Luria-Bertani) agar plates to count numbers of cells in 150 μl of each culture. Concentration of APH(3′)-Ia in vivo was evaluated by dividing the amount of APH(3′)-Ia in 150 μl of cell culture by both the number of cells in 150 μl and by the cytoplasmic volume of a single E. coli cell. Determination of Doubling Time for E. coli K-12 Harboring the aph(3′)-Ia or the blaTEM-1 Genes—To determine the doubling times (generation times), bacterial cultures were diluted 1:1,000 in LB broth medium and incubated with shaking (180 rpm) at 37 °C. Every 20 min, the absorbance of cells was measured with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer from Varian Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) at 600 nm (A600 = 1; 1 × 109 cells/ml) (17Guihard G. Bénédetti H. Besnard M.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 868-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Doubling times during log phase were determined by Equations 2 and 3, 4www2.uta.edu/vanwaasbergen2/micro/growth.html.logN2=logN1+nlog2(Eq. 2) g=(t2-t1)/n(Eq. 3) where N2 is the number of bacteria at time t2, N1 is the number of bacteria at time t1, n is the number of doublings, and g is the doubling time. Pairwise Competition Experiments—Growth cultures of each strain (E. coli K-12, E. coli JM83, or E. coli DH10B) harboring either the aph(3′)-Ia or the blaTEM-1 genes with the high or low copy plasmids were diluted and mixed to 1:1 ratio to ∼105 cells/ml. Cells were grown with shaking (180 rpm) for 24 h in either LB broth or glucose minimal medium without antibiotics. When E. coli JM83 and E. coli DH10B were grown in the glucose minimal medium, the medium was supplemented with proline or leucine, respectively. The number of cells carrying either the aph(3′)-Ia or the blaTEM-1 genes was counted on LB agar plate containing kanamycin or ampicillin, respectively. Bacterial Growth Curves—Overnight cultures (30 μl) of E. coli strains (E. coli K-12, E. coli JM83, and E. coli DH10B) harboring the aph(3′)-Ia or the blaTEM-1 gene were inoculated separately into 3 ml of LB broth containing kanamycin or ampicillin, respectively. Cells were grown for 2 h at 37 °C and then diluted to reach an A600 of 0.1. Cell cultures were further diluted 1000-fold and were grown with shaking (180 rpm) at 37 °C in the glucose minimal medium without antibiotics. The medium was supplemented with proline and leucine for E. coli JM83 and E. coli DH10B, respectively. The absorbance of the cultures was measured at 600 nm at various time intervals. Plasmid Loss Analysis—Overnight cultures of E. coli K-12 strains harboring the aph(3′)-Ia or the blaTEM-1 genes on the low or high copy plasmids were diluted 1000-fold and grown in LB medium in the absence of antibiotics with agitation (180 rpm) at 37 °C. Every 12 h, the cultures were diluted 100-fold in fresh LB broth. Every 5 days cultures were diluted 105-107-fold and plated on LB agar plates without antibiotics. Then, one hundred colonies from each culture were transferred onto LB agar plates containing kanamycin or ampicillin, and the newly formed colonies that retained plasmids were counted. Another plasmid loss test with E. coli K-12 harboring either plasmid pACYC177 or pACYCD216W was performed as described above. Cultures were plated on LB agar plates not containing antibiotics every 4 days, and the colonies harboring plasmids were selected with ampicillin for both pACYC177 and pACYCD216W. All the experiments for plasmid-loss were performed three times. The work commenced with in vitro investigations with purified APH(3′)-Ia and APH(3′)-IIa, both of which have been purified to homogeneity in our laboratory (20Kim C. Haddad J. Vakulenko S.B. Meroueh S.O. Wu Y. Yan H. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Quench-flow experiments for the evaluation of microscopic rate constants were carried out with [γ-32P]ATP, as described earlier (20Kim C. Haddad J. Vakulenko S.B. Meroueh S.O. Wu Y. Yan H. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results of a representative pre-steady-state experiment for the two activities of APH(3′)-Ia, phosphoryl transfer to kanamycin A and to water, are given in Fig. 2. The reactions consisted of two phases, a burst phase and a steady-state phase in both cases as shown in Fig. 2. The microscopic kinetic values for the type Ia APH(3′) [APH(3′)-Ia] are given in Table 1. Those for the type IIa enzyme [APH(3′)-IIa] are given in Table 2. The values compare the phosphate transfer reactions in the ternary (APH(3′)-Ia·kanamycin A·ATP and APH(3′)-IIa·kanamycin A·ATP) and the binary (APH(3′)-Ia·ATP and APH(3′)-IIa·ATP) complexes. The ATPase activity is seen whether the aminoglycoside is bound to the active site or not. The transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group (k3) to a water molecule by APH(3′)-Ia was 7- and 19-fold slower than that to kanamycin A and neamine, respectively. The data for APH(3′)-IIa are quite similar to those of APH(3′)-Ia. Invariably the slow event appears to be the dissociation of one of the products from the enzymes, probably governed by a conformational change in the structure of the enzyme, and reflected in the slower k4, compared with k3 values.TABLE 1Pre-steady-state kinetic parameters of APH(3′)-IaPhosphate acceptorAPH(3′)-Iak3k-3k4kcats-1s-1s-1s-1KanamycinaAPH·ATP·kanamycin⇌k-3k3APH·ADP·kanamycinphosphate→k4APH+ADP+kanamycinphosphate.28.4 ± 3.633.9 ± 1.14.0 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.1Neamine77.9 ± 3.162.4 ± 4.411.4 ± 0.85.9 ± 0.1H2O (+ kanamycin)4.0 ± 0.120.4 ± 3.20.38 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.01H2O (+ neamine)6.4 ± 0.824.4 ± 4.60.32 ± 0.060.07 ± 0.01H2O without aminoglycosidebAPH·ATP·H2O⇌k-3k3APH·ADP·inorganicphosphate→k4APH+ADP+inorganicphosphate.4.1 ± 0.564.0 ± 7.00.35 ± 0.050.02 ± 0.003a APH·ATP·kanamycin⇌k-3k3APH·ADP·kanamycinphosphate→k4APH+ADP+kanamycinphosphate.b APH·ATP·H2O⇌k-3k3APH·ADP·inorganicphosphate→k4APH+ADP+inorganicphosphate.

Open table in a new tab Because APH(3′)s are expressed in bacteria constitutively, and ATP is ubiquitous, hydrolysis of ATP by these enzymes takes place continuously whether bacteria are exposed to aminoglycoside antibiotics or not. As such, harboring the genes for APH(3′)s should exact a price on bacteria, a factor that we set out to evaluate. We have used both high (pUC19, > 200 copies per cell) and low copy (pACYC177, 10–12 copies per cell) plasmids (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.3-1.6Google Scholar). The plasmids were elaborated to possess the aph(3′)-Ia gene (pUC-APH and pACYC-APH) or the blaTEM-1 gene (for the TEM-1 β-lactamase; a resistance enzyme for β-lactam antibiotics; pUC-TEM and pACYC-TEM) as a control, each under the aph(3′)-Ia promoter sequence. The two genes are essentially the same size (816 bp and 792 bp for the aph(3′)-Ia and blaTEM-1 genes, respectively). The four constructed plasmids were introduced by transformation into the antibiotic susceptible strain E. coli K-12 and into its two laboratory derivatives, E. coli JM83 and E. coli DH10B. The presence of various chromosomal mutations in the two laboratory strains results in their lower growth rates (E. coli DH10B has the lowest rate, as discussed later) in comparison to the parental E. coli K-12 strain. One might expect that the extra burden imposed by production of resistance enzymes (and the attendant ATPase reaction of APH(3′)s) would produce a more profound effect on strains that are already attenuated in their growth rates. The low and high copy plasmids were expected to produce concentrations of APH(3′)-Ia within the range for expression of the enzyme by clinical strains in vivo (22Reisbig M.D. Hossain A. Hanson N.D. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 51: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We determined the in vivo concentrations of APH(3′)-Ia by a slight modification of a known methodology (23Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Bacteria not harboring the plasmid and purified APH(3′)-Ia were used as a negative control and as an external standard, respectively (Fig. 3). Concentrations of APH(3′)-Ia in vivo were evaluated at 50 ± 10 μm and 480 ± 80 μm for the E. coli K-12 strains harboring the low and the high copy plasmids, respectively. These concentrations are not atypical for an important enzyme in bacteria (24Louie T.M. Xie X.S. Xun L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7509-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Seyer K. Lessard M. Piette G. Lacroix M. Saucier L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The doubling times (e.g. generation times) for E. coli K-12 harboring low and high copy plasmids were 29 and 35 min, respectively. Doubling times were the same whether the plasmids contained the aph(3′)-Ia or the blaTEM-1 genes, hence no measurable effect on growth was attributable to the ATPase activity of APH(3′)-Ia. The amounts of ATP hydrolyzed by APH(3′)-Ia in the absence of an aminoglycoside in E. coli harboring pACYC-APH and pUC-APH during a single doubling time were evaluated to be 1.8 ± 0.5 mm and 20.1 ± 3.0 mm, respectively (from concentration of APH(3′)-Ia in vivo× slowest rate constant (kcat) × doubling time). The effect on the ATPase activity is 3-fold or larger in the presence of aminoglycosides (Tables 1 and 2). Like for many other critical metabolites, concentrations of ATP in bacteria have been evaluated at high values of 3–5 mm (26Diez-Gonzalez F. Russell J.B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Goss S.R. Spice A.B. Nichols W.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28Lasko D.R. Wang D.I.C. Biotechnol.

These determinations indicate that the mere adventitious hydrolysis of ATP by the constitutively expressed APH(3′)-Ia has the potential of consuming as much as severalfold of the existing pool of ATP during a single bacterial doubling time. Clearly, bacteria absorb much of this cost in the loss of ATP, largely because of the ability of ATP to be regenerated by the metabolic process. However, we assumed that the cost could not be inconsequential. The effect of the ATP hydrolase activity of APH(3′)-Ia on the bacterial growth was determined with all strains harboring low (pACYC-APH or pACYC-TEM) and high copy plasmids (pUC-APH or pUC-TEM) in the glucose minimal medium not containing an aminoglycoside (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, we could not see any significant differences in growth between the strains harboring the aph(3′)-Ia and blaTEM-1 genes, the latter of which serving as a control. The naïve strain harboring the high copy plasmids, regardless of which resistance gene, grew slower than those harboring the low copy plasmids. This would be expected, since replication of the extra genetic materials and synthesis of larger amounts of the resistance enzyme are called for in the case of the high copy plasmid. Subsequently, the potential cost of the ATPase activity of APH(3′)-Ia was measured by pairwise competition experiments. Mixtures (1:1) of strains carrying aph(3′)-Ia gene and blaTEM-1 gene were incubated for 24 h in both LB broth and the glucose minimal medium, followed by selective plating on kanamycin- and ampicillin-containing agar for counting of the cells. There was no significant difference (Table 3).TABLE 3Pairwise competition in growthE. coli strainsRatio of strains harboring the aph(3′)-Ia gene to those with the blaTEM-1 gene0 h24 h (LB)24 h (minimal medium)K-12 (high copy plasmid)1.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1K-12 (low copy plasmid)1.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1JM83 (high copy plasmid)1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1JM83 (low copy plasmid)1.0 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1DH10B (high copy plasmid)0.9 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1DH10B (low copy plasmid)1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab We wondered whether in light of the ATPase activity there might be a selection pressure for the loss of the plasmid that harbors the aph(3′)-Ia gene. An analysis for the loss of plasmid (14Smith M.A. Bidochka M.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Becker E.C. Meyer R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5947-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed. Each strain harboring the aph(3′)-Ia or blaTEM-1 genes was grown in LB medium in the absence of antibiotics with continuous subculture. The dilutions of cultures were spread on LB agar plates not containing antibiotics every 5 days. Then, one hundred colonies of each strain were transferred to LB agar plates containing kanamycin and ampicillin, respectively. We could not estimate the effect of ATPase activity of APH(3′)-Ia on the plasmid maintenance with E. coli K-12 strains harboring pUC-APH and pUC-TEM, because both strains completely lost their plasmids within 100 generations of growth, indicative of the high cost of high copy plasmid maintenance. Significantly, E. coli K-12 strain harboring the low copy pACYC-APH lost its plasmid more rapidly than that containing pACYC-TEM. The former lost ∼50% of the plasmids in 1500 generations in contrast to 10% loss from the latter strain (Table 4). It is important to restate that plasmids and promoters are identical in both cases and the only difference is the nature of the resistance genes, which are of the same size.TABLE 4Loss of plasmids during serial culture of bacteriaStrains% Plasmid loss after indicated no. of generation0250500750100012501500E. coli K-12 (pACYC-APH)003 ± 112 ± 220 ± 238 ± 448 ± 4E. coli K-12 (pACYC-TEM)00006 ± 18 ± 210 ± 2 Open table in a new tab As yet another control, we attempted the same experiments with a mutant variant of APH(3′)-Ia. We chose to introduce a tryptophan within the active site (D216W) of the enzyme near the ATP-binding site, based on the x-ray structure. At saturating concentration of ATP, the activity of the enzyme was reduced to 30% of the wild type. The plasmid pACYCD216W was expelled from the host more slowly (47% loss in 1500 generations) than the wild-type plasmid pACYC177 (71% loss in as many generations), as shown in Table 5. The bacterium lost pACYC177 more rapidly than pACYC-APH because the former is larger (Fig. 5). Attenuation of the ATPase activity of the D216W mutant enzyme resulted in reduction of the rate of the loss of the plasmid. The difference in 1500 generations is 4.8-fold (ratio of 48%/10%, Table 4) preference for the loss of the plasmid when the wild-type APH(3′)-Ia was being compared with the TEM-1 β-lactamase (a protein of the same size without the ATPase activity as a control) versus 1.5-fold (ratio of 71%/47%, Table 5) preference for the loss between the wild-type APH(3′)-Ia and the D216W mutant enzyme. Whereas the results from enzymologic determination of activity in vitro do not necessarily have to translate exactly to effects in experiments with whole bacteria, our findings here do. An attenuation of enzymologic ATPase activity for the D216W mutant APH(3′)-Ia to 30% parallels closely a proportional effect (from 4.8-fold to 1.5-fold) on the propensity of the corresponding plasmids that were lost from the bacteria that harbor them.TABLE 5Loss of plasmids expressing wild-type and mutant APH(3′)-IaStrains% Plasmid loss after indicated no. of generation02004006008001000120014001500E. coli K-12 (pACYC177)01 ± 13 ± 18 ± 222 ± 232 ± 347 ± 164 ± 171 ± 2E. coli K-12 (pACYCD216W)01 ± 11 ± 17 ± 115 ± 225 ± 231 ± 341 ± 147 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Our kinetics of hydrolysis of ATP by the constitutively expressed APH(3′)s suggests a consequence to the bacteria that harbor this resistance enzyme. However, measurements of the rate of growth of bacteria expressing these proteins did not reveal any difference, indicative of the fact that bacteria tolerate this metabolic demand in the short run. However, there would appear to be a selective pressure for the loss of the plasmid that bears the aph(3′)-Ia gene over a number of generations in the absence of an aminoglycoside, a selection pressure that is 5-fold greater than what is measured for the organism that harbors the gene for the β-lactamase in the absence of a β-lactam antibiotic. As phosphorylation is a common mechanism for antibiotic resistance (1Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Mobashery S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 27-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Wright G.D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. Clin.

Rev. 2005; 105: 477-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), there might be generality of our observations to other resistant bacteria dependent on plasmid-borne, ATP-consuming resistance enzymes. The larger implication is that, in the absence of selection, bacteria harboring an enzyme that catalyzes the consumption of key metabolites (ATP in our case) could experience the loss of the plasmid that encodes for the given enzyme. As a final note we would like to acknowledge that our studies do not rule out the possibility that the fitness effect could also have to do with the longevity of the RNA or slightly altered rates of replication of the pACYC-APH plasmid. If one of these were the case, the bacteria have learned to cope with this significantly wasteful and adventitious reaction very well. Our observations suggest that periodic removal of aminoglycosides from hospital formularies may mitigate the dissemination of these resistance enzymes among pathogens. Such policies on rotation of antibiotics in hospital formularies are in place in a few countries presently and perhaps should be more widely practiced."
https://openalex.org/W2030748573,"The rat placental glutathione S-transferase (GST-P), an isozyme of glutathione S-transferase, is not expressed in normal liver but is highly induced at an early stage of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and in hepatomas. Recently, we reported that the NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/MafK heterodimer binds to GST-P enhancer 1 (GPE1), a strong enhancer of the GST-P gene, and activates this gene in preneoplastic lesions and hepatomas. In addition to the positive regulation during hepatocarcinogenesis, negative regulatory mechanisms might work to repress GST-P in normal liver, but this remains to be clarified. In this work, we identify the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) as a negative regulator that binds to GPE1 and suppresses GST-P expression in normal liver. C/EBPα binds to part of the GPE1 sequence, and the binding of Nrf2/MafK and C/EBPα to GPE1 is mutually exclusive. In a transient-transfection analysis, C/EBPα activated GPE1 in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells but strongly inhibited GPE1 activity in hepatoma cells. The expression of C/EBPα was specifically suppressed in GST-P-positive preneoplastic foci in the livers of carcinogentreated rats. A chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that C/EBPα bound to GPE1 in the normal liver in vivo but did not bind in preneoplastic hepatocytes. Introduction of the C/EBPα gene fused with the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain into hepatoma cells, and subsequent activation by β-estradiol led to the suppression of endogenous GST-P expression. These results indicate that C/EBPα is a negative regulator of GST-P gene expression in normal liver.

The placental form of glutathione S-transferase (GST-P) 2The abbreviations used are: GST-P, placental (Pi class) glutathione S-transferase of the rat; GPE1, GST-P enhancer 1; Nrf2, NF-E2 p45-related factor 2; C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.2The abbreviations used are: GST-P, placental (Pi class) glutathione S-transferase of the rat; GPE1, GST-P enhancer 1; Nrf2, NF-E2 p45-related factor 2; C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. is one of a group of enzymes that catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to xenobiotics (1Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). GST-P belongs to the Pi class of GST and is weakly expressed in rat tissues, including lung, kidney, spleen, and placenta. GST-P is not detected in normal liver, but it is markedly and specifically increased during early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. It can be detected in single liver cells as early as 2-3 days after the administration of a chemical carcinogen (2Farber E. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Kitahara A. Satoh K. Nishimura K. Ishikawa T. Ruike K. Sato K. Tsuda H. Ito N.

Therefore, this enzyme has been used as a reliable tumor marker for both chemically induced and spontaneously arising precancerous lesions and hepatomas in experimental carcinogenesis studies. The induction of GST-P occurs primarily at the transcriptional level (8Sugioka Y. Kano T. Okuda A. Sakai M. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6049-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and we have been studying the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the specific activation of the GST-P gene (9Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Okuda A. Imagawa M. Maeda Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol.

Okuda A. Nishi S. Muramatsu M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 344: 123-138PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-P gene has a strong enhancer element, GPE1, 2.5-kb upstream from the cap site (9Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Okuda A. Imagawa M. Maeda Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol.

This enhancer is a major control element for the expression of GST-P in preneoplastic lesions and hepatomas. Muramatsu and co-workers (13Morimura S. Suzuki T. Hochi S. Yuki A. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Nagatsu I. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2065-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Hirabayashi M. Yuki A. Hisatake K. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2651-2655PubMed Google Scholar) established a GPE1-transgenic rat line and showed that GPE1 is essential and nearly sufficient for the expression of GST-P during hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. GPE1 consists of two phorbol-12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate-responsive element (TGAGTCA)-like elements with palindromic orientations (5′-TAGTCAGTCACTATGATTCAGCAA-3′; the phorbol-12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate-responsive element-like sequences are underlined) (9Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and MafK heterodimer interact with GPE1 and activate the GST-P gene early in hepatocarcinogenesis and in rat hepatomas (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the expression of Nrf2 increases moderately during carcinogenesis, Nrf2 is also expressed at considerable levels in the normal liver, in which GST-P is completely repressed. Therefore, there may be other mechanisms that suppress GST-P expression in normal liver. Circumstantial evidence suggests that GPE1 suppresses GST-P expression in the normal liver, in addition to acting as a positive enhancer in preneoplastic lesions and hepatomas. First, the transgenic rat studies by Muramatsu and co-workers (13Morimura S. Suzuki T. Hochi S. Yuki A. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Nagatsu I. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2065-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Hirabayashi M. Yuki A. Hisatake K. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2651-2655PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the rats expressed the GPE1 transgene when they were treated with a carcinogen. In the normal liver, however, none of the GPE1 transgenic rats expressed the transgene. Second, the mouse Pi class GST gene (a homologue of rat GST-P), which does not contain GPE1 or any related element in the regulatory region, is expressed in normal liver (16Bammler T.K. Smith C.A. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Xu X. Stambrook P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30268-30273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although hepatocarcinogenesis does increase the expression of the mouse Pi class GST, the induction is much lower than that of rat GST-P (18Hatayama I. Nishimura S. Narita T. Sato K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 537-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These circumstances suggest that GPE1 may repress GST-P in the normal liver.In this study, we have conducted a computer-mediated search for transcription factors that might interact with the flanking region of the GST-P gene and found that the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) could potentially bind to the GPE1 sequence. The C/EBP family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors is comprised of six members, α to ζ. The various isoforms show different patterns of expression, and they regulate a wide variety of essential differentiation programs, cellular proliferation, and numerous cellular processes (19Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In the liver, C/EBPα is highly expressed and maintains liver quiescence (20Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 21Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2001; 8: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Livers of newborn C/EBPα knock-out mice have an increased rate of proliferation (21Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPα gene expression is very low or completely repressed in preneoplastic nodules and hepatomas (23Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 24Osada S. Takano K. Nishihara T. Suzuki T. Muramatsu M. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31288-31293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of C/EBPα is negatively correlated with that of GST-P.To clarify the possible suppressive effect of C/EBPα on the transcription of the GST-P gene in normal liver, we have analyzed the interaction of this factor with GPE1 in vitro and in vivo and used transient-transfection analysis of hepatoma and F9 cells to examine the effect of C/EBPα on GPE1. We also have analyzed endogenous GST-P expression in C/EBPα overexpressing hepatoma cells. From these analyses, we conclude that C/EBPα suppresses the expression of GST-P in the normal liver.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—To construct the luciferase reporter genes, the -2.9-kb/+37-bp fragment relative to the cap site of the rat GST-P gene (GST/ELuc) or the -50/+37-bp fragment, the minimal promoter region containing the GC and TATA boxes (Δ50Luc) (9Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was inserted into a promoter-less luciferase plasmid vector, pGVB2 (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). The constructs containing internal deletions or synthetic oligonucleotide elements were made by inserting the following sequences into Δ50Luc: a 0.3-kb SacI-AccI fragment (-2.5/-2.2-kb) containing GPE1 (SA/Δ50Luc), GPE1 (5′-GTAGTCAGTCACTATGATTCAGCAACA-3′, GPE1/Δ50Luc), or mutated forms of GPE1 (M11/Δ50Luc: 5′-GTAGTCAGTCACTATGAaTCAGCAtCA-3′; M12/Δ50Luc: 5′-GTAGTCAGTCACTATGAgTCAGCAACA-3′; and M13/Δ50Luc: 5′-GTAGTCAGTCACTATGAcTCAGCAACA-3′; with the mutated positions indicated by lowercase letters). Three copies of the C/EBP-binding consensus sequence (C/EBP-RE) from the mouse transthyretin gene enhancer (5′-TTTTCCATCTTACTCAACATCCTA-3′) were joined in tandem and cloned into Δ50Luc (C/EBP-RE/Δ50Luc) (25Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Xanthopoulos K.G. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3840-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Takiguchi (University of Chiba). The Nrf2 expression vector was described previously (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Reporter Transfection Analysis, and Retroviral Transduction—H4IIE and RL34 rat hepatoma and F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Nissui, Tokyo) with 8% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For transfection analysis, the cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells (H4IIE and RL34) or 2 × 105 cells (F9)/60-mm plate. A total of 4 μg of DNA was transfected into the cells, including 1 μg of the reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pSVβgal; Promega, Madison WI) with or without an effector-gene expression plasmid (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or Nrf2) and pUC18 DNA, according to the procedure of Chen and Okayama (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 45 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Nippon Gene) and for β-galactosidase activity (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis Y. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities. All of the experiments were performed at least twice.The retroviral construct of C/EBPα fused with the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (pBabePuro-C/EBPα-ER) (23Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 28Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Alan D. Friedman (Johns Hopkins University). The BOSC23 packaging cells (29Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected with pBabePuro-C/EBPα-ER by the calcium phosphate method. The supernatant was collected after 40 h and infected into RL34 hepatoma cells with 4 μg/ml polybrene. Stable transformants were cloned after 2 weeks of selection with 3 μg/ml puromycin. C/EBPα-ER-expressing cells and parent RL34 cells were cultured in phenol red-free minimal essential medium (Nissui, Tokyo) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. C/EBPα-ER was activated by the addition of β-estradiol (1 μm; Sigma) and harvested after 48 h for RNA and protein analyses.Animals and Chemical Hepatocarcinogenesis—Rats with hyperplastic nodules induced by the Solt-Farber protocol (30Solt D. Faber E. Nature. 1976; 263: 701-703Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 31Satoh K. Hatayama I. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Satoh (Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan). All of the animal experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of Hokkaido University.EMSA and DNase I Footprinting Analysis—The cDNA fragment encoding the DNA-binding domain of each transcription factor (amino acids 318-598 for Nrf2, 1-156 for MafK, and 282-396 for C/EBPα) was fused to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene of the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs). These fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli cells and purified as previously described (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To prepare probes for the EMSA, synthetic double-stranded DNA elements were cloned into a pBluescript II vector (Stratagene) and fragmented with BamHI (GPE1) or BamHI and SalI (C/EBP-RE, mutant GPE1). The overhanging ends were labeled with Klenow DNA polymerase I (Takara, Kyoto) and [α-32P]dCTP. A fragment of the multiple cloning site of the pBluescript II vector (HindIII-XbaI) was labeled as a negative control probe. EMSA was performed as described previously (32Sakai M. Serria M.S. Ikeda H. Yoshida K. Imaki J. Nishi S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1228-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The recombinant MBP-fused proteins were preincubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min in 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. A 32P-labeled DNA probe (2 × 104 cpm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 10 min. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 25 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.2.Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in 5 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), incubated on ice for 10 min, and briefly centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of buffer A with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), homogenized, and centrifuged. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 1 volume of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and gently stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) for 5 h. The nuclear extracts (10 μg/reaction) were incubated with the indicated antibody at 15 °C for 30 min prior to EMSA using the same procedures as for recombinant proteins, except that 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) was used.For the DNase I footprinting analysis, the probe (2 × 105 cpm) was incubated with bovine serum albumin or recombinant protein (0.1 μg) in 50 μl of EMSA binding buffer. Fifty μl of DNase I buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm KCl, and 4 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA) and 20 ng of DNase I (Takara) were mixed and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.2 m NaCl). DNA was extracted and separated in a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Guanine and adenine bases of the same probes were modified, digested by the Maxam-Gilbert method, and loaded as a marker ladder.RNA and Protein Analyses—Total cellular RNAs were isolated from rat tissues and cultured cells using an RNA extraction kit (Isogen, Nippon Gene). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (34Sakai M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5370-5376PubMed Google Scholar). The fragments of the C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and GST-P cDNAs were labeled with a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Takara) using [α-32P]dCTP and used as probes. RNase protection analysis was performed as described previously (34Sakai M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5370-5376PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA fragment of the GST-P gene (-109 to +56-bp, relative to the cap site) was subcloned into pBluescript II and antisense RNA was synthesized by T7-RNA polymerase with [α-32P]UTP for the probe.For Western blot analysis, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF). The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with anti-C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-GST-P antibody (kindly provided from Dr. K. Satoh, Hirosaki University). After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and the immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities in the autoradiograms of Northern and Western blotting were estimated by NIH Image.Immunohistochemistry—Eight weeks after the Solt-Farber protocol was started, the rats were fixed by an intracardiac perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The liver tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3 μm, and sections were processed for immunofluorescence staining. The slides were incubated with normal goat serum and then with the anti-GST-P or anti-C/EBPα antibody. Binding of the primary antibody was localized using a Cy-3-conjugated (GST-P) or FITC-conjugated (C/EBPα) goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution, 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The slides were examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad; and LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was carried out as described previously (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Harvested cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with an ultrasonic generator (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% protein A slurry (Amersham Biosciences) containing 20 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The precleared chromatin fraction was incubated with anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Nrf2 (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or anti-MafK (kindly provided by Dr. K. Igarashi, Hiroshima University) antibody or preimmune serum for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were mixed with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and washed sequentially with wash buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing 150 mm NaCl, wash buffer 1 containing 500 mm NaCl, wash buffer 2 (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA. The complexes were eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and cross-linking was reversed by heating to 65 °C for 4 h. The DNAs were purified, and the GPE1 region of the GST-P gene was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-TGATTCTGCCATCTTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTTCTCTGGACAAACC-3′. Amplified DNAs were analyzed using 3% agarose gel electrophoresis.RESULTSC/EBPα Suppresses GPE1 Enhancer Activity—We found that the 3′-half of GPE1 (5′-TAGTCAGTCACTATGATTCAGCAAC-3′, the C/EBP-binding consensus sequence is underlined) almost completely matches the consensus binding sequence of C/EBP (5′-RTTGCGYAAY-3′) (36Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Further, C/EBPα is markedly down-regulated in preneoplastic foci of the liver, in which the GST-P gene is strongly induced (24Osada S. Takano K. Nishihara T. Suzuki T. Muramatsu M. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31288-31293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used transient-transfection analysis to examine whether C/EBP influences GST-P expression. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the -2.9-kb/+37-bp region of the GST-P gene (GST/ELuc), and the GPE1 enhancer region (-2.5/-2.2-kb, SA/Δ50Luc) were transfected into cells of the H4IIE rat hepatoma line, with or without a C/EBPα or C/EBPβ expression vector. Fig. 1A shows that both GST/ELuc and SA/Δ50Luc were highly expressed in H4IIE cells but that the expression of both constructs was strongly inhibited by co-transfection with C/EBPα. C/EBPβ also inhibited transcriptional activity, but to a lesser extent than C/EBPα. C/EBP-RE/Δ50Luc, which contained three tandem C/EBP binding consensus sequences from the transthyretin gene, was activated by both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ.Previously, we reported that Nrf2/MafK binds to GPE1 and activates GST-P expression during hepatocarcinogenesis. To determine whether C/EBP inhibits the ability of Nrf2/MafK to activate GPE1, we performed a transient-transfection analysis. The GPE1 core element was fused to a luciferase gene with the minimal promoter sequence of the rat GST-P gene (GPE1/Δ50Luc) and transfected into H4IIE cells, with or without co-transfection with the Nrf2, C/EBPα, or C/EBPβ expression vectors (Fig. 1B). In hepatoma cells, Nrf2 stimulated GPE1/Δ50Luc gene expression ∼10-fold, as described previously (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and C/EBPα dramatically down-regulated GPE1 activity. C/EBPβ also suppressed GPE1, but by approximately only one-fifth as much as C/EBPα. The expression of Δ50Luc, which contained only the minimal promoter, did not significantly change with co-transfection by the effector plasmids.To address why GPE1 was suppressed by C/EBP, we performed a reporter transfection analysis using mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, which do not contain any GPE1-stimulating activity (15Ikeda H. Nishi S. Sakai M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results with hepatoma cells, in F9 cells, C/EBPα stimulated GPE1/Δ50Luc by ∼10-20-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). However, the stimulation of GPE1/Δ50Luc by Nrf2 was much higher (∼300-fold) than that by C/EBPα. The activation of Nrf2 was strongly inhibited by the co-transfection of C/EBPα. These results suggest that C/EBPα interacts with GPE1 and inhibits the binding of the strong positive factor, Nrf2/MafK, in hepatoma cells. C/EBP-RE/Δ50Luc was greatly stimulated by C/EBPα in F9 cells and was not affected by Nrf2.C/EBPα Binds to GPE1—The nucleotide sequence of GPE1 and the results of the reporter transfection analysis described above suggest that C/EBPα binds directly to GPE1. To test whether GPE1 and C/EBPα interact directly, we performed EMSA using recombinant C/EBPα proteins expressed in E. coli and a GPE1 probe. The multiple cloning site of the pBluescript II vector and the C/EBP-binding consensus sequence (C/EBP-RE) were used as negative and positive control probes, respectively. C/EBPα bound strongly to GPE1 (Fig. 2A, lane 8). The probe with a single C/EBP-RE sequence yielded one shifted band, and the probe with two C/EBP-RE sequences yielded double bands, as expected (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). The binding specificity was confirmed by a competition analysis with an excess amount of unlabeled GPE1 probe (Fig. 2A, lanes 11-13).FIGURE 2C/EBPα binds to GPE1. A, EMSA of C/EBPα and GPE1. Approximately 50 ng of the C/EBPα-MBP fusion protein was incubated with labeled probe (2 × 104 cpm). The probes were the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II vector (MCS), single or double C/EBP binding consensus sequences of the transthyretin gene (C/EBP-RE 1×, 2×), or the GPE1 core sequence (GPE1). In the competition analysis, increasing amounts (10×, 20×, and 50× for lanes 11-13, respectively) of unlabeled GPE1 core sequence were added to the binding mixtures. B, DNase I footprinting analysis of Nrf2/MafK and C/EBPα with the GPE1 probe. The indicated proteins (bovine serum albumin, Nrf2/MafK or C/EBPα fusion proteins) were incubated with the GPE1 probe and treated with DNase I, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Guanine and adenine residues were modified and digested by the Maxam-Gilbert method (M). The vertical lines and dotted lines indicate the region protected by Nrf2/MafK and C/EBPα, respectively. C, the binding of Nrf2/MafK and C/EBPα to GPE1 is mutually exclusive. EMSAs were carried out with a fixed amount of C/EBPα (10 ng) and increasing amounts of Nrf2/MafK (0-50 ng, lanes 1-5) and a fixed amount of Nrf2/MafK"

PKGs are dimeric; each monomer contains a regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) domain. In this study, isolated recombinant R domains of PKGIα-(Δ349–670) and PKGIβ-(Δ364–685) containing the dimerization and autoinhibitory subdomains and two allosteric cGMP-binding sites were expressed in Sf9 cells. Both R domains were dimers with elongated conformations (Stokes radii of 44 and 51 Å, respectively, and frictional coefficients of 1.6 and 1.8, respectively). Exchange dissociation kinetics and KD values for cGMP were similar for each holoenzyme and its isolated R domain, indicating that under these conditions the C domain does not appreciably alter cGMP-binding functions of the R domain. As determined by gel filtration chromatography, cGMP binding caused elongation of the PKGIα-isolated R domain and contraction of the PKGIβ-isolated R domain. Cyclic GMP-bound forms of the isoforms have similar physical dimensions that may reflect a common conformation of active isoforms.

Cyclic GMP-mediated activation of PKGs in response to nitric oxide, natriuretic peptides, or guanylins is integrally involved in myriad physiological processes, including modulation of vascular smooth muscle tone, water, and electrolyte homeostasis, platelet aggregation, airway smooth muscle tone, smooth muscle proliferation, and bone formation. Despite the central role of these enzymes in both physiological and pathophysiological processes such as erectile dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, or systemic hypertension, little is known about the molecular mechanism whereby these kinases are activated. PKGs are chimeric proteins composed of regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) domains (9Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The C domain, located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the polypeptide, contains an ATP-binding subdomain and a protein substrate-binding subdomain. The C domain is the most highly conserved region among the PKGs and catalyzes transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to specific serines or threonines in consensus sequences in protein substrates. The R domain, located in the amino-terminal segment of PKG, also contains a number of critical functional subdomains; the amino-terminal 100 AA, which have only 35% identity in PKGIα and PKGIβ, include a dimerization subdomain, autoinhibitory subdomain, and autophosphorylation sites. The remainder of the R domain sequence, which is identical in PKGIα and PKGIβ, contains the two allosteric cGMP-binding sites A and B (Fig. 1A). Despite identical AA sequences of the cGMP-binding sites and the C domains in PKGIα and PKGIβ, the isoforms differ substantially in cyclic nucleotide analog specificities, KD for cGMP binding, and Ka for cGMP activation of catalytic activity (9Takio K.

This indicates that elements in the amino-terminal ∼100 AA (Fig. 1A) allosterically affect functions of the cGMP-binding sites and activation of kinase activity, but the molecular basis of this is not understood (6Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Dimerization of PKGs in higher eukaryotes occurs in large part through a conserved leucine zipper motif near the amino terminus (14Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Richie-Jannetta R. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50070-50079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the autoinhibitory subdomain and autophosphorylation sites are located just carboxyl-terminal to this motif (Fig. 1A). The two allosteric cGMP-binding sites are homologous to each other and are arranged in tandem immediately amino-terminal to the C domain; this comprises the cGMP-binding subdomain. Regions outside the cGMP-binding sites in both PKGIα and PKGIβ modulate affinity of the enzymes for cGMP; Mg2+/ATP increases the dissociation rate of cGMP from site B of PKGIα by 10-fold, thereby weakening cGMP binding (11Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kotera J. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Biochem.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3534-3540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the amino-terminal 100 AA alter cGMP affinity and cyclic nucleotide specificity of sites with identical primary AA sequence. Most of this influence on the cGMP-binding properties of PKGs has been presumed to involve interaction of the autoinhibitory domain with the C domain, but there is no clear documentation of this. In addition, the Mg2+/ATP effect observed in PKGIα is largely lacking in PKGIβ (16Kotera J. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Understanding the functional properties of the R and C domains is required in order to define the molecular mechanism by which cGMP binding brings about activation of PKG. We have previously used a number of approaches in an effort to better understand the molecular events associated with activation of PKG kinase activity. Cyclic GMP binding to PKGIα or PKGIβ induces a molecular elongation that is associated with activation of catalytic activity and increased surface electronegativity (18Chu D.M. Corbin J.D.

Macdonald B.A. Gibson R.R. Trewhella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2380-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the conformational change associated with activation of each isozyme is unknown. The Stokes radii of the cGMP-bound and cGMP-free forms of PKGIα and PKGIβ differ by ∼3–4 Å as measured by gel filtration chromatography (18Chu D.M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering studies have shown that cGMP binding to dimeric PKGIα increases its radius of gyration (Rg) and maximum linear dimension (dmax) 25–30%, indicating that upon cGMP binding the average protein mass moves farther from the center of mass, resulting in a more asymmetric structure (19Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP also induces increased elongation and asymmetry in a monomeric cGMP-dependent PKG mutant, PKGIβ-(Δ1–52), that retains the salient biochemical features of wild type (WT) PKG (20Wall M.E. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Grimes K. Richie-Jannetta R. Kotera J. Macdonald B.A. Gibson R.R. Trewhella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2380-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the magnitude of this change can fully account for the elongation observed in dimeric PKG. These results demonstrate that elongation of type I PKGs correlates with activation and is independent of dimerization. However, the molecular basis for the elongation is not understood and could be the result of structural changes initiated by the R domain, C domain, or both. The novel amino-terminal AA sequences of PKGIα and PKGIβ provide for different cGMP-binding characteristics. Whether this is because of contacts between the respective amino termini and C domain or between the amino termini and elements within the R domain itself has not been experimentally tested. Understanding the role of the respective functional domains in the activation process is key to dissecting the activation mechanism of PKG and interpreting results of biophysical studies of this process. We document the following for the first time: (a) dimerization of PKG R domains occurs in the absence of contributions from the C domain; (b) counter to currently held beliefs, determinants of differences in cGMP binding affinities of PKGIα and PKGIβ reside exclusively within the R domain; and (c) cGMP binding induces isoform-specific conformational changes in the isolated R domains that can be related to the mechanism for activation of kinase catalytic activity. Mutagenesis of PKGIα and PKGIβ to Produce the Isolated Regulatory Domains—PKGIβ cDNA encodes full-length human PKGIβ. A stop codon was introduced after AA 364 of PKGIβ to create the isolated R domain. PKGIβ cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI unique sites of the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392. Oligonucleotides (Operon, Inc.) with the following sequences were used to construct the deletion mutant. The underlined nucleotides incorporate a 3′ stop codon and a 3′ BamHI site. For deletion mutagenesis of PKGIβ-(Δ364–685), the coding strand oligonucleotide was 5′-GCCATGTGACCCT-3′ and the noncoding strand oligonucleotide was 5′-GCCGGGATCCTTACGCTTCAGCTTCATATTT-3′. This region was amplified by PCR for 35 cycles with the melting, annealing, and elongating temperatures of 95, 50, and 72 °C, respectively. The 800-bp PCR product was digested with BamHI and Tth111I (New England Biolabs), purified, and cloned into BamHI/Tth111I-digested wild type PKGIβ clone in the pVL1392 baculovirus expression vector. Because PKGIα and PKGIβ differ only in their amino termini, PKGIα-(Δ349–670) was produced by digesting PKGIβ-(Δ364–685) in pVL1392 with NcoI/BamHI and subcloning the small digestion product into NcoI/BamHI-digested wild type PKGIα cDNA in the pVL1392 baculovirus expression vector. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for transformations with pVL1392. DNA fragments were purified using a Clontech gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). DNA was purified from large scale vector preparations using a BD Biosciences Plasmid Midi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. All DNA segments subjected to mutagenesis and subcloning reactions were sequenced in their entirety to ensure the presence of the desired mutation and proper in-frame subcloning. Plasmids were sequenced on a 373A DNA sequencer (Automated Biosystems, Inc.) at the Vanderbilt University Cancer Center DNA Core. Expression and Purification of WT and Mutant PKGI R Domain Constructs—Sf9 cells (Pharmingen) were cotransfected with BaculoGold linear baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) and either WT PKGIα, WT PKGIβ or one of the mutated PKGIα or PKGIβ clones in the pVL1392 baculovirus expression vector by the calcium phosphate method according to the protocol from Pharmingen. At 5 days post-infection, the cotransfection supernatant was collected, amplified three times in Sf9 cells, and then used directly as viral stock for expression without additional purification of recombinant viruses. Sf9 cells grown at 27 °C in complete Grace's insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma) in T-175 flasks (Corning) were typically infected with 10–100 μl of viral stock/flask. The optimum volume of viral stock used per T-175 flask was experimentally determined. The Sf9 cell pellet was harvested at 72–96 h post-infection. The Sf9 cell pellet for each T-175 flask (∼2 × 107 cells) was resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol (KPEM) containing the concentration of protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell suspension was homogenized in 10- to 20-ml aliquots two times with 4-s bursts in an Ultra Turrex microhomogenizer with a 20-s recovery between bursts. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto an 8-aminohexylamino-cAMP-Sepharose (Sigma) column (1 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated with KPEM. The supernatant volume varied depending on number of T-175 flasks infected. The column was washed with 5 ml of KPEM containing protease inhibitors followed by 10 ml of 0.5 m NaCl in KPEM with protease inhibitors. 10 mm cAMP in KPEM containing 1 m NaCl and protease inhibitors was added to the column and allowed to soak into the cAMP-Sepharose. The column was stopped for 20 min at 4 °C, after which five 0.3-ml elutions were collected. The column was again incubated for 20 min at 4 °C, and an additional five 0.3-ml fractions were collected. Elutions containing significant protein as measured by the Bradford method were pooled and concentrated on Centricon-30 (Amicon). The concentrated sample was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column (0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated in KPEM, 0.15 m NaCl with protease inhibitors, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. This step removed the free cAMP from the affinity column elution. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C; enzyme was flash-frozen in KPEM containing 0.3 m NaCl and 10% sucrose and stored at –70 °C until use. Two preparations of the isolated R domains of PKGIα and PKGIβ were expressed, purified, and used in the experiments. [3H]cGMP Binding—To further reduce cAMP that might be contained in the protein samples following the gel filtration step of the purification procedure, WT PKGs and R domains of each (3–6 μm) were diluted 500× with KPEM, 0.15 m NaCl containing protease inhibitors and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Even if the PKG proteins were still saturated with cAMP after gel filtration, this dilution would reduce cAMP concentration to ∼1.2–2.5 nm, which is well below the KD values of 6 and 10 μm for intact PKGIα and PKGIβ, respectively (6Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To saturate the PKGs with cGMP, 50-μl aliquots of the diluted PKG constructs were incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature with 50 μl of [3H]cGMP and 150 μl of cGMP-binding assay mixture (25 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, 2 m NaCl, 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and 0.5 mg/ml histone IIAS (Sigma)). The final cGMP concentration varied from 0 to 7 μm for PKGIβ and 0 to 3 μm for PKGIα, and the final concentration of enzyme (monomer) was ∼2 nm. After incubation, 2 ml of cold aqueous saturated (NH4)2SO4 was added to each sample. Samples were filtered onto 0.45-μm pore nitrocellulose paper (Millipore) that had been premoistened with saturated (NH4)2SO4 and rinsed three times with 2 ml of cold saturated (NH4)2SO4. Papers were dried and shaken in vials containing 1.5 ml 2% SDS. Aqueous scintillant (10 ml) was added, and the vials were shaken again and then counted in a liquid scintillation counter. KD value was determined by GraphPad Prism graphics. [3H]cGMP Dissociation—WT PKGIα and PKGIβ and their respective isolated R domains (0.20–0.40 mg/ml initial concentration) were diluted 200× with KPEM, 0.15 m NaCl containing protease inhibitors and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 1 ml of diluted PKG was incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature with 3 ml of cGMP-binding assay mixture 100 μ and l of [3H]cGMP for a final concentration of 2.9 μm [H]cGMP. This incubation time was experimentally determined to be adequate for saturation of the cGMP-binding sites in these proteins. After incubation, samples were cooled to 4 °C and divided into 200-μl aliquots per tube. Addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled cGMP at time 0 (Bo) initiated the dissociation (exchange) of bound [3H]cGMP. The cGMP exchange in each tube was stopped at the appropriate time point by addition of 2 ml of cold aqueous saturated ammonium sulfate. Samples were filtered and washed as described previously for cGMP binding. The portion of [3H]cGMP bound at any time point was determined by the method of Rannels and Corbin (21Rannels S.R. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography and Determination of Stokes Radius—Each of the respective purified PKG proteins (∼10 μg) was combined with two internal standards, crystalline catalase (3 mg) and ovalbumin (4 mg), in a volume of 200 μl and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (0.9 × 35 cm) equilibrated in KPEM, 0.15 m NaCl with protease inhibitors at 4 °C. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for [3H]cGMP-binding activity to determine the elution position of PKG proteins. Catalase was located by absorbance at 280 and/or 400 nm, and ovalbumin was located by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was standardized with proteins of known Stokes radii as follows: cytochrome c (16.6 Å), ovalbumin (29 Å), bovine serum albumin (35 Å), and catalase (52 Å). The thyroglobulin elution volume was taken as the void volume, and the elution position of [3H]H2O was taken as the inclusion volume. Elution positions of the protein standards were used to generate a standard curve of (–log Kav)½ versus Stokes radius where Kav was determined as shown in Equation 1,Kav=elutionvolume-voidvolumeinclusionvolume-voidvolume(Eq. 1) The Stokes radii of PKG proteins were determined from the standard curve based on elution volumes. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation and Determination of Sedimentation Coefficient—Purified PKG (∼10 μg) was combined with two internal standards, crystalline phosphorylase b (3 mg), and hemoglobin (0.5 mg), in a volume of 200 μl in KPEM containing 0.15 m NaCl with protease inhibitor tablets (1 tablet per 25 ml of buffer) and layered onto a 13-ml linear 5–20% sucrose gradient containing KPEM, 0.15 m NaCl. The gradients were centrifuged at 37,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 40–44 h at 4 °C, and fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tubes. The s20,w value of phosphorylase b was taken as 8.0 S and was located by absorbance at 280 nm. The s20,w value of hemoglobin was taken as 3.2 S and was located by absorbance at 280 nm and/or 411 nm. [3H]cGMP-binding activity was measured to determine the sedimentation position of the PKG proteins. Sedimentation coefficients of the PKG proteins were then determined by the distance migrated into the gradients compared with the standards. The molecular weights were calculated from the Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients, according to the method of Siegel and Monty (22Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), using Equation 2,Mr=(6πnNas)/(1-νρ)(Eq. 2) where N is Avogadro's number; n is viscosity of medium, assumed to be 1; a is Stokes radius; s is sedimentation coefficient; ρ is density of medium, assumed to be 1; and ν is the partial specific volume, assumed to be 0.725 ml/g. Frictional coefficients were calculated using Equation 3,f/f0=a/(10(3νMr)/(4πN))1/3(Eq. 3) where ν is the partial specific volume, assumed to be 0.725 ml/g, and N is Avogadro's number. Preparations of Sf9 Cell Extracts Used for Studies of PKG Protein Conformation—One T-175 tissue culture flask at 50–70% confluence was infected with the optimal amount of baculovirus for the PKGIα or PKGIβ R domain. At 72 h post-infection, cells were dislodged with a cell scraper (Nunc) and centrifuged for 15 min at 1000–2000 rpm in a Damon table-top swinging bucket centrifuge at room temperature. Cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of KPEM with protease inhibitor tablets (1 tablet per 25 ml of buffer). Cell suspension was homogenized two times with 4-s bursts in an Ultra Turrex microhomogenizer with a 20-s recovery between bursts, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of the supernatant was combined with 4 mg of catalase and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column. For studies in the absence of cGMP, the column was equilibrated in KPEM containing 0.15 m NaCl and protease inhibitors. For studies in the presence of cGMP, the column was equilibrated in KPEM containing 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 100 μm cGMP, and protease inhibitors. Elution position of catalase was determined by absorbance at 400 nm, and the elution positions of PKG proteins were determined by assaying [3H]cGMP binding activity. Calculation of Stokes radius was done as described above under “Gel Filtration Chromatography and Determination of Stokes Radius.” SDS-PAGE and Western Blot of PKGIβ—PKG was boiled for 4 min in the presence of 10% SDS, 2 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For Western blot, gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Primary antibody was 1:7500 diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-PKG, and secondary antibody was 1:5000 diluted goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (BioSource International). The blot was developed using ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Quantification—Protein was determined by the method of Bradford using staining reagent from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) as standard. This method routinely overestimates the amount of PKG protein by 37%, and this correction factor was applied (6Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Materials—Reagents for recombinant enzyme preparations were obtained via the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center Molecular Biology Core. The Vanderbilt Diabetes Center Tissue Culture Core facility provided culture media and competent cells. Baculovirus expression vector pVL 1392, BaculoGold DNA, and transfection reagents and protocols were obtained from Pharmingen. Sf9 log phase cells were purchased from Pharmingen. Protease inhibitor tablets were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Catalase, cytochrome c, phosphorylase b, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Hemoglobin was obtained from Nutritional Biochemicals Corp. T-175 tissue culture flasks were from Corning or Fisher. Expression of R Domains of PKGIα and PKGIβ—Deletion mutagenesis was used to remove the C domain from PKGIα and PKGIβ, creating PKGIα-(Δ349–670) and PKGIβ-(Δ364–685). These isolated R domains contained the dimerization subdomain, autoinhibitory subdomain, and the two cGMP-binding sites (Fig. 1A). The proteins were then expressed using the baculovirus system in Sf9 cells and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of PKG proteins typically displayed at least 100-fold greater [3H]cGMP-binding activity over that of mock-infected cells. The SDS-PAGE migration positions of purified R domains of PKGIα and PKGIβ on SDS-PAGE were consistent with the molecular weights predicted from AA sequences of 40 kDa for PKGIα and 41 kDa for PKGIβ (Fig. 1B). In the most purified samples, one main protein band was observed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE; a minor contaminant of slightly higher molecular weight was present in the PKGIβ preparation. Western blot analysis confirmed that the 40- and 41-kDa bands were derived from PKG (not shown). Structural and Functional Properties of the Isolated R Domains of PKGIα and PKGIβ—Using an exhaustive mutational analytic approach, we recently demonstrated the critical importance of a leucine zipper motif near the amino terminus for dimerization of PKGIβ (15Richie-Jannetta R. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50070-50079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on strong conservation of this motif among PKGs, it seemed likely that it is also crucial for dimerization of PKGIα and PKGII as well. This was supported by the fact that removal of the amino-terminal ∼35 amino acids of PKGIα by limited proteolysis produced a monomeric and cGMP-dependent kinase (23Monken C.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7067-7070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, one study concluded that an isolated R domain construct of PKGIα was monomeric (24Dostmann W.R. Koep N. Endres R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We further examined this issue by determining the quaternary structure of the PKGIα and PKGIβ isolated R domains using the method of Siegel and Monty (22Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) and comparing these values with those derived from the respective recombinant WT PKGs. Gel filtration chromatography was used to determine the Stokes radius, which is a reflection of both the shape and mass of a molecule. As shown in Table 1, the Stokes radii of the isolated PKG R domains and the respective WT PKGs were quite similar despite the fact that the R domains of PKGIα and PKGIβ were approximately half the mass of the full-length PKGs; the Stokes radii were 44 and 51 Å for the isolated R domains of PKGIα and PKGIβ, respectively, compared with 47 and 48 Å for the respective full-length enzymes.TABLE 1Structural and functional properties of WT PKGIα and PKGIβ and their respective isolated R domainsStokes radiusSedimentation coefficientCalculated masscGMP KDSlow site t½cGMP BmaxAssigned quaternary structureÅs20,wkDanmminmol/molWT PKGIαaData are from Chu et al.

https://openalex.org/W2038931441,"ST14 (suppression of tumorigenicity 14) is a transmembrane serine protease that contains a serine protease catalytic (SP) domain, an SEA domain, two complement subcomponent C1r/s (CUB) domains, and four low density lipoprotein receptor class A domains. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins with SP, CUB, and low density lipoprotein receptor domains and their corresponding mutants were generated to analyze protein interactions with these domains. Modified glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the interaction between the SP domain and hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1. With the same method, a CUB domain-interacting protein was isolated and turned out to be the transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor-like and two follistatin-like domains 1 (TMEFF1). Quantitative real time PCR revealed that the expression of the TMEFF1 gene was dependent on the transfection of the ST14 gene in the RKO cell line. Our results also suggested that ST14 and TMEFF1 were co-expressed in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, human placenta, kidney, and liver tissues. Interestingly, these two genes were co-up-regulated in kidney tumors versus normal tissues, consistent with our results that showed the dependence of TMEFF1 expression on ST14 in RKO cells. Finally, homology modeling studies suggested that TMEFF1 might form a complex with ST14 by an interaction between epidermal growth factor and CUB domains.

Finally, homology modeling studies suggested that TMEFF1 might form a complex with ST14 by an interaction between epidermal growth factor and CUB domains. ST14 (suppression of tumorigenicity 14) is a multidomain transmembrane serine protease of the S1 trypsin-like protein family (1Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was first isolated as a novel matrix-degrading protease from human breast cancer cells by Shi et al. (2Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Independently by using subtractive hybridization to isolate genes that are highly expressed in normal intestinal mucosa but not expressed or expressed at a lower level in colon cancers (3Zheng S. Cai X. Cao J. Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1997; 77: 256-259PubMed Google Scholar), we obtained a clone that is identical to ST14. We further assigned the ST14 gene to human chromosome 11q24 (4Zhang Y. Cai X. Schlegelberger B. Zheng S. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 56-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Takeuchi et al. also cloned ST14 from a human prostate cancer cell line and designated it the membrane type serine proteinase 1 (5Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). ST14 was detected in colon carcinomas, immortalized breast epithelial cell lines, breast cancer cell lines, and prostate cancer cell lines but not in cultured fibroblasts or fibrosarcoma cells (3Zheng S.

Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors, such as hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1) (5Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), strongly inhibit ST14 through binding to its catalytic domain. Besides the catalytic domain, other regions are also required for ST14 activation (11Oberst M.D. Williams C.A. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26773-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). By mutation analysis, the CUB and LDLR domains were shown to be indispensable for the proteolytic activity of ST14 (11Oberst M.D. Williams C.A. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26773-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the present study, we generated GST fusion proteins that express three domains of ST14 and demonstrated the interaction between ST14 and HAI-1 using modified GST pull-down assays. Furthermore, we identified a novel interacting protein, TMEFF1, which binds the CUB domain of ST14. Quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that TMEFF1 was expressed only upon ST14 transfection into the RKO cell line. These two genes were found to be co-expressed in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, human normal placenta, kidney tumor, normal kidney, liver tumor, normal liver, lung tumor, and breast tumor. Co-up-regulation of these two genes was observed in kidney cancers and remains an interesting phenomenon to be further explored. Finally, we demonstrated a potential complex formation between TMEFF1 and ST14 by using homology modeling approaches. Cell Lines and Monoclonal Antibody—Human colon carcinoma cell line RKO was transfected with ST14 in a pSecTag2A vector to establish the RKO-ST14 cell line and was transfected with the pSecTag2A backbone vector to establish the RKO-pSecTag2A cell line, respectively. The SW620-HAI-1 cell line, another human colon carcinoma cell line SW620 transfected with HAI-1, and the human monoclonal anti-HAI-1 antibody were generous gifts from Jingjia Ye (12Cao J. Ye J.J. Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 2005; 38: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar). RKO-pSecTag2A and RKO-ST14 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml zeocin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. SW620-HAI-1, the prostate cancer cell line PC3, the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, and Bcap37 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the same condition. Construction of Expression Vectors for GST-ST14 Domains—Each domain of ST14 was amplified by PCR, ligated into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega), and subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) by double enzyme digestions with BamHI and EcoRI/NotI (Takara). The resultant constructs were verified by restrictive enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Primers used for the SP domain were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGATCCAGACTGGCTCGTGTTGTTG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCCTATACCCCAGTGTTCTCTTTG-3′. Primers used for the two CUB domains were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGATCCGTACAGAGGACCCAGGACAAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCATGGGTCACTGGAGTCGTAG-3′. Primers used for the four LDLR domains were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGATCCACCGGCTTCTTAGCTGAATAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAACAGTCGCAGTCCTTCTC-3′. Stop codons (in boldface type) and enzyme sites (underlined) were engineered into the primers. There are two CUB domains (residues 206-475; GenBank™ accession number NP_068813) in the pGEX-4T2-CUB vector and four LDLR domains (residues 438-605) in the pGEX-4T2-LDLR vector. The expression vector containing the SP domain (residues 616-855) is named pGEX-4T2-SP. Point Mutation and Deletion of GST-ST14 Domain Expression Vectors—A deletion mutant of pGEX-4T2-CUB that only contains the first CUB domain (residues 196-362) was created by PCR amplification using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GGATCCGTGGTCACCTCAGTGGTGGCTTTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAGGTGGGTAGTGGCCTGGGTAGTAG-3′. To make site-directed mutations in the SP and LDLR domains, overlap extension PCR was used with primers containing appropriate nucleotide changes. Table 1 lists the primers used for making the three site-specific mutations (H656A, D711A, and S805A) in pGEX-4T2-SP and the four mutations (D482Y, D519Y, D555Y, and D598Y) in pGEX-4T2-LDLR, respectively. A high fidelity Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara) with a proofreading capacity was used to minimize the introduction of erroneous bases in overlap extension PCR. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Primer sequence for site-specific mutagenesisPrimer namePolaritySequenceH656AForward primer5′-TCTCTGCCGCAgcCTGCTACAT-3′aLowercase letters in the primer sequence represent changed nucleotidesReverse primer5′-TAGCAGgcTGCGGCAGAGAC-3′D711AForward primer5′-GACTATGcCATCGCGCTGCT-3′Reverse primer5′-GCGCGATGgCATAGTCGAAG-3′S805AForward primer5′-GGTGATgCCGGGGGACCCCTG-3′Reverse primer5′-CGGcATCACCCTGGCAGGAGTC-3′D482YForward primer5′-CTGCACCGACCACAGCtATGAG-3′Reverse primer5′-CTGTGGTCGGTGCAGTC-3′D519YForward primer5′-GGAGACAACAGCtACGAGCA-3′Reverse primer5′-CTGCTCGTaGCTGTTGTCTC-3′D555YForward primer5′-GGACGGGTCCtACGAGGC-3′Reverse primer5′-GCCTCGTaGGACCCGTCC-3′D598YForward primer5′-GTAGCGACGGCTCAtATGAGA-3′Reverse primer5′-TCATaTGAGCCGTCGCTACA-3′a Lowercase letters in the primer sequence represent changed nucleotides Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—All constructed vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and tested for protein expression. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was used in the purification of GST fusion proteins according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified GST fusion proteins were verified by 10% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Determination of Enzyme Activity—GST-SP and GST-mutSP fusion proteins were tested for serine protease activity using tissue plasminogen activator chromogenic substrate (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST Pull-down Assays with Beads—The bacterial supernatant containing GST fusion proteins was prepared as described (13Bourdoncle A. Labesse G. Margueron R. Castet A. Cavailles V. Royer C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 921-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The final concentration of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin were 1 mm and 5 μg/ml, respectively (aprotinin was not added to the lysate of GST-SP). GST fusion proteins were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with the whole cell extract of SW620-HAI-1 cells overnight at 4 °C (14Li Q. Dai Y. Guo L. Liu Y. Hao C. Wu G.

Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Beads were washed three times, boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing dithiothreitol, and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-HAI-1 antibody. GST Pull-down Assays with Columns—To compare the possibility of protein interaction between the wild-type and mutant forms of GST-ST14 domains, modified GST pull-down assays were used with glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns as described (16Ye S. Pang H. Gu Y.Y. Hua J. Chen X.G. Bao C.D. Wang Y. Zhang W. Qian J. Tsao B.P. Hahn B.H. Chen S.L. Rao Z.H. Shen N. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2003; 42: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins and their corresponding mutants were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns, respectively. The whole cell lysates were loaded onto columns and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The columns were then washed thoroughly with PBS to minimize the contamination. Finally, saline gradient elutions with a 5-column volume of PBS with NaCl concentrations of 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 2000 mm were performed sequentially. Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (Millipore Corp.) with a 5000-Da molecular mass cut-off were used to concentrate each elution product to 50 μl. The proteins bound to GST fusion proteins or their mutants were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Peptide Mass Fingerprint Analysis—Protein bands of interest were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gel and cut into small pieces. After being removed of SDS, gel pieces were digested by sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. The peptides extracted from the gel were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) ProteinChip System (Ciphergen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentration was measured by the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was first blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk and then probed with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HAI-1 antibody, 1:1000 in TBST with 5% nonfat dry milk), followed by incubation with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies; 1:5000 in TBST with 5% nonfat dry milk). The results were visualized by using the Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science). Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cell lines or tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For each reverse transcription-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Two microliters of reverse transcription reaction was then quantified by quantitative real time PCR using an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detector and ABI TaqMan® PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The quantitative results of ST14 and TMEFF1 mRNA were normalized to β-actin mRNA from the same sample. Primers used for quantitative real time PCR were synthesized at GeneCore Corp. Primers used for ST14 were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TGGCTACATGAGGATCACAAATG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGGAATGGGACTCCGCTGTAC-3′. The TaqMan® probe used for ST14 was 5′-FAM-CAGCTTCAGCGCGTCCTTCACCTT-TAMRA-3′. Primers used for TMEFF1 were as follows: forward primer, 5′-AATGTGAGGGAGTCTGACGTAAGAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCCCCATTTGATCCACAGACA-3′. The TaqMan® probe used for TMEFF1 was 5′-FAM-TGTGCATGCCAATTTCAGTGCCATACA-TAMRA-3′. Primers used for β-actin were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCGTCTTCCCCTCCATCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCCCAGTTGGTGACGATGC-3′. The TaqMan® probe used for β-actin was 5′-FAM-CCAGGGCGTGATGGTGGGCAT-TAMRA-3′. Structure Modeling—The query protein sequence was submitted to the metaserver @TOME (17Douguet D. Labesse G.

Expression and Purification of GST-ST14 Domain Fusion Proteins and Their Mutants—GST-ST14 domain fusion proteins were designed essentially as described by Lin and co-workers (11Oberst M.D. Williams C.A.

Mutations that substitute His-656, Asp-711, or Ser-805 with Ala in the SP domain would inactivate the serine protease activity (8Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Ong E. Coombs G. Hunter M. Oehler R.

Deletion of the second CUB domain would result in a poor activation of ST14 (11Oberst M.D. Williams C.A. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26773-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The point mutations that substitute an Asp with Tyr in each of the four LDLR domains would inactivate the Ca2+-binding cage in each domain (11Oberst M.D. Williams C.A. Dickson R.B.

In the present work, SP, CUB, LDLR domains, and the deletion mutant of the CUB domain (only containing the first CUB) were cloned into the pGEX-4T2 vector. The whole cell lysate with or without expression of GST fusion proteins was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2, lane 3 and 4). We also made three point mutations (S805A, D711A, and H656A) in the GST-mutSP fusion protein and four point mutations (D598Y, D555Y, D519Y, and D482Y) in GST-mutLDLR by using overlap extension PCR (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 16Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 3. GST fusion proteins were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and was again revealed by 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 2). ST14 autoactivation was observed with GST-SP fusion proteins in both crude cell lysate (lane 3) and its purified form (lane 2). The upper band corresponds to the inactive GST-SP fusion proteins, and the lower band corresponds to the active GST-SP fusion proteins. The addition of protease inhibitors inhibited autoactivation through purification (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas autoactivation was more obvious in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 2, lane 3). Similar autoactivation was reported when a His-tagged fusion protein of ST14 was expressed in E. coli (5Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Expression and purification of GST-SP fusion proteins. Shown is a 10% SDS-PAGE analysis of GST-SP fusion proteins.

ST14 autoactivation was observed both in lanes 2 and 3. The upper band corresponds to inactivated GST-SP fusion proteins, and the lower band corresponds to active GST-SP fusion proteins. Protease inhibitors were added to prevent autoactivation through purification (lane 2). By contrast, active GST-SP accumulated in whole cell lysates (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Overlap extension PCR of LDLR domains. Lanes 1 and 7, DNA marker DL2000; lanes 2-6, products of the first round of PCR with primers in Table 1, respectively; lane 8, products of the second round PCR to amplify the full-length of LDLR domain. Five PCRs with five pairs of primers (Table 1), respectively, were used to create four point mutations in the first round. The first-round PCR products were diluted to the same concentration (Mol) and used as the template for the second round PCR. Mutagenesis of the SP domain was performed by the same method (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enzyme Activity Assay of GST-SP Fusion Proteins and Mutants—We diluted purified GST-SP and GST-mutSP fusion proteins to the same concentration and tested their enzyme activities in parallel. GST-SP fusion proteins following incubation with aprotinin in a final concentration of 5 μg/ml were tested as control. Aprotinin shows strong inhibitory activity on serine protease activity of ST14 (10Yamasaki Y. Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, aprotinin inhibited the activity of purified GST-SP fusion proteins completely (Fig. 4, curve 3). Similarly, no serine protease activity was detected in the GST-mutSP fusion proteins that were mutated in the catalytic triad of the SP domain (Fig. 4, curve 2). Purified GST-SP fusion proteins were autoactivated slowly, and this activity lasted for several days (Fig. 4, curve 1). Detection of the Interaction between GST-SP and HAI-1 by GST Pull-down Assays—To confirm the interaction between the SP domain and HAI-1, GST-SP fusion proteins were immobilized onto the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and tested for their ability to pull down the HAI-1 proteins that were expressed in the SW620-HAI-1 cells. A parallel experiment was performed using GST-mutSP under identical conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, HAI-1 proteins were pulled down by both GST-SP and GST-mutSP; however, GST-SP pulled down more HAI-1 proteins than GST-mutSP. After an additional wash and increased ionic strength of washing buffer were used, more HAI-1 was washed off from the GST-mutSP beads, whereas a substantial amount of HAI-1 was still bound to GST-SP (data not shown). To further confirm the interaction between the SP domain and HAI-I, we performed modified GST pull-down assays to test the interaction between the SP domain and HAI-1. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, HAI-1 proteins bound to GST-mutSP were eluted completely by 400 mm PBS-NaCl. By contrast, HAI-1 proteins bound to GST-SP were eluted by 600 and 800 mm PBS-NaCl. Therefore, modified GST pull-down assays can distinguish small differences in binding properties between proteins and their corresponding mutants. GST-ST14 Domains as Bait to Capture Prey Proteins—Three cell lines, including Bcap37, RKO-pSecTag2A, and RKO-ST14, were used as sources of potential ST14-interacting proteins. ST14 is detectable in Bcap37 but not in RKO. Therefore, a full-length cDNA of ST14 was cloned into pSecTag2A and transfected into RKO cells. RKO-pSecTag2A was the RKO cell line transfected with the empty pSecTag2A vector and used as a control. The reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the successful transfection. Western blot analysis indicated that HAI-1 was not detectable in these cell lines (Fig. 6A). Three pairs of GST fusion proteins (GST-SP, GST-CUB, and GST-LDLR along with their mutants) were used to capture their interacting proteins in modified GST pull-down assays. Either the proteins bound to both wild-type and mutant ST domains, or bound proteins not sufficient for identification were excluded from the candidate pool of ST14-interacting proteins. The protein bands that were present in the fraction bound to the wild-type domains of ST14 but not in that bound to their mutants were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel for peptide mass fingerprint analysis. No such specific binding proteins were identified in the assays of SP and LDLR domains. However, we obtained a protein of ∼37.6 kDa that was still bound specifically to the wild-type CUB domain in the buffer with 800 mm NaCl (Fig. 6B). This 37.6-kDa protein was detected only in the RKO-ST14 cells, and it was not the GST or GST fusion protein according to its molecular weight. Interestingly, this protein was not detected in Bcap37 or RKO-pSecTag2A cells. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis of this protein was shown in Fig. 7. By searching a peptide mass fingerprint data base (Aldente; available on the World Wide Web at au.expasy.org/tools/aldente/), this protein was found to be most identical to TMEFF1 (rank 1). The other candidate proteins were the precursor of TMEFF1 (rank 2) and DKFZp761G1118 (rank 3). DKFZp761G1118 was a hypothetical protein that was 89% identical to TMEFF1. Pairwise alignments of their corresponding mRNA sequences also demonstrated high similarity between these three genes. We then examined the expression of TMEFF1 in RKO-ST14 and RKO-pSecTag2A cells. TMEFF1 was also detected in RKO-ST14 but not in RKO-pSecTag2A by quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 6C). This result further indicated that this protein is TMEFF1, although it remains unknown whether this protein is the processed form of TMEFF1 or its precursor. Co-expression of ST14 and TMEFF1 in Cell Lines and Tissues—Human placental tissue and a breast cell line MCF7 expressed ST14 and TMEFF1 at different levels. Northern blot analysis showed TMEFF1 was expressed at a moderately low level in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 (27Gery S. Yin D. Xie D. Black K.L. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2723-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ST14 mRNA is undetectable in PC3 according to quantitative real time PCR results of Bhatt et al. (28Bhatt A.S. Takeuchi T. Ylstra B. Ginzinger D. Albertson D. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although Takeuchi et al. (5Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) cloned ST14 cDNA from PC3 cells. Thus, we chose placental tissue, MCF7, and PC3 cell lines in our study. As shown in Fig. 8, our results confirmed the co-expression of ST14 and TMEFF1 in human placental tissue. However, ST14 was expressed at a low level in MCF cells and was undetectable in PC3 cells. We further tested the expression of ST14 and TMEFF1 in the tumor and matched adjacent normal tissue of kidney, liver, lung, breast, and colon. Co-expression of ST14 and TMEFF1 was identified in normal kidney, kidney tumor, normal liver, liver tumor, lung tumor, and breast tumor. Interestingly, ST14 and TMEFF1 were co-up-regulated in kidney tumors versus normal kidney tissues. Consistently, as mentioned above, w"

In an effort to determine the functional consequences of these protein-protein interactions, point mutations were introduced into the gp59 protein. Mutations were chosen based on the available crystal structure and focused on hydrophobic residues with a high degree of solvent accessibility. Characterization of the mutant proteins revealed a single mutation, Y122A, which is defective in polymerase binding and has weakened affinity for the helicase. The interaction between single-stranded DNA-binding protein and Y122A is unaffected, as is the affinity of Y122A for DNA substrates. When standard concentrations of helicase are employed, Y122A is unable to productively load the helicase onto forked DNA substrates. As a result of the loss of polymerase binding, Y122A cannot inhibit the polymerase during nucleotide idling or prevent it from removing the primer strand of a D-loop. However, Y122A is capable of inhibiting strand displacement synthesis by polymerase. The retention of strand displacement inhibition by Y122A, even in the absence of a gp59-polymerase interaction, indicates that there are two modes of polymerase inhibition by gp59. Inhibition of the polymerase activity only requires gp59 to bind to the replication fork, whereas inhibition of the exonuclease activity requires an interaction between the polymerase and gp59. The inability of Y122A to interact with both the polymerase and the helicase suggests a mechanism for polymerase unlocking by the helicase based on a direct competition between the helicase and polymerase for an overlapping binding site on gp59.

The eight protein replisome can be divided into three modules, the leading strand holoenzyme, the lagging strand holoenzyme, and the primosome (3Alberts B.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

Contained within gp43 polymerase are two distinct active sites. One is the polymerization site that catalyzes the 5′ to 3′ incorporation of deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) into the growing primer strand, and the other is the exonuclease site that is responsible for the removal of dNMPs in the 3′ to 5′ direction (4Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). gp45 is bound to the polymerase and encircles the DNA duplex, thereby increasing its processivity during DNA synthesis (5Shamoo Y.

The primosome is made up of the helicase (gp41), primase (gp61), single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32), and the helicase loading protein (gp59) (9Zhang Z. Spiering M.M.

Protein cross-linking experiments have detected molecular contacts between gp59, gp61, gp41, and gp32 proteins (25Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

Single molecule and ensemble fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments (FRET) have confirmed the cross-linking results for gp59-gp32 and gp59-gp41 interactions (9Zhang Z. Spiering M.M.

Recently, we have characterized a protein-protein interaction between gp59 and the gp43 polymerase that inhibits the polymerase and exonuclease activities of gp43. Cross-linking and FRET studies indicate that a complex between these two proteins is formed at the replication fork prior to the initiation of DNA replication (9Zhang Z. Spiering M.M. Trakselis M.A. Ishmael F.T. Xi J. Benkovic S.J. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Barry J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol.

With computational methods, a molecular model of the complex was generated that rationalizes the inhibition of the polymerase activities by gp59 where a protein segment of gp59 blocks partitioning of the DNA substrate between the polymerase and exonuclease sites of the enzyme (17Xi J. Zhuang Z. Zhang Z. Selzer T. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2305-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Unlocking of the polymerase is achieved through the loading of gp41 at the replication fork in the presence of ATP (28Xi J. Zhang Z. Zhuang Z. Yang J. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7747-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to the many protein-protein interactions involving gp59, it also binds to several types of DNA substrates, possessing the highest affinity for forked DNA structures (29Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A molecular model has been proposed for the interaction between gp59 and a forked DNA substrate (30Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As predicted by this model, a site-directed mutation at residue Ile87 renders gp59 defective in regard to the binding of forked DNA (31Jones C.E. Green E.M. Stephens J.A. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25721-25728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In vivo, gp59 is indispensable for the loading of gp41 helicase onto a D-loop, which is formed through the action of UvsX/Y-catalyzed strand invasion of ssDNA into a homologous dsDNA template (32Bleuit J.S.

T4 phage employs two strategies for the initiation of replication (33Mosig G. Colowick N. Gruidl M.E. Chang A. Harvey A.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 83-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the early stages of replication, origin-dependent initiation dominates, using stably bound RNA transcripts called R-loops to serve as the primer and scaffold for replisome assembly (33Mosig G. Colowick N. Gruidl M.E. Chang A. Harvey A.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 83-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, in the middle and late stages of the T4 infection, R-loop-dependent initiation ceases and the D-loop-dependent mode takes over (33Mosig G. Colowick N. Gruidl M.E. Chang A. Harvey A.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 83-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we present the functional effects of site-directed mutation of several possible “hot spots” of protein-protein interactions involving the helicase loader protein gp59 (Fig. 1). Of the four mutants generated, a single mutation, Tyr122 to alanine (Y122A), has drastically altered the properties of the protein. The previously proposed gp59-gp43 interaction model places residue Tyr122 near the interface of these two proteins. Y122A could no longer load gp41 helicase onto DNA and failed to support coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis unless extremely high concentrations of gp41 are used. Moreover, FRET-based assays indicated that Y122A does not form a specific protein-protein contact with DNA polymerase. As a consequence of this deficiency, Y122A no longer inhibits the exonuclease activity of the polymerase but still retains the ability to inhibit the polymerization activity of the polymerase, revealing two distinct modes of polymerase inhibition by gp59. We propose a further refined model that features a competition between gp41 and gp43 for an overlapping binding site on gp59 that rationalizes the loss of both the helicase loading and polymerase inhibition activities upon mutation of Tyr122.MATERIALS AND METHODS[α-32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled ribonucleotides were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Both 7-diethylamino-3-(4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) and Oregon Green 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, 5-isomer (OG) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bacteriophage T4 replication proteins gp41, gp61, gp43, gp44/62, gp45, and gp32 were purified as described (12Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T4 recombination proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the pet28b (Stratagene) expression vectors and purified as described (34Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The pGEM vector was from Promega.Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Wild-type and gp59 Mutants—Site-directed mutants were introduced into the gp59-intein fusion pet-IMPACT vector (12Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutations were made in gp59 using the Quickchange mutagenesis method (Stratagene), and the entire gp59 open reading frame was sequenced using the dideoxy terminator method. The sequences of the mutagenic primers were as follows with the boldface underlined letters indicating the mutation site (reverse primers are the reverse complement of the forward): F111A, 5′-GGACGCTTAAAGCAAATTAAAGCTAAGTTTGAAGAAGATATTCGC; Y217A, 5′-GAAACTGTGAAATCTTGCAAGGCTTGCTTTGCCAAGGGTAC; Y146A, 5′-ATCCAAAAGTTCAATCAAGTGCTATTTTTAAACTTCTGCAATCG; and Y122A, 5′-GATATTCGCAACATTTATGCTTTTAGTAAAAAAGTTGAAGTTTC.Wild-type and gp59 mutants were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and grown in 10 ml of Luria broth overnight at 37 °C. The overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into 1 liter of LB and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. The cultures were then allowed to cool to 18 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 16 h of shaking, cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and resuspended in 10 ml of chitin column binding buffer containing 1/5 of a protease inhibitor pellet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed using sonication, and cell debris was pelleted at 25,000 × g. Cell-free extract was loaded onto 1 ml of chitin (New England Biolabs) columns and washed with 50 column volumes of chitin binding buffer. The chitin resin was resuspended in binding buffer plus 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated overnight at 4 °C to facilitate intein-mediated cleavage. Following overnight cleavage, full-length gp59 was eluted in binding buffer, dialyzed into storage buffer, and analyzed for purity using SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 37,800 m-1 cm-1.DNA Constructs—Single-stranded M13 phage DNA (ssM13) was purified from infected Xl1-Blue cells by polyethylene glycol precipitation and phenol extraction as described (35Manniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 4.21-4.32Google Scholar). Double-stranded M13 phage DNA (dsM13) was purified from the infected Xl1-Blue cells using the Qiagen™ Qiaprep Spin miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The etheno modification of the ssM13 was carried out as described (36Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, ssM13 DNA (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 2 m chloroacetaldehyde in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.5) for 8 h. The reaction was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 16 h and transferred to a 55 °C oven for an additional 8 h to allow for maturation of the derivatized bases. The integrity of the modified DNA (ϵM13) was confirmed by Tris acetate-EDTA (TAE)-agarose electrophoresis. The absorbance maximum and minimum were identical to published values (36Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the ϵM13 was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 16,268 m-1 cm-1.The 3540-bp nicked substrate used for rolling circle replication (pGEM_nick) was made by specifically nicking a modified pGEM vector at position 1353 with the enzyme N.BbvC IB (New England Biolabs). The nicking site was introduced through Quickchange™ mutagenesis of a pGEM vector containing a 530-bp insertion of phage T4 DNA corresponding to positions 114,754-115,284 of the T4 genome. The sequence of the forward mutagenic primer (reverse primer is the reverse complement of the forward) was 5′-GCT TAA TCA GTG AGG CAC CTA CC^T CAG CGA TCT GTC TAT TTC GTT, where the boldface underlined letter indicates the mutation site, and ^ indicates the nicking position. The nicking reaction was carried for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer 4 (New England Biolabs) containing 10 μg of the pGEM_nick plasmid and 20 units of N.BbvC IB. Following digestion, the reaction was heated to 70 °C for 20 min to completely denature the nicking enzyme. The substrate was used without further treatment. The efficiency of the nicking reaction was monitored with 1% TAE-agarose electrophoresis. As a control, pGEM vector without the nick site was treated in an identical fashion, and no change in mobility was observed using TAE electrophoresis.The sequences of the oligonucleotide substrates used in the unwinding assays were as follows: fork lead, 5′-CAT CAT GCA GGA CAG TCG GAT CGC AGT CAG ATT TAC TGT GTC ATA TAG TAC GTA TTC AG; fork lag, 5′-TAA CGT ATT CAA GAT ACC TCG TAC TCT GTA CTG ACT GCG ATC CGA CTG TCC TGC ATG ATG; and trap, 5′-CTG ACT GCG ATC CGA CTG TCC TGC ATG ATG. The unwinding fork was made by mixing fork lead and fork lag DNA in equal molar amounts.The 80-base oligonucleotide (ss80mer) used for the D-loop experiments is homologous to the coding strand of phage M13 between positions 6240 and 6320. PCR was used to amplify a 1500-bp region of M13 phage (dsM131500) using primers annealing to positions 6200-6222 and 7229-7250 for the forward and reverse primers, respectively.The forked DNA substrate used in the FRET assays was identical to those used previously (17Xi J. Zhuang Z. Zhang Z. Selzer T. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2305-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primer and template strands of the Bio25/75 substrate used in the polymerase idling assays were 5′-Bio-CAA CAT TTC CTC CAC CTC ACC CTT′ and 5′-AGG TGG AGG GAT GGT GGT AAT CCC GTG TGA GGT GGA GGT GAG TAG GTT GGA AGG GTG AGG TGG AGG AAG ATG TTG, respectively. All DNA strands were annealed by heating to 95 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling (∼1 h) to room temperature. Where indicated, 5′ labeling was performed with polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP under standard conditions.DNA Binding of Wild-type and gp59 Mutants—Etheno-derivatized single-stranded M13 DNA (ϵM13) binding experiments were performed in 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 8 μm ϵM13 (nucleotides), and a gp59 concentration of 0.75 μm (37Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence was recorded using an ISA FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. Protein and DNA were incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to fluorescence readings. The excitation and emission wavelengths used were 305 and 410 nm, respectively. Slit widths of 2 nm were used for both excitation and emission. Each data point represented an average of 10 1-s acquisitions. For the NaCl titration experiments, the system was allowed to come to equilibrium for 5 min before acquisition. The fluorescence signal was corrected for protein fluorescence and dilution upon addition of NaCl. The total volume change throughout the NaCl titration was no more than 7%. To determine the IC50 values for NaCl for the wild-type and mutant gp59s, the equilibrium fluorescence data were fit to Equation 1 ΔFF0=(ΔFmax/F0)n1+(IC50/X)n(Eq. 1) where ΔF is the change in fluorescence caused upon addition of NaCl; F0 is the fluorescence in the absence of ligand; ΔFmax is the maximum fluorescence change at an infinite concentration of NaCl; X is the concentration of NaCl; Kd is the dissociation constant; and n is the Hill coefficient.Helicase Unwinding Assay—The helicase unwinding assays were performed in the standard replication buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 125 mm KOAc, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2) with 10 nm unwinding fork DNA, 50 nm trap ssDNA, 400 nm gp32, 5 mm ATP, 150 nm gp41, and 150 nm gp59 (monomeric concentrations). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C, and various aliquots were removed at the time points indicated and quenched with an equal volume of 250 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 μg/ml xylene cyanol FF). Reaction products were separated by 10% PAGE in TBE buffer and analyzed using a PhosphorImager.Labeling gp43 and gp59 with Fluorophores—Labeling of WT and mutant gp59s (F111A, Y122A, Y146A, and Y217A) with CPM was carried out essentially as described previously (17Xi J. Zhuang Z. Zhang Z. Selzer T. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2305-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, after dialyzing against the labeling buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), WT and gp59 mutants were labeled with a 4-fold excess of CPM dye, and the labeling reactions were allowed to proceed in dark for 4 h at 4 °C. Excess dye was removed by buffer exchange with a Centricon (Millipore) until no free dye was detectable in the filtrate. The protein concentration and the amount of dye were measured by the absorbance at 280 and 384 nm, respectively. The labeling efficiency ([dye]/[protein]) was generally between 60 and 70%. The labeled proteins were frozen in aliquots and stored at -70 °C. The procedure for labeling the N terminus of gp43 with Oregon Green 488 maleimide (OG) is as described previously (17Xi J. Zhuang Z. Zhang Z. Selzer T. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2305-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Steady-state FRET Experiments—Steady-state FRET experiments were carried out on an ISA FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. gp59-CPM (600 nm) was mixed with gp43-OG (400 nm) in the presence of a forked 32/64/73-mer DNA substrate (100 nm) constructed as described previously (17Xi J. Zhuang Z. Zhang Z. Selzer T. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2305-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An excitation wavelength of 390 nm was used. Donor (gp59-CPM) quenching and acceptor (gp43-OG) sensitization due to FRET were observed over a wavelength range between 430 and 600 nm. Slit widths were adjusted between 1 and 3 nm to keep the spectrum on scale. FRET signals between gp43 and WT/mutant gp59s were measured.Three reactions were performed for each gp43/gp59 pair. In the first reaction, CPM-labeled gp59 was mixed with OG-labeled gp43 to measure the energy transfer between the donor and the acceptor. In the second reaction, unlabeled gp59 was mixed with OG-labeled gp43 to measure the background signal of acceptor sensitization under the experimental conditions. This spectrum was then subtracted from the one obtained in the first reaction to correct the FRET signal. In the third reaction, CPM-labeled gp59 was mixed with unlabeled gp43 to measure the amount of donor quenching by gp43 and was subtracted from the first reaction.Wild-type Polymerase Idling—The polymerase idling reactions were performed in the standard replication buffer containing 0.5 μm Bio25/75, 100 nm gp43, 500 nm gp44/62, 500 nm gp45, 5 mm ATP, 50 μm dCTP, 50 μm dTTP, 50 μm dATP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in a total volume of 20 μl. Because of the omission of dGTP, the holoenzyme will idle at the guanosine base preceding the stall site (turnover of dCTP). Bio25/75 was mixed with holoenzyme components and nucleotides for 15 s prior to adding either wild-type or Y122A gp59. Aliquots of 2 μl were removed from the reaction mixture at various time points and quenched with an equal volume of 250 mm EDTA. 1 μl from each time point was spotted on PEI-cellulose TLC plates and developed with 300 mm KPi (pH 7.0). After drying, the TLC plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette for 1 h and then quantitated using the PhosphorImager. IC50 values were determined by using Equation 1, with the fluorescence signal being replaced with counts/min.Rolling Circle Replication—The rolling circle replication reactions were performed in the standard replication buffer containing 5 nm pGEM_nick, 200 nm gp43, 200 nm 44/62, 200 nm gp45, 400 nm gp41, 400 nm gp61, 100 nm gp59 (WT or mutant as indicated), 4 μm gp32, 100 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm dNTPs, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, in a reaction volume of 45 μl. The reactions were quenched at the time points indicated with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA. Titration of WT-gp59 and Y122A was performed in a total volume of 10 μl, and the reaction was quenched after 10 min. IC50 values were determined by using Equation 1, with the fluorescence signal being replaced with counts/min. In experiments where the concentration of gp41 was varied, a total reaction volume of 5 μl was used, and reactions were quenched after 7 min. The DNA products were analyzed through 0.8% alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (30 mm NaOH and 5 mm EDTA) for 48 h.D-loop Initiated Replication—For the polymerase inhibition reactions, the 5′-32P-labeled ss80mer (10 nm) was preincubated with 1.5 μm UvsX and 0.25 μm UvsY for 10 min at 37 °C prior to mixing with a 3-fold molar excess of dsM131500 (30 nm) in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 50 μm dNTPs, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 5 units/ml of creatine kinase followed by the immediate addition of the replisomal proteins at t"

Prolonged incubation of NA3 in medium containing 2 mm nitrate led to isolation of a pseudorevertant (NA3R) capable of transport of millimolar concentrations of nitrate, from which three mutants with improved affinity for nitrate were obtained. We identified three genes responsible for the latent transport activity for nitrate: ltnA, which encodes a response regulator with no effector domain; ltnB, which encodes a hybrid histidine kinase with two receiver domains; and ltnT, which encodes a sulfate permease-like protein with a putative cyclic nucleoside monophosphate (cNMP)-binding domain. Missense mutations of the high affinity derivatives of NA3R were found in ltnT, verifying that LtnT acts as the transporter. Overexpression of truncated LtnT lacking the cNMP-binding domain (but not full-length LtnT) conferred nitrate transport activity on NA3, suggesting that the cNMP-binding domain inhibits transport under normal conditions. A nonsense mutation in ltnB that resulted in elimination of the receiver domains of the encoded protein was responsible for expression of nitrate transport activity in NA3R. Expression of LtnB derivatives lacking the receiver domains also conferred low affinity nitrate transport activity on NA3. The phosphoryl group of the histidine kinase domain of LtnB was transferred to Asp52 of LtnA in vitro. Overexpression of LtnA (but not LtnA(D52E)) led to manifestation of the latent nitrate transport activity in NA3, indicating involvement of phosphorylated LtnA in activation of the novel transporter.

Nitrate is a major source of nitrogen for plants, algae, fungi, and many species of bacteria (1Guerrero M.G. Vega J.M. Losada M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 169-204Crossref Google Scholar, 2Guerrero M.G. Lara C. The Cyanobacteria.in: Fay P. Van Baalen C. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1987: 163-186Google Scholar). It is transported into the cells by an active nitrate transport system (NRT) 2The abbreviations used are: NRT, nitrate transport system; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ORFs, open reading frames; cNMP, cyclic nucleoside monophosphate; SulP, sulfate permease; LTN, latent transport activity for nitrate; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. and reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase. Nitrite is further reduced to ammonium by nitrite reductase, and the resulting ammonium is fixed as the amide group of Gln by glutamine synthetase. Three distinct types of nitrate transport systems have been identified among the large variety of organisms that assimilate nitrate, viz. NRT1, NRT2, and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type NRT. NRT1 and NRT2 possess 12 membrane-spanning regions and belong to the major facilitator superfamily of secondary active transport systems (3Forde B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). ABC-type NRT is a primary active transport system consisting of a substrate-binding protein and a membrane transporter complex (4Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although NRT2 is widespread and found in plants, algae, fungi, the marine strains of cyanobacteria, and some species of heterotrophic bacteria, NRT1 has been found only in vascular plants. ABC-type NRT is present only in prokaryotic organisms, including the freshwater strains of cyanobacteria and some heterotrophic bacteria. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has an ABC-type NRT encoded by four genes: nrtA encodes the substrate-binding protein; nrtB encodes the integral membrane component of the transporter; and nrtC and nrtD encode the ABC proteins (5Omata T.

The NA3 mutant, which was constructed by deleting the nrtABCD genes from the nirA operon, lacks NRT activity and requires high concentrations of nitrate (>30 mm) for sustained growth (12Maeda S.-i. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated and characterized a pseudorevertant of NA3 (NA3R) that is capable of uptake of low concentrations of nitrate. Genetic analysis of NA3R and its derivatives revealed that a novel sulfate permease-like protein of unknown substrate specificity shows low affinity nitrate transport activity. We also shown that a two-component regulatory system involving a hybrid histidine kinase and a response regulator with no effector domain is required for activation of the transporter. Possible roles of the phosphotransfer reaction via the two-component system in the regulation of the activity of the novel nitrate transport system are discussed. Strains and Growth Conditions—A derivative of S. elongatus that was cured of the resident small plasmid pUH24 (R2-SPc (13Kuhlemeier C.J. Thomas A.A. van der Ende A. van Leen R.W.

The basal medium used was a nitrogen-free medium obtained by modification of the BG11 medium (14Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (15Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2688-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ammonium-containing medium and nitrite-containing medium were prepared by the addition of 3.75 mm (NH4)2SO4 and 5 mm NaNO2, respectively to the basal medium. Nitrate-containing medium was prepared by the addition of KNO3 at the indicated concentrations to the basal medium. Solid medium was prepared by adding 1.5% Bacto agar (Difco) to the liquid medium. All media were buffered with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.2). When appropriate, kanamycin and/or chloramphenicol was added to the media at 25 and 10 μg/ml, respectively.

After 4 months of cultivation, the color of the culture turned yellow green, indicating growth of cells. Streaking of the culture onto a plate containing 5 mm nitrate allowed isolation of a colony of a pseudorevertant (designated NA3R) that grew well on 5 mm nitrate, but failed to grow on 0.5 mm nitrate. For selection of NA3R derivatives with high affinities for nitrate, NA3R cells were incubated under low nitrate conditions that did not support growth of the pseudorevertant. Thus, after incubation for 3 months on solid medium containing 0.3 mm nitrate, one colony arose and was isolated as a high affinity derivative of the pseudorevertant (designated HAR1). Two independent NA3R derivatives capable of growth on solid medium containing 0.3 mm nitrate were isolated from liquid cultures containing 1mm and 0.3 mm nitrate and designated HAR2 and HAR3, respectively. Loss-of-Function Analysis of the Genes Required by NA3R for Nitrate Transport—A transcriptional fusion of the nitrogen-responsive promoter of nirA (nucleotides -275 to -15 with respect to the nirA translation start site) and the coding sequences of luxA and luxB (PnirA::luxAB) (16Maeda S.-i. Kawaguchi Y. Ohe T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was integrated into the cmpB-cmpC region of the Synechococcus genome as described previously (16Maeda S.-i. Kawaguchi Y. Ohe T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to construct a reporter strain (NA3Rlux) from NA3R. For random tagging mutagenesis of NA3Rlux, genomic DNA isolated from wild-type Synechococcus cells was partially digested with Sau3AI, and the resulting DNA fragments of 0.3-1.0 kilobase pairs in size were inserted into the BamHI site of the pHSG298 vector (TaKaRa). NA3Rlux cells were transformed with the DNA library and allowed to grow on solid medium containing 60 mm nitrate and kanamycin. After cultivation for 10 days on agar plates, colonies emitting strong bioluminescence were selected and shown to be defective in growth on 5 mm nitrate. For retrieval of the genomic DNA regions that were modified by integration of the pHSG298 derivatives, genomic DNA isolated from the selected mutants was digested with EcoRI or SalI and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA fragments of 3-10 kilobase pairs in size were eluted from the gel and self-ligated, and the resulting plasmids were used for transformation of Escherichia coli JM109. Kanamycin-resistant E. coli transformants were isolated and shown to contain pHSG298 derivatives carrying Synechococcus genomic DNA fragments. Nucleotide sequences of the DNA regions were compared with the complete genome sequence of S. elongatus strain PCC 6301 (GenBank™ accession number NC_006576; available at cyano.genome.jp/), the gene sequences of which are 99.7% identical to those of S. elongatus strain PCC 7942, to identify the lesions in the NA3Rlux derivatives unable to grow on 5 mm nitrate. Construction of the Insertion Mutants—Site-directed insertion mutants were constructed as described previously by Williams and Szalay (17Williams J.G. Szalay A.A. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 24: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DNA fragments that contained complete or partial sequences of the target open reading frames (ORFs) of Synechococcus were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega Corp.). A kanamycin-resistant (18Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) or chloramphenicol-resistant (19Dzelzkalns V.A. Owens G.C. Bogorad L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8917-8925Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) marker was subsequently inserted at a suitable restriction site in each of the ORFs in the same orientation as the ORFs. The resulting plasmids were used to transform Synechococcus to kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance through homologous recombination. The transformants were allowed to grow on solid medium supplemented with kanamycin or chloramphenicol. After serial streak purifications to promote segregation of alleles and to isolate homozygous mutants, genomic DNA from selected clones was analyzed by PCR to confirm the presence and position of the kanamycin- or chloramphenicol-resistant marker. Expression of Plasmid-encoded Proteins in Synechococcus—A shuttle expression vector (pSE1) (12Maeda S.-i. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used for expression of cloned genes in Synechococcus. The coding regions of ltnA, ltnB, and ltnT were amplified from the Synechococcus chromosomal DNA by PCR. Sense primers carried mismatches with the genomic sequence that created an NcoI or a BspHI recognition site at the translation start site without changing the encoded amino acid sequence. Antisense primers carried a BamHI or an XbaI recognition sequence immediately downstream of the termination codon. The ltnA sequence with a T-to-A base substitution at the nucleotide 156 was generated by overlap extension PCR (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). For expression of LtnB derivatives lacking the N-terminal signal input domain, an internal ATG codon located at position 1222 of the ORF was used as the initiation codon. For expression of LtnB derivatives lacking one or two of its receiver domains, antisense primers were designed to introduce stop codons at nucleotides 2563 and 2206, respectively. For expression of an LtnT derivative lacking the C-terminal cyclic nucleoside monophosphate (cNMP)-binding domain, an antisense primer was designed to introduce a stop codon at position 1756 of the coding region. The PCR products were digested with a combination of NcoI and BamHI, NcoI and XbaI, BspHI and BamHI, or BspHI and XbaI and cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites or the NcoI and XbaI sites of pSE1. The resulting plasmids were introduced into the NA3 cells after verification of the nucleotide sequence. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli—The expression vectors pQE30 and pQE31 (Qiagen Inc.) were used for overexpression of LtnA, LtnB, and their derivatives as His-tagged proteins. The coding sequences of the ltnA and ltnA(T156A) genes were prepared essentially as described above, except that the sense primer used for PCR carried mismatches with the genomic sequence to create a BamHI recognition site nine nucleotides upstream of the translation start site and that the antisense primer carried a BamHI recognition sequence immediately downstream of the termination codon. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pQE30. The truncated ltnB genes were excised from the pSE1 derivatives used for expression of the genes in Synechococcus (see above) by digestion with BalI and XbaI and cloned between the SmaI and NheI site of pQE31. After verification of the nucleotide sequences, the resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen Inc.), and the His-tagged proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Phosphotransfer Experiment—Purified proteins were incubated in 15 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol supplemented with 0.05 mm [γ-32P]ATP (200 TBq/mmol), 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 according to the protocol of Aiba et al. (21Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8563-8567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of SDS buffer containing 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 60% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. The samples were subjected to 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the 32P-labeled signals were detected using a bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Measurement of Nitrate Uptake—Cells grown in medium containing 60 mm nitrate were washed with the basal medium supplemented with 5mm NaHCO3 and 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.2) and suspended in the same medium at a chlorophyll concentration of 5 or 10 μg/ml. The reactions were started by the addition of KNO3 at various concentrations to cell suspensions kept at 30 °C in the light (70 microeinsteins m-2 s-1). Aliquots were withdrawn from the cell suspension at 10-min intervals. After immediate centrifugation to sediment the cells, the nitrate concentrations of the supernatants were determined using a flow injection analyzer (NOX-1000, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.). The rate of nitrate uptake was calculated from the linear decrease in the nitrate concentration of the medium with time. Other Methods—Chromosomal DNA was extracted from Synechococcus cells and purified as described by Williams (22Williams J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Manipulations and analyses of DNA were performed according to standard protocols. Chlorophyll and protein concentrations were determined according to Mackinney (23Mackinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The in vivo bioluminescence from the Synechococcus transformants carrying a PnirA::luxAB transcriptional fusion was measured with a luminometer (ARGUS-50, Hamamatsu Photonics) as described previously (16Maeda S.-i. Kawaguchi Y. Ohe T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrate Uptake Capacity of the Mutant Strains—Fig. 1 compares the growth curves of the wild-type strain, the NRT-deficient mutant NA3, and the pseudorevertant of NA3 (designated NA3R). The wild-type strain grew equally well in ammonium- or nitrate-containing medium with a generation time of 6.4 h (Fig. 1A). The NA3 mutant grew as fast as the wild-type strain in ammonium-containing medium with a generation time of 6.8 h, but hardly grew in medium containing 2 mm nitrate; the generation time was 90 h, and the culture showed a yellow color due to reduced pigmentation (Fig. 1B) as described previously (12Maeda S.-i. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Growth of NA3 was improved with increasing concentrations of nitrate, but even at a nitrate concentration of 60 mm, growth was slower than in ammonium-containing medium, with a generation time of 10 h. NA3R cells grew with a generation time of 11 h in medium containing 2 mm nitrate. At ≥6 mm nitrate, growth of NA3R was as fast as in ammonium-containing medium, with a generation time of 7.0-7.3 h (Fig. 1C). The results indicate that NA3R has a higher capacity for utilization of low concentrations of nitrate compared with NA3. Fig. 2 compares the dependence of nitrate uptake rate on nitrate concentration in the medium. Wild-type cells took up nitrate at a rate of 40 μmol/mg of chlorophyll/h in an external nitrate concentration range of 0.1-6 mm, but NA3 cells were unable to take up nitrate in this concentration range as described previously (12Maeda S.-i. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NA3R did not exhibit nitrate uptake at external concentrations of 0.1 mm or lower, but the nitrate uptake rate increased as the external nitrate concentration was raised, reaching a rate of 38 μmol/mg of chlorophyll/h at 6 mm nitrate. The results indicate that a low affinity nitrate transport system is present in NA3R. NA3R was virtually unable to grow on solid medium containing 0.3 mm nitrate, but prolonged incubation of the cells at the low nitrate concentration led to isolation of three independent NA3R derivatives that could grow on 0.3 mm nitrate (designated HAR1, HAR2, and HAR3). The maximum nitrate uptake rates of the HAR mutants were lower than that of the parental NA3R strain, but the mutants showed much higher rates of nitrate uptake compared with NA3R at external nitrate concentrations of 1 mm or lower (Fig. 2), indicating that the affinity of the nitrate transport system for nitrate had been improved in the HAR mutants. Genes Required for the Low Affinity Nitrate Transport Activity of NA3R—For genetic identification of the genes involved in the low affinity nitrate transport of the NA3R strain, we first introduced a PnirA::luxAB fusion into the genome of NA3R to construct a reporter strain (NA3Rlux) and then mutagenized this strain by random tagging. The PnirA promoter is responsive to nitrogen and is most active in nitrate-limited cells (16Maeda S.-i. Kawaguchi Y. Ohe T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When NA3Rlux was grown on 60 mm nitrate, the cells were nitrate-replete, and the luciferase expression level was 0.01 of that observed in the PnirA::luxAB strain constructed from NA3 (data not shown). After random tagging mutagenesis of NA3Rlux, we selected strongly luminescent clones in the presence of 60 mm nitrate to isolate mutants with impaired nitrate assimilation. Of the nine mutants thus isolated, three mutants that showed very strong bioluminescence grew normally on ammonium-containing agar plates, but grew very slowly with significant loss of pigmentation on plates containing 5 mm nitrite or 60 mm nitrate, indicating that they were defective in assimilation of nitrite. These mutants carried the pHSG298 vector inserted at different positions in the nirA gene for nitrite reductase. The other six mutants were similar to NA3 in that they grew normally on ammonium- or nitrite-containing plates, at an appreciable rate on plates containing 60 mm nitrate, and only poorly on plates containing 5 mm nitrate, indicating that they had lost the low affinity nitrate transport activity. In five of the six mutants, pHSG298 was found to replace a 4.5-kilobase pair genomic region carrying the six ORFs from syc2273_c to syc2278_d (Fig. 3A). The other nitrate transport mutant was shown to have pHSG298 inserted between syc1141_c and syc1148_c, replacing the six ORFs from syc1142_c to syc1147_c (Fig. 3B). To identify the genes required for the low affinity nitrate transport activity, we insertion-inactivated each of the 12 ORFs in NA3Rlux. Interruption of syc2277_d, syc2278_d, and syc1147_c (but none of the other ORFs) abolished the ability to grow on plates containing 5 mm nitrate and caused high level expression of the PnirA::luxAB fusion when grown on plates containing 60 mm nitrate (data not shown), indicating that the three genes are essential to the low affinity nitrate transport activity. syc2277_d encodes a response regulator of 121 amino acids that has no effector domain and that belongs to the CheY subfamily of response regulators. syc2278_d encodes a hybrid histidine kinase of 977 amino acids that has a predicted signal peptide at the N terminus, a membrane-spanning region, a histidine kinase domain, and two receiver domains (Fig. 4A). syc1147_c encodes a novel sulfate permease-like protein of 727 amino acids that consists of two domains: an N-terminal “sulfate permease (SulP)” domain of 554 amino acids (NCBI accession number COG0659) and a C-terminal cNMP-binding domain of 115 amino acids (NCBI accession number cd00038) (Fig. 4B). The three ORFs required for low affinity nitrate transport, viz. syc2277_d, syc2278_d, and syc1147_c, were named genes ltnA, ltnB, and ltnT, respectively, where “ltn” stands for latent transport activity for nitrate (LTN).FIGURE 4Structural characteristics of LtnB and LtnT.
