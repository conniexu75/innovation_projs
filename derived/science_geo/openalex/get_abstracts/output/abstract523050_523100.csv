https://openalex.org/W2100473511,"We demonstrate that discrete three-dimensional (3D) DNA components can specifically self-assemble in solution on the basis of shape-complementarity and without base pairing. Using this principle, we produced homo- and heteromultimeric objects, including micrometer-scale one- and two-stranded filaments and lattices, as well as reconfigurable devices, including an actuator, a switchable gear, an unfoldable nanobook, and a nanorobot. These multidomain assemblies were stabilized via short-ranged nucleobase stacking bonds that compete against electrostatic repulsion between the components' interfaces. Using imaging by electron microscopy, ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy, and electrophoretic mobility analysis, we show that the balance between attractive and repulsive interactions, and thus the conformation of the assemblies, may be finely controlled by global parameters such as cation concentration or temperature and by an allosteric mechanism based on strand-displacement reactions."

Paolo et al. present satellite data showing that ice shelves in many regions around the edge of the continent are losing mass. This result increases concern about how fast sea level might rise as climate continues to warm. If warming continues to cause ice shelves to thin, as they have for the past couple of decades, their disappearance may allow land-based ice to collapse and melt. Science , this issue p. 327"

For now, astronomers can only observe dark matter's influence indirectly, such as when watching unseen creatures perturb the surface of a pond. Harvey et al. observed 72 galaxy collisions to compare the resulting centers of mass for the gas and stars (from direct observations) and for the dark matter (by inference). Based on these offsets, dark matter is clearly present. Science , this issue p. 1462"

This is not far from the truth—the neutron is about 0.14% heavier (and less stable) than the proton. The precise value is important, because if the mass difference were bigger or smaller, the world as we know it would likely not exist. Borsanyi et al. calculated the mass difference to high precision using a sophisticated approach that took into account the various forces that exist within a nucleon. The calculations reveal how finely tuned our universe needs to be. Science , this issue p. 1452"

These processes are critically influenced by cell-cell adhesion forces. However, the identity of the proteins that resist and transmit forces at cell-cell junctions remains unclear, and how these proteins control tissue dynamics is largely unknown. Here we provide a systematic study of the interplay between cell-cell adhesion proteins, intercellular forces and epithelial tissue dynamics. We show that collective cellular responses to selective perturbations of the intercellular adhesome conform to three mechanical phenotypes. These phenotypes are controlled by different molecular modules and characterized by distinct relationships between cellular kinematics and intercellular forces. We show that these forces and their rates can be predicted by the concentrations of cadherins and catenins. Unexpectedly, we identified different mechanical roles for P-cadherin and E-cadherin; whereas P-cadherin predicts levels of intercellular force, E-cadherin predicts the rate at which intercellular force builds up."

Such ordered phases appear, for example, in magnetic systems. Schauss et al . simulated these phenomena using a collection of neutral atoms at low temperatures. By shining laser light on the atoms, the authors brought some of them into a high energy state called the Rydberg state. By carefully varying the experimental parameters, they coaxed these Rydberg atoms into patterns reminiscent of crystal lattices in rod- and disk-shaped atomic samples. Science , this issue p. 1455"

Current understanding is that carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by phytoplankton that are eaten, and in turn their predators die and sink into deep water and seafloor sediments. In addition to this route, Omand et al. show that downwelling caused by ocean eddies 1 to 10 km across can deliver much of the carbon produced in spring to the deep sea.

https://openalex.org/W2027797725,"Primitive streak formation in the chick embryo involves large-scale highly coordinated flows of more than 100,000 cells in the epiblast. These large-scale tissue flows and deformations can be correlated with specific anisotropic cell behaviours in the forming mesendoderm through a combination of light-sheet microscopy and computational analysis. Relevant behaviours include apical contraction, elongation along the apical–basal axis followed by ingression, and asynchronous directional cell intercalation of small groups of mesendoderm cells. Cell intercalation is associated with sequential, directional contraction of apical junctions, the onset, localization and direction of which correlate strongly with the appearance of active myosin II cables in aligned apical junctions in neighbouring cells. Use of class specific myosin inhibitors and gene-specific knockdown shows that apical contraction and intercalation are myosin II dependent and also reveal critical roles for myosin I and myosin V family members in the assembly of junctional myosin II cables. Using light-sheet microscopy to image tissue flows, Weijer and colleagues demonstrate that myosin-II-driven changes in cell shape and cell intercalation contribute to primitive streak formation in chick embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2025036673,"In the quest for superconductors with high transition temperatures (T$_\mathrm{c}$s), one emerging motif is that unconventional superconductivity is enhanced by fluctuations of a broken-symmetry phase near a quantum-critical point. While recent experiments have suggested the existence of the requisite broken symmetry phase in the high-T$_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates, the signature of quantum-critical fluctuations in the electronic structure has thus far remained elusive, leaving their importance for high-T$_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in question. We use magnetic fields exceeding 90 tesla to access the underlying metallic state of the cuprate YBa2Cu3O6+$_\delta$ over an unprecedented range of doping, and magnetic quantum oscillations reveal a strong enhancement in the quasiparticle effective mass toward optimal doping. This mass enhancement is a characteristic signature of quantum criticality, and identifies a quantum-critical point at p$_{crit}$ $\approx$ 0.18. This point also represents the juncture of the vanishing pseudogap energy scale and the disappearance of Kerr rotation, the negative Hall coefficient, and the recently observed charge order, suggesting a mechanism of high-T$_\mathrm{c}$ that is strongest when these definitive experimental signatures of the underdoped cuprates converge at a quantum critical point."

The genus Lens consists of seven taxa, however, there are many discrepancies in the taxon and gene pool classification of lentil and its wild relatives. Due to the narrow genetic basis of cultivated lentil, there is a need towards better understanding of the relationships amongst wild germplasm to assist introgression of favourable genes into lentil breeding programs. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is an easy and affordable method that allows multiplexing of up to 384 samples or more per library to generate genome-wide single nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. In this study, we aimed to characterize our lentil germplasm collection using a two-enzyme GBS approach. We constructed two 96-plex GBS libraries with a total of 60 accessions where some accessions had several samples and each sample was sequenced in two technical replicates. We developed an automated GBS pipeline and detected a total of 266,356 genome-wide SNPs. After filtering low quality and redundant SNPs based on haplotype information, we constructed a maximum-likelihood tree using 5,389 SNPs. The phylogenetic tree grouped the germplasm collection into their respective taxa with strong support. Based on phylogenetic tree and STRUCTURE analysis, we identified four gene pools, namely L. culinaris/L. orientalis/L. tomentosus, L. lamottei/L. odemensis, L. ervoides and L. nigricans which form primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary gene pools, respectively. We discovered sequencing bias problems likely due to DNA quality and observed severe run-to-run variation in the wild lentils. We examined the authenticity of the germplasm collection and identified 17% misclassified samples. Our study demonstrated that GBS is a promising and affordable tool for screening by plant breeders interested in crop wild relatives."

Yet, among the American public, there is widespread misunderstanding of this scientific consensus. In this paper, we report results from two experiments, conducted with national samples of American adults, that tested messages designed to convey the high level of agreement in the climate science community about human-caused climate change. The first experiment tested hypotheses about providing numeric versus non-numeric assertions concerning the level of scientific agreement. We found that numeric statements resulted in higher estimates of the scientific agreement. The second experiment tested the effect of eliciting respondents' estimates of scientific agreement prior to presenting them with a statement about the level of scientific agreement. Participants who estimated the level of agreement prior to being shown the corrective statement gave higher estimates of the scientific consensus than respondents who were not asked to estimate in advance, indicating that incorporating an ""estimation and reveal"" technique into public communication about scientific consensus may be effective. The interaction of messages with political ideology was also tested, and demonstrated that messages were approximately equally effective among liberals and conservatives. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."

There is increasing appreciation, however, that astrocytes, which are the major non-neuronal glial cells, may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Unlike neurons, astrocytes are resistant to Aβ cytotoxicity, which may, in part, be related to their greater reliance on glycolytic metabolism. Here we show that, in cultures of human fetal astrocytes, pharmacological inhibition or molecular down-regulation of a main enzymatic regulator of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB3), results in increased accumulation of Aβ within and around astrocytes and greater vulnerability of these cells to Aβ toxicity. We further investigated age-dependent changes in PFKFB3 and astrocytes in AD transgenic mice (TgCRND8) that overexpress human Aβ. Using a combination of Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, we identified an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in astrocytes that paralleled the escalation of the Aβ plaque burden in TgCRND8 mice in an age-dependent manner. Furthermore, PFKFB3 expression also demonstrated an increase in these mice, although at a later age (9 months) than GFAP and Aβ. Immunohistochemical staining showed significant reactive astrogliosis surrounding Aβ plaques with increased PFKFB3 activity in 12-month-old TgCRND8 mice, an age when AD pathology and behavioral deficits are fully manifested. These studies shed light on the unique bioenergetic mechanisms within astrocytes that may contribute to the development of AD pathology.

Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) induced by endosymbiotic Wolbachia can be used to produce functionally sterile males that can be released in the field as a suppression tool against this mosquito. Because the available sexing methods are not efficient enough to avoid unintentional release of a few transinfected females, we assessed the CI pattern in crosses between wPip Wolbachia-transinfected (ARwP) females and wild-type males of Ae. albopictus in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to monitor the titer of the Wolbachia strains that naturally infect Ae. albopictus, that is, wAlbA and wAlbB, in age-controlled males and females. Data were coupled with incompatibility level detected when the above-mentioned males were crossed with ARwP females. Wolbachia infection titer was also monitored in samples of wild caught males. Incompatibility level was positively correlated only with wAlbA density. Crosses between wild-type males having very low wAlbA density (<0.001 wAlbA/actin copy numbers) and ARwP females were partially fertile (CIcorr = 68.06 ± 6.20). Individuals with low wAlbA titer were frequently found among sampled wild males (30%–50% depending on the site and period). ARwP males can be as considered as a very promising tool for suppressing Ae. albopictus. However, crosses between wild males having low wAlbA density and ARwP females may be partially fertile. In the case of local establishment of the transinfected mosquito line, this occurrence may favor the replacement of the wild-type mosquitoes with the ARwP line, thus reducing the long-term efficacy of incompatible insect technique. Various alternative strategies have been discussed to prevent this risk and to exploit Wolbachia as a tool to control Ae. albopictus."

Nurr1 is also expressed in astrocytes and microglia where it functions to mitigate the release of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic factors. Given that Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis has been linked to both loss of Nurr1 expression in the SNpc and inflammation, increasing levels of Nurr1 maybe a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study a novel Nurr1 agonist, SA00025, was tested for both its efficiency to induce the transcription of dopaminergic target genes in vivo and prevent dopaminergic neuron degeneration in an inflammation exacerbated 6-OHDA-lesion model of PD. SA00025 (30mg/kg p.o.) entered the brain and modulated the expression of the dopaminergic phenotype genes TH, VMAT, DAT, AADC and the GDNF receptor gene c-Ret in the SN of naive rats. Daily gavage treatment with SA00025 (30mg/kg) for 32 days also induced partial neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in rats administered a priming injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) and subsequent injection of 6-OHDA. The neuroprotective effects of SA00025 in this dopamine neuron degeneration model were associated with changes in microglial morphology indicative of a resting state and a decrease in microglial specific IBA-1 staining intensity in the SNpc. Astrocyte specific GFAP staining intensity and IL-6 levels were also reduced. We conclude that Nurr1 agonist treatment causes neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in an inflammation exacerbated 6-OHDA lesion model of PD."

This defect can be recapitulated in vitro by challenging dopaminergic cells with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a neurotoxin that inhibits complex I of electron transport chain. Consequently, oxidative phosphorylation is blocked, and cells become dependent on glycolysis for ATP production. Therefore, increasing the rate of glycolysis might help cells to produce more ATP to meet their energy demands. In the present study, we show that microRNA-7, a non-coding RNA that protects dopaminergic neuronal cells against MPP+-induced cell death, promotes glycolysis in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y and differentiated human neural progenitor ReNcell VM cells, as evidenced by increased ATP production, glucose consumption, and lactic acid production. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that targeted repression of RelA by microRNA-7, as well as subsequent increase in the neuronal glucose transporter 3 (Glut3), underlies this glycolysis-promoting effect. Consistently, silencing Glut3 expression diminishes the protective effect of microRNA-7 against MPP+. Further, microRNA-7 fails to prevent MPP+-induced cell death when SH-SY5Y cells are cultured in a low glucose medium, as well as when differentiated ReNcell VM cells or primary mouse neurons are treated with the hexokinase inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, indicating that a functional glycolytic pathway is required for this protective effect.

In this study, we collected adipose tissues obtained from the perirenal regions of adult patients with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) or non-functioning adrenal tumors (NF). We demonstrated that perirenal brown adipocytes were activated in adult patients with PHEO. These cells had the molecular characteristics of classical brown fat rather than those of beige/brite fat.

https://openalex.org/W2012662077,"We herein describe a novel procedure for dentin regeneration that mimics the biological processes of tooth development in nature. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is an important regulator of the Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) expression. Our approach mimics the biological processes underlying tooth development in nature and focuses on the activation of canonical Wnt signaling to trigger the natural process of dentinogenesis. The coronal portion of the dentin and the underlying pulp was removed from the first molars. We applied lithium chloride (LiCl), an activator of canonical Wnt signaling, on the amputated pulp surface to achieve transdifferentiation toward odontoblasts from the surrounding pulpal cells. MicroCT and microscopic analyses demonstrated that the topical application of LiCl induced dentin repair, including the formation of a complete dentin bridge. LiCl-induced dentin is a tubular dentin in which the pulp cells are not embedded within the matrix, as in primary dentin. In contrast, a dentin bridge was not induced in the control group treated with pulp capping with material carriers alone, although osteodentin without tubular formation was induced at a comparatively deeper position from the pulp exposure site. We also evaluated the influence of LiCl on differentiation toward odontoblasts in vitro. In the mDP odontoblast cell line, LiCl activated the mRNA expression of Dspp, Axin2 and Kallikrein 4 (Klk4) and downregulated the Osteopontin (Osp) expression. These results provide a scientific basis for the biomimetic regeneration of dentin using LiCl as a new capping material to activate dentine regeneration."

CD2F1 mice were exposed to 0 (control) or 7–12.5 Gy total-body gamma-radiation, and CD34+ cells were irradiated with 0, 2 or 4 Gy of radiation. Single doses of DT3 (75 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection for mice or 2 μM for CD34+ cell culture) were administrated 24 h before irradiation and animal survival was monitored for 30 days. Mouse bone marrow (BM), jejunum, kidney, liver and serum as well as CD34+ cells were collected at 1, 4, 8, 24, 48 or 72 h after irradiation to determine apoptotic markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, miR-30, and stress response protein expression. Our results showed that radiation-induced IL-1β release and cell damage are pathological states that lead to an early expression and secretion of miR-30b and miR-30c in mouse tissues and serum and in human CD34+ cells. DT3 suppressed IL-1β and miR-30 expression, protected against radiation-induced apoptosis in mouse and human cells, and increased survival of irradiated mice. Furthermore, an anti-IL-1β antibody downregulated radiation-induced NFκBp65 phosphorylation, inhibited miR-30 expression and protected CD34+ cells from radiation exposure. Knockdown of NFκBp65 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly suppressed radiation-induced miR-30 expression in CD34+ cells. Our data suggest that DT3 protects human and mouse cells from radiation damage may through suppression of IL-1β-induced NFκB/miR-30 signaling."

Reflectance in near infrared (NIR) regions was significantly correlated with disease index at GS 10.5.3, 10.5.4, and 11.1 at two plant densities in both seasons. For the two plant densities, the area of the red edge peak (Σdr680–760 nm), difference vegetation index (DVI), and triangular vegetation index (TVI) were significantly correlated negatively with disease index at three GSs in two seasons. Compared with other parameters Σdr680–760 nm was the most sensitive parameter for detecting powdery mildew. Linear regression models relating mildew severity to Σdr680–760 nm were constructed at three GSs in two seasons for the two plant densities, demonstrating no significant difference in the slope estimates between the two plant densities at three GSs. Σdr680–760 nm was correlated with grain yield at three GSs in two seasons. The accuracies of partial least square regression (PLSR) models were consistently higher than those of models based on Σdr680760 nm for disease index and grain yield. PLSR can, therefore, provide more accurate estimation of disease index of wheat powdery mildew and grain yield using canopy reflectance."

https://openalex.org/W2070991529,"Hybridization in natural populations provides an opportunity to study the evolutionary processes that shape divergence and genetic isolation of species. The emergence of pre-mating barriers is often the precursor to complete reproductive isolation. However, in recently diverged species, pre-mating barriers may be incomplete, leading to hybridization between seemingly distinct taxa. Here we report results of a long-term study at Bird Island, South Georgia, of the extent of hybridization, mate fidelity, timing of breeding and breeding success in mixed and conspecific pairs of the sibling species, Macronectes halli (northern giant petrel) and M. giganteus (southern giant petrel). The proportion of mixed-species pairs varied annually from 0.4–2.4% (mean of 1.5%), and showed no linear trend with time. Mean laying date in mixed-species pairs tended to be later than in northern giant petrel, and always earlier than in southern giant petrel pairs, and their breeding success (15.6%) was lower than that of conspecific pairs. By comparison, mixed-species pairs at both Marion and Macquarie islands always failed before hatching. Histories of birds in mixed-species pairs at Bird Island were variable; some bred previously or subsequently with a conspecific partner, others subsequently with a different allospecific partner, and some mixed-species pairs remained together for multiple seasons. We also report the first verified back-crossing of a hybrid giant petrel with a female northern giant petrel. We discuss the potential causes and evolutionary consequences of hybridization and back-crossing in giant petrels and summarize the incidence of back-crossing in other seabird species."

TAK-063 at 10 µM did not show more than 50% inhibition or stimulation of 91 enzymes or receptors except for PDEs. In vitro autoradiography (ARG) studies using rat brain sections revealed that [3H]TAK-063 selectively accumulated in the caudate putamen (CPu), nucleus accumbens (NAc), globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and striatonigral projection, where PDE10A is highly expressed. This [3H]TAK-063 accumulation was almost entirely blocked by an excess amount of MP-10, a PDE10A selective inhibitor, and the accumulation was not observed in brain slices of Pde10a-knockout mice. In rat brain sections, [3H]TAK-063 bound to a single high-affinity site with mean ± SEM dissociation constants of 7.2 ± 1.2 and 2.6 ± 0.5 nM for the CPu and NAc shell, respectively. Orally administered [14C]TAK-063 selectively accumulated in PDE10A expressing brain regions in an in vivo ARG study in rats. Striatal PDE10A occupancy by TAK-063 in vivo was measured using T-773 as a tracer and a dose of 0.88 mg/kg (p.o.) was calculated to produce 50% occupancy in rats. Translational studies with TAK-063 and other PDE10A inhibitors such as those presented here will help us better understand the pharmacological profile of this class of potential central nervous system drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2010307819,"Background The preservation of microRNAs in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue makes them particularly useful for biomarker studies. The utility of small RNA sequencing for microRNA expression profiling of FFPE samples has yet to be determined. Methods Total RNA was extracted from de-paraffinized and proteinase K-treated FFPE specimens (15–20 years old) of 8 human lung adenocarcinoma tumors by affinity chromatography on silica columns. MicroRNAs in the RNA preparations were quantified by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform with sequencing libraries prepared with the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (version 2.0) to obtain unpaired reads of 50 b for small RNA fragments. MicroRNAs were also quantified using Agilent Human miRNA (release 16.0) microarrays that can detect 1,205 mature microRNAs and by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results Between 9.1–16.9 million reads were obtained by small RNA sequencing of extracted RNA samples. Of these, only 0.6–2.3% (mean = 1.5%) represented microRNAs. The sequencing method detected 454–625 microRNAs/sample (mean = 550) compared with 200–349 (mean = 286) microRNAs detected by microarray. In Spearman correlation analyses, the average correlation coefficient for the 126 microRNAs detected in all samples by both methods was 0.37, and >0.5 for 63 microRNAs. In correlation analyses of the sequencing- and RT-PCR-based measurements, the coefficients were 0.19–0.95 (mean = 0.73) and >0.7, respectively, for 7 of 9 examined microRNAs. The average inter-replicate Spearman correlation coefficient for the sequencing method was 0.81. Conclusions Small RNA sequencing can be used to obtain microRNA profiles of FFPE tissue specimens with performance characteristics similar to those of microarrays, in spite of the fragmentation of ribosomal and messenger RNAs that reduces the method's informative capacity. The accuracy of the method can conceivably be improved by increasing sequencing depth and/or depleting FFPE tissue RNAs of ribosomal RNA fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2079825550,"The genomics of economically important marine bivalves is studied to provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their different reproductive strategies. The recently available gonad transcriptome of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera is a novel and powerful resource to study these mechanisms in marine mollusks displaying hermaphroditic features. In this study, RNAseq quantification data of the P. margaritifera gonad transcriptome were analyzed to identify candidate genes in histologically-characterized gonad samples to provide molecular signatures of the female and male sexual pathway in this pearl oyster. Based on the RNAseq data set, stringent expression analysis identified 1,937 contigs that were differentially expressed between the gonad histological categories. From the hierarchical clustering analysis, a new reproduction model is proposed, based on a dual histo-molecular analytical approach. Nine candidate genes were identified as markers of the sexual pathway: 7 for the female pathway and 2 for the male one. Their mRNA levels were assayed by real-time PCR on a new set of gonadic samples. A clustering method revealed four principal expression patterns based on the relative gene expression ratio. A multivariate regression tree realized on these new samples and validated on the previously analyzed RNAseq samples showed that the sexual pathway of P. margaritifera can be predicted by a 3-gene-pair expression ratio model of 4 different genes: pmarg-43476, pmarg-foxl2, pmarg-54338 and pmarg-fem1-like. This 3-gene-pair expression ratio model strongly suggests only the implication of pmarg-foxl2 and pmarg-fem1-like in the sex inversion of P. margaritifera. This work provides the first histo-molecular model of P. margaritifera reproduction and a gene expression signature of its sexual pathway discriminating the male and female pathways. These represent useful tools for understanding and studying sex inversion, sex differentiation and sex determinism in this species and other related species for aquaculture purposes such as genetic selection programs."
https://openalex.org/W2013109235,"Objective To compare plans using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with conventional sliding window intensity-modulated radiation therapy (c-IMRT) to treat upper thoracic esophageal cancer (EC). Methods CT datasets of 11 patients with upper thoracic EC were identified. Four plans were generated for each patient: c-IMRT with 5 fields (5F) and VMAT with a single arc (1A), two arcs (2A), or three arcs (3A). The prescribed doses were 64 Gy/32 F for the primary tumor (PTV64). The dose-volume histogram data, the number of monitoring units (MUs) and the treatment time (TT) for the different plans were compared. Results All of the plans generated similar dose distributions for PTVs and organs at risk (OARs), except that the 2A- and 3A-VMAT plans yielded a significantly higher conformity index (CI) than the c-IMRT plan. The CI of the PTV64 was improved by increasing the number of arcs in the VMAT plans. The maximum spinal cord dose and the planning risk volume of the spinal cord dose for the two techniques were similar. The 2A- and 3A-VMAT plans yielded lower mean lung doses and heart V50 values than the c-IMRT. The V20 and V30 for the lungs in all of the VMAT plans were lower than those in the c-IMRT plan, at the expense of increasing V5, V10 and V13. The VMAT plan resulted in significant reductions in MUs and TT. Conclusion The 2A-VMAT plan appeared to spare the lungs from moderate-dose irradiation most effectively of all plans, at the expense of increasing the low-dose irradiation volume, and also significantly reduced the number of required MUs and the TT. The CI of the PTVs and the OARs was improved by increasing the arc-number from 1 to 2; however, no significant improvement was observed using the 3A-VMAT, except for an increase in the TT."
https://openalex.org/W2066215028,"Human rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and children under the age of 5 years in both developed and developing countries. Human lactadherin, a milk fat globule membrane glycoprotein, inhibits human rotavirus infection in vitro, whereas bovine lactadherin is not active. Moreover, it protects breastfed infants against symptomatic rotavirus infections. To explore the potential antiviral activity of lactadherin sourced by equines, we undertook a proteomic analysis of milk fat globule membrane proteins from donkey milk and elucidated its amino acid sequence. Alignment of the human, bovine, and donkey lactadherin sequences revealed the presence of an Asp-Gly-Glu (DGE) α2β1 integrin-binding motif in the N-terminal domain of donkey sequence only. Because integrin α2β1 plays a critical role during early steps of rotavirus host cell adhesion, we tested a minilibrary of donkey lactadherin-derived peptides containing DGE sequence for anti-rotavirus activity. A 20-amino acid peptide containing both DGE and RGD motifs (named pDGE-RGD) showed the greatest activity, and its mechanism of antiviral action was characterized; pDGE-RGD binds to integrin α2β1 by means of the DGE motif and inhibits rotavirus attachment to the cell surface. These findings suggest the potential anti-rotavirus activity of equine lactadherin and support the feasibility of developing an anti-rotavirus peptide that acts by hindering virus-receptor binding."

Woodgett J.R. GSK-3: tricks of the trade for a multi-tasking kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In addition, GSK-3β is known to be involved in diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (14.Luo J. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in tumorigenesis and cancer chemotherapy.Cancer Lett. 2009; 273: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysregulation of GSK-3β has also been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (14.Luo J. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in tumorigenesis and cancer chemotherapy.Cancer Lett. 2009; 273: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In recent studies, the role of GSK-3 as a regulator of immune responses, including activation and differentiation of DCs and endotoxemia, has been reported (15.Martin M. Rehani K. Jope R.S.

Also, GSK-3-mediated regulation of Stat3 in primary astrocytes of the cerebral cortex was demonstrated (18.Beurel E. Jope R.S. Differential regulation of STAT family members by glycogen synthase kinase-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21934-21944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, we defined the role and regulatory mechanism of GSK-3β in Stat-mediated IDO expression. Using a DC-based tumor vaccination murine model, we examined the substantial role of GSK-3β involved in IDO expression via the JAK1/2-Stat signaling cascade in DCs, representative cells of initiating the immune response and mediating T-cell proliferation and CTL responses against EG7 thymoma. Eight- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6 (H-2Kb and I-Ab) mice were purchased from the Korean Institute of Chemistry Technology (Daejeon, Korea). C57BL/6 OT-I T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic and IDO−/− mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment within our animal facility and used in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal care. All experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines of the committee of Ethics of Animal Experiments, Konkuk University. The EG7 cell line, an ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing EL4 variant, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm l-glutamine (all purchased from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. GSK-3β+/+ and GSK-3β−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (19.Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Requirement for glycogen synthase kinase-3β in cell survival and NF-κB activation.Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. J. R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada), and GSK-3β+/+, GSK-3β−/− MEFs were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Recombinant mouse (rm) granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), rm interleukin 4 (rm IL-4), and rm INF-γ were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); rottlerin was from Calbiochem. SB415286, a GSK-3β-specific inhibitor, was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC) or phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Abs) that were used to detect the expression of CD11c (HL3), CD4, and CD8 (Lyt-2) were purchased from Pharmingen. The antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follow: anti-phospho-Stat3 (Ser-727), anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9), anti-Stat3, anti-Stat1, anti-JAK1, anti-JAK2, anti-phospho-JAK1, and anti-phospho-JAK2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti-mouse IDO (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego); anti-tubulin, anti-GSK-3β, anti-β-catenin, anti-phospho-PKCδ, anti-PKCδ, anti-phospho-Stat1, and anti-IRF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To knock down GSK-3β, BMDCs were transfected with the four sequence pools (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, LU-001080-00-0020, mouse GSK-3β, NM_019827 (Dharmacon Lafayette, CO)) using the DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, BMDCs were seeded in 12-well plates at 80–90% confluence; the medium was replaced with complete RPMI 1640 medium without antibiotics before transfection. DharmaFECT 1 and siRNA products were incubated separately in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at room temperature for 5 min. Mixtures were combined, incubated for another 20 min, and added to the cells at the final concentration of 2 μl/ml DharmaFECT 1 and 25 nm siRNAs. For IFN-γ stimulation, siRNA and the transfection reagent were removed 24 h post-transfection, and the complete culture medium was added. Briefly, bone marrow was flushed from the tibiae and femurs of 6–8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice and depleted of red blood cells (RBCs) using a red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma). The cells were then plated in 6-well culture plates (1 × 106 cells/ml; 2 ml per well) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 20 ng/ml rmGM-CSF, and 10 ng/ml rmIL-4 at 37 °C in 5% CO2. On days 3 and 5, the floating cells were gently removed from the cultures, and fresh medium was added. On day 6 of culture, nonadherent cells and loosely adherent proliferating dendritic cell aggregates were harvested and re-plated in 60-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells/ml; 5 ml/dish) for stimulation and analysis. On day 7, 80% or more of the nonadherent cells expressed CD11c. In certain experiments, the DCs were labeled with bead-conjugated anti-CD11c mAb (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany) and then subjected to positive selection through paramagnetic columns (LS columns; Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's instructions, to obtain highly purified populations for subsequent analysis. The purity of the selected cell fraction was >90%. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and were incubated with IDO antibody purchased from Alexis. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. All images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (AX10; Carl Zeiss, Germany). The results are representative of three independent experiments. In brief, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in a washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). In brief, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20.Noh K.T. Cho S.G. Choi E.J. Knockdown of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 modulates basal glycogen synthase kinase-3β kinase activity and regulates cell migration.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4097-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the lysates were subjected to 10 min of microcentrifugation at 12,000 × g. The soluble fraction was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies, after which the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed via immunoblotting. Transgenic OVA-specific CD8+ T-cells or CD4+ T-cells were purified from bulk splenocytes via negative selection by using CD4+ T cell isolation kit and CD8+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The purity of the obtained cell population was assessed to be >93% by flow cytometry after staining with a Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8 Ab. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 5 μm carboxyfluroscein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and shaken for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were washed once in pure FBS and twice in PBS with 10% FBS. Immature DCs, OVA-pulsed DCs, OVA-pulsed and IFN-γ-treated DCs, or OVA-pulsed IFN-γ and GSK-3β inhibitor-treated DCs were cultured with CFSE-labeled splenocytes of OT-I T-cell receptor transgenic mice (1 × 106 per well) for 96 h. After 4 days, the cells were harvested and stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD8 Ab (to gate OT-I T-cells) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of IFN-γ were measured, using an ELISA kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the effect of IFN-γ and GSK-3β on OVA-specific CTLs, cytotoxicity assays were performed. In mixed cultures, immature DCs, OVA-pulsed DCs, OVA-pulsed and IFN-γ-treated DCs, or OVA-pulsed IFN-γ and GSK-3β inhibitor-treated DCs were first cultured with splenocytes of OT-I TCR transgenic mice (1 × 106 per well) for 72 h and then co-cultured with EL4 (1 × 106 cells stained with 1 μm CFSE) or EG7 cells (1 × 106 cells stained with 10 μm CFSE). After 4 h, the mixed lymphocyte tumor cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mice were intraperitoneally injected once a week for 3 weeks with immature DCs, OVA-pulsed DCs, OVA-pulsed and IFN-γ-treated DCs, or OVA-pulsed IFN-γ and GSK-3β inhibitor-treated DCs, followed by subcutaneous injection of EG7 thymoma cells (1 × 106) into the right lower back. The tumor size was measured every 4 days, and the tumor mass was calculated as follows: V = (2A × B)/2, where A is the length of the short axis, and B is the length of the long axis. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and consistent results were obtained. Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to compare experimental groups with control values, whereas comparisons between multiple groups were made using Tukey's multiple comparison tests (Prism 3.0 GraphPad software). p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In a previous study, it was revealed that a GSK-3 inhibitor disturbs the activation of Stat3 by blocking the interaction between IFN-γ and Stat3 in primary astrocytes (18.Beurel E. Jope R.S. Differential regulation of STAT family members by glycogen synthase kinase-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21934-21944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the physiological meaning of a GSK-3 inhibitor-mediated reduction of Stat activity in IFN-γ-stimulated conditions was not defined. Here, we illuminate the precise regulatory mechanism of GSK-3β by examining the influence of a GSK-3β inhibitor on the JAK1/2-Stat signaling axis and PKCδ on the IFN-γ-induced expression of IDO, an immunoregulatory enzyme in DCs. Moreover, by using DC-mediated immune enhancement via T-cell proliferation and a DC-vaccinated murine EG7 thymoma model system, we investigated the physiological role of the GSK-3β inhibition-mediated reduction of IDO via Stat in IFN-γ-treated conditions. Consistent with a previous study (18.Beurel E. Jope R.S. Differential regulation of STAT family members by glycogen synthase kinase-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21934-21944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), IFN-γ provokes the activation of GSK-3β in BMDCs (Fig. 1A). In addition, in IFN-γ-treated conditions, GSK-3β inhibition blocked the activation of Stat3 (Fig. 1B). However, the activity of JAK1 and JAK2, upstream kinases of Stat3, did not change (Fig. 1B, left panel). Therefore, we inferred that a GSK-3β inhibitor (SB415286) prohibits the JAK1/2-Stat signaling cascade by inhibiting Stat3. In addition, the IFN-γ-mediated expressions of IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a downstream transcription factor of Stat3, and IDO were also inhibited (Fig. 1B, right panel). As shown in Fig. 1C, using an immunofluorescence assay, we confirmed that IFN-γ-induced expression of IDO is reduced by adding a GSK-3β inhibitor. Those results indicate that GSK-3β modulates the expression of IDO, a crucial immunoregulatory protein, by regulating Stat3 in the IFN-γ signaling cascade. In a previous report, we revealed that PKCδ-dependent Stat regulation was critical for IDO expression in IFN-γ-treated BMDCs (12.Jeong Y.I. Kim S.W. Jung I.D. Lee J.S. Chang J.H. Lee C.M. Chun S.H. Yoon M.S. Kim G.T. Ryu S.W. Kim J.S. Shin Y.K. Lee W.S. Shin H.K. Lee J.D. Park Y.M. Curcumin suppresses the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by blocking the Janus-activated kinase-protein kinase Cδ-STAT1 signaling pathway in interferon-γ-stimulated murine dendritic cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3700-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether or not GSK-3β inhibition-mediated regulation of Stat3 and IDO was via PKCδ. As shown in Fig. 2A, IFN-γ-induced activation of PKCδ was blocked by a GSK-3β inhibitor in BMDCs. Using GSK-3β−/− MEFs, we confirmed that GSK-3β is crucial for PKCδ activity (Fig, 2A, right). Next, we investigated whether or not GSK-3β inhibition-mediated suppression of Stat3 and IDO is independent on PKCδ using rottlerin (PKCδ inhibitor). Here, we found that a GSK-3β inhibitor partially inhibits Stat3 activity and IDO expression in the presence of rottlerin (Fig. 2B). Previously, we found that Stat1 activity is modulated by inhibiting protein kinase Cδ activation in BMDCs (12.Jeong Y.I. Kim S.W. Jung I.D. Lee J.S. Chang J.H. Lee C.M. Chun S.H. Yoon M.S. Kim G.T. Ryu S.W. Kim J.S. Shin Y.K. Lee W.S. Shin H.K. Lee J.D. Park Y.M. Curcumin suppresses the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by blocking the Janus-activated kinase-protein kinase Cδ-STAT1 signaling pathway in interferon-γ-stimulated murine dendritic cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3700-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined whether GSK-3β activity influences Stat1 activity in IFN-γ-stimulated conditions. Here, we found that GSK-3β inhibition suppressed the activity of Stat1 in a PKCδ-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Thus, we concluded that GSK-3β inhibition-mediated regulation of Stat and IDO occurs via PKCδ-dependent or -independent pathways in IFN-γ-treated BMDCs. Next, we examined the PKCδ-independent negative regulation mechanism of Stat3 by GSK-3β inhibition. Thus, we investigated the effect of a GSK-3β inhibitor on the interaction between JAK1/2, upstream kinases of Stat3 and Stat3. We found that IFN-γ-induced interaction of both proteins was blocked by GSK-3β inhibition (Fig. 3A). Using GSK-3β−/− MEFs, we confirmed that GSK-3β contributes to the interaction between Stat3 and JAK1/2 in IFN-γ-treated BMDCs (Fig. 3B). From that data, we found that GSK-3β functions as a positive regulator of IFN-γ-mediated interaction between Stat3 and JAK1/2. Because of the fact that we found that GSK-3β regulates the expressions of IDO and IRF1 by modulating Stat in IFN-γ-treated BMDCs, we confirmed the phenomenon using GSK-3β−/− MEFs. Consistent with data in dendritic cells, GSK-3β abolition did not influence the activity of JAK1 and JAK2, upstream kinases of Stat in an IFN-γ-stimulated condition. Instead, it blocked the activation of Stat1 and Stat3 (Fig. 4A). In addition, IFN-γ-mediated expression of IRF-1, a downstream transcription factor of Stat, and IDO were also inhibited (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we confirmed that the activation of Stat1 and Stat3 and the expression of IDO were also inhibited by the silencing of GSK-3β expression (Fig. 4C). From that data, we confirmed that GSK-3β modulates the expression of IDO by regulating Stat in IFN-γ-stimulated conditions. To determine whether or not IFN-γ-induced IDO expression via GSK-3β activity in DCs affects T-cell proliferation, we performed a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay using CD8+ T-cells of OT-I TCR transgenic mice, which express a TCR specific for the MHC class I-restricted OVA peptide 257–264 antigen (OVA(257–264)) in DCs (21.Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Heath W.R. Howard J.L. Bevan M.J. Carbone F.R. T-cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection.Cell. 1994; 76: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). The proliferation of CFSE-labeled OVA-specific CD8+ T-cells co-cultured with DCs pulsed with OVA(257–264) was significantly higher than that of T-cells co-cultured with unpulsed DCs (Fig. 5A, upper panel). In addition, the enhanced CD8+ T-cell proliferation by DCs pulsed with OVA peptide was dramatically inhibited by treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Furthermore, IFN-γ-mediated suppressed CD8+ T-cell proliferation was restored by the treatment of a GSK-3β inhibitor (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Next, to examine whether or not IFN-γ-mediated suppression of CD8+ T-cell proliferation is due to IDO regulated by GSK-3β, we performed an MLR assay using IDO−/− dendritic cells. In that experiment, OVA-pulsed DC-induced CD8+ T-cell proliferation was not suppressed by IFN-γ in the absence of IDO (Fig. 5A, lower panel). We then investigated IFN-γ production in the abovementioned MLR conditions. A higher level of IFN-γ was produced by syngeneic T-cells primed with OVA peptide-pulsed DC reduced by IFN-γ (IDO inducer)-treated DC (Fig. 5B). By using GSK-3β-inhibited DC, IFN-γ-treated DC-mediated attenuation of OVA-pulsed DC-mediated IFN-γ production in T-cells was restored (Fig. 5B). To examine whether the attenuation of OVA-pulsed DC-mediated IFN-γ production in T-cells by IFN-γ-treated DC is due to IDO, we checked the level of IFN-γ in an MLR assay using IDO−/− dendritic cells. Here, the reduced level of OVA-pulsed DC-mediated IFN-γ production in T-cells by IFN-γ-treated DC was not restored (Fig. 5B). From these results, we inferred that IFN-γ-induced IDO expression via GSK-3β activity in DCs modulates CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Next, we investigated the cytotoxic T-cell responses of CD8+ T-cells generated by OVA-pulsed DCs. OVA-pulsed DCs reduced the population of CSFE-stained OVA-expressing EG7 tumor cells compared with nonpulsed DCs, and the reduced OVA-expressing EG7 tumor cells were restored by IFN-γ-treated and OVA-pulsed DCs (Fig. 6, upper panel). Furthermore, the restored CTL activity by IFN-γ was abolished by GSK-3β inhibition (Fig. 6, upper panel). However, DC-mediated modulation of CTL responses did not affect non-OVA-expressing EL4 tumor cells (Fig. 6, upper panel). In addition, by IFN-γ-treated and OVA-pulsed DCs or IFN-γ + SB415286-treated and OVA-pulsed DCs, the modulation of OVA-pulsed DC-mediated CTL activity against OVA-expressing EG7 tumor cells was not observed in the absence of IDO (Fig. 6, lower panel). From that data, we concluded that OVA-specific CTL activity was consistent with the previous CD8+ T-cell proliferation data. Next, we assessed that IFN-γ-induced IDO expression via GSK-3β in DCs is crucial for cell-based anti-tumor activity using an EG7 lymphoma model. To determine the anti-tumor potential of immunization with OVA-treated DCs, mice were intraperitoneally injected once a week for 3 weeks with immature DCs, OVA-pulsed DCs, OVA-pulsed IFN-γ-treated DCs, or OVA-pulsed IFN-γ and GSK-3β inhibitor-treated DCs (1 × 105), followed by subcutaneous injection of EG7 thymoma cells (1 × 106) into the right lower back. Injection of DCs pulsed with OVA(257–264) significantly reduced the size of the OVA-expressing EG7 tumors compared with tumors in mice receiving DCs that had not been pulsed with OVA (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, EG7 tumors in mice that received IFN-γ-treated DCs pulsed with OVA were larger than those in mice that received DCs pulsed with OVA (Fig. 7A). In the group of IFN-γ and GSK-3β inhibitor-treated DCs pulsed with OVA, the attenuated anti-tumor activity was restored (Fig. 7A). Consistent with that finding, the group of mice injected with OVA-pulsed DCs showed prolongation of survival compared with mice injected with OVA-pulsed IFN-γ-treated DCs (Fig. 7B). The group of mice injected with IFN-γ and GSK-3β inhibitor-treated DCs pulsed with OVA had an enhanced survival score compared with mice injected with IFN-γ-treated DCs pulsed with OVA (Fig. 7B). From those results, we concluded that IFN-γ-mediated IDO regulation via GSK-3β activity plays a role in dendritic cell-based vaccination against EG7 thymoma tumor. It was revealed that GSK-3 is deeply involved in the JAK1/2-Stat signaling cascade (18.Beurel E. Jope R.S. Differential regulation of STAT family members by glycogen synthase kinase-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21934-21944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22.Lin C.F. Tsai C.C. Huang W.C. Wang C.Y. Tseng H.C. Wang Y. Kai J.I. Wang S.W. Cheng Y.L.

However, the physiological meaning of GSK-3-mediated regulation of JAK1/2-Stat signaling has not been defined. Previously, we showed that that PKCδ-dependent Stat regulation is critical for IDO expression in IFN-γ-treated BMDCs (12.Jeong Y.I. Kim S.W. Jung I.D. Lee J.S. Chang J.H. Lee C.M. Chun S.H. Yoon M.S. Kim G.T. Ryu S.W. Kim J.S. Shin Y.K. Lee W.S. Shin H.K. Lee J.D. Park Y.M. Curcumin suppresses the induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by blocking the Janus-activated kinase-protein kinase Cδ-STAT1 signaling pathway in interferon-γ-stimulated murine dendritic cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3700-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on the physiological role of GSK-3β-mediated regulation of JAK1/2-Stat signaling in the immunomodulatory function of IDO, an immunoregulatory enzyme. Here, we illuminate the precise regulatory mechanism of GSK-3β by examining the influence of a GSK-3β inhibitor on the JAK1/2-Stat signaling axis and PKCδ on IFN-γ-induced expression of IDO, an immunoregulatory enzyme in DCs. IDO is an essential enzyme that degrades the amino acid tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway (1.Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. IDO expression by dendritic cells: tolerance and tryptophan catabolism.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 3.Löb S. Königsrainer A. Rammensee H.G. Opelz G. Terness P. Inhibitors of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase for cancer therapy: can we see the wood for the trees?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It has been reported that IDO is functionally expressed in various immune cells such as DCs and macrophages. It has been shown to also play a role in the immune response as a crucial modulator of tumor-mediated immune tolerance by causing T-cell suppression (1.Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. IDO expression by dendritic cells: tolerance and tryptophan catabolism.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 23.Muller A.J. Prendergast G.C.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tumor-induced tolerance.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Based on the function of IDO as a crucial mediator of immune tolerance, we further examined the idea that the DC-based immune response mediated by IFN-γ-induced IDO expression via GSK-3β activity influences CD8+ T-cell proliferation, cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, and OVA-pulsed DC vaccination against EG7 thymoma. DCs function as crucial regulatory cells in the innate and adaptive immune response; therefore, DC-based immunotherapy via the enhancement of host immunogenicity could be a crucial strategy to prevent immune rejection, a major problem in cancer therapy (25.Ferrantini M. Capone I. Belardelli F. Dendritic cells and cytokines in immune rejection of cancer.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2008; 19: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26.Liu Y.J. Dendritic cell subsets and lineages, and their functions in innate and adaptive immunity.Cell. 2001; 106: 259-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Because of those advantages, anti-tumor immune responses via DC-based vaccination have been utilized in tumor therapy, and vaccination has been studied with regard to the above-mentioned DC functions. Tumor peptide-loaded DCs effectively lead a CTL response in the tumor environment, thereby rendering tumor cell lysis by CTLs. In this study, we applied our finding, the regulation of IFN-γ-induced IDO expression via GSK-3β activity, to DC-based cancer vaccination. We found that the regulation of IDO levels by GSK-3β activity is a determinant for the efficiency of cell-based cancer vaccination using DCs. Through various experiments, we clarified that GSK-3β activity is crucial for IFN-γ-induced IDO expression in various cells, and we defined that the regulation of DC function by GSK-3β-dependent IDO regulation is important for CD8+ T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. Thus, we concluded that GSK-3β activity plays an important role in the immune enhancement-mediated anti-tumor response via IDO regulation. Further studies are needed to define the pivotal role of the regulation of IDO via GSK-3β in various disease models such as graft-versus-host disease and clinical immune imbalances, including asthma and autoimmune diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2038781268,"Background Treatment with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved survival in many cancers, yet has been associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Warnings of cardiovascular events are common in drug labels of many TKIs. Despite these warnings, cardiovascular toxicity of patients treated with TKIs remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes of advanced cancer patients treated with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Methods A population based cohort study was undertaken involving adults aged >18 years in Ontario, Canada, diagnosed with any advanced malignancy between 2006 and 2012. Data were extracted from linked administrative governmental databases. Adults with advanced cancer receiving TKIs were identified and followed throughout the time period. The main outcomes of interest were rates of hospitalization for ischemic heart disease (acute myocardial infarction and angina) or cerebrovascular accidents and death. Results 1642 patients with a mean age of 62.5 years were studied; 1046 were treated with erlotinib, 166 with sorafenib and 430 with sunitinib. Over the 380 day median follow-up period (range 6-1970 days), 1.1% of all patients had ischemic heart events, 0.7% had cerebrovascular accidents and 72.1% died. Rates of cardiovascular events were similar to age and gender-matched individuals without cancer. In a subgroup analysis of treatment patients with a prior history of ischemic heart disease, 3.3% had ischemic heart events while 1.2% had cerebrovascular accidents. Conclusions TKIs do not appear to increase the cause-specific hazard of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular accidents compared to age and gender-matched individuals without advanced cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2170308984,"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the first polyomavirus clearly associated with a human cancer, i.e. the Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Polyomaviruses are small naked DNA viruses that induce a robust polyclonal antibody response against the major capsid protein (VP1). However, the polyomavirus VP1 capsid protein epitopes have not been identified to date. The aim of this study was to identify the neutralizing epitopes of the MCPyV capsid. For this goal, four VP1 mutants were generated by insertional mutagenesis in the BC, DE, EF and HI loops between amino acids 88-89, 150-151, 189-190, and 296-297, respectively. The reactivity of these mutants and wild-type VLPs was then investigated with anti-VP1 monoclonal antibodies and anti-MCPyV positive human sera. The findings together suggest that immunodominant conformational neutralizing epitopes are present at the surface of the MCPyV VLPs and are clustered within BC and EF loops."
https://openalex.org/W2011527233,"Background & Aims Recent studies have shown that increased expression of liver hypoxia inducible factor 2-α (HIF-2α) leads to liver inflammation and a pro-fibrotic gene expression signature. Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) is required for HIF-2α transcriptional activity and has previously been shown to regulate hepatic metabolism in mice. In these studies we examined the role of hepatocyte ARNT in the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced model of liver fibrosis. Methods Hepatocyte-specific ARNT-null (LARNT) mice were created using an albumin promoter-driven Cre recombinase. LARNT and floxed control (FC) littermates were placed on chow diet and received twice weekly intraperitoneal injections of 0.15mg/g body weight of TAA for 13 weeks. Results TAA treated LARNT and FC mice had a similar pattern of fibrosis. Quantification of Sirius red histology staining and hydroxyproline content revealed mixed results in terms of collagen deposition in LARNT livers. There was no significant difference in hepatocyte apoptosis or proliferation, as assessed by cleaved Caspase-3 and Ki67 respectively. LARNT mice had decreased macrophage accumulation, and decreased liver mRNA expression of Col1A1, Col1A2, Col5A1, Tgfβ1, Tgfβ2, Timp1 and Timp2. Conclusions Deletion of hepatocyte ARNT leads to altered expression of collagen associated mRNA and reduced macrophage infiltration in the TAA-induced model of liver fibrosis. It appears that hepatocyte ARNT is not a requirement for initiation of liver fibrogenesis, but does regulate pro-fibrotic gene expression and macrophage accumulation."

The key amino acid residues responsible for its localization are not yet defined. In this study, we identified a motif from Lys216 to Lys222 in BUB3 as its nuclear localization signal. A BUB3 mutant with deletion of this motif (Del216–222) was found to localize to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, distinct from the exclusively nuclear distribution of wild-type BUB3. Further analysis revealed that residues Glu213, Lys216, Lys217, Lys218, Tyr219, and Phe221, but not Lys222, contribute to nuclear localization. Interestingly, the nuclear localization signal was also critical for the kinetochore localization of BUB3. The deletion mutant Del216–222 and a subtle mutant with four residue changes in this region (E213Q/K216E/K217E/K218E (QE)) did not localize to the kinetochore efficiently or mediate mitotic checkpoint arrest.

Significance: This study helps to dissect the role of BUB3 in mitotic checkpoint signaling. Cells use surveillance mechanisms, such as a mitotic checkpoint or spindle assembly checkpoint, to maintain the integrity of the genome (1.Topham C.H. Taylor S.S. Mitosis and apoptosis: how is the balance set?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2013; 25: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The mitotic checkpoint fulfills this function by monitoring the interaction between the chromosomal kinetochore and spindle microtubules (2.Lara-Gonzalez P. Westhorpe F.G. Taylor S.S. The spindle assembly checkpoint.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R966-R980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). When the cell enters the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, the mitotic checkpoint is activated by kinetochores unattached to spindle microtubules (even a single unattached kinetochore can activate the checkpoint). When every kinetochore is attached to spindle microtubules and bi-orientation of sister chromatids is established, the mitotic checkpoint is satisfied, its signaling is silenced, and chromosome segregation proceeds (3.Wang Y. Jin F. Higgins R. McKnight K. The current view for the silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint.Cell Cycle. 2014; 13: 1694-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Prolonged mitotic checkpoint signaling activates cell death, which thus helps to eliminate the generation of aneuploid cells. The mitotic checkpoint also ensures the reductional division of chromosomes during meiosis (4.Li M. Li S. Yuan J. Wang Z.B. Sun S.C. Schatten H. Sun Q.Y.

Mitotic checkpoint proteins localize to kinetochores unattached to the spindle microtubule, and they assemble at the kinetochore as an active complex. The complex converts MAD2 to its inhibitory form, which binds to and inhibits CDC20, the activator subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). APC is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B1, securin, and other mitotic proteins. Once APC is inhibited by MAD2, degradation of these proteins is blocked, the cell cycle progression to anaphase halts, and the initiation of premature chromosome segregation is prevented. budding uninhibited by benzimidazole mitotic arrest defective centromeric protein A anaphase-promoting complex. The distribution and localization of mitotic checkpoint components during the cell cycle are dynamic, and the regulatory mechanisms have been of great interest (12.Hori T. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y.

The kinase MPS1 predominately localizes to the cytosol during interphase of the cell cycle and relocates from the cytosol to the nucleus at the G2/M-phase boundary prior to nuclear envelope breakdown (14.Xu Q.

In both yeast and mammalian cells, Mad1 and Mad2 localize to the nuclear pore complex during interphase. Upon mitotic checkpoint activation, Mad2 (but not Mad1) is released from the nuclear pore complex and accumulates on kinetochores (16.Quimby B.B. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. Ran GTPase regulates Mad2 localization to the nuclear pore complex.Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Most of the mitotic checkpoint components are kinetochore dynamic proteins, and they localize to the kinetochore hierarchically (17.McAinsh A.D. Tytell J.D. Sorger P.K.

Spindle checkpoint protein dynamics at kinetochores in living cells.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 953-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In yeast, Bub1 is required for kinetochore localization of BubR1, Cenp-E, Cenp-F, and Mad2 (20.Howell B.J. Moree B. Farrar E.M. Stewart S. Fang G. Salmon E.D. Spindle checkpoint protein dynamics at kinetochores in living cells.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 953-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MPS1 is required for the recruitment of Mad1 and Mad2 to kinetochores, and the kinetochore localization of MPS1 itself depends on the calponin homology domain of HEC1 (21.Nijenhuis W. von Castelmur E. Littler D. De Marco V. Tromer E. Vleugel M. van Osch M.H. Snel B. Perrakis A. Kops G.J. A TPR domain-containing N-terminal module of MPS1 is required for its kinetochore localization by Aurora B.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Constituents of the kinetochore are also critical for mitotic checkpoint proteins to localize to the unattached kinetochore. It is thought that certain exposed kinetochore components are subjected to phosphorylation by a mitotic kinase, such as MPS1 or the Aurora kinases, and that these events further recruit mitotic checkpoint signaling components to assemble into a large complex at kinetochores (22.Goutte-Gattat D.

The centromere-specific variant of histone H3, CENP-A, is required for sustained kinetochore association of BubR1 under conditions of checkpoint activation (25.Régnier V. Vagnarelli P. Fukagawa T.

Biol. 2005; 25: 3967-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human BUB3 is an essential component for the mitotic checkpoint. It has been demonstrated that BUB3 enrichment at the unattached kinetochore is essential for BUB1 and BubR1 to localize to the kinetochore (26.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it was reported that Bub3 recognizes multiple MPS1-phosphorylated Met-Glu-Leu-Thr (MELT) motifs of Spc105/Knl1 (also known as CASC5, Blinkin, and AF15Q14 and referred to as Spc105 in yeast) (30.Zhang G.

There are significant differences between human BUB3 and yeast Bub3. The domain(s) or amino acid residues in human BUB3 that are responsible for recognizing the kinetochore component have not been defined to date (31.Shepperd L.A. Meadows J.C. Sochaj A.M.

We previously reported the regulation of BUB3 expression by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/TGF-β signaling and MPS1 translocation (14.Xu Q. Zhu S. Wang W. Zhang X. Old W. Ahn N. Liu X.

We are interested in the mechanism by which the localization of human BUB3 is regulated. In this study, we report the identification of a motif in BUB3 that is required for its nuclear and kinetochore localization and also a region in the kinetochore component CENP-A that mediates BUB3/CENP-A interaction. HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2.

The lentivirus was produced according to the protocol from Addgene. BUB3 and its mutant constructs were cloned into pEGFPC2, pEGFPN1, and the lentiviral vector FUGW for overexpression. Mutations were made with the QuikChange kit from Agilent. All constructs and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. DNA transfections were performed using a transfection reagent from Exelgene.

For recombinant protein production of His6-BUB3 and GST-CENP-A, BUB3 was cloned into pET28a. CENP-A was cloned into pGEX-4T-1, and the DNA fragment coding GST-CENP-A was subcloned to FUGW for mammalian expression. Western blotting and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (35.Zhu S. Wang W. Clarke D.C. Liu X.

For immunofluorescence staining, cells were seeded on polylysine-coated glass coverslips and stained as described previously (14.Xu Q. Zhu S. Wang W. Zhang X. Old W. Ahn N. Liu X.

For immunofluorescence staining of mitotic cells, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μm Taxol for 4 h and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Stained cells or GFPBUB3-transfected cells were observed on a Leica microscope (Leica, Tokyo, Japan). The following antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: BUB3, Abcam Ab4180 and Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-376506; BUB1, mouse monoclonal antibody (14H5) to BUB1, Abcam Ab4636; BubR1, mouse monoclonal antibody (8G1) to BubR1, Abcam Ab4637; HEC1 mouse monoclonal clone 9G3, Abcam Ab3613; MAD2 (C-19), Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC-6329; Crest antisera, Antibodies Inc.; CENP-A, Cell Signaling Technology, CST2186; KNL1, (CASC5, K-14), Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-242311; GAPDH ABclonal Inc.; and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, Cell Signaling Technology. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. We detected the localization of endogenous BUB3 in HeLa cells by immunostaining. The specificity of the antibody for BUB3 was confirmed by Western blotting. Two shRNAs against BUB3 (4.Li M. Li S. Yuan J. Wang Z.B. Sun S.C. Schatten H. Sun Q.Y. Bub3 is a spindle assembly checkpoint protein regulating chromosome segregation during mouse oocyte meiosis.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (shBUB3) were transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). The BUB3 antibody recognized a single band with a predicted molecular mass of 37 kDa. The intensity of the BUB3 decreased upon transfection of HeLa cells with shBUB3 (Fig. 1A), and the shRNA specifically targeted BUB3 without effect on other checkpoint-related proteins, BUB1, MAD2, and CENP-A, and had very minor effects on BubR1 and KNL1, suggesting that the antibody is relatively specific for BUB3. In contrast to the cytosolic localization of MPS1 during interphase, as we reported previously (14.Xu Q. Zhu S. Wang W. Zhang X. Old W. Ahn N. Liu X. Regulation of kinetochore recruitment of two essential mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins by Mps1 phosphorylation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), BUB3 localizes to the nucleus during interphase (Fig. 1B) in HeLa cells. During the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, BUB3 was found as discrete dots and was localized to the kinetochores, which were visualized by CREST antiserum staining (Fig. 1C). We next generated an N-terminal GFP-tagged BUB3 expression vector (GFPBUB3) and expressed this construct in HeLa cells (Fig. 1F). Confocal microscopy showed that in prometaphase (Fig. 1D) and prophase (Fig. 1E), GFPBUB3 presented as discrete dots, as observed with endogenous BUB3. The kinetochore localization of GFPBUB3 was further confirmed by its co-localization with endogenous centromeric marker CENP-A protein (Fig. 1G). This observation is consistent with other studies (26.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F.

To understand the mechanism controlling the nuclear localization of BUB3, we examined its amino acid sequence and noted the presence of two interesting motifs: one containing Lys216, Lys217, Lys218, Tyr219, Ala220, Phe221, and Lys222, and a second one containing Lys266, Lys267, and Arg268. Both motifs contained tandem polar basic amino acid residues typical of a protein nuclear localization signal. We created two mutants: one with a deletion of the region from Lys216 to Lys222 (Del216–222), and the other with the polar charged amino acid residues Lys266, Lys267, and Arg268 mutated to the polar uncharged amino acid Gln (K266Q/K267Q/R288Q) (Fig. 2A). Western blots confirmed that both mutants were intact and recognized by the BUB3-specific antibody when expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). We found that wild-type BUB3 (GFPBUB3WT) localization was exclusively nuclear (Fig. 2B), which was marked by mCherryH2B and DAPI staining. The deletion mutant Del216–222 (GFPDel216–222) was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). The localization of the K266Q/K267Q/R288Q mutant remained the same as that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2D). We further examined the role of the individual amino acid residue of the deleted region in BUB3 nuclear localization. We made three mutants with the individual point mutations (Y219A, F221A, and K222A) and a QE mutant 4The following mutant designation was used: QE, E213Q/K216E/K217E/K218E. (Fig. 3A) in which the polar acidic residue glutamic acid was mutated to the polar uncharged residue glutamine and three of the polar basic residue lysines were changed to glutamic acid residues. All mutants were GFP-tagged. After expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 3F), we found that, with the exception of K222A, all of the mutants were cytoplasmically distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, B–E). This suggested that the nuclear localization capacity of these mutants was impaired and that residues Glu213, Lys216, Lys217, Lys218, Tyr219, and Phe221 all contribute to BUB3 nuclear localization. BUB3 function in the mitotic checkpoint depends on its kinetochore localization. We asked whether these BUB3 mutants were still able to localize to the kinetochore. HeLa cells were transfected with GFPBUB3 or its mutants, treated with Taxol for 4 h, and then subjected to immunostaining with an antibody specific for CENP-A, which is a kinetochore marker. We found that BUB3WT colocalized very well with CENP-A (Fig. 4A). However, the kinetochore localization of both the QE and the Del216–222 mutants was impaired but not abolished (Fig. 4, B and C). This suggested that the nuclear localization signal of BUB3 is also involved in its kinetochore localization. To further examine the role of the BUB3 nuclear localization signal in mitotic checkpoint signaling, we measured the ability of the QE and Del216–222 mutants to arrest cells at mitotic phase. We first knocked down endogenous BUB3 using the shBUB3 lentivirus and then restored the BUB3WT, QE or Del216–222 proteins in the BUB3-depleted cells. All of the overexpression plasmids were made to be resistant to shBUB3. We then activated the mitotic checkpoint with nocodazole and measured mitotic checkpoint signaling using multiple assays (Fig. 5A). The shBUB3 virus depleted BUB3 efficiently, and the expression levels of WT, QE, and Del216–222 were comparable with each other (Fig. 5C). We observed mitotic arrest by microscopy when these cells were treated with nocodazole for 18 h (Fig. 5B, panels a–e). A high percentage of the control group cells was able to arrest during mitosis upon nocodazole treatment, as indicated by the presence of many rounded cells. As expected, cells in the shBUB3 group were not able to arrest during mitosis. The restored expression of BUB3WT partially rescued the ability of cells to arrest during mitosis. However, neither QE nor Del216–222 could rescue the mitotic arrest to the extent of the wild-type protein. To further confirm this observation, these cells were harvested and subjected to biochemical analysis of mitotic markers including MPM2, cyclin B1, and phospho-Ser10 of histone H3 (Fig. 5D). The levels of multiple bands of MPM2 decreased significantly upon shBUB3 infection, and the major signal at ∼55–75 kDa (but not the other bands) was largely rescued in the WT group. In the QE and Del216–222 groups (Fig. 5D, upper panel), none of the MPM2 signals were rescued. Both cyclin B1 and phospho-Ser10 of histone H3 were largely rescued in the WT group but not in the QE and Del216–222 groups. We further performed FACS analysis to quantify the mitotic 4N population in the cell pool of each group, and the result was consistent with the microscopic observation and biochemical analysis (Fig. 5E), further confirming the impaired function of the QE and Del216–222 mutants. We noticed that the levels of mitotic markers cyclin B1 and histone H3 phopsho-Ser10 were largely rescued to levels similar to control upon the wild-type BUB3 restoration in shBUB3 cells; however, the mitotic index (Fig. 5E) was not fully rescued. These data underscored the importance of unperturbed expression BUB3 in mitotic checkpoint signaling. Combined with its kinetochore localization data, we concluded that the motif from Lys216 to Lys222 is critical for BUB3 function in mitotic checkpoint signaling.

Moreover, plasma samples were collected at delivery from mother and infant.HIV-1 RNA was quantified in 1,212 breast milk samples from 273 women. At delivery, 96% of the women and 99% of the infants had detectable nevirapine in plasma with a median (interquartile range, IQR) of 1.5 μg/mL (0.75-2.20 μg/mL) and 1.04 μg/mL (0.39-1.71 μg/mL), respectively (P < 0.001). At 1 week postpartum, 93% and 98% of the women had detectable nevirapine in plasma and breast milk, with a median (IQR) of 0.13 μg/mL (0.13-0.39 μg/mL) and 0.22 μg/mL (0.13-0.34 μg/mL), respectively. Maternal plasma and breast milk HIV-1 RNA correlated at all visits (R = 0.48, R = 0.7, R = 0.59; all P = 0.01). Subclinical mastitis was detected in 67% of the women at some time during 6 weeks, and in 38% of the breast milk samples. Breast milk samples with subclinical mastitis had significantly higher HIV-1 RNA at 1, 4 and 6 weeks (all P < 0.05).After short-course antiretroviral prophylaxis, nevirapine was detectable in most infant cord blood samples and the concentration in maternal plasma and breast milk was high through week 1 accompanied by suppressed HIV-1 RNA in plasma and breast milk."
