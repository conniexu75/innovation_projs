https://openalex.org/W1997650940,"The assessment of pain is critical for the welfare of horses, in particular when pain is induced by common management procedures such as castration. Existing pain assessment methods have several limitations, which reduce the applicability in everyday life. Assessment of facial expression changes, as a novel means of pain scoring, may offer numerous advantages and overcome some of these limitations. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a standardised pain scale based on facial expressions in horses (Horse Grimace Scale [HGS]).Forty stallions were assigned to one of two treatments and all animals underwent routine surgical castration under general anaesthesia. Group A (n = 19) received a single injection of Flunixin immediately before anaesthesia. Group B (n = 21) received Flunixin immediately before anaesthesia and then again, as an oral administration, six hours after the surgery. In addition, six horses were used as anaesthesia controls (C). These animals underwent non-invasive, indolent procedures, received the same treatment as group A, but did not undergo surgical procedures that could be accompanied with surgical pain. Changes in behaviour, composite pain scale (CPS) scores and horse grimace scale (HGS) scores were assessed before and 8-hours post-procedure. Only horses undergoing castration (Groups A and B) showed significantly greater HGS and CPS scores at 8-hours post compared to pre operatively. Further, maintenance behaviours such as explorative behaviour and alertness were also reduced. No difference was observed between the two analgesic treatment groups.The Horse Grimace Scale potentially offers an effective and reliable method of assessing pain following routine castration in horses. However, auxiliary studies are required to evaluate different painful conditions and analgesic schedules."

However, the mechanisms by which pancreatic CSCs are maintained are not well understood or characterized. Methods Expression of Notch receptors, ligands, and Notch signaling target genes was quantitated in the CSC and non-CSC populations from 8 primary human pancreatic xenografts. A gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) that inhibits the Notch pathway and a shRNA targeting the Notch target gene Hes1 were used to assess the role of the Notch pathway in CSC population maintenance and pancreatic tumor growth. Results Notch pathway components were found to be upregulated in pancreatic CSCs. Inhibition of the Notch pathway using either a gamma secretase inhibitor or Hes1 shRNA in pancreatic cancer cells reduced the percentage of CSCs and tumorsphere formation. Conversely, activation of the Notch pathway with an exogenous Notch peptide ligand increased the percentage of CSCs as well as tumorsphere formation. In vivo treatment of orthotopic pancreatic tumors in NOD/SCID mice with GSI blocked tumor growth and reduced the CSC population. Conclusion The Notch signaling pathway is important in maintaining the pancreatic CSC population and is a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2072383097,"A major goal of recent research in aging has been to examine cognitive plasticity in older adults and its capacity to counteract cognitive decline. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether older adults could benefit from brain training with video games in a cross-modal oddball task designed to assess distraction and alertness. Twenty-seven healthy older adults participated in the study (15 in the experimental group, 12 in the control group. The experimental group received 20 1-hr video game training sessions using a commercially available brain-training package (Lumosity) involving problem solving, mental calculation, working memory and attention tasks. The control group did not practice this package and, instead, attended meetings with the other members of the study several times along the course of the study. Both groups were evaluated before and after the intervention using a cross-modal oddball task measuring alertness and distraction. The results showed a significant reduction of distraction and an increase of alertness in the experimental group and no variation in the control group. These results suggest neurocognitive plasticity in the old human brain as training enhanced cognitive performance on attentional functions.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02007616."
https://openalex.org/W2010010504,"Background Complement functions as an important host defense system and complement C5 and C7 have been implicated in immunopathology of tuberculosis. However, little is known about the role of other complement components in tuberculosis. Methods Complement gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of tuberculosis patients and controls were determined using whole genome transcriptional microarray assays. The mRNA and protein levels of three C1q components, C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC, were further validated by qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The percentages of C1q expression in CD14 positive cells were determined by flow cytometry. Finally, C1qC protein level was quantified in the pleural fluid of tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis pleurisy. Results C1q expression increases significantly in the peripheral blood of patients with active tuberculosis compared to healthy controls and individuals with latent TB infection. The percentage of C1q-expressing CD14 positive cells is significantly increased in active TB patients. C1q expression in the peripheral blood correlates with sputum smear positivity in tuberculosis patients and is reduced after anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. Notably, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that C1qC mRNA levels in peripheral blood efficiently discriminate active from latent tuberculosis infection and healthy controls. Additionally, C1qC protein level in pleural effusion shows improved power in discriminating tuberculosis from non-tuberculosis pleurisy when compared to other inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Conclusions C1q expression correlates with active disease in human tuberculosis. C1q could be a potential diagnostic marker to discriminate active tuberculosis from latent tuberculosis infection as well as tuberculosis pleurisy from non-tuberculosis pleurisy."
https://openalex.org/W2083028088,"Skeletal muscle satellite cell function is largely dictated by the surrounding environment following injury. Immune cell infiltration dominates the extracellular space in the injured area, resulting in increased cytokine concentrations. While increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression has been previously established in the first 3 days following injury, less is known about the time course of cytokine expression and the specific mechanisms of cytokine induced myoblast function. Therefore, the expression of IL-1β and IL-6 at several time points following injury, and their effects on myoblast proliferation, were examined. In order to do this, skeletal muscle was injured using barium chloride in mice and tissue was collected 1, 5, 10, and 28 days following injury. Mechanisms of cytokine induced proliferation were determined in cell culture using both primary and C2C12 myoblasts. It was found that there is a ∼20-fold increase in IL-1β (p≤0.05) and IL-6 (p = 0.06) expression 5 days following injury. IL-1β increased proliferation of both primary and C2C12 cells ∼25%. IL-1β stimulation also resulted in increased NF-κB activity, likely contributing to the increased proliferation. These data demonstrate for the first time that IL-1β alone can increase the mitogenic activity of primary skeletal muscle satellite cells and offer insight into the mechanisms dictating satellite cell function following injury."
https://openalex.org/W2057166084,"The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) is an important ecological model parameter and may vary with temperature and moisture. While Q10 generally decreases with increasing temperature, the moisture effects on Q10 have been controversial. To address this, we conducted a 90-day laboratory incubation experiment using a subtropical forest soil with a full factorial combination of five moisture levels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% water holding capacity--WHC) and five temperature levels (10, 17, 24, 31, and 38°C). Under each moisture treatment, Rh was measured several times for each temperature treatment to derive Q10 based on the exponential relationships between Rh and temperature. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial community structure and soil nutrients were also measured several times to detect their potential contributions to the moisture-induced Q10 variation. We found that Q10 was significantly lower at lower moisture levels (60%, 40% and 20% WHC) than at higher moisture level (80% WHC) during the early stage of the incubation, but became significantly higher at 20%WHC than at 60% WHC and not significantly different from the other three moisture levels during the late stage of incubation. In contrast, soil Rh had the highest value at 60% WHC and the lowest at 20% WHC throughout the whole incubation period. Variations of Q10 were significantly associated with MBC during the early stages of incubation, but with the fungi-to-bacteria ratio during the later stages, suggesting that changes in microbial biomass and community structure are related to the moisture-induced Q10 changes. This study implies that global warming's impacts on soil CO2 emission may depend upon soil moisture conditions. With the same temperature rise, wetter soils may emit more CO2 into the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1980802319,"Prospero homeobox 1 (Prox1) and forkhead box (FOX) C2 regulate angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis. However, the detailed role and function of Prox1 and FOXC2 in cancer remains controversial. In the present study, we examined the expression of Prox1 and FOXC2 proteins in specimens from 163 cases with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Furthermore, the role of Prox1 and FOXC2 in cancer cell growth and invasion was evaluated in cultured OSCC cells. Prox1 expression was significantly associated with local progression of the tumor (P = 0.0023), clinical stage (P<0.0001), lymphovessel density (LVD) (P<0.0001), nodal metastasis (P<0.0001), and worse prognosis (P<0.0001). Immunoreactivity of FOXC2 was strongly correlated with microvessel density (MVD) (P<0.0001) and poor prognosis (P = 0.0076). In vitro analysis demonstrated that Prox1 regulates cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and lymphangiogenesis by activating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C expression. Furthermore, FOXC2 enhanced the expression level of Prox1 and promoted angiogenesis by enhancement of VEGF-A expression. Our results suggested that Prox1 and FOXC2 play key roles in OSCC progression and that further studies focusing on these proteins may yield useful insights for diagnosis and therapy of OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2052889906,"Few diazotrophs have been found to belong to the family Cytophagaceae so far. In the present study, a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that forms red colonies, was isolated from sands of the Takalamakan desert. It was designated H4XT. Phylogenetic and biochemical analysis indicated that the isolate is a new species of the genus Pontibacter. The 16S rRNA gene of H4XT displays 94.2–96.8% sequence similarities to those of other strains in Pontibacter. The major respiratory quinone is menaquinone-7 (MK-7). The DNA G+C content is 46.6 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15∶0, C16∶1ω5c, summed feature 3 (containing C16∶1ω6c and/or C16∶1ω7c) and summed feature 4 (comprising anteiso-C17∶1B and/or iso-C17∶1I). The major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), one aminophospholipid (APL) and some unknown phospholipids (PLs). It is interesting to see that this bacterium can grow very well in a nitrogen-free medium. PCR amplification suggested that the bacterium possesses at least one type of nitrogenase gene. Acetylene reduction assay showed that H4XT actually possesses nitrogen-fixing activity. Therefore, it can be concluded that H4XT is a new diazotroph. We thus referred it to as Pontibacter diazotrophicus sp. nov. The type strain is H4XT ( = CCTCC AB 2013049T = NRRL B-59974T)."
https://openalex.org/W2151239487,"Primary hyperhidrosis is defined as excessive sweating of certain body areas without physiological reasons. Hyperhidrotic individuals report a high psychological strain and an impairment of their quality of life. Thus, the aim of the study is to investigate the relation between hyperhidrosis and different psychological as well as physiological aspects of chronic stress as a co-factor for the etiology of depression. In this study, forty hyperhidrotic subjects were compared to forty age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (‘Trierer Inventar zum chronischen Stress’: TICS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Screening for Somatoform Disorders (SOMS-2) were used to examine the correlation between primary hyperhidrosis and stress as well as accompanying depressive and somatic symptoms. The cortisol awakening response of each subject was analyzed as a physiological stress correlate. In hyperhidrotics, we found a significant lack of social recognition as well as significantly more depressive symptoms compared to the control subjects. A subgroup of patients with axillary hyperhidrosis had the highest impact on these increased issues of chronic stress, pointing to a higher embarrassment in these subjects. Especially in social situations, hyperhidrotics showed higher stress levels, whereby a vicious circle of stress and sweating is triggered. However, the cortisol awakening response did not significantly differ between hyperhidrotics and controls. Moreover, affected persons suffer from more depressive symptoms, which may be caused by feelings of shame and a lack of self-confidence. This initial study provides an impetus for further investigation to reveal a causative relationship between hyperhidrosis and its psychological concomitants."
https://openalex.org/W2118341078,"This study investigated whether there is a discrepancy pertaining to trait and state academic emotions and whether self-concept of ability moderates this discrepancy. A total of 225 secondary school students from two different countries enrolled in grades 8 and 11 (German sample; n = 94) and grade 9 (Swiss sample; n = 131) participated. Students' trait academic emotions of enjoyment, pride, anger, and anxiety in mathematics were assessed with a self-report questionnaire, whereas to assess their state academic emotions experience-sampling method was employed. The results revealed that students' scores on the trait assessment of emotions were generally higher than their scores on the state assessment. Further, as expected, students' academic self-concept in the domain of mathematics was shown to partly explain the discrepancy between scores on trait and state emotions. Our results indicate that there is a belief-driven discrepancy between what students think they feel (trait assessment) and what they really feel (state assessment). Implications with regard to the assessment of self-reported emotions in future studies and practical implications for the school context are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2050613453,"Peptide bond-hydrolyzing catalytic antibodies (catabodies) could degrade toxic proteins, but acquired immunity principles have not provided evidence for beneficial catabodies. Transthyretin (TTR) forms misfolded β-sheet aggregates responsible for age-associated amyloidosis. We describe nucleophilic catabodies from healthy humans without amyloidosis that degraded misfolded TTR (misTTR) without reactivity to the physiological tetrameric TTR (phyTTR). IgM class B cell receptors specifically recognized the electrophilic analog of misTTR but not phyTTR. IgM but not IgG class antibodies hydrolyzed the particulate and soluble misTTR species. No misTTR-IgM binding was detected. The IgMs accounted for essentially all of the misTTR hydrolytic activity of unfractionated human serum. The IgMs did not degrade non-amyloidogenic, non-superantigenic proteins. Individual monoclonal IgMs (mIgMs) expressed variable misTTR hydrolytic rates and differing oligoreactivity directed to amyloid β peptide and microbial superantigen proteins. A subset of the mIgMs was monoreactive for misTTR. Excess misTTR was dissolved by a hydrolytic mIgM. The studies reveal a novel antibody property, the innate ability of IgMs to selectively degrade and dissolve toxic misTTR species as a first line immune function."
https://openalex.org/W2004851406,"D-amino acids are toxic for life on Earth. Yet, they form constantly due to geochemical racemization and bacterial growth (the cell walls of which contain D-amino acids), raising the fundamental question of how they ultimately are recycled. This study provides evidence that bacteria use D-amino acids as a source of nitrogen by running enzymatic racemization in reverse. Consequently, when soils are inundated with racemic amino acids, resident bacteria consume D- as well as L-enantiomers, either simultaneously or sequentially depending on the level of their racemase activity. Bacteria thus protect life on Earth by keeping environments D-amino acid free."
https://openalex.org/W2051530313,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are major toxic air pollutants released during incomplete combustion of coal. PAH emissions are especially problematic in China because of their reliance on coal-powered energy. The prenatal period is a window of susceptibility to neurotoxicants. To determine the health benefits of reducing air pollution related to coal-burning, we compared molecular biomarkers of exposure and preclinical effects in umbilical cord blood to neurodevelopmental outcomes from two successive birth cohorts enrolled before and after a highly polluting, coal-fired power plant in Tongliang County, China had ceased operation. Women and their newborns in the two successive cohorts were enrolled at the time of delivery. We measured PAH-DNA adducts, a biomarker of PAH-exposure and DNA damage, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein involved in neuronal growth, in umbilical cord blood. At age two, children were tested using the Gesell Developmental Schedules (GDS). The two cohorts were compared with respect to levels of both biomarkers in cord blood as well as developmental quotient (DQ) scores across 5 domains. Lower levels of PAH-DNA adducts, higher concentrations of the mature BDNF protein (mBDNF) and higher DQ scores were seen in the 2005 cohort enrolled after closure of the power plant. In the two cohorts combined, PAH-DNA adducts were inversely associated with mBDNF as well as scores for motor (p = 0.05), adaptive (p = 0.022), and average (p = 0.014) DQ. BDNF levels were positively associated with motor (p = 0.018), social (p = 0.001), and average (p = 0.017) DQ scores. The findings indicate that the closure of a coal-burning plant resulted in the reduction of PAH-DNA adducts in newborns and increased mBDNF levels that in turn, were positively associated with neurocognitive development. They provide further evidence of the direct benefits to children's health as a result of the coal plant shut down, supporting clean energy and environmental policies in China and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W1964021758,"Background The lipid milleu exacerbates the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis but its effect on T cell mediated immune response has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that lipid lowering would modulate T cell mediated immune function. Methods and Results T cells isolated from human PBMC or splenic T cells from apoE-/- mouse had higher proliferative response to T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) compared to medium with 10% delipidated FBS. The differences in proliferation were associated with changes in lipid rafts, cellular cholesterol content, IL-10 secretion and subsequent activation of signaling molecule activated by TCR ligation. Immune biomarkers were also assessed in vivo using male apoE-/- mice fed atherogenic diet (AD) starting at 7 weeks of age. At 25 weeks of age, a sub-group was switched to normal diet (ND) whereas the rest remained on AD until euthanasia at 29 weeks of age. Dietary change resulted in a lower circulating level of cholesterol, reduced plaque size and inflammatory phenotype of plaques. These changes were associated with reduced intracellular IL-10 and IL-12 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Conclusion Our results show that lipid lowering reduces T cell proliferation and function, supporting the notion that lipid lowering modulates T cell function in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1969959701,"Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica Desv.) is the only natural grass species in the maritime Antarctic. It has been researched as an important ecological marker and as an extremophile plant for studies on stress tolerance. Despite its importance, little genomic information is available for D. antarctica. Here, we report the complete chloroplast genome, transcriptome profiles of the coding/noncoding genes, and the posttranscriptional processing by RNA editing in the chloroplast system.The complete chloroplast genome of D. antarctica is 135,362 bp in length with a typical quadripartite structure, including the large (LSC: 79,881 bp) and small (SSC: 12,519 bp) single-copy regions, separated by a pair of identical inverted repeats (IR: 21,481 bp). It contains 114 unique genes, including 81 unique protein-coding genes, 29 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes. Sequence divergence analysis with other plastomes from the BEP clade of the grass family suggests a sister relationship between D. antarctica, Festuca arundinacea and Lolium perenne of the Poeae tribe, based on the whole plastome. In addition, we conducted high-resolution mapping of the chloroplast-derived transcripts. Thus, we created an expression profile for 81 protein-coding genes and identified ndhC, psbJ, rps19, psaJ, and psbA as the most highly expressed chloroplast genes. Small RNA-seq analysis identified 27 small noncoding RNAs of chloroplast origin that were preferentially located near the 5'- or 3'-ends of genes. We also found >30 RNA-editing sites in the D. antarctica chloroplast genome, with a dominance of C-to-U conversions.We assembled and characterized the complete chloroplast genome sequence of D. antarctica and investigated the features of the plastid transcriptome. These data may contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of D. antarctica within the Poaceae family for use in molecular phylogenetic studies and may also help researchers understand the characteristics of the chloroplast transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2050153822,"The fungal pathogen Penicillium marneffei produces melanin-like pigment in vitro. The synthetic pathway of melanin and its possible influence in the protective yeast cells surviving within macrophage cells are not known. In this work, P. marneffei produced brown black pigment in the presence of L-DOPA and black particles were extracted from yeast cells treated with proteolytic enzymes, denaturant and concentrated hot acid. Kojic acid inhibited the brown-black pigment production of P. marneffei yeast grown on brain heart infusion agar. Transmitting electron microscopy showed spherical granular electron-dense particles with an average diameter of 100 nm in a beaded arrangement in the innermost cell wall. Electron-paramagnetic resonance revealed that the black particles contain a stable free radical compound. The UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared spectra of particles extracted from P. marneffei and synthetic DOPA-melanin showed a high degree of similarity. Melanized yeast cells decreased phagocytosis by macrophage cells and increased resistance to intracellular digestion in vitro. These results indicate that P. marneffei can synthesize DOPA-melanin or melanin-like compounds in vitro and suggest that the DOPA-melanin pathway is associated with cell wall structure and enhances the resistance to phagocytosis by macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2091161589,"To elucidate the role of prenatal, neonatal and early postnatal variables in influencing the achievement of full enteral feeding (FEF) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and to determine whether neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) differ in this outcome.Population-based retrospective cohort study using data on 1,864 VLBW infants drawn from the ""Emilia-Romagna Perinatal Network"" Registry from 2004 to 2009. The outcome of interest was time to FEF achievement. Eleven prenatal, neonatal and early postnatal variables and the study NICUs were selected as potential predictors of time to FEF. Parametric survival analysis was used to model time to FEF as a function of the predictors. Marginal effects were used to obtain adjusted estimates of median time to FEF for specific subgroups of infants.Lower gestational age, exclusive formula feeding, higher CRIB II score, maternal hypertension, cesarean delivery, SGA and PDA predicted delayed FEF. NICUs proved to be heterogeneous in terms of FEF achievement. Newborns with PDA had a 4.2 days longer predicted median time to FEF compared to those without PDA; newborns exclusively formula-fed had a 1.4 days longer time to FEF compared to those fed human milk.The results of our study suggest that time to FEF is influenced by clinical variables and NICU-specific practices. Knowledge of the variables associated with delayed/earlier FEF achievement could help in improving specific aspects of routine clinical management of VLBW infants and to reduce practice variability."
https://openalex.org/W2088299741,"We characterized recombinant Lin1839 protein (Lin1839r) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 94 from Listeria innocua. Lin1839r catalyzed the synthesis of a series of 1,2-β-oligoglucans (Sopn: n denotes degree of polymerization) using sophorose (Sop2) as the acceptor and α-D-glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) as the donor. Lin1839r recognized glucose as a very weak acceptor substrate to form polymeric 1,2-β-glucan. The degree of polymerization of the 1,2-β-glucan gradually decreased with long-term incubation to generate a series of Sopns. Kinetic analysis of the phosphorolytic reaction towards sophorotriose revealed that Lin1839r followed a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. The kinetic parameters of the phosphorolysis of sophorotetraose and sophoropentaose were similar to those of sophorotriose, although the enzyme did not exhibit significant phosphorolytic activity on Sop2. These results indicate that the Lin1839 protein is a novel inverting phosphorylase that catalyzes reversible phosphorolysis of 1,2-β-glucan with a degree of polymerization of ≥3. We propose 1,2-β-oligoglucan: phosphate α-glucosyltransferase as the systematic name and 1,2-β-oligoglucan phosphorylase as the short name for this Lin1839 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1980451811,"It was recently proposed that for bactericidal antibiotics a common killing mechanism contributes to lethality involving indirect stimulation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) formation. Flow cytometric detection of OH• by hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF) probe oxidation was used to support this hypothesis. Here we show that increased HPF signals in antibiotics-exposed bacterial cells are explained by fluorescence associated with increased cell size, and do not reflect reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration. Independently of antibiotics, increased fluorescence was seen for elongated cells expressing the oxidative insensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP). Although our data question the role of ROS in lethality of antibiotics other research approaches point to important interplays between basic bacterial metabolism and antibiotic susceptibility. To underpin such relationships, methods for detecting bacterial metabolites at a cellular level are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1986890607,"Why do we frequently fixate an object of interest presented peripherally by moving our head as well as our eyes, even when we are capable of fixating the object with an eye movement alone (lateral viewing)? Studies of eye-head coordination for gaze shifts have suggested that the degree of eye-head coupling could be determined by an unconscious weighing of the motor costs and benefits of executing a head movement. The present study investigated visual perceptual effects of head direction as an additional factor impacting on a cost-benefit organization of eye-head control. Three experiments using visual search tasks were conducted, manipulating eye direction relative to head orientation (front or lateral viewing). Results show that lateral viewing increased the time required to detect a target in a search for the letter T among letter L distractors, a serial attentive search task, but not in a search for T among letter O distractors, a parallel preattentive search task (Experiment 1). The interference could not be attributed to either a deleterious effect of lateral gaze on the accuracy of saccadic eye movements, nor to potentially problematic optical effects of binocular lateral viewing, because effect of head directions was obtained under conditions in which the task was accomplished without saccades (Experiment 2), and during monocular viewing (Experiment 3). These results suggest that a difference between the head and eye directions interferes with visual processing, and that the interference can be explained by the modulation of attention by the relative positions of the eyes and head (or head direction)."
https://openalex.org/W2044881587,"The first white Doberman pinscher (WDP) dog was registered by the American Kennel Club in 1976. The novelty of the white coat color resulted in extensive line breeding of this dog and her offspring. The WDP phenotype closely resembles human oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and clinicians noticed a seemingly high prevalence of pigmented masses on these dogs. This study had three specific aims: (1) produce a detailed description of the ocular phenotype of WDPs, (2) objectively determine if an increased prevalence of ocular and cutaneous melanocytic tumors was present in WDPs, and (3) determine if a genetic mutation in any of the genes known to cause human OCA is causal for the WDP phenotype. WDPs have a consistent ocular phenotype of photophobia, hypopigmented adnexal structures, blue irides with a tan periphery and hypopigmented retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. WDPs have a higher prevalence of cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms compared with control standard color Doberman pinschers (SDPs); cutaneous tumors were noted in 12/20 WDP (<5 years of age: 4/12; >5 years of age: 8/8) and 1/20 SDPs (p<0.00001). Using exclusion analysis, four OCA causative genes were investigated for their association with WDP phenotype; TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and SLC45A2. SLC45A2 was found to be linked to the phenotype and gene sequencing revealed a 4,081 base pair deletion resulting in loss of the terminus of exon seven of SLC45A2 (chr4∶77,062,968–77,067,051). This mutation is highly likely to be the cause of the WDP phenotype and is supported by a lack of detectable SLC45A2 transcript levels by reverse transcriptase PCR. The WDP provides a valuable model for studying OCA4 visual disturbances and melanocytic neoplasms in a large animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2081534106,"Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is a widely used solvent in biology. It has many applications perhaps the most common of which is in aiding the preparation of drug solutions from hydrophobic chemical entities. Recent studies have suggested that this molecule may be able to induce apoptosis in neural tissues urging caution regarding its introduction into humans, for example as part of stem cell transplants. Here we have used in vitro electrophysiological methods applied to murine brain slices to examine whether a few hours treatment with 0.05% DMSO (a concentration regarded by many as innocuous) alters intrinsic excitability properties of neurones. We investigated pyramidal neurones in two distinct brain regions, namely area CA1 of the hippocampus and layer 2 of perirhinal cortex. In the former there was no effect on resting potential but input resistance was decreased by DMSO pre-treatment. In line with this action potential count for any level of depolarizing current stimulus was reduced by ∼25% following DMSO treatment. Ih-mediated ""sag"" was also increased in CA1 pyramids and action potential waveform analysis demonstrated that DMSO treatment moved action potential threshold towards resting potential. In perirhinal cortex a decreased action potential output for various depolarizing current stimuli was also seen. In these cells action potential threshold was unaltered by DMSO but a significant increase in action potential width was apparent. These data indicate that pre-treatment with this widely employed solvent can elicit multifaceted neurophysiological changes in mammalian neurones at concentrations below those frequently encountered in the published literature."
https://openalex.org/W1998795042,"Infection-induced preterm birth is the largest cause of infant death and of neurological disabilities in survivors. Silibinin, from milk thistle, exerts potent anti-inflammatory activities in non-gestational tissues. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of silibinin on pro-inflammatory mediators in (i) human fetal membranes and myometrium treated with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, and (ii) in preterm fetal membranes with active infection. The effect of silibinin on infection induced inflammation and brain injury in pregnant mice was also assessed. Fetal membranes and myometrium (tissue explants and primary cells) were treated with 200 μM silibinin in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml LPS or 1 ng/ml IL-1β. C57BL/6 mice were injected with 70 mg/kg silibinin with or without 50 μg LPS on embryonic day 16. Fetal brains were collected after 6 h. In human fetal membranes, silibinin significantly decreased LPS-stimulated expression of IL-6 and IL-8, COX-2, and prostaglandins PGE2 and PGF2α. In primary amnion and myometrial cells, silibinin also decreased IL-1β-induced MMP-9 expression. Preterm fetal membranes with active infection treated with silibinin showed a decrease in IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9 expression. Fetal brains from mice treated with silibinin showed a significant decrease in LPS-induced IL-8 and ninjurin, a marker of brain injury. Our study demonstrates that silibinin can reduce infection and inflammation-induced pro-labour mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium. Excitingly, the in vivo results indicate a protective effect of silibinin on infection-induced brain injury in a mouse model of preterm birth."

ZASP has several alternatively spliced isoforms, in this paper we clarify the nomenclature of its human isoforms as well as their dynamics and expression pattern in striated muscle. Interaction is demonstrated between ZASP and two new binding partners both of which have roles in signalling, regulation of gene expression and muscle differentiation; the mechanosensing protein Ankrd2 and the tumour suppressor protein p53. These proteins and ZASP form a triple complex that appears to facilitate poly-SUMOylation of p53. We also show the importance of two of its functional domains, the ZM-motif and the PDZ domain. The PDZ domain can bind directly to both Ankrd2 and p53 indicating that there is no competition between it and p53 for the same binding site on Ankrd2. However there is competition for this binding site between p53 and a region of the ZASP protein lacking the PDZ domain, but containing the ZM-motif. ZASP is negative regulator of p53 in transactivation experiments with the p53-responsive promoters, MDM2 and BAX. Mutations in the ZASP ZM-motif induce modification in protein turnover. In fact, two mutants, A165V and A171T, were not able to bind Ankrd2 and bound only poorly to alpha-actinin2. This is important since the A165V mutation is responsible for zaspopathy, a well characterized autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Although the mechanism by which this mutant causes disease is still unknown, this is the first indication of how a ZASP disease associated mutant protein differs from that of the wild type ZASP protein."

However, traditional assessment of vestibular function in this species using the vestibulo-ocular reflex requires agar-immobilization of individual fish and specialized video, which are difficult and labor-intensive. We report that using a static magnetic field to directly stimulate the zebrafish labyrinth results in an efficient, quantitative behavioral assay in free-swimming fish. We recently observed that humans have sustained nystagmus in high strength magnetic fields, and we attributed this observation to magnetohydrodynamic forces acting on the labyrinths. Here, fish were individually introduced into the center of a vertical 11.7T magnetic field bore for 2-minute intervals, and their movements were tracked. To assess for heading preference relative to a magnetic field, fish were also placed in a horizontally oriented 4.7T magnet in infrared (IR) light. A sub-population was tested again in the magnet after gentamicin bath to ablate lateral line hair cell function. Free-swimming adult zebrafish exhibited markedly altered swimming behavior while in strong static magnetic fields, independent of vision or lateral line function. Two-thirds of fish showed increased swimming velocity or consistent looping/rolling behavior throughout exposure to a strong, vertically oriented magnetic field. Fish also demonstrated altered swimming behavior in a strong horizontally oriented field, demonstrating in most cases preferred swimming direction with respect to the field. These findings could be adapted for ‘high-throughput’ investigations of the effects of environmental manipulations as well as for changes that occur during development on vestibular function in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W1999481474,"Current developments in the field of land use modelling point towards greater level of spatial and thematic resolution and the possibility to model large geographical extents. Improvements are taking place as computational capabilities increase and socioeconomic and environmental data are produced with sufficient detail. Integrated approaches to land use modelling rely on the development of interfaces with specialized models from fields like economy, hydrology, and agriculture. Impact assessment of scenarios/policies at various geographical scales can particularly benefit from these advances. A comprehensive land use modelling framework includes necessarily both the estimation of the quantity and the spatial allocation of land uses within a given timeframe. In this paper, we seek to establish straightforward methods to estimate demand for industrial and commercial land uses that can be used in the context of land use modelling, in particular for applications at continental scale, where the unavailability of data is often a major constraint. We propose a set of approaches based on ‘land use intensity’ measures indicating the amount of economic output per existing areal unit of land use. A base model was designed to estimate land demand based on regional-specific land use intensities; in addition, variants accounting for sectoral differences in land use intensity were introduced. A validation was carried out for a set of European countries by estimating land use for 2006 and comparing it to observations. The models’ results were compared with estimations generated using the ‘null model’ (no land use change) and simple trend extrapolations. Results indicate that the proposed approaches clearly outperformed the ‘null model’, but did not consistently outperform the linear extrapolation. An uncertainty analysis further revealed that the models’ performances are particularly sensitive to the quality of the input land use data. In addition, unknown future trends of regional land use intensity widen considerably the uncertainty bands of the predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2108286951,"Human phospholipid scramblase 1 (hPLSCR1), a type II integral class membrane protein, is known to mediate bidirectional scrambling of phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. hPLSCR2, a homolog of hPLSCR1 that lacks N-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD), did not show scramblase activity. We attribute this absence of scramblase activity of hPLSCR2 to the lack of N-terminal PRD. Hence to investigate the above hypothesis, we added the PRD of hPLSCR1 to hPLSCR2 (PRD-hPLSCR2) and checked whether scramblase activity was restored. Functional assays showed that the addition of PRD to hPLSCR2 restored scrambling activity, and deletion of PRD in hPLSCR1 (ΔPRD-hPLSCR1) resulted in a lack of activity. These results suggest that PRD is crucial for the function of the protein. The effects of the PRD deletion in hPLSCR1 and the addition of PRD to hPLSCR2 were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Our results clearly showed that hPLSCR1 and PRD-hPLSCR2 showed Ca2+-dependent aggregation and scrambling activity, whereas hPLSCR2 and ΔPRD-hPLSCR1 did not show aggregation and activity. Thus we conclude that scramblases exhibit Ca2+-dependent scrambling activity by aggregation of protein. Our results provide a possible mechanism for phospholipid scrambling mediated by PLSCRs and the importance of PRD in its function and cellular localization.

The biological semipermeable membrane that separates the interior of the cell from external environment is the plasma membrane (PM). 4The abbreviations used are:PMplasma membranePSphosphatidylserinePLphospholipidPLSCRphospholipid scramblasehPLSCR1human phospholipid scramblase 1hPLSCR2human phospholipid scramblase 2CTHC-terminal helixPRDproline rich domainPRD-hPLSCR2PRD of hPLSCR1 fused to hPLSCR2ΔPRD-hPLSCR1PRD deleted from hPLSCR1NBD7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3 diazol-4-ylPIpropidium iodideANS8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid. The unique feature of PM is the maintenance of membrane asymmetry by phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, which are localized in the outer leaflet, whereas aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine are predominant in the inner leaflet of PM. This asymmetry is maintained by the concerted action of energy (ATP)-dependent phospholipid (PL) translocators, which include flippases and floppases (1Zachowski A.

PM of eukaryotic cells is also equipped with a special class of PL translocators called human phospholipid scramblase 1(hPLSCR1). It is a type II membrane protein first identified in erythrocyte membranes that is activated upon elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels resulting in destruction of PM asymmetry (6Bassé F. Stout J.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17205-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Later other members of scramblases, hPLSCR2–4, were identified that were highly conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (7Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Identification of three new members of the phospholipid scramblase gene family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although initially identified as scramblase, hPLSCR1 was found to be involved in many signal transduction pathways like IFN-mediated antiviral activity and PKC-δ mediated pathways and is also a substrate for cellular kinases (8Lizak M.

Dai Q. Chen J. Durrant D. Freeman A. Liu T. Grossman D. Lee R.M. Phospholipid scramblase 3 controls mitochondrial structure, function, and apoptotic response.Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 892-902PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that hPLSCR4 also mediates bidirectional translocation of PLs across PL bilayer (11Francis V.G. Gummadi S.N. Biochemical and functional characterization of human phospholipid scramblase 4 (hPLSCR4).Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). hPLSCR2 is known to be localized to the nucleus; however, the structural and functional characterization of hPLSCR2 has not been performed yet (12Yu A.

Homology studies of PLSCRs reveal that hPLSCR2, -3, and -4 share 59, 47, and 46% similarity with hPLSCR1 (5Sahu S.K. Gummadi S.N. Manoj N. Aradhyam G.K. Phospholipid scramblases: an overview.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PLSCRs are multidomain-containing proteins where each domain has distinct functions that need to be elucidated. Major domains of PLSCRs include proline-rich domain (PRD), DNA binding motif, palmitoylation motif, nuclear localization signal, putative EF-hand like calcium binding motif, and C-terminal helix (CTH) (5Sahu S.K.

A highly conserved EF-hand-like Ca2+ binding motif was essential for its scrambling activity, and point mutations within this domain affected its function. It was also reported that CTH of hPLSCR1 is indeed a true transmembrane domain and is required for membrane insertion and Ca2+ binding (22Stout J.G. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J.

The single C-terminal helix of human phospholipid scramblase 1 is required for membrane insertion and scrambling activity.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 2855-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To date, the exact mechanism of scramblase activity is not known. Sims and co-workers (22Stout J.G. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Change in conformation of plasma membrane phospholipid scramblase induced by occupancy of its Ca2+ binding site.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14860-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed that the PL translocation could be due to protein aggregation or oligomerization, which was not sufficiently validated. Recent reports have disputed that hPLSCR1 might not be a true scramblase as the members of the TMEM16 family also show Ca2+-dependent scramblase activity and have been implicated in Scott syndrome mechanism (24Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Sequence homology of hPLSCR2 with hPLSCR1 and hPLSCR1 lacking PRD (ΔPRD-hPLSCR1) shows 59% and 84% homology, respectively. Even though hPLSCR2 shows such a high similarity with hPLSCR1 and retains all the major domains of hPLSCR1 except for the PRD domain, it fails to externalize PS in CHO-K1 cell lines under apoptotic conditions (12Yu A. McMaster C.R. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. Cook H.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9706-9714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite several years of research on scramblases, many questions are still unanswered. Does hPLSCR2 show Ca2+-dependent activity in vitro? What is the role of PRD in scramblase function? Is protein aggregation or oligomerization required for scramblase activity? To address the above questions, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified hPLSCR1, hPLSCR2, ΔPRD-hPLSCR1, and chimeric PRD-hPLSCR2 proteins to homogeneity, and various biochemical and biophysical studies were performed. Our results clearly showed that PRD is required for the Ca2+-dependent aggregation of protein that is required for functional activation of the protein. Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21 (DE3) strains were obtained from ATCC. cDNA of hPLSCR1 and -2 was purchased from Invitrogen, and pET-28b(+) was from Novagen. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, dithiothreitol (DTT), and EDTA were purchased from Himedia. SM-2 Biobeads and Chelex-100 resin were obtained from Bio-Rad. Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid was purchased from Qiagen. N-Lauroylsarcosine, BCA protein estimation kit, molecular biology grade CaCl2, trypsin, and egg phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. 7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl phosphatidylcholine and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) fluorescent-labeled lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The open reading frames of hPLSCR1 (957 bp) and hPLSCR2 (675 bp) were amplified from mammalian expression vector pCMV-SPORT6 by polymerase chain reaction using the primers PLSCR1F (5′-AGCTATCATATGATGCCAGCACCACC-3′) and PLSCR1R (5′-CGTAGTGAATTCTTACCTAGTTCTTTCAAAAAACATG-3′) with NdeI and EcoR1 sites and PLSCR2F (5′-AAACATATGCCAGCACCACCACC-3′) and PLSCR2R (5′-ATATGCGGCCGCTTACCTAGTTCTTTCAAAAAACATGTAGTCAATGAG-3′) with NdeI and Not1 sites, respectively. The amplicon was then digested and ligated into respective digested sites of pET-28b (+) vector. For generation of PRD-hPLSCR2 plasmid, we analyzed the sequence homology of hPLSCR1 and hPLSCR2 and found a unique SacI site that was used as a restriction site to fuse the PRD domain of hPLSCR1 to hPLSCR2 in-frame using the primers PLSCR2F (5′-ACTATGAGCTCCTGGAAGTTCTATTCAGTTTTGAAAGTAG-3′) and PLSCR1R (5′-ACTACTGAGCTCAATTTGCTGATGAATCAGTATCTG-3′). ΔPRD-hPLSCR1-pET-28a(+) plasmid was constructed using the forward primer (5′-TATTTAAGTCAGATAGATC-3′), and same reverse primers were used as PLSCR1R primer. Recombinant overexpression and purification of recombinant proteins was done as described earlier (25Francis V.G. Majeed M.A. Gummadi S.N.

Biotechnol. 2012; 39: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). E. coli BL-21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the respective plasmids and grown in a selective media containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Post-induction, cells were pelleted and lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl) with 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT using a probe sonicator (Vibro cell ultrasonicator). Cell lysate was then clarified at 12,000 × g, and the inclusion bodies were thoroughly washed with lysis buffer. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by 0.3% N-lauroylsarcosine followed by centrifugation at 4400 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Supernatant was then pulse-dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.025% w/v Brij-35. Protein in this buffer was used for all assays, and any changes in the composition are mentioned below. His-tagged proteins were then purified to homogeneity by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The proteins were visualized on 12% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein estimation was done by the BCA method. Reconstitution of purified proteins into vesicles was performed, and estimation of the reconstituted proteins was done as described earlier (23Francis V.G. Mohammed A.M. Aradhyam G.K. Gummadi S.N.

Slow detergent removal was facilitated by the addition of SM2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) for proteoliposomes formation. Outside-labeled proteoliposomes were prepared by incubating unlabeled vesicles with 0.3 mol of % NBD lipids in 0.25% v/v DMSO. Unbound lipids were then removed by centrifugation at 230,000 × g, vesicles were then incubated with appropriate metal ion and EDTA, and scramblase assay was performed. Outside-labeled vesicles were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, with 4 mm metal ions like Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ independently or 4 mm EDTA. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 532 nm with a slit width of 3 and 5 nm, respectively, using a stirred spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-55) continuously at 23 °C. Initial fluorescence was measured for 200 s, after which freshly prepared dithionite in 1 m Tris base was added, and the fluorescence was monitored for an additional 400 s. The residual difference between the non-quenchable fluorescence in the presence and absence of metal ion gives scramblase activity. Scramblase activity = Fmetal ion − FEDTA, where Fmetal ion is residual fluorescence of Ca2+ or any other metal ion-treated vesicles after dithionite addition, and FEDTA is residual fluorescence of EDTA-treated vesicles after dithionite addition. HEK 293T cells were grown on 60-mm2 polylysine-coated dishes. Once the cells reached 60–70% confluency, cells were transfected with 5 μg of respective plasmids by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Post-transfection cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM media for 4 h for synchronization of the cells in same phase. After 4 h, serum-free medium was replaced with fresh DMEM media with 10% FBS and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Apoptosis was induced by serum starvation for 12 h where the cells were incubated with DMEM medium containing 0.1% serum. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to trypsinization. Trypsinized cells were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and pelleted at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml. Annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences) staining was done as per the manufacturer's instructions. Dead cells were stained by propidium iodide (PI) (50 μg/ml). Cell sorting was performed in BD FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FITC and PI dual staining. Cells transfected with only vector was used as the control. Results were analyzed using BD FACSuite software (BD Biosciences). Various constructs used in this study were cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector. COS-7 cells were grown on poly d-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected with 2.5 μg of DNA for 24 h. Post-transfection cells were serum-starved by replacing the medium with serum-free media and grown for 9 h. Cells expressing the respective GFP constructs were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde and observed using fluorescence microscopy. The nucleus was stained with DAPI to differentiate the nucleus from cytoplasm. The images were captured using Carl Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Ziess AG, Germany) with 40× objective. HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged constructs of various proteins used in this study to determine the subcellular localization. GFP-tagged constructs were used to differentiate between endogenous and overexpressed protein. 24 h post transfection cells were serum-starved to induce apoptosis. Cells were washed with PBS and fractionation buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 5 mm KCl, and protease inhibitor mixture was added and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed by passing through a 27-gauge needle 25 times and centrifuged at 450 × g for 10 min, and the pellet (nuclear fraction) and supernatant (cytosolic + membrane fraction) were saved. Supernatant was then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min to separate the membrane and cytosolic fraction. The membrane and nuclear fraction were then solubilized using lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent and used for Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear proteins (50 μg) was taken for Western blot analysis. Transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors). Total protein was estimated by the BCA method using BSA as the standard. 50 μg of total protein was loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was blocked using blocking buffer with BSA (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25 °C. Immunoblotting was done using hPLSCR1 and hPLSCR2 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz), and detection was performed using an ECL kit (Thermo Scientific kit). To check the protein expression levels of all four constructs, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged gene constructs. After 18 h of transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and Western blots were developed as described above with rabbit monoclonal antibodies specific to GFP (Promega) and β-actin (Sigma, mouse) with 1:5000 dilutions. The bands were visualized by Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad). Stains-All, a cationic carbocyanine dye, was used to monitor the calcium binding properties of hPLSCR1 and -2 and mutant constructs. Stains-All was dissolved in 2 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.2) containing 30% ethylene glycol. Stains-All produces a series of discrete spectra depending upon interaction and conformation of binding region (27Caday C.G. Lambooy P.K. Steiner R.F. The interaction of Ca2+-binding proteins with the carbocyanine dye stains-all.Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 1579-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The free form of the dye produces two distinctive spectra at 535 nm (β-band) and 575 nm (α-band) that correspond to the monomeric and dimeric form of the dye. In the presence of EF-hand containing proteins, Stains-All dye produces a discrete band at 650 nm termed J band. For competition experiments, to the protein-Stains-All complex 2 and 4 mm Ca2+ was added, and the spectrum was monitored. Additionally Tb3+, an isomorphous luminescent replacement probe for Ca2+, was used for Ca2+ binding studies. It has a broad excitation spectrum that overlaps with the emission spectrum of tyrosine and tryptophan. This allows the energy transfer between protein and terbium, giving distinctive luminescent peaks at 490 and 547 nm (28Brittain H.G. Richardson F.S. Martin R.B. Terbium (III) emission as a probe of calcium(II) binding sites in proteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 8255-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Protein was titrated with small aliquots of terbium chloride (TbCl3) ranging between 50 and 700 μm, and samples were excited at 295 nm, and emission spectrum was recorded between 310 and 560 nm with a scan speed of 100 nm/min and bandwidths of 5 nm each. Additionally the binding affinity of all the proteins used in this study with Ca2+ and Mg2+ was determined. 2 μm concentrations of the respective proteins were titrated with small aliquots of CaCl2 and MgCl2 (5 mm increments until saturation) independently. Binding constants were determined by a Scatchard plot using nonlinear curve-fitting (Prism 5.0 GraphPad Software). Curve-fitting was done for the fraction of ligand sites occupied [(Fo − F)/(Fo − FS)] versus ligand concentration using the one-site binding nonlinear regression analysis, where Fo is fluorescence in the absence of ligand, FS is fluorescence at saturation ligand concentration, F is fluorescence in the presence of a particular ligand concentration, Bmax is the maximum specific binding, and Kd is the dissociation constant (mm). Fo−FFo−Fs=Bmax[Ca2+]Kd+[Ca2+](Eq. 1) Far UV-CD spectra were recorded using JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton MD) at 25 °C with a thermostat cell holder. Samples were scanned using 1-mm path length cuvettes from 250 to 190 nm. Protein surface hydrophobicity changes were monitored using 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) (29Daniel E. Weber G. Cooperative effects in binding by bovine serum albumin. I. The binding of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate. Fluorimetric titrations.Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). 10 μm protein in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 200 mm NaCl was used to perform the assay without the addition of Brij-35 to the buffer due to its interference with ANS emission spectra. ANS dye is weakly fluorescent in water (emission at 530 nm) and the fluorescence emission increases only when ANS is bound to protein, which in turn exposes the hydrophobic patches to the surface. The ANS binding of protein was monitored by recording the emission between 400 and 650 nm after excitation at 365 nm with a scan speed of 100 nm/min and bandwidth of 10 nm each. ANS binding to the protein alters the emission maxima from 530 to 460 nm. Trypsin digestion was used to monitor conformation changes in WT hPLSCR2 and PRD hPLSCR2. The protein-lipid (1:20) ratio was incubated with and without Ca2+ at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently trypsin (1:75 w/w) was added to the protein lipid mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The digested samples were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE. UV absorbance at 360 nm is a routine method to monitor the formation of protein aggregates in solution. A protein with a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was used to monitor Ca2+-dependent aggregation. Time course measurement of absorbance at 360 nm was performed for 30 min at 25 °C using V-670 Jasco UV-visible spectrophotometer. Apoprotein absorbance at 360 nm in the buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.025% Brij-35 was recorded in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette with a bandwidth of 1 nm. The absorbance of protein incubated with 4 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C was measured. To determine the size of the aggregates, dynamic light scattering was performed by using Zetatrac particle size analyzer. A particle size analyzer measures the size distribution by velocity of the particles dispersed in the buffer. For particle size distribution of each sample, proteins (0.5 mg/ml) in the presence and absence of 4 mm Ca2+ was monitored with a run time of 60 s and 15 repetitions. The results were analyzed by Microtrac-FLEX software 10.5.3. hPLSCR1, hPLSCR2, PRD-hPLSCR2, and Δ100-hPLSCR1 constructs as in Fig. 1A were overexpressed and purified from inclusion bodies to homogeneity as described earlier (25Francis V.G. Majeed M.A. Gummadi S.N. Recovery of functionally active recombinant human phospholipid scramblase 1 from inclusion bodies using N-lauroylsarcosine.J. Ind. Microbiol.

https://openalex.org/W2171257746,"Background Atherothrombotic diseases including cerebrovascular disease (CVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), contribute to the major causes of death in the world. Although several studies showed the association between polyvascular disease and poor cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in Asian population, there was no large-scale study to validate this relationship in this population. Methods and Results This retrospective cohort study included patients with a diagnosis of CVD, CAD, or PAD from the database contained in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Bureau during 2001–2004. A total of 19954 patients were enrolled in this study. The atherothrombotic disease score was defined according to the number of atherothrombotic disease. The study endpoints included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), all strokes, vascular procedures, in hospital mortality, and so on. The event rate of ischemic stroke (18.2%) was higher than that of acute myocardial infarction (5.7%) in our patients (P = 0.0006). In the multivariate Cox regression analyses, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of each increment of atherothrombotic disease score in predicting ACS, all strokes, vascular procedures, and in hospital mortality were 1.41, 1.66, 1.30, and 1.14, respectively (P≦0.0169). Conclusions This large population-based longitudinal study in patients with atherothrombotic disease demonstrated the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke was higher than that of subsequent AMI. In addition, the subsequent adverse CV events including ACS, all stroke, vascular procedures, and in hospital mortality were progressively increased as the increase of atherothrombotic disease score."
https://openalex.org/W2059543583,"The 6 minutes walk test (6MWT) is often shown to be the best predictor of mortality in pulmonary hypertension (PH) probably because it challenges the failing heart to deliver adequate cardiac output. We hypothesised that the 6MWT elicits maximal cardiac output as measured during a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).18 patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (n = 12) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 6) and 10 healthy subjects performed a 6MWT and CPET with measurements of cardiac output (non invasive rebreathing device) before and directly after exercise. Heart rate was measured during 6MWT with a cardiofrequence meter.Cardiac output and heart rate measured at the end of the 6MWT were linearly related to 6MW distance (mean±SD: 490±87 m). Patients with a high NT-pro-BNP achieve a maximum cardiac output during the 6MWT, while in normal subjects and in patients with a low-normal NT-proBNP, cardiac output at the end of a 6MWT was lower than achieved at maximum exercise during a CPET. In both cases, heart rate is the major determinant of exercise-induced increase in cardiac output. However, stroke volume increased during CPET in healthy subjects, not in PH patients.Maximal cardiac output is elicited by 6MWT in PH patients with failing right ventricle. Cardiac output increase is dependent on chronotropic response in patients with PH."
https://openalex.org/W2132857127,"Background Live attenuated influenza vaccine viruses (LAIVs) can be generated by classical reassortment of gene segments between a cold adapted, temperature sensitive and attenuated Master Donor Virus (MDV) and a seasonal wild-type (wt) virus. The vaccine candidates contain hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes derived from the circulating wt viruses and the remaining six genes derived from the MDV strains. Rapid, efficient selection of the viruses with 6∶2 genome compositions from the large number of genetically different viruses generated during reassortment is essential for the biannual production schedule of vaccine viruses. Methodology/Principal Findings This manuscript describes a new approach for the genotypic analysis of LAIV reassortant virus clones based on pyrosequencing. LAIV candidate viruses were created by classical reassortment of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) (A/Victoria/361/2011, A/Ohio/02/2012, A/Texas/50/2012) or influenza A (H7N9) (A/Anhui/1/2013) wt viruses with the MDV A/Leningrad/134/17/57(H2N2). Using strain-specific pyrosequencing assays, mixed gene variations were detected in the allantoic progenies during the cloning procedure. The pyrosequencing analysis also allowed for estimation of the relative abundance of segment variants in mixed populations. This semi-quantitative approach was used for selecting specific clones for the subsequent cloning procedures. Conclusions/Significance The present study demonstrates that pyrosequencing analysis is a useful technique for rapid and reliable genotyping of reassortants and intermediate clones during the preparation of LAIV candidates, and can expedite the selection of vaccine virus candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1974031202,"Background The response to cytotoxic chemotherapy varies greatly in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and molecular markers may be useful in determining a preferable therapeutic approach for individual patients. This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the predictive value of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M1 (RRM1) on the therapeutic efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC who received platinum doublet chemotherapy (n = 229) were included in this retrospective study, and their clinical outcomes were analyzed according to RRM1 expression. Results In patients receiving gemcitabine-based therapy, the disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with RRM1-negative tumors were significantly higher than in patients with RRMI-positive tumors (P = 0.041 and P = 0.01, respectively), and multivariate analysis showed that RRM1 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.013). No similar differences were found in patients receiving docetaxel- or vinorelbine-based therapy. In RRM1-positive patients, the DCRs for docetaxel and vinorelbine were higher than for gemcitabine (P = 0.047 and P = 0.047, respectively), and docetaxel and vinorelbine showed a longer PFS than gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.007). No similar differences were found among patients with RRM1-negative tumors. Conclusions Negative RRM1 expression in advanced NSCLC is associated with a higher response rate to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. In patients with RRM1-positive tumors, docetaxel and vinorelbine showed a higher therapeutic efficacy than gemcitabine-based therapy. Additional prospective studies are needed to investigate the predictive meaning of RRM1 in the response to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2083994547,"Maggots of the blowfly Lucilia sericata are used for the treatment of chronic wounds. As haemostatic processes play an important role in wound healing, this study focused on the effects of maggot secretions on coagulation and fibrinolysis. The results showed that maggot secretions enhance plasminogen activator-induced formation of plasmin and fibrinolysis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. By contrast, coagulation was not affected by secretions. Biochemical studies indicated that a novel serine protease within secretions, designated Sericase, cleaved plasminogen to several fragments. Recombinant Sericase degraded plasminogen leading amongst others to the formation of the mini-plasminogen like fragment Val454-plasminogen. In addition, the presence of a non-proteolytic cofactor in secretions was discovered, which plays a role in the enhancement of plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis by Sericase. We conclude from our in vitro studies that the novel serine protease Sericase, with the aid of a non-proteolytic cofactor, enhances plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2029453266,"Rangewide studies of genetic parameters can elucidate patterns and processes that operate only over large geographic scales. Herein, we present a rangewide population genetic assessment of the eastern box turtle Terrapene c. carolina, a species that is in steep decline across its range. To inform conservation planning for this species, we address the hypothesis that disruptions to demographic and movement parameters associated with the decline of the eastern box turtle has resulted in distinctive genetic signatures in the form of low genetic diversity, high population structuring, and decreased gene flow. We used microsatellite genotype data from (n = 799) individuals from across the species range to perform two Bayesian population assignment approaches, two methods for comparing historical and contemporary migration among populations, an evaluation of isolation by distance, and a method for detecting barriers to gene flow. Both Bayesian methods of population assignment indicated that there are two populations rangewide, both of which have maintained high levels of genetic diversity (HO = 0.756). Evidence of isolation by distance was detected in this species at a spatial scale of 300-500 km, and the Appalachian Mountains were identified as the primary barrier to gene flow across the species range. We also found evidence for historical but not contemporary migration between populations. Our prediction of many, highly structured populations across the range was not supported. This may point to cryptic contemporary gene flow, which might in turn be explained by the presence of rare transients in populations. However these data may be influenced by historical signatures of genetic connectivity because individuals of this species can be long-lived."
https://openalex.org/W2083617394,"Introduction In this study, we assessed the relationship of insular strokes and plasma MR-proANP levels with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (NDAF). Methods This study is based on a prospective acute stroke cohort (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00390962). Patient eligibility was dependent on the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, absence of previous stroke based on past medical history and MRI, no history of AF and congestive heart failure (cohort A) and, additionally, no stroke lesion size ≥ 20 mL (sub-cohort A*). AF, the primary endpoint, was detected on 24-hour electrocardiography and/or echocardiography. Involvement of the insula was assessed by two experienced readers on MRI blinded to clinical data. MR-proANP levels were obtained through a novel sandwich immunoassay. Logistic-regression-models were fitted to estimate odds ratios for the association of insular strokes and MR-proANP with NDAF. The discriminatory accuracy of insular strokes and MR-proANP was assessed by a model-wise comparison of the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics-curve (AUC) with known predictors of AF. Results 104 (cohort A) and 83 (cohort A*) patients fulfilled above-mentioned criteria. Patients with isolated insular strokes had a 10.7-fold higher odds of NDAF than patients with a small ischemic stroke at any other location. The AUC of multivariate logistic regression models for the prediction of NDAF improved significantly when adding stroke location and MR-proANP levels. Moreover, MR-proANP levels remained significantly elevated throughout the acute hospitalization period in patients with NDAF compared to those without. Conclusions Isolated insular strokes and plasma MR-proANP levels on admission are independent predictors of NDAF and significantly improve the prediction accuracy of identifying patients with NDAF compared to known predictors including age, the NIHSS and lesion size. To accelerate accurate diagnosis and enhance secondary prevention in acute stroke, higher levels of MR-proANP and insular strokes may represent easily accessible indicators of AF if confirmed in an independent validation cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2037091303,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a cutaneous amphibian fungus that causes the lethal disease chytridiomycosis, has been implicated as a cause of many amphibian declines. Bd can tolerate low temperatures with an optimum thermal range from 17-24°C. It has been shown that Bd infection may result in species extinction, avoiding the transmission threshold presented by density dependent transmission theory. Prevalence of Bd during autumn and winter has been shown to be as low as 0% in some species. It is currently unclear how Bd persists in field conditions and what processes result in carry-over between seasons. It has been hypothesised that overwintering tadpoles may host Bd between breeding seasons. The Great Barred Frog (Mixophyes fasciolatus) is a common, stable and widespread species in Queensland, Australia, and is known to carry Bd. Investigation into Bd infection of different life stages of M. fasciolatus during seasonally low prevalence may potentially reveal persistence and carry-over methods between seasons. Metamorphs, juveniles, and adults were swabbed for Bd infection over three months (between March and May, 2011) at 5 sites of varying altitude (66 m-790 m). A total of 93 swabs were analysed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) real-time analysis. PCR analysis showed 6 positive (1 excluded), 4 equivocal and 83 negative results for infection with Bd. Equivocal results were assumed to be negative using the precautionary principle. The 5 positive results consisted of 4 emerging (Gosner stage 43-45) metamorphs and 1 adult M. fasciolatus. Fisher's exact test on prevalence showed that the prevalence was significantly different between life stages. All positive results were sampled at high altitudes (790 m); however prevalence was not significantly different between altitudes. Infection of emerging metamorphs suggests that individuals were infected as tadpoles. We hypothesise that M. fasciolatus tadpoles carry Bd through seasons. Thus, Mixophyes fasciolatus may act as disease reservoirs at multiple life stages."
https://openalex.org/W2050863323,"Vaccines for cancer immunotherapy are of interest but in general have not yet achieved the desired therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. We present here a novel model to evaluate vaccine strategies by following tissue destruction in a transgenic model, where a defined antigen is expressed on pancreatic islets. We found that the transfer of syngeneic antigen-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) resulted in autoimmune cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation that was not observed following vaccinations that were based on peptides and adjuvants. Importantly, the induction of diabetes by DC transfer is dependent upon the maturation of DCs prior to transfer. Furthermore, diabetes induction only occurred if DCs were pulsed with the immunodominant epitope in addition to at least one other peptide, suggesting greater cytolytic activity upon engagement of multiple T-cell specificities. While the tumor environment undoubtedly will be more complex than healthy tissue, the insights gained through this model provide useful information on variables that can affect CD8-mediated tissue cytolysis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1987991921,"Selecting seeds for long-term storage is a key factor for food hoarding animals. Siberian chipmunks (Tamias sibiricus) remove the pericarp and scatter hoard sound acorns of Quercus mongolica over those that are insect-infested to maximize returns from caches. We have no knowledge of whether these chipmunks remove the pericarp from acorns of other species of oaks and if this behavior benefits seedling establishment. In this study, we tested whether Siberian chipmunks engage in this behavior with acorns of three other Chinese oak species, Q. variabilis, Q. aliena and Q. serrata var. brevipetiolata, and how the dispersal and germination of these acorns are affected. Our results show that when chipmunks were provided with sound and infested acorns of Quercus variabilis, Q. aliena and Q. serrata var. brevipetiolata, the two types were equally harvested and dispersed. This preference suggests that Siberian chipmunks are incapable of distinguishing between sound and insect-infested acorns. However, Siberian chipmunks removed the pericarp from acorns of these three oak species prior to dispersing and caching them. Consequently, significantly more sound acorns were scatter hoarded and more infested acorns were immediately consumed. Additionally, indoor germination experiments showed that pericarp removal by chipmunks promoted acorn germination while artificial removal showed no significant effect. Our results show that pericarp removal allows Siberian chipmunks to effectively discriminate against insect-infested acorns and may represent an adaptive behavior for cache management. Because of the germination patterns of pericarp-removed acorns, we argue that the foraging behavior of Siberian chipmunks could have potential impacts on the dispersal and germination of acorns from various oak species."
https://openalex.org/W2038893924,"Stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors initiates a signaling cascade that activates PI3K. Activated PI3K uses PIP2 to generate PIP3, which recruit Akt to the plasma membrane through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, permitting its activation by PDKs. Activated Akt controls important biological functions, including cell metabolism, proliferation and survival. The PI3K pathway is therefore an attractive target for drug discovery. However, current assays for measurement of PIP3 production are technically demanding and not amenable to high-throughput screening. We have established a MCF-7-derived breast cancer cell line, that stably co-expresses the PH domain of Akt fused to Renilla luciferase and YFP fused to a membrane localization signal. This BRET biosensor pair permits to monitor, in real time, in living cells, PIP3 production at the plasma membrane upon stimulation by different ligands, including insulin, the insulin analogue glargine, IGF1, IGF2 and EGF. Moreover, several known inhibitors that target different steps of the PI3K/Akt pathway caused inhibition of ligand-induced BRET. Cetuximab, a humanized anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of cancer, completely inhibited EGF-induced BRET, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostine AG1024 inhibited insulin effect on PIP3 production. Moreover, the effects of insulin and IGF1 were inhibited by molecules that inhibit PI3K catalytic activity or the interaction between PIP3 and the PH domain of Akt. Finally, we showed that human serum induced a dose-dependent increase in BRET signal, suggesting that this stable clone may be used as a prognostic tool to evaluate the PI3K stimulatory activity present in serum of human patients. We have thus established a cell line, suitable for the screening and/or the study of molecules with stimulatory or inhibitory activities on the PI3K/Akt pathway that will constitute a new tool for translational research in diabetes and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2333982423,"Sacoglossans are specialized marine herbivores that tend to have a close evolutionary relationship with their macroalgal hosts, but the widely distributed species Elysia viridis can associate with several algal species. However, most previous investigations on the field abundance and size distribution of E. viridis have focussed on Codium spp. in the British Isles, and algae from this genus are considered superior hosts for E. viridis. In the present study, we investigated the abundance and size distribution of E. viridis on 6 potential host algae with differing morphologies (the septate species Cladophora sericea, Cladophora rupestris, Chaetomorpha melagonium, and Ceramium virgatum, as well as the siphonaceous species Codium fragile and Bryopsis sp.) at 2 sites on the Swedish west coast over the course of a year. In spring, slugs were almost absent from all algal hosts. In summer and autumn, E. viridis consistently occurred on several of the algal species at both sites. The highest number of small E. viridis were found on C. sericea, intermediate numbers of significantly larger E. viridis were found on C. rupestris, while fewer, intermediate sized animals were found on C. fragile. Throughout the study period, only a few E. viridis individuals were found on C. melagonium, Bryopsis sp., and C. virgatum. Our results indicate that E. viridis is an annual species in Sweden, capable of exploiting co-occurring congeneric and intergeneric algal hosts with differing morphologies. These results corroborate previous findings that E. viridis can exploit several different algal species, but does not indicate that C. fragile is a superior host."
https://openalex.org/W1966948969,"Both tumor cells and their supporting endothelial cells should be considered for targeted cell killing when designing cancer treatments. Here we investigated the feasibility of combining radioiodide and antiangiogenic therapies after baculovirus-mediated transfer of genes encoding the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and plasminogen kringle 5 (K5).A recombinant baculovirus containing the NIS gene under control of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter and the K5 gene driven by the early growth response 1 (Egr1) promoter was developed. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the activation of hTERT transcription. NIS and K5 gene expression were identified by Western blot and Real-Time PCR. Functional NIS activity in baculovirus-infected Hela cells was confirmed by the uptake of 125I and cytotoxicity of 131I. The apoptotic effect of 131I-induced K5 on baculovirus-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was analyzed by a flow cytometry-based assay. In vivo, NIS reporter gene imaging and therapeutic experiments with 131I were performed. Finally, the microvessel density (MVD) in tumors after treatment was determined by CD31 immunostaining.The activation of hTERT transcription was specifically up-regulated in tumor cells. NIS gene expression markedly increased in baculovirus-infected HeLa cells, but not in MRC5 cells. The Hela cells showed a significant increase of 125I uptake, which was inhibited by NaClO4, and a notably decreased cell survival rate by 131I treatment. Expression of the K5 gene induced by 131I was elevated in a dose- and time-dependent manner and resulted in the apoptosis of HUVECs. Furthermore, 131I SPECT imaging clearly showed cervical tumor xenografts infected with recombinant baculovirus. Following therapy, tumor growth was significantly retarded. CD31 immunostaining confirmed a significant decrease of MVD.The recombinant baculovirus supports a promising strategy of NIS-based raidoiodide therapy combined with K5-based antiangiogenic therapy by targeting both the tumor and its supporting vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2044484003,"Previous research has shown that loneliness has a heritable component and that genes within the serotonin-, dopamine-, and oxytocin systems are related to loneliness in adolescence. In the present study, the relation between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and loneliness in adolescent boys and girls was examined in a longitudinal study spanning five annual waves (N = 305). Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) was used to examine the baseline level and the change in loneliness over time. The main finding was that the BDNF gene was not related to loneliness in the total sample. A BDNF by sex interaction was found, in that Met carrying girls had the highest levels of loneliness at baseline, whereas in boys the ValVal genotype was related to higher levels of loneliness. Our results underline the importance of sex-stratified analyses when examining effects of the BDNF genotype and the necessity of conducting gene studies to intermediate phenotypes of loneliness."
https://openalex.org/W2090429533,"The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmids pMCBF1 and pMCBF6 was determined and analyzed. pMCBF1 and pMCBF6 form a novel clade within the IncP-1 plasmid family designated IncP-1 ς. The plasmids were exogenously isolated earlier from a marine biofilm. pMCBF1 (62 689 base pairs; bp) and pMCBF6 (66 729 bp) have identical backbones, but differ in their mercury resistance transposons. pMCBF1 carries Tn5053 and pMCBF6 carries Tn5058. Both are flanked by 5 bp direct repeats, typical of replicative transposition. Both insertions are in the vicinity of a resolvase gene in the backbone, supporting the idea that both transposons are “res-site hunters” that preferably insert close to and use external resolvase functions. The similarity of the backbones indicates recent insertion of the two transposons and the ongoing dynamics of plasmid evolution in marine biofilms. Both plasmids also carry the insertion sequence ISPst1, albeit without flanking repeats. ISPs1is located in an unusual site within the control region of the plasmid. In contrast to most known IncP-1 plasmids the pMCBF1/pMCBF6 backbone has no insert between the replication initiation gene (trfA) and the vegetative replication origin (oriV). One pMCBF1/pMCBF6 block of about 2.5 kilo bases (kb) has no similarity with known sequences in the databases. Furthermore, insertion of three genes with similarity to the multidrug efflux pump operon mexEF and a gene from the NodT family of the tripartite multi-drug resistance-nodulation-division (RND) system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found. They do not seem to confer antibiotic resistance to the hosts of pMCBF1/pMCBF6, but the presence of RND on promiscuous plasmids may have serious implications for the spread of antibiotic multi-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1963541102,"We explored the social-signaling hypothesis that variability in exogenous pain sensitivities across the menstrual cycle is moderated by women's current romantic relationship status and hence the availability of a solicitous social partner for expressing pain behaviors in regular, isochronal ways. In two studies, we used the menstrual calendars of healthy women to provide a detailed approximation of the women's probability of conception based on their current cycle-day, along with relationship status, and cold pressor pain and ischemic pain sensitivities, respectively. In the first study (n = 135; 18-46 yrs., Mage = 23 yrs., 50% natural cycling), we found that naturally-cycling, pair-bonded women showed a positive correlation between the probability of conception and ischemic pain intensity (r = .45), associations not found for single women or hormonal contraceptive-users. A second study (n = 107; 19-29 yrs., Mage = 20 yrs., 56% natural cycling) showed a similar association between greater conception risk and higher cold-pressor pain intensity in naturally-cycling, pair-bonded women only (r = .63). The findings show that variability in exogenous pain sensitivities across different fertility phases of the menstrual cycle is contingent on basic elements of women's social environment and inversely correspond to variability in naturally occurring, perimenstrual symptoms. These findings have wide-ranging implications for: a) standardizing pain measurement protocols; b) understanding basic biopsychosocial pain-related processes; c) addressing clinical pain experiences in women; and d) understanding how pain influences, and is influenced by, social relationships."

Health service planners must deliver routine and emergency services and, in recent Games, health legacy initiatives, for the local and visiting population. However there is little evidence to support their planning decisions. We therefore evaluated the strategic health planning programme for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to identify generalisable information for future Games. Methods We thematically analysed data from stakeholder interviews and documents. The data were prospectively collected in three phases, before, during and after the Games. Findings We identified five key themes: (1) Systemic Improvement for example in communications, (2) Effective relationships led to efficiencies and permanent gains, such as new relationships with the private sector (3) Difficult relationships led to inefficiencies, for instance, duplication in testing and exercising emergency scenarios, (4) Tendency to over-estimate demand for care, particularly emergency medicine, and (5) Difficulties establishing a health legacy due to its deprioritisation and lack of vision by the programme team. Interpretation Enduring improvements which are sustained after the Games are possible, such as the establishment of new and productive partnerships. Relationships must be established early on to avoid duplication, delay and unnecessary expense. There should be greater critical evaluation of the likely demand for health services to reduce the wasting of resources. Finally, if a health legacy is planned, then clear definitions and commitment to its measurement is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2017431749,"PEM capsules have been proposed for vehicles of drug microencapsulation, with the release triggered by pH, salt, magnetic field, or light. When built on another carrier encapsulating drugs, such as nanoparticles, it could provide additional release barrier to the releasing drug, providing further control to drug release. Although liposomes have received considerable attention with PEM coating for sustained drug release, similar results employing PEM built on poly(lactic-co-lycolic acid) (PLGA) particles is scant. In this work, we demonstrate that the build-up pH and polyelectrolyte pairs of PEM affect the release retardation of BSA from PLGA particles. PAH/PSS pair, the most commonly used polyelectrolyte pair, was used in comparison with PLL/DES. In addition, we also demonstrate that the release retardation effect of PEM-coated PLGA particles diminishes as the particle size increases. We attribute this to the diminishing relative thickness of the PEM coating with respect to the size of the particle as the particle size increases, reducing the diffusional resistance of the PEM."
https://openalex.org/W1987354706,"The molecular chaperone Hsp90 buffers the effects of genetic variation by assisting the stabilization and folding of multiple clients critical for cell signaling and growth. We identified an interaction of Hsp90 and associated proteins with the essential nucleolar protein, Utp21, part of a large complex required for biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit. The utp21-S602F mutation, which causes minor defects in otherwise wild-type yeast, exhibited severe or lethal growth defects when combined with mutations in Hsp90 or co-chaperones. WT Utp21 and Utp21-S602F exhibited similar interactions with Hsp90, and steady-state levels of WT Utp21 were reduced upon Hsp90 mutation or inhibition. Mutations in the human homolog of UTP21, WDR36, have been associated with adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Three different mutant forms of Utp21 analogous to glaucoma-associated WDR36 mutations exhibit reduced levels in yeast cells expressing mutations in Hsp90 or associated chaperones, suggesting that Hsp90 and co-chaperones buffer the effects of those mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2088890362,"DNA can be concatenated by hybridization of DNA fragments with protruding single-stranded termini. DNA cleavage occurring at a nucleotide containing a DNA base analogue is a useful method to obtain DNA with designed protruding termini. Here, we report a novel non-enzymatic DNA cleavage reaction for DNA concatenation. We found that DNA is cleaved at a nucleotide containing 5-ethynyluracil in a methylamine aqueous solution to generate 5'-phosphorylated DNA fragment as a cleavage product. We demonstrated that the reaction can be applied to DNA concatenation of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. This novel non-enzymatic DNA cleavage reaction is a simple practical approach for DNA concatenation."
https://openalex.org/W2024868612,"Vertebrate limbs originate from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) and the overlying ectoderm. While normal limb formation in defined regions has been well studied, the question of whether other positions retain limb-forming potential has not been fully investigated in mice. By ectopically activating β-catenin in the ectoderm with Msx2-cre, we observed that local tissue outgrowths were induced, which either progressed into limb-like structure within the inter-limb flank or formed extra tissues in other parts of the mouse embryo. In the presumptive abdominal region of severely affected embryos, ectopic limb formation was coupled with impaired abdominal ventral body wall (AVBW) closure, which indicates the existence of a potential counterbalance of limb formation and AVBW closure. At the molecular level, constitutive β-catenin activation was sufficient to trigger, but insufficient to maintain the ectopic expression of a putative limb-inducing factor, Fgf8, in the ectoderm. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of limb formation and AVBW closure, and the crosstalk between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and Fgf signal."
https://openalex.org/W2086569396,"Aims To demonstrate that p53 modulates endothelial function and the stress response to a high-fat western diet (WD). Methods and Results Three-month old p53+/+ wild type (WT) and p53+/− male mice were fed a regular or WD for 3 months. Plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol were significantly elevated (p<0.05) in WD-fed WT (from 2.1±0.2 mmol/L to 3.1±0.2, and from 0.64±0.09 mmol/L to 1.25±0.11, respectively) but not in p53+/− mice. The lack of cholesterol accumulation in WD-fed p53+/− mice was ass–ociated with high bile acid plasma concentrations (p53+/− = 4.7±0.9 vs. WT = 3.3±0.2 μmol/L, p<0.05) concomitant with an increased hepatic 7-alpha-hydroxylase mRNA expression. While the WD did not affect aortic endothelial relaxant function in p53+/− mice (WD = 83±5 and RD = 82±4% relaxation), it increased the maximal response to acetylcholine in WT mice (WD = 87±2 vs. RD = 62±5% relaxation, p<0.05) to levels of p53+/−. In WT mice, the rise in TC associated with higher (p<0.05) plasma levels of pro-inflammatory keratinocyte-derived chemokine, and an over-activation (p<0.05) of the relaxant non-nitric oxide/non-prostacyclin endothelial pathway. It is likely that in WT mice, activations of these pathways are adaptive and contributed to maintain endothelial function, while the WD neither promoted inflammation nor affected endothelial function in p53+/− mice. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that low endogenous p53 expression prevents the rise in circulating levels of cholesterol when fed a WD. Consequently, the endothelial stress of hypercholesterolemia is absent in young p53+/− mice as evidenced by the absence of endothelial adaptive pathway over-activation to minimize stress-related damage."
