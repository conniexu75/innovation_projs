https://openalex.org/W2002780348,"We previously reported the isolation of a gene (FMR-1) expressed in brain at the fragile X locus. One exon of this gene lies within an EcoRI fragment that exhibits length variation in fragile X patients. This exon also contains the CGG repeat within the CpG island hypermethylated in fragile X patients. To study the involvement of the FMR-1 gene in the fragile X syndrome, its expression was studied in lymphoblastoid cell lines and leukocytes derived from patients and normal controls. FMR-1 mRNA was absent in the majority of male fragile X patients, suggesting a close involvement of this gene in development of the syndrome. Normal individuals and carriers all show expression. The methylation status of the BssHII site at the CpG island was also studied by Southern blot analysis of DNA from patients, carriers, and controls. The minority of fragile X affected males that show expression of FMR-1 demonstrated an associated incomplete methylation of the BssHII site."

https://openalex.org/W2008434851,"We have designed an in vitro system in which Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells are cocultured in collagen gels with fibroblasts under conditions precluding heterocellular contact. Using this experimental approach, we have obtained evidence that fibroblast-derived soluble factors play a crucial role in the control of epithelial morphogenesis. First, MDCK cells suspended alone in collagen gels form spherical cysts, whereas in the presence of fibroblasts they form branching tubules. Second, MDCK cells grown as a monolayer on fibroblast-containing collagen gels invade the underlying matrix, within which they form a network of tubules. Third, fibroblast-conditioned medium mimics the effects of coculture by eliciting tubulogenesis by MDCK cells. These results demonstrate the involvement of diffusible paracrine factors in morphogenetic epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and provide a strategy for their molecular characterization."

We report the establishment of a nestin-positive cell line, HiB5, from embryonic precursor cells to the rat hippocampus. Since it was immortalized using the temperature-sensitive allele tsA58 of SV40 large T antigen, these cells grow continuously at 33 degrees C, but not at 39 degrees C, the body temperature of rodents. To test their developmental capacity, HiB5 cells were implanted into both the neonatal hippocampus and cerebellum. The cells integrated into the host tissue and acquired morphologies characteristic of the neurons and glial cells found at the implant site. HiB5 cells might thus be useful in characterizing the signals regulating cell type determination in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1989475423,"Analysis of the heteromeric DNA binding protein GABP has revealed the interaction of two distinct peptide sequence motifs normally associated with proteins located in different cellular compartments. The alpha subunit of GABP contains an 85-amino acid segment related to the Ets family of DNA binding proteins. The ETS domain of GABP alpha facilitates weak binding to DNA and, together with an adjacent segment of 37 amino acids, mediates stable interaction with GABP beta. The beta subunit of GABP contains four imperfect repeats of a sequence present in several transmembrane proteins including the product of the Notch gene of Drosophila melanogaster. These amino-terminal repeats of GABP beta mediate stable interaction with GABP alpha and, when complexed with GABP alpha, directly contact DNA. These observations provide evidence for a distinct biochemical role for the 33-amino acid repeats, and suggest that they may serve as a module for the generation of specific dimerization interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2065018402,"The actII region, flanked by biosynthetic genes in the 25 kb act cluster of S. coelicolor, consists of four open reading frames, including a transcriptional activator for the biosynthetic genes, and genes controlling antibiotic export. A TTA codon (extremely rare in Streptomyces) is present both in actII-ORF2 (encoding a putative transmembrane export protein) and actII-ORF4 (the transcriptional activator gene). Change of the TTA in ORF4 to TTG reverses the normal interruption of actinorhodin synthesis caused by mutation in the pleiotropic regulatory gene bldA (which encodes the cell's tRNAbeuUA). We conclude that initiation of actinorhodin synthesis via the actII-ORF4 product, and the final step in production, antibiotic export, are twin targets via which bldA exerts developmental control of actinorhodin production."

https://openalex.org/W2037755199,"The mitochondrial genome of Trypanosoma brucei is organized in the form of a complex catenated network of circular DNA molecules. This mass of DNA, known as the kinetoplast, is present at a unique site in the single mitochondrion, and is replicated in a discrete, periodic S phase of the cell cycle. The single-copy nature of the kinetoplast suggests that there is a mechanism ensuring segregation fidelity of replicated copies to each daughter cell. Historically, speculation regarding the nature of this mechanism has often attributed significance to the close association between the kinetoplast and the flagellum basal body. We provide here direct evidence that this mitochondrial DNA complex is indeed linked to the basal body, and segregation of the kinetoplast DNA is dependent on a microtubule-mediated separation of the new and old flagellar basal bodies during the cell cycle. This unique system may represent the remnants of an evolutionarily archaic mechanism for genome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2043158983,"Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on a specificity factor, CPF, recognizing the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA. This paper describes an apparently novel poly(A)-binding protein that acts as a second specificity factor, mediating the recognition of the growing poly(A) tall. A transition from a slow initiation phase of polyadenylation to rapid elongation occurs when the growing tall is long enough to serve as a binding site for the poly(A)-binding protein. Elongation of an RNA carrying a tail of 10 or more adenylate residues can occur independently of CPF. A sharp decrease in the poly(A) chain growth rate after the addition of approximately 200 adenylate residues invites speculations about a role of the poly(A)-binding protein in poly(A) tail length control."

https://openalex.org/W2062034371,"Fatty acid hydroperoxides (lipoxygenase products) are metabolized to allene oxides by a type of dehydrase that has been detected in plants, corals, and starfish oocytes. The allene oxides are unstable epoxide precursors of more complex products such as jasmonic acid, the plant growth hormone. Characterization of the dehydrase enzyme of flaxseed revealed that it is a 55-kilodalton hemoprotein. The spectral characteristics of this dehydrase revealed it to be a cytochrome P-450. It operates with the remarkable activity of greater than or equal to 1000 turnovers per second. The results establish a new catalytic activity for a cytochrome P-450 and illustrate the cooperation of different oxygenases in pathways of fatty acid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2019401962,"A technique for producing non-peptide compounds (mimetics) of designed specificities was developed that permitted the synthesis of a conformationally restricted molecule that mimicked the binding and functional properties of monoclonal antibody (MAb) 87.92.6, which recognizes the reovirus type 3 cellular receptor. Binding of either MAb 87.92.6, peptide analogs, or 87.1-mimetic to the cellular receptor inhibited cellular proliferation. The mimetic was a synthetic beta-loop structure that mimics the second complementarity-determining region of the MAb. These studies may lead to strategies for the synthetic design of antibody complementarity regions, ligands, and other pharmacologically active agents that are water soluble, resistant to proteolysis, and nonimmunogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2028971512,An acceptor stem G3.U70 base pair is a major determinant of the identity of an alanine transfer RNA. Hairpin helices and RNA duplexes consisting of complementary single strands are aminoacylated with alanine if they contain G3.U70. Chemical synthesis of RNA duplexes enabled the introduction of base analogs that tested the role of specific functional groups in the major and minor grooves of the RNA helix. The results of these experiments indicate that an unpaired guanine 2-amino group at a specific position in the minor groove of an RNA helix marks a molecule for aminoacylation with alanine.
https://openalex.org/W1978655203,"Mediation of photoperiodic effects by indoleamines, especially melatonin, is known in higher vertebrates. A similar mechanism may occur in a unicellular alga, the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra. This organism entered the dormant stage of a cyst upon short-day treatment at lowered temperatures. Interruption of darkness by 2 hours of light prevented cyst formation, even when the overall duration of light was the same as in cyst-inducing short days. When given in a noninducing photoperiod, melatonin and an analog, 5-methoxytryptamine, substances that had previously been shown to occur in Gonyaulax, provoked cyst formation. Methoxylated indoleamines may play a role as mediators of darkness in this unicellular, in a similar way as in vertebrates, suggesting a common biochemical basis of photoperiodism."
https://openalex.org/W1555202681,"Apolipoprotein (apo) B48 is produced in the mammalian intestine by a tissue-specific RNA-editing mechanism, which mediates a C to U conversion at position 6666 in apoB mRNA. This generates an inframe translation stop codon (UAA) in place of glutamine (CAA) at position 2153. To establish the sequences required for editing we have used an in vitro conversion assay to monitor the editing of synthetic RNAs by rat intestinal extracts. Transcripts containing 55 nucleotides (positions 6649-6703) or more of human apoB mRNA sequence were edited in vitro. Transcripts containing 42 nucleotides (positions 6648-6689) and 26 nucleotides (positions 6662-6687) were edited at 62 and 24% efficiency, respectively, of the 55-nucleotide sequence. To delineate the precise sequence requirements for editing, mutants were generated where 6-nucleotide sections of the 55-base region were changed to anti-sense sequence. Mutation of the 12-nucleotide region immediately downstream of C-6666 abolished editing, and mutation of 6-base sequences immediately 3' and 5' of this 12-nucleotide region significantly reduced editing. Having identified the key region of interest, a panel of 46 mutant RNAs carrying single base substitutions or deletions between nucleotide positions 6657 and 6685 was constructed. Mutagenesis in the sequence 5'-TGATCAGTATA-3' (positions 6671-6681) downstream of C-6666 had the most dramatic effect, since almost all mutations abolished or greatly reduced conversion in vitro. These results suggest that editing is a highly sequence-specific process. We propose that this downstream region is a recognition and/or binding site for the editing enzyme. A search for this sequence in other genes may help to reveal other RNAs that undergo editing."
https://openalex.org/W1564465661,"Evidence from developing countries and volunteer studies indicates that immunity to Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli may be acquired, but the antigenic basis for this protection is poorly defined. We have purified to homogeneity four proteins with molecular weights of 28,000 (PEB1), 29,000 (PEB2), 30,000 (PEB3), and 31,000 (PEB4) from epidemic C. jejuni strain 81-176 using acid extraction and sequential ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatography. The relative amino acid compositions of these four proteins are similar. NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicates that all four proteins are different, although the first 35 amino acids of PEB2 and PEB3 are 51.4% homologous. Isoelectric focusing showed that all four are basic proteins with pI of 8.5 for PEB1 protein and greater than 9.3 for the others. Use of the purified proteins as antigens in an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) found that seroconversion to the PEB1 or PEB3 proteins occurred in 15 of 19 patients with sporadic C. jejuni or C. coli infection. In comparison, only two, six, and 14 of these patients seroconverted to PEB2, PEB4, or the acid extract antigen. In an ELISA with whole bacterial cells as antigens, antiserum to the acid-extracted antigens showed broad recognition of C. jejuni, C. coli, C. fetus, C. lari, and Helicobacter pylori. Antiserum to PEB1 recognized all 35 C. jejuni and all 15 C. coli strains but none of the isolates of the other three bacterial species. The PEB1 and PEB3 proteins appear to be candidate antigens for both a Campylobacter vaccine and for serological assays for the pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W2114840608,"Structural information defining an N-terminal sequence required for the membrane sorting of bacterial lipoproteins has been previously garnered through the study of a hybrid outer membrane (OM) lipo-beta-lactamase (LL) (Ghrayeb and Inouye (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 463-467). Introduction of an aspartate as the second residue of mature LL (D2 mutant) causes an inner membrane (IM) localization of this protein (Yamaguchi, K., Yu, F., and Inouye, M. (1988) Cell 53, 423-432). Introduction of as aspartate at the third residue of mature LL (D3) causes a weaker IM sorting signal and when present as the fourth residue (D4), normal OM sorting occurs. A positively charged residue at the second position (K2) has no effect on OM localization. Remarkably, glutamate substitution at either the second (E2) or third (E3) position does not interfere with OM sorting. Sorting of the mutant D2 LL can be partially suppressed by introduction of a positively charged histidine (D2H3) or lysine (D2K3) at residue 3 of the mature protein. These results indicate that both the negative charge of the aspartate residue and some structural feature not present in a glutamate residue are required for sorting to the IM. The suppression of IM localization of the D2H3 LL double mutant can be eliminated by growing Escherichia coli at pH 8.4 to reduce the histidine partial positive charge. This result supports the essentiality of a negative charge in IM localization and indicates that the committed step in lipoprotein sorting is made in a cellular compartment, the periplasm, at equilibrium with the external pH."
https://openalex.org/W1595934517,"Periplasmic permeases consist of a substrate-binding receptor, located in the periplasm, and a membrane-bound complex composed of two integral membrane proteins and two nucleotide-binding proteins. The receptor interacts with the membrane-bound complex, which, upon receiving this signal, is postulated to hydrolyze ATP and translocate the substrate. We show that a class of mutations in the membrane-bound complex of the histidine permease, which allow transport in the absence of the substrate-binding protein, hydrolyze ATP independently from any signal. The data are compatible with the notion that cross-membrane signaling between the liganded periplasmic receptor and the cytoplasmic ATP-binding sites initiates conformational changes leading to ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1518834515,"The recent isolation and sequencing of the rat liver prolactin (PRL) receptor cDNA (clone F3) revealed that the receptor is a small molecular weight protein (nonglycosylated form, Mr 33,000; glycosylated form, Mr 42,000) comprised of 291 amino acids. A second form of the PRL receptor exists (591 amino acids) that contains a much longer cytoplasmic domain. In the present study, site-directed point mutations of the 5 conserved cysteine (Cys) residues and of the three potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain of the rat PRL receptor were constructed to assess their involvement in hormone binding. In addition, a truncation mutant (T delta 237) lacking 55 of 57 intracellular amino acids was constructed to determine the influence of the cytoplasmic domain on ligand-receptor interactions. Binding studies of transiently transfected COS-7 cells demonstrated that serine substitution of the first 4 Cys residues (Cys12, Cys22, Cys51, and Cys62) completely eliminated binding of 125I-ovine PRL and 125I-U5 and -U6, two monoclonal antibodies that bind the receptor molecule outside the PRL-binding domain. RNA blot analysis of the transfected cells showed that both the wild-type and mutant clones had similar levels of expression of receptor mRNA. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that lack of PRL binding in these mutants was not due to incomplete processing of the protein, since the fully glycosylated Mr 42,000 form of the receptor was seen. Mutation of Cys184 had no effect on affinity or dimerization capacity of the receptor, suggesting the 5th cysteine is not directly involved in the binding domain. Carbohydrate groups of some receptors have been shown to be involved in ligand-receptor interactions as well as intracellular trafficking. This does not appear to be the case for the PRL receptor, since there was no corresponding decrease in affinity for PRL or cell surface receptor expression, following mutation of each of the 3 asparagine residues to aspartate. Interestingly, T delta 237 showed a 4-5-fold increase in affinity for PRL as well as a marked increase in the number of receptor sites. Whole cell binding assays also demonstrated that loss of the cytoplasmic domain lead to inefficient recycling of the receptor. These studies suggest that the first 4 conserved Cys residues are crucial for ligand binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1527793640,"Captopril ((2S)-1-(3-mercapto-2-methyl-propionyl)-L-proline) inhibited the bifunctional, Zn(2+)-containing enzyme leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase reversibly and competitively with Ki = 6.0 microM for leukotriene B4 formation and Ki = 60 nM for L-lysine-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis at pH 8. Inhibition was independent of pH between pH 7 and 8, the optimum range for each catalytic activity. Half-maximal inhibition of leukotriene B4 formation by intact erythrocytes and neutrophils required 50 and 88 microM captopril, respectively. In neutrophils and platelets neither 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, nor leukotriene C4 formation were reduced, indicating selective inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase, not 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, or leukotriene C4 synthase. In whole blood, captopril inhibited leukotriene B4 formation with an accompanying redistribution of substrate toward formation of cysteinyl leukotrienes. The decrease in leukotriene B4 was more substantial than the corresponding increase in cysteinyl leukotrienes suggesting that nonenzymatic hydration predominates over transcellular metabolism of leukotriene A4 by platelets during selective inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase. Enalapril dicarboxylic acid and Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-ProGln-Ile-Pro-Pro which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme: angiotensin I, bradykinin, and N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]Phe-Gly-Gly which are substrates; and chloride ions which activate angiotensin-converting enzyme did not modulate leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase activity. The results indicate that: (i) the sulfhydryl group of captopril is an important determinant for inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase, probably by binding to an active site Zn2+; (ii) aminopeptidase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase display differential susceptibility to inhibition; (iii) there is minimal functional similarity between angiotensin-converting enzyme (peptidyl dipeptidase) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase; (iv) captopril may be a useful prototype to identify more potent and selective leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1530752532,"The activity of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) was determined in microsomes from the liver and small intestine of rats with differing vitamin A status. In animals depleted of retinol, as judged by undetectable liver vitamin A stores and low plasma retinol concentrations, hepatic LRAT activity was almost undetectable, whether assayed with retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein or solvent-dispersed retinol. In contrast, neither the activity of intestinal LRAT nor that of acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase in either liver or intestine differed from that of vitamin A-adequate rats. During the course of vitamin A depletion, liver LRAT activity fell progressively, nearly in parallel to the decrease in plasma retinol concentration. Oral repletion of vitamin A-depleted rats with 0.8 mg of retinol resulted in a very rapid restoration of plasma retinol concentration and full recovery of hepatic LRAT activity within 24 h, together with deposition of retinyl ester in the liver. These data strongly implicate LRAT activity in liver as responsible for the storage of hepatic retinyl esters. Retention of the intestine's capacity to esterify retinol during vitamin A deficiency provides a mechanism for capture of dietary vitamin A, while reduced hepatic LRAT activity may function to redirect retinol in liver from storage to other metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1595218069,"A cDNA for rat cathepsin C (dipeptidylaminopeptidase I) was isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence of cathepsin C comprises 462 amino acid residues: 28 NH2-terminal residues corresponding to the signal peptide, 201 residues corresponding to the propeptide, and 233 COOH-terminal residues corresponding to the mature enzyme region. Four potential glycosylation sites were found, three located in the propeptide region, and one in the mature enzyme region. The amino acid sequence of mature cathepsin C has 39.5% identity to that of cathepsin H, 35.1% to that of cathepsin L, 30.1% to that of cathepsin B, and 33.3% to that of papain. Cathepsin C, therefore, is a member of the papain family, although its propeptide region is much longer than those of other cysteine proteinases and shows no significant amino acid sequence similarity to any other cysteine proteinase."
https://openalex.org/W2158141125,"RNA polymerase engaged in the joint complex with the lac repressor at the lac UV5 promoter cannot escape into elongation but generates abortive RNA oligomers. The joint complex actively transcribes a few initial base pairs in a reaction unusually sensitive to a decrease in the substrate concentration. The joint complex, however, fails to traverse a point in the initial transcribed sequence that normally requires a high concentration of the elongating substrate. Thus, the repressor acts by augmenting a natural high ""kNTP"" site (pause site) embedded in the promoter. A lethal RNA polymerase mutation that mimics the effect of the repressor leads to an analogous block of promoter clearance and shortened abortive product pattern on several promoters, reflecting the widespread occurrence of high kNTP sites in promoters."

https://openalex.org/W1605679263,"One of the major physiologic functions of erythrocytes is the mediation of chloride-bicarbonate exchange in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The anion exchange is mediated by a typical polytopic transmembrane protein in the cell membrane, designated Band 3. A carboxyl-terminal peptide of Band 3 was affinity-labeled with pyridoxal phosphate, a substrate for the anion transport system, and then sequenced (Kawano, Y., Okubo, K., Tokunaga, F., Miyata, T., Iwanaga, S., and Hamasaki, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8232-8238). The 10th amino acid residue of the peptide could not be determined, suggesting post-translational modification of the residue. In the present communication, we have investigated the molecular structure of human Band 3 and the COOH-terminal 8500-dalton peptide using gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Band 3 was modified covalently by fatty acids and these acids were released from Band 3 by hydroxylamine treatment at either pH 7 or 11, indicating that the linkage between Band 3 and the fatty acid is a thio ester bond. 1 mol of Band 3 interacted with 1 mol of fatty acid at a cysteine residue located 69 residues from the COOH terminus of Band 3. The fatty acids used in the modification were myristate, palmitate, oleate, and stearate, with palmitate being the major component. The esterified site is close to the site affinity-labeled with pyridoxal phosphate (Kawano, Y., Okubo, K., Tokunaga, F., Miyata, T., Iwanaga, S., and Hamasaki, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8232-8238). The amino acid sequence including the acylation site was Phe-Thr-Gly-Ile-Gln-Ile-Ile-Cys-Leu-Ala-Val-Leu, which is conserved in the G2 protein of Rift Valley fever virus as Phe-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ala-Ile-Ile-Cys-Leu-Ala-Val-Leu. The G2 protein, like Band 3, is a polytopic transmembrane protein. Although acylation of the cysteine residue of G2 protein has not been examined, the Phe-X-X-Ile-X-Ile-Ile-Cys-Leu-Ala-Val-Leu sequence could be a common motif for fatty acylation of certain membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1538480131,"By means of limited proteolysis of Bacillus stearothermophilus initiation factor IF2 and genetic manipulation of its structural gene, infB, we have been able to produce (or hyperproduce) and purify two polypeptide fragments corresponding to two structurally and functionally separate domains of the protein. The first is the G-domain (approximately 41 kDa), which makes up the central part of the molecule and contains the conserved structural elements found in all GTP/GDP-binding sites of G-proteins. This domain is resistant to proteolysis in the presence of GTP or GDP, retains the capacity to interact with the 50 S subunit, binds weakly to the 30 S subunit, and displays ribosome-dependent GTPase activity with an approximately 2-fold higher Km for GTP and the same Vmax as compared with intact IF2. The second is the C-domain (approximately 24 kDa), which corresponds to the COOH-terminal part of IF2 and constitutes an extraordinarily compact domain containing the fMet-tRNA binding site of IF2. In spite of its negligible affinity for the ribosomes, the C-domain weakly stimulates the ribosomal binding of fMet-tRNA, presumably by affecting the conformation of the initiator tRNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2049692544,"The glp-1 and lin-12 genes encode homologous transmembrane proteins that may act as receptors for cell interactions during development. The glp-1 product is required for induction of germ-line proliferation and for embryogenesis. By contrast, lin-12 mediates somatic cell interactions, including those between the precursor cells that form the vulval hypodermis (VPCs). Here we analyse an unusual allele of glp-1, glp-1(q35), which displays a semidominant multivulva phenotype (Muv), as well as the typical recessive, loss-of-function Glp phenotypes (sterility and embryonic lethality). We find that the effects of glp-1(q35) on VPC development mimic those of dominant lin-12 mutations, even in the absence of lin-12 activity. The glp-1(q35) gene bears a nonsense mutation predicted to eliminate the 122 C-terminal amino acids, including a ProGluSerThr (PEST) sequence thought to destabilize proteins. We suggest that the carboxy terminus bears a negative regulatory domain which normally inactivates glp-1 in the VPCs. We propose that inappropriate glp-1(q35) activity can substitute for lin-12 to determine vulval fate, perhaps by driving the VPCs to proliferate."
https://openalex.org/W1910270583,"The expression of the genes encoding the three isoforms of the human ADP/ATP translocase (T1, T2, and T3) has been investigated in cultured cell systems under different experimental conditions, using isoform- specific probes. In several human cell lines tested, i.e. HeLa, Hep3B, 143B, HL60, the T3 gene is expressed as a single 1300-nucleotide mRNA, whereas the T2 gene produces two species of mRNA, 1450 and 1600 nucleotides in size. These two species, which are present in HeLa cells in approximately equivalent amounts, were shown to derive from the use of two different polyadenylation signals. The gene for the muscle-specific isoform of ADP/ATP translocase, T1, was not found to be expressed in any of the cell lines investigated. The levels of T2 and T3 mRNAs in HeLa cells are differentially affected by the growth conditions. In fact, the T2 mRNA level remains relatively constant throughout the exponential and stationary phases, whereas the T3 mRNA level decreases progressively in the second half of the exponential phase and in the stationary phase down to less than 50%. This difference in quantitative behavior of the two mRNAs must reflect changes in their rates of synthesis, since their half-lives are very similar (t^1/2 = 5-6 h), with no significant growth-related differences. Treatment of HL60 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or retinoic acid, two agents which induce cessation of cell proliferation and cell differentiation, resulted in a marked decrease in both T2 and T3 mRNA levels. Exposure of HeLa cells to chloramphenicol produced a pronounced decrease in the levels of both T2 and T3 mRNAs after 48 to 72 h of treatment. Half-life time measurements strongly suggested that this decrease reflected a reduction in the rate of synthesis of the two transcripts. Treatment of HeLa cells with dinitrophenol also produced a dramatic decrease in the steady state levels of both T2 and T3 mRNA, which, however, in contrast to the just mentioned situation, could be accounted for by a decrease in their metabolic stability. Control experiments indicated that the chloramphenicol- and dinitrophenol-induced changes were not a nonspecific consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction. The observations reported here clearly demonstrate that the expression of the multiple ADP/ATP translocase genes in human cells is sensitive to the cell physiological conditions, responding to the varying cellular demands by changes in the rate of synthesis or stability of their mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1924738353,"Serotype-specific polysaccharide antigens from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29523 (serotype a) and NCTC 9710 (serotype c) were extracted from whole cells by autoclaving and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Analysis of component sugars by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and NMR together with optical rotation data showed that the serotype a antigen was composed solely of 6-deoxy-D-talose, whereas the serotype c antigen consisted of 6-deoxy-L-talose. Structural analysis indicated that both of these antigens were composed of closely related repeating units, -3)-6-deoxy-alpha-D-Talp-(1-2)-6-deoxy-alpha-D-Talp-(1-(sero type a) and -3)-6-deoxy-alpha-L-Talp-(1-2)-6-deoxy-alpha-L-Talp-(1-(sero type c). 1H and 13C NMR analysis showed that both of these serotype antigens contained one acetyl group/2 sugar residues. These acetyl groups localized at the O-2 position of 3-linked 6-deoxy-D-talose (serotype a) or O-4 position of 3-linked 6-deoxy-L-talose residues (serotype c), respectively. These results coupled with our previous findings on the serotype b antigen (Amano, K., Nishihara, T., Shibuya, N., Noguchi, T., and Koga, T. (1989) Infect. Immun. 57, 2942-2946) showed that the serotype antigens from A. actinomycetemcomitans are a group of novel polysaccharides with structural features closely related biosynthetically."
https://openalex.org/W1612382250,"Residue-209 plays a critical role in determining the substrate and product specificity of cytochrome P450coh. In order to investigate further the structural function of residue-209 in coumarin 7-hydroxylase reaction, we measured the enzyme-kinetic properties of wild-type P450coh and its mutants in which residue-209 was substituted with various amino acids. In general, the Km and Vmax values for coumarin increased as the size of residue-209 became smaller and Vmax values decreased. The size of residue-209, therefore, was a principle factor determining Km, Kd, and Vmax values of P450coh. Although the polarity and charge also increased the Km value consistently, they altered Vmax and Kd values in an irregular manner. The substitution of serine for residue-209 increased the Vmax, while the substitution of lysine decreased it. Coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity was inhibited weakly by indan, but competitively and strongly by 2-coumaranone. Moreover, Ki values for the inhibitor were similar to Km values of the corresponding, mutated P450s. The results indicate, therefore, that residue-209 is localized in a proposed substrate-binding sequence 1 which binds to the 2-keto group of coumarin and directs its 7-position toward the sixth ligand of heme. Consequently, the identity of residue-209 determines not only the binding of coumarin in P450coh, but also the other reaction step(s) of coumarin 7-hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1998685622,"The evolutionary significance of protein polymorphisms has long been debated. Exponents of the balanced theory advocate that selection operates to maintain polymorphisms, whereas the neoclassical school argues that most genetic variation is neutral. Some studies have suggested that protein polymorphisms are not neutral, but their significance has been questioned because one cannot eliminate the possibility that linked loci were responsible for the observed differences. Evidence is presented that an enzymatic phenotype can affect carbon flow through a metabolic pathway. Glucose flux differences between lactate dehydrogenase-B phenotypes of Fundulus heteroclitus were reversed by substituting the Ldh-B gene product of one homozygous genotype with that of another."
https://openalex.org/W2157006405,"The MalF protein spans the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane eight times. Deletion of the first transmembrane stretch of MalF, which acts as an export signal, results in a truncated protein that still exhibits high levels of maltose transport activity. These and additional results indicate that the orientation of a membrane protein is not determined by the amino-terminal export signal, topological information is distributed throughout the MalF protein, and insertion of a protein into the cytoplasmic membrane can occur nonsequentially."
https://openalex.org/W1664776133,"A recombinant single-chain molecule, scFv-K12G0, containing the variable domains of the monoclonal antibody MA-15C5, specific for fragment D-dimer of human cross-linked fibrin, was constructed and expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9, insect cells. The Arg108 carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the variable domain of the light-chain of the antibody was connected through a synthetic Ala-Gly-Gln-Gly-Ser-Ser-Val peptide linker with the Gln1 amino-terminal amino acid of the variable domain of its heavy chain. scFv-K12G0 was secreted by the infected Sf9 cells at a rate of 10 micrograms/10(6) cells within 48 h, resulting in conditioned medium with a maximal concentration of 15 mg of scFv-K12G0/liter. The molecule, purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration, migrated as a single Mr band on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. It bound to immobilized fragment D-dimer with an affinity constant of 4.0 x 10(9) M-1 (2.0 x 10(10) M-1 for intact MA-15C5). Clearing of scFv-K12G0 from the circulation in rabbits occurred with an initial half-life (t1/2 alpha) of 10 min and a clearance of 5.1 ml min-1, as compared to 90 min and 210 ml min-1 for intact MA-15C5. Nephrectomy resulted in a prolongation of t1/2 alpha to 110 min, suggesting that the rapid clearance of scFv-K12G0 occurs primarily via the kidney, presumably by glomerular filtration. The results indicate that the single-chain recombinant molecule scFv-K12G0 is secreted in functionally intact form and suggest that it may be useful for targeting of radioisotopes or plasminogen activators to blood clots in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1608117093,"We have found polymorphism in the repetitive and nonrepetitive regions of the sporozoite vaccine antigen, the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, in Plasmodium vivax malaria parasites from two geographically distant malaria endemic regions of the world. Like the recently described variant repeat sequence of P. vivax from Thailand, the CS protein repeat sequence of the variant P. vivax parasites from Papua New Guinea and Brazil is ANGA(G/D)(N/D)QPG, which differs from the previously identified CS repeat sequence, GDRA(D/A)GQPA, of P. vivax parasites from South America, Central America, and North Korea. Comparison of the P. vivax CS protein outside the repeat region revealed restricted polymorphism in regions that have exhibited T-cell immune function and sequence heterogeneity in the CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum. Our results show that P. vivax malaria parasites with the variant CS repeat sequences are widespread in nature and that the polymorphism in the CS protein of P. vivax is also present in the nonrepeat region."
https://openalex.org/W1487086728,The activity of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2)-specific Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III (CaM PK III) is regulated by phosphorylation. The kinase can be inactivated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase and subsequently reactivated by endogenous protein kinase. This kinase can be substituted for by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase but not by casein kinase II. The purified kinase preparation contains only one protein as judged by gel electrophoresis. This protein has a molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.2. Reactivation of the eEF-2 kinase is associated with the phosphorylation of this protein. The amino acid sequence obtained from the 90-kDa protein reveals substantial homology with that of murine heat shock protein 86 (HSP 86) a member of the HSP 90-family. Conventional preparations of HSP 90 contain an inactive eEF-2 kinase that could be activated after dephosphorylation and phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
https://openalex.org/W1486625521,"Since plasma levels of enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), that scavenge reactive oxygen species are low, surface membranes of endothelial and parenchymal cells of various tissues are often exposed to oxidative stress. To dismutase superoxide radicals efficiently in and around vascular endothelial cells, we constructed a fusion gene encoding a hybrid SOD (HB-SOD) consisting of human Cu/Zn-SOD and a C-terminal basic peptide that binds to heparin-like proteoglycans. The fusion gene was expressed in yeast, and the resulting HB-SOD was highly purified. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, HB-SOD revealed a protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 20,000. HB-SOD bound to endothelial cells of aortic segments by a mechanism which was inhibited by heparin but not by antithrombin III. When injected intravenously to rats, 125I-labeled HB-SOD rapidly disappeared from the circulation; the rate of disappearance was decreased by heparin. Less than 1% of the injected HB-SOD was found in the urine 20 min after administration at which time more than 70% of SOD was excreted in its intact form. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that HB-SOD predominantly bound to heparin-like proteoglycans on endothelial cells of the artery and other tissues. HB-SOD might permit studies on pathophysiological roles of superoxide radicals in and around vascular endothelial cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518577971,"The mammalian mitochondrial complex consisting of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-Ts (EF-Tu.Tsmt) is capable of efficiently binding aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome in the presence and absence of guanine nucleotides. In the presence of GTP the binding reaction is catalytic. In the absence of guanine nucleotides, or in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, only one round of ribosome binding occurs. EF-Tu.Tsmt is capable of forming a ternary complex with GTP and Escherichia coli Phe-tRNA as demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography, nitrocellulose filter binding, and by protection of the aminoacyl-tRNA bond from hydrolysis. GDP and the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate are also capable of facilitating ternary complex formation with EF-Tu.Tsmt, but are less effective. No kinetic advantage results from the formation of this ternary complex prior to ribosome binding, and EF-Tu.Tsmt may actually bind aminoacyl-tRNA directly to the ribosome prior to binding GTP. These results suggest that a variation of the prokaryotic elongation cycle is occurring in animal mitochondria. N-Ethylmaleimide inhibits the activity of EF-Tu.Tsmt in polymerization and in ribosome binding. However, the activity of the EF-Tsmt which can be measured independently, is not altered."
https://openalex.org/W1524349083,"The monomer-dimer equilibria of the dimeric phospholipases A2 from Crotalus atrox and Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus venoms were examined chromatographically as a function of pH and in the presence versus absence of the essential cofactor, calcium ion. At neutral pH without calcium, the subunits of both enzymes reequilibrated sufficiently slowly that dimer and monomer were separated by size exclusion chromatography. At pH 4.2 and lower, the dimers underwent rapid dissociation and reassociation, eluting as single broad peaks whose position as a function of applied protein concentration could be analyzed to determine association constants using an algorithm that estimates these values based on elution positions. Lowering the pH from 7.0 to 4.2 increased the self-association constant of the C. atrox enzyme by 1 order of magnitude and that of the A. p. piscivorus dimer by a factor of 3. Calcium ion, an essential cofactor of phospholipase A2, converted the kinetic behavior of the dimers at neutral pH from slow to virtually instantaneous on the time scale of the chromatography runs, 40 min. Calcium ion also altered the thermodynamic stability of the enzymes; the association constant of A. p. piscivorus phospholipase A2 in neutral pH buffer was reduced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude, whereas that of C. atrox was increased by a factor of 6. The structural basis for the disparate effects of calcium ion on these two acidic, dimeric venom phospholipases A2 is uncertain. This study illustrates the importance of calcium ion and pH on the solution behavior of the dimeric members of this class of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1581906203,"[14C]Glucosamine metabolic labeling and concanavalin A blots were used to identify four major glycoprotein species associated with ascites tumor cell microvillar microfilament cores and with a transmembrane complex containing actin. Phalloidin shift analysis of glucosamine-labeled microvilli showed that glycoproteins of 110-120, 80, 65, and 55 kDa are stably associated with the microfilament cores. Analysis of large (greater than 10(6) kDa) transmembrane complexes from microvillar membranes made under microfilament-depolymerizing conditions (Carraway, C. A. C., Jung, G., and Carraway, K. L. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 430-434) revealed glycoproteins of the same Mr values, showing the same relative staining or labeling patterns as those observed with the microfilament cores. Gel filtration of high salt, high pH extracts of intact microvilli, microfilament cores, or transmembrane complexes showed that in all of these fractions the glycoproteins are associated in a very large, stable complex. The glycoprotein multimer was isolated essentially free of actin and other components by Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography of microvilli, microvillar membranes prepared at pH 11, microfilament cores, or transmembrane complex fractions in Triton X-100, 1 M KCl, glycine, pH 9.5. Purified glycoprotein complex bound actin when incubated under polymerizing conditions. The presence of the glycoprotein heteromultimer in both microfilament cores and transmembrane complex from isolated membranes and the association of the purified glycoprotein complex with actin are consistent with our hypothesis that the glycoprotein-containing transmembrane complex is an association site for microfilaments at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1516990263,"A highly photosensitive analogue of thymidine, 5-azidodeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate, has been incorporated into 61-base pair (bp) DNA fragments corresponding to the central region of Xenopus somatic-type 5 S RNA genes such that 5-azidodeoxyuridine replaces some or all T residues in either the coding or noncoding strand of the TFIIIA binding site. Photolysis of TFIIIA.DNA complexes formed with these probes results in efficient, sequence-specific cross-linking to the Zn-finger protein providing direct evidence that this class of proteins have contacts in the major groove of their target sequence. Of the 20 T residues present in the 61-bp probes, greater than 90% of the cross-linking occurs from two sites in the 5 S RNA gene corresponding to T residues at positions 84 and 88 in the noncoding and coding strands, respectively. Digestion by V8 protease of the complex formed with the noncoding strand probe releases peptides not bound to the DNA. Amino acid sequence analysis of the remaining, cross-linked peptides indicates the region including zinc-finger 2 plus the finger 2-3 linker is in contact with position 84. The linker region between fingers 5 and 6 is also in close proximity to the major groove somewhere upstream from position 84."

The enzyme is encoded by a single gene, which is actively transcribed during growth, but not during development.

The Dictyostelium enzyme has extensive homology with the GMP synthetase of Escherichia coli and regional homology to other glutamine amidotransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1584474168,"Based upon analyses of purified enzyme preparations, T4 bacteriophage-coded ribonucleotide reductase is considered to be relatively insensitive to control by allosteric inhibition. However, two factors suggest that CDP reduction to dCDP is feedback-controlled by dTTP in infected cells. First, the pool of 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidine triphosphate, which expands manyfold upon infection by a dCMP deaminase-deficient T4 mutant, shrinks to near-normal levels as a consequence of dTTP accumulation, and ribonucleotide reductase is the only apparent control point. Second, analysis of mutagenesis by 5-bromodeoxyuridine suggests that most induced mutations result from localized pool depletion of 5-hydroxymethyl-dCTP at replication sites, as if 5-bromo-dUTP were behaving like dTTP in inhibiting the CDP reductase activity of the phage enzyme. We found that CDP reductase activity in crude extracts of T4 phage-infected bacteria is sensitive to inhibition by either dTTP or 5-bromo-dUTP, at concentrations as low as 0.01 mM. However, in partially purified enzyme preparations that sensitivity is lost. Although we don't know the basis for this loss of feedback sensitivity, the results suggest that kinetic properties of enzymes in intact cells are determined by the cellular milieu in ways not apparent from analysis of purified enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1528896524,"We have expressed a cDNA to human apolipoprotein E (apoE) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Secretion of apoE was achieved only by the use of a mutant (upc2) strain of yeast with the phenotype of enhanced uptake and intracellular esterification of exogenous cholesterol. Approximately 40 ng/ml apoE was secreted by upc2 mutants in the absence of media cholesterol. ApoE secretion was increased 2-3-fold upon the inclusion of cholesterol in the growth media. This response to exogenous cholesterol was not mediated at the transcriptional level, since apoE mRNA levels were constant under all culture conditions. Concomitant with the increase in secretion following cholesterol uptake by upc2 strains, approximately 5% of secreted apoE was associated with lipid; polar and non-polar lipids were detected in this lipoprotein fraction. Intracellular degradation of apoE in non-secreting strains of yeast was minimized by the presence of null mutations in both vacuolar proteases with non-specific activity (pep4) and a Golgi endopeptidase with specificity for paired basic residues (kex2). The approach of expressing human apolipoproteins in yeast may identify factors that mediate lipoprotein biosynthesis in higher cells. One such factor could be the mammalian equivalent of the gene product of UPC2."
https://openalex.org/W1486374171,"Four cytosolic 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine-binding proteins (CTBP) were isolated from hemoglobin-free human erythrocyte on DEAE-cellulose column by linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.4 M). CTBP I, II, and IV underwent rapid loss of their activities at low temperatures, whereas CTBP III was cold-insensitive. Reactivation of cold-inactivated CTBPs by warming was obtained at 20 and 37 degrees C. CTBP I, II, and IV were not inhibited by thiol-blocking agents, whereas CTBP III was blocked. Scatchard analysis of L-3,5,3'-triodo-thyronine binding showed a high affinity site with Kd on the order of 10(-10) M for CTBP II and Kd values of about 10(-9) M for CTBP I and IV and of about 10(-8) M for CTBP III. The order of affinity of iodothyronine analogues to CTBPs was similar in CTBP I, II, and IV but different in CTBP III. Chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 HR showed the elution of a single peak for each CTBP. The apparent molecular weights were about 200,000, 200,000, 25,000, and 60,000 for CTBP I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The physiological relevance of these CTBPs is discussed."
