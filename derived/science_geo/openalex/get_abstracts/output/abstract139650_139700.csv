https://openalex.org/W2154104720,"New neurons are continuously added in specific regions of the adult mammalian central nervous system. These neurons are derived from multipotent stem cells whose identity has been enigmatic. In this work, we present evidence that ependymal cells are neural stem cells. Ependymal cells give rise to a rapidly proliferating cell type that generates neurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb. In response to spinal cord injury, ependymal cell proliferation increases dramatically to generate migratory cells that differentiate to astrocytes and participate in scar formation. These data demonstrate that ependymal cells are neural stem cells and identify a novel process in the response to central nervous system injury."

https://openalex.org/W2154963941,"The human AIDS viruses human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) represent cross-species (zoonotic) infections1,2,3,4. Although the primate reservoir of HIV-2 has been clearly identified as the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys)2,4,5,6,7, the origin of HIV-1 remains uncertain. Viruses related to HIV-1 have been isolated from the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)8,9, but only three such SIVcpz infections have been documented1,10,11, one of which involved a virus so divergent11 that it might represent a different primate lentiviral lineage. In a search for the HIV-1 reservoir, we have now sequenced the genome of a new SIVcpz strain (SIVcpzUS) and have determined, by mitochondrial DNA analysis, the subspecies identity of all known SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. We find that two chimpanzee subspecies in Africa, the central P. t. troglodytes and the eastern P. t. schweinfurthii, harbour SIVcpz and that their respective viruses form two highly divergent (but subspecies-specific) phylogenetic lineages. All HIV-1 strains known to infect man, including HIV-1 groups M, N and O, are closely related to just one of these SIVcpz lineages, that found in P. t. troglodytes. Moreover, we find that HIV-1 group N is a mosaic of SIVcpzUS- and HIV-1-related sequences, indicating an ancestral recombination event in a chimpanzee host. These results, together with the observation that the natural range of P. t. troglodytes coincides uniquely with areas of HIV-1 group M, N and O endemicity, indicate that P. t. troglodytes is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 and has been the source of at least three independent introductions of SIVcpz into the human population."

https://openalex.org/W2117931147,"A high-resolution model of the microtubule has been obtained by docking the crystal structure of tubulin into a 20 A map of the microtubule. The excellent fit indicates the similarity of the tubulin conformation in both polymers and defines the orientation of the tubulin structure within the microtubule. Long C-terminal helices form the crest on the outside of the protofilament, while long loops define the microtubule lumen. The exchangeable nucleotide in beta-tubulin is exposed at the plus end of the microtubule, while the proposed catalytic residue in alpha-tubulin is exposed at the minus end. Extensive longitudinal interfaces between monomers have polar and hydrophobic components. At the lateral contacts, a nucleotide-sensitive helix interacts with a loop that contributes to the binding site of taxol in beta-tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2066183013,"We examined the transcriptional regulation of the clock-controlled arginine vasopressin gene in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). A core clock mechanism in mouse SCN appears to involve a transcriptional feedback loop in which CLOCK and BMAL1 are positive regulators and three mPeriod (mPer) genes are involved in negative feedback. We show that the RNA rhythm of each mPer gene is severely blunted in Clock/Clock mice. The vasopressin RNA rhythm is abolished in the SCN of Clock/Clock animals, leading to markedly decreased peptide levels. Luciferase reporter gene assays show that CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers act through an E box enhancer in the vasopressin gene to activate transcription; this activation can be inhibited by the mPER and mTIM proteins. These data indicate that the transcriptional machinery of the core clockwork directly regulates a clock-controlled output rhythm."

https://openalex.org/W2053095874,"The human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 kills Caenorhabditis elegans. Using systematic mutagenesis of PA14 to identify mutants that fail to kill C. elegans and a C. elegans mutant that lacks P-glycoproteins, we identified phenazines, secreted P. aeruginosa pigments, as one of the mediators of killing. Analysis of C. elegans mutants with altered responses to oxidative stress suggests that phenazines exert their toxic effects on C. elegans through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Finally, we show that phenazines and other P. aeruginosa factors required for C. elegans killing are also required for pathogenesis in plants and mice, illustrating that this model tackles the dual challenges of identifying bacterial virulence factors as well as host responses to them."
https://openalex.org/W2032733101,"Using in vitro assays with purified proteins, we show that XKCM1 and XKIF2, two distinct members of the internal catalytic domain (Kin I) kinesin subfamily, catalytically destabilize microtubules using a novel mechanism. Both XKCM1 and XKIF2 influence microtubule stability by targeting directly to microtubule ends where they induce a destabilizing conformational change. ATP hydrolysis recycles XKCM1/XKIF2 for multiple rounds of action by dissociating a XKCM1/XKIF2–tubulin dimer complex released upon microtubule depolymerization. These results establish Kin I kinesins as microtubule-destabilizing enzymes, distinguish them mechanistically from kinesin superfamily members that use ATP hydrolysis to translocate along microtubules, and have important implications for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and for the intracellular functions and evolution of the kinesin superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2006338784,"MALT B cell lymphomas with t(1;14)(p22;q32) showed a recurrent breakpoint upstream of the promoter of a novel gene, Bcl10. Bcl10 is a cellular homolog of the equine herpesvirus-2 E10 gene: both contain an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) homologous to that found in several apoptotic molecules. Bcl10 and E10 activated NF-kappaB but caused apoptosis of 293 cells. Bcl10 expressed in a MALT lymphoma exhibited a frameshift mutation resulting in truncation distal to the CARD. Truncated Bcl10 activated NF-kappaB but did not induce apoptosis. Wild-type Bcl10 suppressed transformation, whereas mutant forms had lost this activity and displayed gain-of-function transforming activity. Similar mutations were detected in other tumor types, indicating that Bcl10 may be commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2036681136,"MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a 610 amino acid nuclear protein (menin) of previously unknown function. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with menin as the bait, we have identified the transcription factor JunD as a direct menin-interacting partner. Menin did not interact directly with other Jun and Fos family members. The menin-JunD interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Menin repressed transcriptional activation mediated by JunD fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain from a Gal4 responsive reporter, or by JunD from an AP1-responsive reporter. Several naturally occurring and clustered MEN1 missense mutations disrupted menin interaction with JunD. These observations suggest that menin's tumor suppressor function involves direct binding to JunD and inhibition of JunD activated transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2008630890,"Histidine kinases allow bacteria, plants, and fungi to sense and respond to their environment. The 2.6 A resolution crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima CheA (290-671) histidine kinase reveals a dimer where the functions of dimerization, ATP binding, and regulation are segregated into domains. The kinase domain is unlike Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases but resembles two ATPases, Gyrase B and Hsp90. Structural analogies within this superfamily suggest that the P1 domain of CheA provides the nucleophilic histidine and activating glutamate for phosphotransfer. The regulatory domain, which binds the homologous receptor-coupling protein CheW, topologically resembles two SH3 domains and provides different protein recognition surfaces at each end. The dimerization domain forms a central four-helix bundle about which the kinase and regulatory domains pivot on conserved hinges to modulate transphosphorylation. Different subunit conformations suggest that relative domain motions link receptor response to kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2076276305,"Differentiation of muscle cells is regulated by extracellular growth factors that transmit largely unknown signals into the cells. Some of these growth factors induce mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades within muscle cells. In this work we show that the kinase activity of p38 MAPK is induced early during terminal differentiation of L8 cells. Addition of a specific p38 inhibitor SB 203580 to myoblasts blocked their fusion to multinucleated myotubes and prevented the expression of MyoD and MEF2 family members and myosin light chain 2. The expression of MKK6, a direct activator of p38, or of p38 itself enhanced the activity of MyoD in converting 10T1/2 fibroblasts to muscle, whereas treatment with SB 203580 inhibited MyoD. Several lines of evidence suggesting that the involvement of p38 in MyoD activity is mediated via its co-activator MEF2C, a known substrate of p38, are presented. In these experiments we show that MEF2C protein and MEF2-binding sites are necessary for the p38 MAPK pathway to regulate the transcription of muscle creatine kinase reporter gene. Our results indicate that the p38 MAPK pathway promotes skeletal muscle differentiation at least in part via activation of MEF2C."
https://openalex.org/W2125617798,"The PR65/A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A serves as a scaffolding molecule to coordinate the assembly of the catalytic subunit and a variable regulatory B subunit, generating functionally diverse heterotrimers. Mutations of the beta isoform of PR65 are associated with lung and colon tumors. The crystal structure of the PR65/Aalpha subunit, at 2.3 A resolution, reveals the conformation of its 15 tandemly repeated HEAT sequences, degenerate motifs of approximately 39 amino acids present in a variety of proteins, including huntingtin and importin beta. Individual motifs are composed of a pair of antiparallel alpha helices that assemble in a mainly linear, repetitive fashion to form an elongated molecule characterized by a double layer of alpha helices. Left-handed rotations at three interrepeat interfaces generate a novel left-hand superhelical conformation. The protein interaction interface is formed from the intrarepeat turns that are aligned to form a continuous ridge."
https://openalex.org/W2008698762,"Activation of gene transcription in metazoans is a multistep process that is triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA polymerase II apparatus. One class of co-activator, the TAF(II) subunits of transcription factor TFIID, can serve as targets of activators and as proteins that recognize core promoter sequences necessary for transcription initiation. Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors such as Sp1 requires TFIID, but the identity of other necessary cofactors has remained unknown. Here we describe a new human factor, CRSP, that is required together with the TAF(II)s for transcriptional activation by Sp1. Purification of CRSP identifies a complex of approximate relative molecular mass 700,000 (M(r) approximately 700K) that contains nine subunits with M(r) values ranging from 33K to 200K. Cloning of genes encoding CRSP subunits reveals that CRSP33 is a homologue of the yeast mediator subunit Med7, whereas CRSP150 contains a domain conserved in yeast mediator subunit Rgr1. CRSP p200 is identical to the nuclear hormone-receptor co-activator subunit TRIP2/PBP. CRSPs 34, 77 and 130 are new proteins, but the amino terminus of CRSP70 is homologous to elongation factor TFIIS. Immunodepletion studies confirm that these subunits have an essential cofactor function. The presence of common subunits in distinct cofactor complexes suggests a combinatorial mechanism of co-activator assembly during transcriptional activation."

https://openalex.org/W2094899168,"Using the coiled-coil region of Stat5b as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the association of Nmi, a protein of unknown function previously reported as an N-Myc interactor. We further show that Nmi interacts with all STATs except Stat2. We evaluated two cytokine systems, IL-2 and IFNgamma, and demonstrate that Nmi augments STAT-mediated transcription in response to these cytokines. Interestingly, Nmi lacks an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain; instead, Nmi enhances the association of CBP/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5, and together with CBP/p300 can augment IL-2- and IFNgamma-dependent transcription. Therefore, our data not only reveal that Nmi can potentiate STAT-dependent transcription, but also suggest that it can augment coactivator protein recruitment to at least some members of a group of sequence-specific transcription factors."

https://openalex.org/W2103625519,"The mechanisms by which the p53 response is triggered following exposure to DNA-damaging agents have not yet been clearly elucidated. We and others have previously suggested that blockage of RNA polymerase II may be the trigger for induction of the p53 response following exposure to ultraviolet light. Here we report on the correlation between inhibition of mRNA synthesis and the induction of p53, p21WAF1 and apoptosis in diploid human fibroblasts treated with either UV light, cisplatin or the RNA synthesis inhibitors actinomycin D, DRB, H7 and α-amanitin. Exposure to ionizing radiation or the proteasome inhibitor LLnL, however, induced p53 and p21WAF1 without affecting mRNA synthesis. Importantly, induction of p53 by the RNA synthesis or proteasome inhibitors did not correlate with the induction of DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, cisplatin-induced accumulation of active p53 in repair-deficient XP-A cells occurred despite the lack of DNA strand break induction. Our results suggest that the induction of the p53 response by certain toxic agents is not triggered by DNA strand breaks but rather, may be linked to inhibition of mRNA synthesis either directly by the poisoning of RNA polymerase II or indirectly by the induction of elongation-blocking DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2044804476,"3-O-Sulfated glucosaminyl residues are rare constituents of heparan sulfate and are essential for the activity of anticoagulant heparan sulfate. Cellular production of the critical active structure is controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme, heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 (3-OST-1) (EC 2.8.2.23). We have probed the expressed sequence tag data base with the carboxyl-terminal sulfotransferase domain of 3-OST-1 to reveal three novel, incomplete human cDNAs. These were utilized in library screens to isolate full-length cDNAs. Clones corresponding to predominant transcripts were obtained for the 367-, 406-, and 390-amino acid enzymes 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B, respectively. These type II integral membrane proteins are comprised of a divergent amino-terminal region and a very homologous carboxyl-terminal sulfotransferase domain of ∼260 residues. Also recovered were partial length clones for 3-OST-4. Expression of the full-length enzymes confirms the 3-O-sulfation of specific glucosaminyl residues within heparan sulfate (Liu, J., Shworak, N. W., Sinaÿ, P., Schwartz, J. J. Zhang, L., Fritze, L. M. S., and Rosenberg, R. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 5185–5192). Southern analyses suggest the human 3OST1, 3OST2, and 3OST4 genes, and the corresponding mouse isologs, are single copy. However, 3OST3A and 3OST3B genes are each duplicated in humans and show at least one copy each in mice. Intriguingly, the entire sulfotransferase domain sequence of the 3-OST-3B cDNA (774 base pairs) was 99.2% identical to the same region of 3-OST-3A. Together, these data argue that the structure of this functionally important region is actively maintained by gene conversion between 3OST3A and 3OST3B loci. Interspecific mouse back-cross analysis identified the loci for mouse3Ost genes and syntenic assignments of corresponding human isologs were confirmed by the identification of mapped sequence-tagged site markers. Northern blot analyses indicate brain exclusive and brain predominant expression of 3-OST-4 and 3-OST-2 transcripts, respectively; whereas, 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3Bisoforms show widespread expression of multiple transcripts. The reiteration and conservation of the 3-OST sulfotransferase domain suggest that this structure is a self-contained functional unit. Moreover, the extensive number of 3OST genes with diverse expression patterns of multiple transcripts suggests that the novel 3-OST enzymes, like 3-OST-1, regulate important biologic properties of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. 3-O-Sulfated glucosaminyl residues are rare constituents of heparan sulfate and are essential for the activity of anticoagulant heparan sulfate.

Moreover, the extensive number of 3OST genes with diverse expression patterns of multiple transcripts suggests that the novel 3-OST enzymes, like 3-OST-1, regulate important biologic properties of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are hybrid molecules composed of a protein core to which is attached one or more linear glycosaminoglycan chains of the heparan sulfate variety. Extreme structural diversity of the heparan sulfate side chains enables interactions with a broad array of protein effector molecules that modulate a wide range of biologic processes. The specificity of any given heparan sulfate-protein interaction is largely dictated by placement of sulfate groups along the chain's length. Thus the order and ring position of sulfate substituents creates distinct oligosaccharide sequences (fine structure) and defines corresponding biologic activities (reviewed in Refs. 1Bernfield M.

The profound functional diversity of heparan sulfate proteoglycans necessitates a mechanism that can generate and independently regulate the production of a myriad of fine structures. Such control is predominantly imposed in a cell type-specific fashion by varying the functional status of the Golgi apparatus, with the core proteins potentially contributing only a minor degree of influence (4Sanderson R.D.

The rate of complex formation is dramatically enhanced via interactions with glycosaminoglycans containing the antithrombin-binding site;i.e. pharmaceutical heparin and anticoagulant heparan sulfate. The latter is generated by endothelial cells, which line the blood vessel wall. The importance of the anticoagulant heparan-antithrombin interaction is evidenced by the arterial thrombotic events that occur in patients producing antithrombin variants defective in anticoagulant heparan binding (reviewed in Ref.6Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. Vane J.R. Born G.V.R. Welzel D. The Endothelial Cell in Health and Disease. Schattauer, Stuttgart1995: 119-146Google Scholar). Given this critical role, it is not surprising that the cellular production of anticoagulant heparan is regulated independently of the general bulk of heparan sulfate (5Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M.

The central 3-O-sulfate group is absolutely essential for induction of the conformational change and high affinity antithrombin binding. Binding specificity additionally requires the 6-O-sulfate groups on residues 1 and 5, the amino group at residue 5 and carboxyl groups at other sites (9Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6454-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The critical role of the 3-O-sulfate group and the extreme paucity of this substituent within heparan sulfate (5Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K.

Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that the enzyme 3-OST-1 performs the rate-limiting biosynthetic reaction that determines cellular production of anticoagulant heparan (10Shworak N.W.

The enzyme recognizes a specific precursor structure, corresponding to the antithrombin-binding site devoid of just the 3-O-sulfate, and adds this rare substituent to complete the formation of anticoagulant heparan (10Shworak N.W.

Thus, 3-OST-1 activity controls cellular anticoagulant phenotype. This example raises the possibility that additional heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes may function in an analogous fashion, controlling production of other important heparan sulfate fine structures. The molecular cloning of the cDNA for the precursor protein of 3-OST-1 showed that the enzyme undergoes removal of an amino-terminal leader sequence to generate a Golgi intraluminal resident of ∼290 amino acids (12Shworak N.W.

Most importantly, the carboxyl-terminal ∼260 residues have striking homology to the comparable region of the bifunctional biosynthetic enzymes heparan sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 and -2 (∼50% similarity to both NST-1 and NST-2), and at least 30% similarity to virtually every type of sulfotransferase enzyme previously identified. Consequently, this conserved structure that spans the majority of 3-OST-1 has been presumptively designated as the sulfotransferase domain (12Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28008-28019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the present article, we have employed this conserved structure to molecularly clone related cDNAs, which encode homologous carboxyl-terminal sulfotransferase domains but distinct amino-terminal structures. Unlike 3-OST-1, the novel 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B enzymes are predicted to have type II integral membrane architecture. An incomplete cDNA encoding the sulfotransferase domain portion of the enzyme 3-OST-4 was also obtained. Comparison of the enzyme structures predicts motifs that may govern sequence specific modification. Northern hybridizations show isoform-specific expression patterns, whereas genomic characterizations identified at least 7 human 3-OST genes. Thus, the 3-OST multigene family is exquisitely suited to encode key enzymes that regulate the production of many distinct heparan sulfate fine structures. The National Center for Biotechnology Information data bank of I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) expressed sequence tag cDNA clones (13Lennon G. Auffray C.

To obtain full-length clones, we first identified cDNA regions, described below, which would function as isoform-specific probes by hybridizing Southern blots of human genomic DNA with expressed sequence tag fragments 32P-labeled by random priming. The corresponding fragments were used to screen λ TriplEx brain and liver cDNA libraries (CLONTECH), as described previously (12Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D.

Positive plaques were purified, TriplEx-based plasmids were excised in vivo according to the manufacturers protocol, and inserts were sequenced as described below. The 5′ and 3′ insert regions were enzymatically sequenced from flanking primer sites of the respective cloning vectors. The remaining sequence of both strands was obtained with internally priming oligonucleotides. Primers were spaced no more than 400 base pairs (bp) apart with a 200-bp offset between + and − strands, thus each nucleotide was detected within 200 bp of a primer. Automated fluorescence sequencing was performed with Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Models 373A and 477 DNA Sequencers. Each reaction typically yielded 400 to 600 bases of high quality sequence. DNA sequence files were aligned and compiled with the program Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corp.). Sequence comparison searches were performed with Gapped BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.

Genomic DNA from human endothelial cells was used for the analysis of human 3OST gene copy number and for genomic restriction mapping studies. Genomic DNA was isolated from 76 plates (150 mm) of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) grown according to the suppliers protocol. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min. Cells were lysed by vortexing for 5 min in ice-cold 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 4 min and resuspended in 3 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, then combined with 133 μg of RNase A and 333 μg of proteinase K. Nuclei were lysed with the addition of 3 ml of 0.4% SDS and then incubated at 65 °C for 16 h. Samples were extracted 5 times against 8 ml of phenol, chloroform, isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the aqueous phase was combined with 15 ml of isopropyl alcohol, DNA was harvested by spooling, washed with 80% ethanol, and resuspended in 4 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA.

Dr. Chao Sun (Whitehead Institute) generously provided human DNA samples isolated from peripheral leukocytes of 16 unrelated male individuals for the analysis of the BstXI pattern generated by 3-OST probes. Typically, 10-μg samples were restriction digested, resolved by 0.8% or 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes. Membranes were hybridized for 16 h in 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate buffer containing SSC and formamide. The concentrations of these latter two components were adjusted so that all homologous hybridizations were incubated at T m − 25 °C and all heterologous hybridizations were incubated at T m− 35 °C, where for a DNA:DNA hybrid T m = 81.5 °C + (16.6 × log([Na+])) + (41 × percentage GC) − (500 ÷ length of probe template in bp) − (62 × percentage formamide) (25Wahl G.M.

Membranes were washed in 1% SDS and sufficient SSC to generate a final incubation stringency of at least T m − 25 °C or T m − 35 °C, as described above, respectively. Tissue and cell type-specific expression of 3-OST forms was performed with human multiple tissue and human cancer cell line Northern blots, respectively (CLONTECH). Endothelial expression of 3-OST forms was tested on 10 μg of total RNA from immortalized rat fat pad endothelial cells and primary mouse cardiac microvascular cells, as well as 5 μg of poly(A)+ prepared from primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells, as described previously (12Shworak N.W.

Membranes were washed in 1% SDS and sufficient SSC to generate a final incubation stringency of at least T m − 25 °C orT m − 35 °C, as described above, respectively. Interspecific back-cross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 females and C57BL/6J males as described (27Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the3Ost loci, as described under “Results.” DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization were performed essentially as described (28Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All blots were prepared with Hybond-N+nylon membrane (Amersham). The employed hybridization probes are described above. The 3Ost1 probe, mST-1, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed labeling kit (Stratagene); washing was done to a final stringency of 1.0 × SSCP, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C. A fragment of 6.3 kb was detected inScaI-digested C57BL/6J (B) DNA and a fragment of 8.4 kb was detected in ScaI-digested M. spretus (S) DNA. The3Ost2 probe, ST-2, detected major BglI fragments of 23.0 (B) and 16.0 (S) kb. The 3Ost3a probe, SPLAG-A, detected major ScaI fragments of 16.5 and 5.4 (B) and 16.5 and 7.0 kb (S). The 3Ost3b probe, SPLAG-B, detected majorHincII fragments of 18.0 and 5.0 kb (B) and 9.0 and 5.0 kb (S). Finally, the 3Ost4 probe, ST-4, detectedHindIII fragments of 1.7 (B) and 2.4 (S) kb. The presence or absence of the M. spretus-specific fragments was followed in back-cross mice. A description of the probes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the loci linked to the 3Ost genes has been reported previously. These include Adra2c, Msx1, andBst1, chromosome 5 (29Avraham K.B. Givol D. Avivi A. Yayon"
https://openalex.org/W2154949704,"This study reports a primase-to-polymerase switch in E. coli that closely links primase action with extension by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. We find that primase tightly grips its RNA primer, protecting it from the action of other proteins. However, primase must be displaced before the beta sliding clamp can be assembled on the primed site. A single subunit of the holoenzyme, chi, is dedicated to this primase displacement task. The displacement mechanism depends on a third protein, SSB. Primase requires contact to SSB for its grip on the primed site. The chi subunit also binds SSB, upon which the primase-to-SSB contact is destabilized leading to dissociation of primase and assembly of beta onto the RNA primer. The conservation of this three-point switch, in which two proteins exchange places on DNA via mutually exclusive interaction with a third protein, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2022845014,"The 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues is an important modification during the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS). Our previous studies have led us to purify and molecularly clone the heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST-1), which is the key enzyme converting nonanticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSinact) to anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSact). In this study, we expressed and characterized the full-length cDNAs of 3-OST-1 homologous genes, designated as 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B as described in the accompanying paper (Shworak, N.

All these cDNAs were successfully expressed in COS-7 cells, and heparan sulfate sulfotransferase activities were found in the cell extracts. We demonstrated that 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B are heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferases because the enzymes transfer sulfate from adenosine 3′-phosphophate 5′-phospho-[35S]sulfate ([35S]PAPS) to the 3-OH position of glucosamine. 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B sulfate an identical disaccharide. HSact conversion activity in the cell extract transfected by 3-OST-1 was shown to be 300-fold greater than that in the cell extracts transfected by 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A, suggesting that 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A do not make HSact. The results of the disaccharide analysis of the nitrous acid-degraded [35S]HS suggested that 3-OST-2 transfers sulfate to GlcA2S-GlcNS and IdoA2S-GlcNS; 3-OST-3A transfers sulfate to IdoA2S-GlcNS. Our results demonstrate that the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine is generated by different isoforms depending on the saccharide structures around the modified glucosamine residue.

The highly charged HS side chains are the copolymers of glucuronic acid (GlcA)/iduronic acid (IdoA) andN-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) with various sulfations. HS binds to specific proteins such as antithrombin and several growth factors, thereby regulates various biological processes including anticoagulation and angiogenesis (1Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The unique sulfation pattern of a monosaccharide sequence within HS is believed to be critical for binding to the target protein. The biosynthesis of HS involves the formation of a polysaccharide backbone followed by serial sulfation and epimerization reactions. The HS backbone is elongated by HS copolymerase-dependent (2Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) transfer of GlcA and GlcNAc to the tetrasaccharide linkage region present on core proteins.

Although this mechanism provides a scheme for generating the average structure of HS, it is unable to explain how HS with defined monosaccharide sequences are produced.We have delineated a mechanism for generating HS with a specific monosaccharide sequence based on our investigation of the biosynthesis of anticoagulant active HS (HSact). Our results show that the synthesis of HSact requires a limiting factor, as well as a precursor with a defined polysaccharide structure which can be modified by the limiting factor. HSact, normally present as 1–10% of total HS, contains a structurally defined antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide with a sequence of -GlcNSorAc6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S±6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S- (9Lindahl U.

We have shown that 3-OST-1 requires an appropriate HS precursor with defined monosaccharide sequence for sulfation to occur and make HSact. 2Zhang, L., Yoshida, K., Liu, J., and Rosenberg, R. D.

Chem. 274,in press.It is likely that 3-O-sulfated HS are specifically involved in other HS-related biological processes. If this is the case, studies of 3-O-sulfation should facilitate the identification of new biologically active HS-binding proteins. The 3-OST-1, which we have previously purified and molecularly cloned, only sulfates the glucosamine in GlcA-GlcNS±6S. However, there are at least two other types of 3-O-sulfated glucosamine that were previously characterized. For example, the HS isolated from glomerular basement membrane contains substantial amounts of an IdoA2S-GlcNS3S disaccharide unit (21Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. J. Biol.

It is apparent that neither the IdoA2S-GlcNS3S nor the IdoA-GlcNS3S6S is the product of 3-OST-1. These observations suggest the possible existence of different heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferases, which specifically sulfate the 3-OH positions of glucosamine residues that are linked to various sulfated/nonsulfated uronic acid residues at the nonreducing termini. In this article, we report the expression and characterization of new heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms, designated as 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B that were isolated as described in the accompanying article (24Shworak N.W.

We have found that 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A catalyze the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine in GlcA2S-GlcNS and IdoA2S-GlcNS, respectively, and 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B sulfate an identical disaccharide. The HS modified by 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A do not contain anticoagulant activity. Our studies reveal the presence of different isoforms, each of which sulfates the sugar residue in unique disaccharides or possibly in oligosaccharide sequences. Thus, we provide a new mechanism for the biosynthesis of HS with specific monosaccharide sequences and different potential biological functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPlasmids pJL2.7, pJL3.3, and pJL3.6 containing 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B were isolated from human brain and liver cDNA libraries (24Shworak N.W.

The partial acid hydrolysis of 35S-labeled disaccharide (2 × 104 cpm) was performed in 0.5 mH2SO4 and incubated at 100 °C for 15 min as described elsewhere (30Delaney S.R. Leger M. Conrad H.E. Anal.

The partially desulfated [35S]disaccharide became susceptible to α-iduronidase or β-glucuronidase which permitted the establishment of the structure of the disaccharide as well as the position of [35S]sulfate (14,31).β-Glucuronidase and α-Iduronidase Digestion35S-Labeled disaccharide (1 × 104 cpm) was mixed with GlcA-[3H]AnMan6S or GlcA-[3H]AnMan3S6S in 50 μl of 50 mm NaAcO, pH 4.5, and 100 μl of purified β-glucuronidase (5,000 units) and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h.

Briefly, the RPIP-HPLC purified [35S]disaccharides were diluted 5–10-fold with water to bring the concentration of phosphate to less than 5 mm, neutralized with 10 m NaOH and charged to a 1-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Sigma), which was equilibrated with 10 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (Sigma), pH 8.0.

J. 1990; 271: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe cDNAs, which have approximately 60% similarity to the earlier cloned 3-OST-1 in the sulfotransferase domain, were demonstrated to encode heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms. The strategy used to characterize these cDNAs is the following: 1) expression of the cDNAs in COS-7 cells by transient transfection; 2) preparation of 35S-labeled HS by mixing the [35S]PAPS and unlabeled HS with the COS-7 cell extracts transfected with 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B; 3) determination of the 35S labeling site within the [35S]HS by degrading the HS with nitrous acid at low pH (pH 1.5). A similar approach has been previously used to characterize 3-OST-1, heparan sulfate (d-glucosaminyl) 6-O-sulfotransferase, and heparan sulfate (uronosyl) 2-O-sulfotransferase (7Kobayashi M.

Our data suggest that 3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B are heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferases because they transfer [35S]sulfate from [35S]PAPS to the 3-OH position of the glucosamine residue, and 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B sulfates an identical disaccharide.To our knowledge, the activities of 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3Ahave not been previously reported. The substrate specificities of 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A at the disaccharide level were identified by determining the structures and [35S]sulfate labeling sites of two 35S-labeled disaccharides designated as Peak-X and Peak-Y. These two disaccharides are the products of low pH nitrous acid-treated [35S]HS prepared by 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A. Peak-X was identified to be IdoA2S-[35S]AnMan3S, and Peak-Y was identified to be GlcA2S-[35S]AnMan3S. The structure GlcA2S-AnMan3S has not been identified previously in naturally occurring heparin and heparan sulfate. However, because of the potential side reactions during chemical degradation of [35S]HS, the substrate specificities of 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A have not been conclusively determined. Such side reactions can only be controlled by using chemically defined oligosaccharides with expected modifications.The differences between the isoforms and 3-OST-1 are as follows: 3-OST-1 generates HSact, while 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A do not. In addition, the isoforms transfer sulfate to uronyl-glucosamine disaccharides with different sulfated uronic acid residues. For example, 3-OST-1 transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of the glucosamine within GlcA-GlcNS ± 6S; 3-OST-2 transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of the glucosamine within GlcA2S-GlcNS and IdoA2S-GlcNS; 3-OST-3A transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of the glucosamine within IdoA2S-GlcNS. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that 3-OST-2 and 3-OST-3A sulfate the 3-OH position of the glucosamine within GlcA2S-GlcNH2and IdoA2S-GlcNH2, respectively. 6We have recently found that purified 3-OST-3A sulfates the glucosamine residue with free amino group. The conclusion was based on the results of the structural analysis of two 35S-labeled tetrasaccharides, which were isolated from heparin lyases degraded the [35S]HS [35S]sulfated by purified 3-OST-3A. Furthermore, 3-OST-1 is a secretary protein, because substantial amounts of the activity were detected in the cell medium and no p"
https://openalex.org/W2068990208,"When cells are exposed to certain external stimuli, arachidonic acid (AA) is released from the membrane and serves as a precursor of various types of eicosanoids. A Ca2+-regulated cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) plays a dominant role in the release of AA. To closely examine the relation between Ca2+ response and AA release by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, we established several lines of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing platelet-activating factor receptor or leukotriene B4receptor. Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) demonstrated that cell lines capable of releasing AA elicited a sustained [Ca2+]iincrease when stimulated by agonists. The prolonged [Ca2+]i elevation is the result of Ca2+ entry, because this elevation was blocked by EGTA treatment or in the presence of Ca2+ channel blockers (SKF 96365 and methoxyverapamil). cPLA2 fused with a green fluorescent protein (cPLA2-GFP) translocated from the cytosol to the perinuclear region in response to increases in [Ca2+]i. When EGTA was added shortly after [Ca2+]i increase, the cPLA2-GFP returned to the cytosol, without liberating AA. After a prolonged [Ca2+]i increase, even by EGTA treatment, the enzyme was not readily redistributed to the cytosol. Thus, we propose that a critical time length of [Ca2+]i elevation is required for continuous membrane localization and full activation of cPLA2. When cells are exposed to certain external stimuli, arachidonic acid (AA) is released from the membrane and serves as a precursor of various types of eicosanoids. A Ca2+-regulated cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) plays a dominant role in the release of AA. To closely examine the relation between Ca2+ response and AA release by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, we established several lines of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing platelet-activating factor receptor or leukotriene B4receptor. Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) demonstrated that cell lines capable of releasing AA elicited a sustained [Ca2+]iincrease when stimulated by agonists. The prolonged [Ca2+]i elevation is the result of Ca2+ entry, because this elevation was blocked by EGTA treatment or in the presence of Ca2+ channel blockers (SKF 96365 and methoxyverapamil). cPLA2 fused with a green fluorescent protein (cPLA2-GFP) translocated from the cytosol to the perinuclear region in response to increases in [Ca2+]i. When EGTA was added shortly after [Ca2+]i increase, the cPLA2-GFP returned to the cytosol, without liberating AA. After a prolonged [Ca2+]i increase, even by EGTA treatment, the enzyme was not readily redistributed to the cytosol. Thus, we propose that a critical time length of [Ca2+]i elevation is required for continuous membrane localization and full activation of cPLA2.

We found that a critical time length of [Ca2+]i elevation is required for continuous translocation of cPLA2 to the membrane and for the release of AA.DISCUSSIONcPLA2 plays a major role in releasing AA upon cell stimuli and in production of eicosanoids (10Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11Bonventre J.V.

A. 1992; 89: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). This enzyme is activated by [Ca2+]i increases in physiological ranges. Although previous reports have shown by immunohistochemical and biochemical methods that cPLA2 is translocated to membranes in response to [Ca2+]i increases, the dynamic change of the enzyme localization in the living cell has not been reported. The question we addressed here was how different Ca2+ signaling patterns control cPLA2translocation and AA release. We found that a critical time length of [Ca2+]i elevation is required for continuous membrane localization and full activation of cPLA2.Optimal concentrations of PAF and LTB4 triggered comparable maximal increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO cell lines expressing PAF and/or LTB4 receptor. However, duration of the [Ca2+]i increase varied with the cell line (Fig. 1). Correlations between Ca2+ signaling pattern (transient or sustained) and response in AA release (Table I) raised the possibility that the agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling pattern is responsible for the release of AA. Calcium mobilization from internal stores and subsequent Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space are the two major components of Ca2+signaling following activation of cell-surface receptors. The inability of PAF to induce AA release in Ca2+-free medium (Fig.4 A) or in the presence of Ca2+ channel blockers (Fig. 4 B) indicates the critical role of Ca2+influx in AA release. This is consistent with the previous observations, in which AA release has been linked to Ca2+influx (21Brooks R.C. McCarthy K.D. Lapetina E.G. Morell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20147-20153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane occurs via voltage-, store-, or receptor-operated channels. Although the primary route of Ca2+ influx in CHO cells remains to be elucidated, 100 μm nifedipine, an L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, had no apparent effects on the Ca2+ influx induced by PAF or LTB4 (data not shown).Stimulation of PAF receptor exerts various responses, including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activations of MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipases C and D, and tyrosine kinases, as well as increase in [Ca2+]i (24Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 32Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim.

Although MAPK was activated by PAF and LTB4 to about the same extent in PAF-LT cells (data not shown), LTB4 did not induce AA release (Table I), suggesting that MAPK activation with a transient [Ca2+]i increase is insufficient to induce AA release. The experiments using ionomycin and EGTA confirmed that a sustained [Ca2+]iincrease is essential for AA release in CHO cells (Fig. 5 D). The difference in the extent of AA release between PAF and ionomycin (Fig. 5, C and D) is probably due to phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAPK. Whereas PAF induced MAPK activation (34Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mobility shift of cPLA2 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Sakanaka C. Ferby I. Waga I. Bito H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), ionomycin did not activate MAPK or promote the gel shift of cPLA2 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the previous reports that phosphorylation of cPLA2 increases its intrinsic enzymatic activity (7Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31693-31700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that, in mouse peritoneal macrophages, the effects of phosphorylation of cPLA2 on AA release differ depending on whether calcium response is transient or sustained (40Qiu Z.-H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to identify fully the individual and combined roles of calcium and phosphorylation for the activation of cPLA2 in various types of cells.Calcium-mediated translocation of heterologously expressed cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum was shown previously in CHO cells using an anti-cPLA2 antibody (14Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because immunohistochemical studies provide only a static picture and have a possible loss in signal linearity due to fixation, permeabilization, and staining of the cells, we took advantage of the GFP fusion protein and digital imaging technique to monitor cPLA2 translocation in real time in living cells. Although the endoplasmic reticulum forms a fine reticular network throughout the cytoplasm and around the nuclear envelope in CHO cells (41Náray-Fejes-Tóth A. Fejes-Tóth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15436-15442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), cPLA2-GFP was translocated upon [Ca2+]i increase to a restricted space at the perinuclear region including the nuclear envelope (Figs. 6 and 7). This observation may be consistent with the study in rat alveolar epithelial cells, in which stimulation with a calcium ionophore A23187 induced translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear membrane fraction and preferential loss of AA from this membrane fraction (42Peters-Golden M. Song K. Marshall T. Brock T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, functional activation of cPLA2 takes place after translocation to the perinuclear region. Mechanisms involved in the preferential targeting of the enzyme to this site are under investigation.Another important finding of the present study is that a brief [Ca2+]i rise caused a transient translocation of cPLA2 without AA release, whereas an increase in [Ca2+]i of longer duration (∼5 min) induced a prolonged translocation of cPLA2 and AA release even after [Ca2+]i returned to the resting level (Figs. 5and 7). To explain these observations, we propose a two-step mechanism for cPLA2 activation. In the initial step, cPLA2 is translocated to the perinuclear region upon increase in [Ca2+]i and weakly binds to the membranes. The enzyme is not yet activated, and the translocation can be readily reversed upon decrease in [Ca2+]i. In the second step, the binding of cPLA2 to the membranes becomes stronger with a marked reduction in the dissociation rate. Concomitantly, the enzyme is activated. The transfer from the first step to the second requires a critical length of continuous [Ca2+]i increase. The critical duration of [Ca2+]i increase was ∼2 min in PAF11 cells but may differ depending on the cell type and the level of cPLA2 expression. Possible mechanisms by which cPLA2 is transferred from the weak-binding state to the strong-binding state include conformational change of cPLA2by phosphorylation (7Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar), dissociation of inhibitory proteins such as p11 (43Wu T. Angus C.W. Yao X.L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and interaction with anchoring or activating factors (44Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The requirement of critical duration of [Ca2+]iincrease for the activation of cPLA2 may serve as a safety mechanism to discriminate appropriate signals from transient fluctuations of [Ca2+]i. Once the [Ca2+]i transient exceeds the critical duration, the strong-binding state of cPLA2 allows the cells to produce AA for prolonged periods even after [Ca2+]i returns to the resting value.

Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and/or leukotriene B4(LTB4) receptor (25Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In CHO cells, cPLA2 is expressed endogenously and coupled to receptor-mediated release of AA (26Lin L.-L. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 27Vial D. Piomelli D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2765-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We found that a critical time length of [Ca2+]i elevation is required for continuous translocation of cPLA2 to the membrane and for the release of AA. DISCUSSIONcPLA2 plays a major role in releasing AA upon cell stimuli and in production of eicosanoids (10Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A.

This enzyme is activated by [Ca2+]i increases in physiological ranges. Although previous reports have shown by immunohistochemical and biochemical methods that cPLA2 is translocated to membranes in response to [Ca2+]i increases, the dynamic change of the enzyme localization in the living cell has not been reported. The question we addressed here was how different Ca2+ signaling patterns control cPLA2translocation and AA release. We found that a critical time length of [Ca2+]i elevation is required for continuous membrane localization and full activation of cPLA2.Optimal concentrations of PAF and LTB4 triggered comparable maximal increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO cell lines expressing PAF and/or LTB4 receptor. However, duration of the [Ca2+]i increase varied with the cell line (Fig. 1). Correlations between Ca2+ signaling pattern (transient or sustained) and response in AA release (Table I) raised the possibility that the agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling pattern is responsible for the release of AA. Calcium mobilization from internal stores and subsequent Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space are the two major components of Ca2+signaling following activation of cell-surface receptors. The inability of PAF to induce AA release in Ca2+-free medium (Fig.4 A) or in the presence of Ca2+ channel blockers (Fig. 4 B) indicates the critical role of Ca2+influx in AA release. This is consistent with the previous observations, in which AA release has been linked to Ca2+influx (21Brooks R.C. McCarthy K.D. Lapetina E.G. Morell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20147-20153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane occurs via voltage-, store-, or receptor-operated channels. Although the primary route of Ca2+ influx in CHO cells remains to be elucidated, 100 μm nifedipine, an L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, had no apparent effects on the Ca2+ influx induced by PAF or LTB4 (data not shown).Stimulation of PAF receptor exerts various responses, including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activations of MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipases C and D, and tyrosine kinases, as well as increase in [Ca2+]i (24Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 32Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim.

Although MAPK was activated by PAF and LTB4 to about the same extent in PAF-LT cells (data not shown), LTB4 did not induce AA release (Table I), suggesting that MAPK activation with a transient [Ca2+]i increase is insufficient to induce AA release. The experiments using ionomycin and EGTA confirmed that a sustained [Ca2+]iincrease is essential for AA release in CHO cells (Fig. 5 D). The difference in the extent of AA release between PAF and ionomycin (Fig. 5, C and D) is probably due to phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAPK. Whereas PAF induced MAPK activation (34Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mobility shift of cPLA2 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Sakanaka C. Ferby I. Waga I. Bito H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), ionomycin did not activate MAPK or promote the gel shift of cPLA2 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the previous reports that phosphorylation of cPLA2 increases its intrinsic enzymatic activity (7Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31693-31700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that, in mouse peritoneal macrophages, the effects of phosphorylation of cPLA2 on AA release differ depending on whether calcium response is transient or sustained (40Qiu Z.-H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to identify fully the individual and combined roles of calcium and phosphorylation for the activation of cPLA2 in various types of cells.Calcium-mediated translocation of heterologously expressed cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum was shown previously in CHO cells using an anti-cPLA2 antibody (14Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because immunohistochemical studies provide only a static picture and have a possible loss in signal linearity due to fixation, permeabilization, and staining of the cells, we took advantage of the GFP fusion protein and digital imaging technique to monitor cPLA2 translocation in real time in living cells. Although the endoplasmic reticulum forms a fine reticular network throughout the cytoplasm and around the nuclear envelope in CHO cells (41Náray-Fejes-Tóth A. Fejes-Tóth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15436-15442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), cPLA2-GFP was translocated upon [Ca2+]i increase to a restricted space at the perinuclear region including the nuclear envelope (Figs. 6 and 7). This observation may be consistent with the study in rat alveolar epithelial cells, in which stimulation with a calcium ionophore A23187 induced translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear membrane fraction and preferential loss of AA from this membrane fraction (42Peters-Golden M. Song K. Marshall T. Brock T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, functional activation of cPLA2 takes place after translocation to the perinuclear region. Mechanisms involved in the preferential targeting of the enzyme to this site are under investigation.Another important finding of the present study is that a brief [Ca2+]i rise caused a transient translocation of cPLA2 without AA release, whereas an increase in [Ca2+]i of longer duration (∼5 min) induced a prolonged translocation of cPLA2 and AA release even after [Ca2+]i returned to the resting level (Figs. 5and 7). To explain these observations, we propose a two-step mechanism for cPLA2 activation. In the initial step, cPLA2 is translocated to the perinuclear region upon increase in [Ca2+]i and weakly binds to the membranes. The enzyme is not yet activated, and the translocation can be readily reversed upon decrease in [Ca2+]i. In the second step, the binding of cPLA2 to the membranes becomes stronger with a marked reduction in the dissociation rate. Concomitantly, the enzyme is activated. The transfer from the first step to the second requires a critical length of continuous [Ca2+]i increase. The critical duration of [Ca2+]i increase was ∼2 min in PAF11 cells but may differ depending on the cell type and the level of cPLA2 expression. Possible mechanisms by which cPLA2 is transferred from the weak-binding state to the strong-binding state include conformational change of cPLA2by phosphorylation (7Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar), dissociation of inhibitory proteins such as p11 (43Wu T. Angus C.W. Yao X.L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17145-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and interaction with anchoring or activating factors (44Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The requirement of critical duration of [Ca2+]iincrease for the activation of cPLA2 may serve as a safety mechanism to discriminate appropriate signals from transient fluctuations of [Ca2+]i. Once the [Ca2+]i transient exceeds the critical duration, the strong-binding state of cPLA2 allows the cells to produce AA for prolonged periods even after [Ca2+]i returns to the resting value. cPLA2 plays a major role in releasing AA upon cell stimuli and in production of eicosanoids (10Uozumi N.

https://openalex.org/W1977909615,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a pluripotent cytokine with a wide range of target cells. Heparan sulfate binds bFGF, and this interaction has been demonstrated to protect bFGF against physical denaturation and protease degradation. The high concentrations of heparan sulfate in basement membranes have implicated these matrices as storage sites for bFGF in vivo. However, the mechanisms by which basement membranes modulate bFGF storage and release is unknown. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we have developed experimental and mathematical models of extracellular growth factor transport through basement membrane. Intact Descemet's membranes isolated from bovine corneas were mounted within customized diffusion cells and growth factor transport was measured under a variety of conditions that decoupled the diffusion process from the heparan sulfate binding phenomenon. Transport experiments were conducted with bFGF and interleukin 1β. In addition, bFGF-heparan sulfate binding was disrupted in diffusion studies with high ionic strength buffer and buffers containing protamine sulfate. Transport of bFGF was enhanced dramatically when heparan sulfate binding was inhibited. This process was modeled as a problem of diffusion with fast reversible binding. Experimental parameters were incorporated into a mathematical model and independent simulations were run that showed that the experimental data were accurately predicted by the mathematical model. Thus, this study indicated that basement membranes function as dynamic regulators of growth factor transport, allowing for rapid response to changing environmental conditions.

It has been implicated in processes ranging from wound healing to tumor growth (1Baird A. Walicke P.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1989; 45: 438-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Like the other members of the FGF family, bFGF binds heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). The association of bFGF with heparin/HS is characterized by a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. This interaction stabilizes the growth factor and protects it from proteolytic degradation (3Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In vivo, HS is found linked to a protein core as a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Basic FGF has been localized to HS sites in a specific extracellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, and it is a potent mitogen for the endothelial cells that border basement membranes (4Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Sasse J. Wadzinski M. Ingber D. Vlodavsky I. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 130: 393-400PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jeanny J. Fayein N. Moenner M. Chevallier B. Barritault D. Courtois Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, under normal physiological conditions these cell layers remain relatively quiescent. This observation, in conjunction with other in vivo and in vitro evidence, suggests that basement membrane HS plays a critical role in modulating the activity of bFGF by providing a natural reservoir for bFGF (6Baird A.

However, it is unclear how the basement membrane HS functions as a reservoir and regulates the transport of bFGF through ECM. basic fibroblast growth factor heparan sulfate extracellular matrix Descemet's membrane bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline interleukin 1β basic fibroblast growth factor heparan sulfate extracellular matrix Descemet's membrane bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline interleukin 1β Several mechanisms have been proposed for the ECM-bFGF reservoir. Release of bFGF could be triggered by degradation of HS or the membrane by glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes or protease activity. Alternatively, the growth factor could take advantage of nonspecific interactions with the HS chains and experience a form of one-dimensional diffusion along the HS chains allowing for accelerated movement through the matrix. This type of process might require that the HS concentrations reach a level where a continuous HS pathway through the matrix is available. Another possibility is that the rapid kinetics of bFGF association and dissociation from HS could provide a dynamic reservoir of bFGF that could release or incorporate bFGF in response to changes in the local bFGF or HS concentrations. Our previous studies on the kinetics of bFGF·HS binding suggest that the average lifetime of an bFGF·HS complex is approximately 1 min (11Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid binding could facilitate a dynamic storage and release system for bFGF that would not absolutely require matrix degradation to trigger release. Researchers using in vitro systems have studied the properties of bFGF movement through artificial extracellular matrices and negatively charged hydrogels. Dabin and Courtois (12Dabin I. Courtois Y.

Physiol. 1991; 147: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) conducted diffusion experiments with radiolabeled bFGF through MatrigelTM, an extract of Engelbreth Holm Swarm tumor matrix that is rich in HS. In their studies, either increasing the concentration of bFGF or adding soluble heparin along with bFGF, increased the amount of bFGF that crossed a layer of matrigel. Likewise, Flaumenhaft et al. (13Flaumenhaft R. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) showed that positively charged proteins such as cytochrome c and bFGF demonstrated reduced diffusion through negatively charged agarose gels, and that both heparin and protamine sulfate can increase the radius of diffusion of bFGF and cytochrome c. They reported similar phenomena for diffusion within fibrin gels and cultured cell layers. Furthermore, a recent study on the permeation of bFGF across rabbit buccal mucosa demonstrated increased permeation with denaturation of bFGF with guanidine HCl (14Johnston T.P. Rahman A. Alur H. Shah D. Mitra A.K. Pharmacol. Res. 1998; 15: 246-253Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is likely that denaturation of bFGF resulted in a loss in heparin binding activity which might have imparted increased permeation properties to bFGF. While these critical studies identified heparan sulfate as an important factor that can control the movement of bFGF through matrices, they did not provide information about the mechanism of this matrix transport. In addition, no data currently exist on the movement of bFGF through actual basement membrane samples. More controlled experimental systems need to be developed using actual basement membrane samples to obtain mechanistic information, and to determine how changes in the nature of bFGF, or its concentration, would affect transport in basement membranes. Furthermore, critical elements in the process can be identified by building mathematical models that incorporate the potentially important interactions between the matrix and its soluble components, thus enabling a comparison of the model's predictions to empirical studies. In this way, a systematic framework for understanding the interplay of key matrix/growth factor parameters can be developed. In the present study we analyzed the transport of bFGF across Descemet's membrane (DM), the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, using a model that considers the diffusion of bFGF through the interstices of the membrane coupled with fast, reversible association of bFGF to resident HS chains. Descemet's membrane is situated in the anterior region of the cornea between the corneal stroma and the endothelium. Its molecular structure is dominated by a dense meshwork of collagen VIII (15Kapoor R. Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3930-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Sawada H. Cell Tissue Res. 1982; 226: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Sawada H. Konomi H. Hirosawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The presence of the other major basement membrane components, collagen IV, laminin, entactin, fibronectin, and perlecan heparan sulfate proteoglycan has also been demonstrated (18Ljubimov A.V. Burgeson R.E. Butkowski R.J. Michael A.F. Sun T. Kenney M.C. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 461-473PubMed Google Scholar, 19Labermeier U. Demlow T.A. Kenney M.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 37: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ultrastructure of the DM has been determined by electron microscopy to be based on a lamellar hexagonal lattice of 80 nm nodes connected by rods approximately 120 nm long and 25 nm in diameter (16Sawada H. Cell Tissue Res. 1982; 226: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bovine DM can be as much as 100-μm thick making it possible to physically isolate it for diffusion studies. Furthermore, the DM was the first basement membrane identified as a potentialin vivo bFGF reservoir (4Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Sasse J. Wadzinski M. Ingber D. Vlodavsky I. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 130: 393-400PubMed Google Scholar). Basic FGF diffusion through the DM was measured with a diffusion chamber apparatus under different conditions that decoupled the diffusion process from the binding phenomenon. The diffusivity data was incorporated into a diffusion/binding model along with independent measurements of the bFGF-HS interaction. This model was used to simulate experimental results and suggests that the essential elements of the basement membrane bFGF reservoir are governed by diffusion and binding of bFGF. bFGF (human recombinant) (18 kDa) was from Scios-Nova (Mountain View, CA). Human recombinant125I-interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent were obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). 125I-bFGF was prepared using a modification of the Bolton-Hunter method (11Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).125I-bFGF has been demonstrated to be as active as unlabeled bFGF at stimulating DNA synthesis in and binding to quiescent Balb/c3T3 cells (11Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21256-21264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fannon M.

Sodium chloride, sodium azide, pepstatin, leupeptin, N-ethylmaleimide, trichloroacetic acid, and potassium iodide were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to human recombinant bFGF (mouse, anti-human) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (from sheep) whole antibody was from Amersham. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Bovuminar Cohn Fraction V) was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Microreaction columns were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). Sephadex G-25 PD-10 columns and heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography media were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Diffusion chambers and clamps were obtained from Crown Glass Co. (Sommerville, NJ). Solution concentrations of bFGF were measured, in some cases, using a human bFGF Quantikine Immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Tween 20 was purchased from Bio-Rad. 3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Immobilon P and Duropore 0.65-μm membranes were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Whole bovine eyes were obtained from Pel-Freeze (Rodgers, AK) and shipped overnight on ice after harvest. The cornea was removed by cutting along its periphery with curved scissors, and placed endothelium face up on a spherical surface. The endothelium was removed by repeated wiping with a tissue followed with PBS rinses. A curved Teflon spatula was used to score the surface of the DM into quarters, and the DM was wetted with PBS. The exposed edge of the DM was gradually teased away from the stroma using the wedge-shaped edge of the Teflon spatula. Upon removal, the DM was placed in a vial with storage buffer (PBS, 0.1% sodium azide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide). Membrane sections were stored in the refrigerator for as long as 2 months with no noticeable change in transport properties, but they were generally used within 3 weeks of dissection. In control studies, the permeability of freshly isolated membranes was analyzed over 4 days using a mixture of fluorescent dextrans and no time-dependent changes were noted. Furthermore, the permeability of bFGF was measured under identical experimental conditions in membranes stored for 5, 14, 27, and 36 days. In these studies FGF permeability varied by ≤13% from experiment to experiment with neither an increasing nor decreasing trend with time of membrane storage. The variability in bFGF permeability between experiments was generally less than or equal to that observed with multiple membranes in a single experiment. Dissected membranes were fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and stained for basement membrane with the periodic acid shiff reagent (22McManas J.F.A. Nature. 1946; 158: 202Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of membrane preparations revealed no evidence of residual corneal stroma or endothelium (data not shown). Immediately prior to each diffusion experiment, 125I-bFGF samples were purified on heparin columns to separate non-heparin binding bFGF and dissociated free 125I from native 125I-bFGF. Heparin-Sepharose CL-6B was dissolved in deionized water to form a 1:2 gel to water slurry. A 100-μl column was poured using U. S. Biochemical Corp. compact reaction columns and 1 liter of PBS was run over the column overnight. Leaching rates of heparin from the column after this wash were shown to be negligible. The column was equilibrated with approximately 30 ml of chilled PBS, 1 mg/ml BSA (PBS-BSA) buffer. All buffers that contacted bFGF were prepared with PBS with 1 mg/ml BSA as a carrier protein to reduce surface adsorption losses of bFGF. A 100-μl aliquot of 125I-bFGF (1–3 μg/ml) diluted with 200 μl of PBS-BSA was applied to the column. The column with bFGF was maintained in suspension on ice for a 10-min incubation period to allow bFGF to bind the heparin. 30 ml of chilled 0.5 m NaCl PBS were passed over the column to remove free label and unbound bFGF. After draining the column to its bed surface, 300 μl of 3.0 m NaCl in 1 mg/ml PBS was added to the gel, and incubated on ice for another 10 min. The column was centrifuged (10,000 × g for 30 s) into a 2-ml centrifuged tube to remove the eluant. In experiments conducted in 3.0m NaCl buffer, the centrifugation step was omitted, and bFGF was eluted with 4 × 200-μl volumes of 3.0 mNaCl. The final concentration of 125I-bFGF was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The radioactivity in the heparin-Sepharose purified material was greater than 99.0% precipitable by trichloroacetic acid. Size exclusion gel filtration chromatography was used to separate free125I-label from 125I-IL-1β and inactive125I-bFGF. In these cases, a PD-10 column containing Sephadex G-25 gel filtration media was used to remove the free label. The column was equilibrated and the separation was conducted in PBS-BSA buffer. The radioactive peak that eluted in the void volume was collected as the radioactive protein. Greater than 98.5% of the radioactivity in the void volume was trichloroacetic acid precipitable. Additional gel filtration chromatographic analysis of the non-binding bFGF showed no evidence of oligomerization as compared with native bFGF. Thus, the inactive bFGF fraction appears to be similar in size yet without the heparin-binding affinity of native bFGF. Fig. 1is a schematic of the diffusion cell apparatus with membrane slide mounts. The chamber apparatus was secured with a metal clamp attached to a Lucite base. The glass diffusion cells and mounts were coated to reduce protein adsorption through the covalent attachment of short carbohydrate chains to their glass surfaces (23Regnier F.E. Noel R. J. Chromatogr. Sci. 1976; 14: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The chambers and membrane mounts were soaked in 6 n HCl overnight and washed exhaustively with deionized water to remove impurities. The coating solution was prepared with 25 ml of 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 225 ml of deionized water, and 62.5 μl of 1 m HCl to adjust the solution pH to 3.5. The chambers and slides were coated for 6 h at 90 °C, including a 1-h warm-up period to prevent the glass chambers from fracturing. Following the coating the chambers were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and placed in a dry box for storage. Control experiments using model compounds (urea and sucrose), with known aqueous diffusion coefficients, and a synthetic hydrophilic membrane (Durapore 0.65 μm) were conducted to ensure that the membrane slide mounts did not introduce significant boundary layer effects near the surface of the membranes. Membranes were placed between the two slide mounts, bolted in place, and the slides were positioned between the two diffusion cells. A bead of vacuum grease (Dow Corning Silicone vacuum grease) was applied around the face of each of the diffusion cells to maintain a water-tight seal. The clamp was tightened only until resistance was felt so as not to puncture the membranes. 3 ml of 0.22-μm filtered PBS-BSA was added to each chamber and the apparatus was placed on a stir plate at 4 °C. A coated Teflon microstir bar was added to each cell. These stir bars were surface modified by Corning Inc. with a polyethylene oxide-like, non-ionic, hydrophilic coating to limit protein adsorption to the Teflon (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY). The stirring rate was adjusted to 500 rpm. The assembled chambers were allowed to equilibrate for 15–20 h prior to initiating diffusion experiments. The buffer in the sink chamber was removed and replaced with fresh buffer immediately prior to the start of the experiment. The contents of the source chamber was replaced with a phosphate buffer (10 mm NaPO4 pH 7.4) lacking salt in experiments with native bFGF, since the 125I-bFGF sample provided enough salt to bring the final concentration in the source chamber to 150 mm. Standard PBS-BSA was used in the source chamber in studies with non-heparin binding bFGF or IL-1β. Experiments were initiated by introducing purified radiolabeled protein to the source chamber. Over the course of the experiment, 200-μl samples were removed from the sink chamber at each time point. This volume was replaced with fresh PBS-BSA. The source chamber was also sampled at various time points during the course of the experiment. All samples were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation to quantify125I-protein. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was used to distinguish free radiolabel from radiolabeled protein. For a 200-μl sample to be precipitated, the following volumes were added: 1) 1.25 ml of PBS or saline; 2) 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA; and 3) 200 μl of 10 mm KI. The samples were precipitated with 250 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, vortexed vigorously, and placed on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,800 × g and the supernatant was removed. The pellets were washed with 500 μl of 14% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged again. Radioactivity in the pellet, supernatant, and wash solutions was measured in a γ-counter (Packard Auto-γ 5650). The thickness of the membrane is a critical parameter in the diffusion process. The thickness of each membrane was measured after each diffusion experiment by taking advantage of its natural tendency to curl over on itself. The membrane was viewed in cross-section and photomicrographs were made at × 200 using a Nikon Diaphott microscope (Nikon). Membrane thicknesses were measured with a calibrated micrometer photographed at the same magnification. Based on 26 individual diffusion experiments with Descemet's membrane, the average membrane thickness was 40 μm with a standard deviation of 8 μm. The total thickness variation across a given membrane averaged 14 μm. The data from each diffusion study was normalized to the thickness of the particular membrane used. While experiments conducted in 3.0 m NaCl buffer were also normalized to the thickness of the particular membrane used in those experiments, theoretical considerations suggest that membranes might be altered physically by the high ionic strength. Thus to evaluate whether the high salt conditions were altering membrane thickness, individual membranes were fixed in place in a continuous flow viewing chamber constructed of two glass slides and a neoprene gasket. Membranes within chambers containing 150 mm NaCl PBS were positioned on a microscope and photographed for baseline thickness measurements and then the buffer was exchanged to 3.0 m NaCl phosphate buffer through 20-gauge needle input and export ports within the chamber. Ionic strength was monitored in the outflow with an on-line conductivity meter and flow was stopped when the buffer was fully exchanged. Membrane thickness measurements were taken at the exact same positions along the fixed membrane over a 24-h period. An ∼10% reduction in membrane thickness was noted after membrane equilibration into 3.0 m NaCl phosphate buffer. At the end (24 h) of diffusion experiments using high bFGF concentrations (1 μm) samples were removed from the sink chambers and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% running gel) under reducing conditions (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar). Control lanes were included containing PBS-BSA buffer alone. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon P membranes and bFGF was detected with an anti-bFGF antibody (25Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked overnight in 10% milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, probed for 1 h at 37 °C with mAb anti-bFGF type II at 1:1000 dilution, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (from sheep) at 1:1000 dilution. The bands were visualized with Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescent reagent (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) on X-Omat AR scientific imaging film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). After the chemiluminescent reagent had been exhausted, a fresh piece of film was placed over the blot and allowed to expose for 2 months at −70 °C to detect radioactive samples. Sink chamber bFGF was also determined to retain its heparin binding activity as determined by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Descemet's membranes were dissected as described above and diced until the larger pieces were approximately 1 mm2. U. S. Biochemical Corp. microcolumns were incubated in PBS-BSA and then weighed dry. Membranes (0.052–0.065 g) were added to each column and allowed to incubate in PBS-BSA while being constantly inverted at 4 °C for 12 h. The wet mass of the membranes was determined by centrifuging the columns for 30 s at 50 × g to remove excess solution and subsequently by measuring the total mass. Five hundred microliters of PBS-BSA containing non-heparin binding 125I-bFGF or125I-IL-1β were added to the membranes in the columns and incubated at 4 °C with constant rotation for 5 h. The centrifugation step was repeated. The membrane containing columns and their incubation solutions were weighed and the radioactivity was measured with a γ-counter. The volume of incubation solution was determined by mass difference. PBS-BSA was applied through the membrane containing columns at 4 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and 2-ml fractions were collected. Radioactivity in these fractions was measured in a γ-counter. The partition coefficient was determined from the known membrane volume (V mem), the total amount of elutable radioactivity from the membranes (γmem), the volume of incubation solution (V bulk), and the total cpm of the incubation solution (γbulk). K=γmemVmemγbulkVbulkEquation 1 The partition coefficient for bFGF in the DM was 1.48 ± 0.03 and for IL-1β was 1.49 ± 0.05. The reported errors represent half the total range for duplicate determinations. The goal of this study was to determine if the complex process of bFGF transport through basement membrane could be described with a simple diffusion/binding model. Thus, bFGF would diffuse through the matrix of the basement membrane and experience rapid, reversible association with the resident HS chains. Diffusion with reaction can be represented by the following equation, ∂b∂t=Deff∂2b∂x2−∂c∂tEquation 2 Here, b is the molar concentration of free bFGF in the membrane. The concentration of bFGF·HS complex is represented byc. As this is a one-dimensional equation for diffusion,t is time, and χ is the distance through the matrix.D eff is the effective diffusivity of bFGF in the ECM. The diffusivity of bFGF through the tight meshwork of ECM is expected to be much lower than the free aqueous diffusivity of bFGF.K is a partition coefficient that relates the concentration of unbound bFGF in the matrix to its bulk concentration. This value will be influenced by the nature of bFGF's interaction with the membrane and the proportion of the total aqueous volume of the matrix that is available to bFGF. In this formulation of the problem, the partition coefficient does not encompass the equilibrium binding interaction of bFGF with HS. The association of bFGF with HS sites in the membrane was modeled as a reversible association with a single class of binding sites with no cooperativity. ∂c∂t=kon·b·h−koff·cEquation 3 where k on and k offare the on- and off-rate constants for the interaction of bFGF with HS and h is the concentration of uncomplexed HS sites in the membrane. The concentrations of complex and free HS sites are also subject to the following constraint, htot=c+hEquation 4 where h tot is the total number of HS sites. Values for both the concentration of complexes (c) and the total concentration of HS sites (h tot) reflect the presence of multiple bFGF binding sites per HS molecule. If the binding events take place on a much shorter time scale"
https://openalex.org/W2026922732,"We have identified altered lineage-specific expression of an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene, Galgt2, as the gain-of-function mechanism responsible for the action of the Mvwf locus, a major modifier of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) level in RIIIS/J mice. A switch of Galgt2 gene expression from intestinal epithelial cell-specific to a pattern restricted to the vascular endothelial cell bed leads to aberrant posttranslational modification and rapid clearance of VWF from plasma. Transgenic expression of Galgt2 directed to vascular endothelial cells reproduces the low VWF phenotype, confirming this switch in lineage-specific gene expression as the likely molecular mechanism for Mvwf. These findings identify alterations in glycosyltransferase function as a potential general mechanism for the genetic modification of plasma protein levels."

https://openalex.org/W2068378027,"PTH is a major regulator of calcium homeostasis by mobilizing calcium through bone resorption. We show that the expression of collagenase-3 (MMP-13), a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases, required for the cleavage of collagens in the bone, is increased upon PTH injection in mice. A cis-acting element in the collagenase-3 promoter was identified which, together with AP-1, is required for induction by PTH. This element contains CCACA motifs which are required for binding of the 65 kDa osteoblast-specific splice variant of Cbfa1. Introduction of mutations in this binding site that interfere with protein interaction also eliminates PTH inducibilty and transactivation by Cbfa/Runt proteins. While DNA binding activity of AP-1 is increased upon PTH treatment, high basal level of Cbfa/Runt binding activity is detectable in untreated cells which is not further increased by PTH, suggesting that AP-1 and Cbfa1 contribute to transcriptional activation through different mechanisms. In agreement with the critical role of both proteins defined in tissue culture cells, expression of collagenase-3 is reduced in mice lacking c-fos and is completely absent in cbfa1−/− embryos. These data provide the first evidence for a critical role of Cbfa1, a major regulator of bone development, in PTH-dependent processes such as bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W2081446858,"An approach to identify backbone conformational changes underlying nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gating was developed. Specific backbone peptide bonds were replaced with an ester, which disrupts backbone hydrogen bonds at the site of mutation. At a conserved proline residue (alphaPro221) in the first transmembrane (M1) domain, the amide-to-ester mutation provides receptors with near-normal sensitivity, although the natural amino acids tested other than Pro produce receptors that gate with a much larger EC50 than normal. Therefore, a backbone hydrogen bond at this site may interfere with normal gating. In the alphaM2 domain, the amide-to-ester mutation yielded functional receptors at 15 positions, 3 of which provided receptors with >10-fold lower EC50 than wild type. These results support a model for gating that includes significant changes of backbone conformation within the M2 domain."
https://openalex.org/W2056350794,"We used a perfused clot system to study the degradation of cross-linked fibrin. Multiangle laser light scattering showed that plasmin-mediated cleavage caused the release of noncovalently associated fibrin degradation products (FDPs) with a weight-averaged molar mass (M w) of ∼6 × 106 g/mol. The M w of FDPs is dependent on ionic strength, and the M wobserved at 0.15 m NaCl resulted from the self-association of FDPs having M w of ∼3.8 × 106 g/mol. Complete solubilization required the cleavage of ∼25% of fragment D/fragment E connections, with 48% α-, 62% β-, and 42% γ-chains cleaved. These results showed that D-E cleavage cannot be explained by a random mechanism, implying cooperativity. Gel filtration and multiangle laser light scattering showed that FDPs range from 2.5 × 105 to 1 × 107 g/mol. In addition to fragment E, FDPs are composed of fragments ranging from 2 × 105 Da (D-dimer, or DD) to at least 2.3 × 106 Da (DX8D). FDP mass distribution is consistent with a model whereby FDPs bind to fibrin with affinities proportional to fragment mass.

Fibrinogen is the target protein of the coagulation cascade, and, following vascular injury, fibrin comprises the major protein component of the hemostatic plug. Fibrinogen is a 340-kDa soluble plasma protein consisting of three pairs of disulfide-bonded α-, β-, and γ-chains arranged as depicted in Fig.1. The molecule consists of a central globular E region connected by coiled-coil regions to two identical globular D regions. In addition, two other structures comprising approximately the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the α-chains, designated αC regions, have been described (1Veklich Y.I. Gorkun O.V. Medved L.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2523-2530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The E and D regions in each half-molecule are delineated by a pair of disulfide rings, which link chains α to β, β to γ, and γ to α (3Zhang J.Z. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 652-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous plasmin- and thrombin-sensitive bonds have been identified and are shown in Fig. 1 (4Henschen A. Thromb. Res., Suppl. 1983; 5: 27-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin by catalyzing the proteolytic removal of both fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B. These cleavages unmask two polymerization sites in the E region, forming soluble fibrin, to which one D region from each of two fibrin(ogen) molecules can bind (5Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13687-13693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble fibrin spontaneously polymerizes to form double-stranded protofibrils, with the fibrin monomers within each strand arranged end to end and the fibrin across strands arranged in a half-staggered overlap, as depicted by the combination of strands a and b in Fig.2. The protofibrils may further associate laterally to produce fibers, which themselves may associate to form fiber bundles. Collectively, the protofibrils, fibers, and fiber bundles, variously branched, comprise the fibrin clot. As also indicated in Fig. 2, the γ-chains of adjacent D regions within a strand of a protofibril are covalently cross-linked by isopeptide bonds, the formation of which is catalyzed by factor XIIIa (6Weisel J.W. Francis C.W. Nagaswami C. Marder V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26618-26624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, in cross-linked fibrin, the individual strands consist of polymers of covalently linked fibrin molecules. Factor XIIIa more slowly catalyzes isopeptide bond formation in the αC region between multiple α-chains within and presumably between protofibrils (8Francis C.W. Marder V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Figure 2Fibrin formation and degradation. The production of γ-chain cross-linked fibrin occurs as a result of the actions of thrombin and factor XIIIa in the presence of calcium ion. Thrombin removes fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen, forming soluble fibrin. The fibrin monomers spontaneously polymerize, yielding a double-stranded protofibril. The monomers within each of the two strands (a and b) are arranged end-to-end, and each monomer in strand a is noncovalently associated (indicated by the triple lines) with two monomers in strand b in a half-staggered overlap, forming a protofibril. Thrombin also removes fibrinopeptide B from the fibrin monomers, which results in the lateral aggregation of the protofibrils into fibers. Factor XIIIa catalyzes isopeptide bond formation between the γ-chains in the D regions of adjacent monomers within a strand, resulting in a cross-linked clot. The production of FDPs occurs as the result of plasmin-mediated cleavage of the α-, β-, and γ-chains in at least four plasmin-sensitive regions. To produce FDPs, two sets of cleavages must occur (eg. 1 and 2,3 and 5, and 1 and 5) such that in each set, the cleavages occur between reciprocally noncovalently associated D and E regions in two monomers as indicated by the diagonal lines 1–7. The size and structure of the noncovalently associated soluble material depends on the distance between the two sets of cleavages. The nomenclature and approximate molecular weights of the intact FDPs are indicated. The FDPs may contain additional cleavages and still retain their noncovalent structures, provided that at least one chain between reciprocally noncovalently associated D and E regions is not cleaved.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The solubilization of fibrin is the result of selected bond cleavages catalyzed by plasmin. The cleavage of fibrinogen and fibrin by plasmin has been extensively studied (4Henschen A. Thromb. Res., Suppl. 1983; 5: 27-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Marder V.J.

Fragmentation of fibrinogen occurs upon cleavages within the α-chain to release the αC fragments, thereby producing fragment X (∼260 kDa; Fig. 1). Further cleavage of fragment X in the α-, β-, and γ-chains between the two disulfide rings in one half of the molecule (see arrowsin Fig. 1) produces fragment Y (∼160 kDa) and fragment D (∼100 kDa). Further cleavage of fragment Y produces a second fragment D and fragment E (∼60 kDa). The terminal fragments E and D approximately comprise the respective E and D regions of the parent fibrinogen molecule. The current model for the solubilization of γ-chain cross-linked fibrin is depicted in Fig. 2 (19Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1982; 8: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Marder V.J. Francis C.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The release of soluble material requires cleavage of the α-, β-, and γ-chains between the two disulfide rings in the region connecting the E and D regions of the fibrin monomers that are across from one another in the two strands of the protofibril. These are the same bonds that are cleaved in fibrinogen (25Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1986; 37: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two sets of such cleavages must occur to obtain soluble products (Fig. 2). Numerous soluble products can be produced, the nature of which depends on the relative locations of the sets of cleavages. Examples are shown in Fig. 2. Cleavages depicted by1 and 2, for example, yield the limit product of digestion of cross-linked fibrin, which is a species consisting of covalently cross-linked D regions from one strand (D-dimer (DD) 1The abbreviations DDD-dimerPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTBSTris-buffered salineHBSHEPES-buffered salineFDPfibrin degradation productVFKckvalyl-phenylalanyl-lysyl chloromethylketoneM wweight-averaged molar massRMSrroot mean square radiusTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine ) noncovalently associated with the E region from the other strand. This product is designated DD/E. Larger products are produced by sets of cleavages more distant than that which generates DD/E. Some examples are shown by sets1 and 3, 1 and 4, and1 and 5 in Fig. 2. Cleavages 1 and 3 produce two noncovalently associated DY fragments (DY/YD); cleavages 1 and 4 produce fragments DXD and YY associated noncovalently with one another (DXD/YY); and cleavages 1 and 5 produce two noncovalently associated DXY fragments (DXY/YXD). This pattern can be extended to include sets of cleavages more distant than those depicted in Fig. 2, but the upper limit for the distance and the corresponding limit size of soluble material is not known. In addition to the cleavages depicted in Fig. 2, cleavages within the connecting regions in each strand of each of the products (DY/YD, DXD/YY, and DXY/YXD) are possible, subject to the restraint that not all of the α-, β-, and γ-chains of connecting regions across from one another on the two strands are cleaved, since this would produce two new noncovalently associated products.

Consequently, the studies described in this paper were carried out in order to identify and quantify the molecules released during the process of plasmin-catalyzed solubilization of cross-linked fibrin with respect to average molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, covalent structure, and α-, β-, and γ-chain composition and their extents of cleavage. These were accomplished by collecting the materials solubilized from clots perfused with plasmin, inhibiting the plasmin in the eluted material to eliminate or at least minimize further degradation of soluble material, and analyzing the material by multiangle laser light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, and SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. All human proteins were purified from citrated fresh frozen human plasma obtained from the Kingston General Hospital (Kingston, Canada). Human thrombin was prepared from purified human prothrombin (26Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to a modified procedure of Lundbladet al. (27Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Prothrombin was dialyzed into a solution made up of 2 volumes 0.02 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 in 1 volume of water ( 23 TBS), and the concentration of prothrombin was adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml in 23 TBS. Prothrombin was activated to thrombin in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2, 10 μmphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles (75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine, made according to Barenholz (28Barenholz Y.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with stirring at room temperature (∼22 °C) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA (5 mm final) and loaded onto a 2.5 × 12-cm column of sulfopropyl-Sephadex C-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Canada) pre-equilibrated in 23 TBS. The column was washed with 23 TBS until A 280 was <0.01 and was then washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, until A 280 was <0.01. The thrombin was eluted using a linear gradient of sodium phosphate, pH 6.5 (0.1–0.3 m, 500 ml total), and the peak fractions were concentrated by precipitation with 80% ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The pellet obtained upon centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) of the precipitated solution was taken up in a minimal volume of 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Human Glu-plasminogen was isolated according to the procedure of Castellino and Powell (30Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with the following changes: no Trasylol was used during the purification; the plasma was not slurried, but adsorbed under vacuum to lysine-Sepharose in a sintered glass funnel over a 15-min period; 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.0, was used to equilibrate the lysine-Sepharose and to wash the protein-bound resin under light vacuum in a sintered glass funnel; 0.05 m Tris, 0.02m ε-aminocaproic acid was used to elute the plasminogen; and the plasminogen was concentrated with 80% ammonium sulfate, taken up in a minimal volume of 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Human plasmin was produced by a modification of the procedures of Bajzar et al. (31Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and Robbins and Summaria (32Robbins K.C. Summaria L. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 184-199Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 20 mg of plasminogen was dissolved into 20 ml in 0.05 m Tris, 0.15m NaCl, pH 8.0 (TBS) and then dialyzed three times in 2 liters of the same buffer for 1 h each. The solution was made 25% (v/v) in glycerol and 50 mm in ε-aminocaproic acid. The activation was initiated by the addition of urokinase (Calbiochem) to 50 units/ml and was carried out at 37 °C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by the plasmin-catalyzed hydrolysis of S-2251 (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) at various times. When the level of plasmin appeared to plateau (∼120 min), a further 50 units/ml of urokinase was added, and the reaction was further monitored by S-2251 hydrolysis. A second plateau was reached at ∼210 min, and the solution was loaded onto an 8-ml benzamidine-Sepharose (Sigma, Oakville, Canada) column equilibrated in TBS. The column was washed with TBS, and the plasmin was eluted from the column with TBS, 0.02m benzamidine in 4-ml fractions. The plasmin-containing fractions were identified using the S-2251 assay and were concentrated by dialysis against 80% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The precipitated protein was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min, and the pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Active site titration using thep-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate HCl method of Chase and Shaw (33Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar) showed that the plasmin contained 100% active sites. Factor XIII was purified by a modified procedure of Janus et al. (34Lorand L. Credo R.B. Janus T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 250 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate, 1 mmEDTA was added to 1 liter of citrated, fresh frozen plasma on ice. The solution was allowed to sit for 1 h, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The pellet was washed vigorously with 200 ml of 20% saturated ammonium sulfate, 1 mm EDTA and recentrifuged. The drained pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.4. Saturated ammonium sulfate, 1 mm EDTA was added to 16% (v/v), and the sample was left at 22 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 30 min at 8 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.05 m Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5, and heated to 56 °C for 10 min in a water bath to denature/flocculate the fibrinogen, and the solution was clarified by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 8 °C. The supernatant was made 36% in saturated ammonium sulfate, 1 mm EDTA, and after 30 min at 22 °C it was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.05 m Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, dialyzed three times in 2 liters at 22 °C versusthe same buffer and loaded onto a 50-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated (22 °C) in the same buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer, and the factor XIII was eluted from the column using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.2 m over 500 ml. The presence of factor XIII in the fractions was assessed by monitoring the fluorescence increase observed upon the factor XIIIa-mediated incorporation of dansyl cadaverine (Sigma) into fibrin clots. A 5-μl aliquot from each fraction was added to the well of a fluorescence microtiter plate containing a separate 5-μl aliquot of 600 nm human thrombin. The reaction was started by the addition of 200 μl of 1.05 mg/ml fibrinogen, 105 μmdansyl cadaverine, 2.1 mm CaCl2 in 0.02m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS). The reactions were monitored every 2 min over 1 h at room temperature in a LS-50B fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Montreal, Canada) using the plate reader accessory. The samples were excited at 360 nm, and the emission was monitored at 546 nm using a 530-nm emission filter. Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm. Fractions containing factor XIII were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against ammonium sulfate at 36% (final) saturation. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and was dissolved in HBS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The remaining fibrinogen was eliminated by repetitively (three times) heating the factor XIII to 56 °C for 10 min, cooling on ice, and then centrifuging at 16,000 × g at 22 °C for 5 min to clarify. No difference in factor XIIIa activity was observed following the heating/cooling/centrifugation cycles. The purified factor XIII was dialyzed against HBS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, passed through a 0.22-μm syringe filter, and stored at −70 °C in small aliquots. Sheep anti-human factor XIII-Sepharose was prepared according to a modified procedure of Cuatrecasas (35Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3059-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 ml of Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Canada) was washed with 250 ml of 2 m Na2CO3 under light vacuum in a 25-ml sintered glass funnel. The resin was then activated by the addition of 3 ml of 1 g/ml CNBr in acetonitrile, and the slurry was stirred for 2 min. The CNBr/acetonitrile was evacuated, and the resin was washed with 250 ml of 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, and taken to near dryness under vacuum. The resin cake was then added to 10 ml of 20 mg/ml sheep anti-human factor XIII total IgG (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, Canada) in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5m NaCl, pH 8.3, and the slurry was incubated overnight at room temperature with gentle rocking on an orbital shaker. The resin was stacked in a column and washed with 50 ml of 0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, and the coupling efficiency, determined from the absorbance of the wash, was found to be 96%. The column was washed with 100 ml of 0.5 m Tris, 1.0m NaCl, pH 8.0, to block any remaining reactive sites and then prepared for use by washing with 40 ml of Gentle Elution Buffer (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Canada) followed by 100 ml of HBS. The column was stored in HBS, 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C. Human fibrinogen was purified according to a modified procedure of Straughn and Wagner (36Straughn W. Wagner R.H. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1966; 16: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 80 ml of 1.0 m BaCl2was added with stirring to 1 liter of citrated, fresh frozen plasma over 5 min at 22 °C. The solution was stirred at 22 °C for 30 min and was then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The supernatant was made 1 mm in diisopropylfluorophosphate and allowed to stand 10 min at 22 °C. 4.0m β-alanine, made up in 0.05 m trisodium citrate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5, was added to a final concentration of 1.0 m. After 30 min at 22 °C, the solution was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The supernatant was then made up to 2.0 m in β-alanine, stirred for 30 min at 22 °C, and then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The pellet was dissolved in the original plasma volume of 0.05 m trisodium citrate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5. The solution was made 2.0m in β-alanine and centrifuged as before. The pellet was dissolved in ∼ 18 starting plasma volume of 0.05 mtrisodium citrate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5. This was made 2% in PEG-8000 by the addition of 40% (w/v) PEG-8000 in water. The solution sat for 15 min at 22 °C and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was made 5% in PEG-8000 and sat 15 min at 22 °C before centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 0.02 m HEPES, 1.0 mNaCl, pH 7.4, by rapid agitation on an orbital shaker table at 22 °C. This was then dialyzed against 3 × 4.0 liters of 0.02m HEPES, 0.025 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 22 °C. The solution was passed over a 5-ml lysine-Sepharose column followed by a 10-ml anti-factor XIII-Sepharose column and finally loaded onto a 100-ml DEAE-cellulose column, all at 22 °C. All columns were pre-equilibrated in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.025 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and were linked in tandem. The columns were washed with 50 ml of 0.02 m HEPES, 0.025 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and the DEAE-cellulose column was disconnected and was washed with a further 300 ml of equilibration buffer. Fibrinogen was eluted from the column with 0.02 m HEPES, 0.10 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and further fractionated to yield high molecular weight fibrinogen (containing intact α-chains) by precipitation with 19% ammonium sulfate as described previously (37Holm B. Nilsen D.W.T. Kierulf P. Godal H.C. Thromb. Res. 1985; 37: 165-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purified fibrinogen was dialyzed extensively against HBS, passed through a 5-μm syringe filter, and stored at −70 °C at 5–10 mg/ml. A perfused clot system was used to produce fibrin degradation products (FDPs) for further analysis. The clot was formed in a disposable column (Econo-Pac, Bio-Rad) filled with the polyethylene disks supplied with the column as a solid support. The column was filled to the 10-ml mark, which yielded a 4.5-ml available volume for the clot. The column was washed extensively with degassed, 0.2-μm-filtered HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80 prior to use. The clots were constructed as follows: an 8.0-ml solution containing 2.0 mg/ml fibrinogen, 2.0 mmCaCl2, 0.01% (w/v) Tween 80 in HBS was prepared in a 10-ml syringe, capped at the bottom. The solution was made 13 nmin plasmin, and the clotting was initiated by the addition of 92 μl of 0.8 mg/ml factor XIIIa, 130 nm thrombin (90 μl of 0.8 mg/ml factor XIII was activated to factor XIIIa by the addition of 2 μl of 6 μm thrombin followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min). The solution was rapidly mixed and then passed through a prewetted 0.45-μm syringe filter, filling the column (prefilled with degassed, 0.2 μm filtered HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80) from the bottom using a four-way stopcock. The excess solution was removed from the top of the column, and the solution was allowed to clot and lyse minimally for 90 min at room temperature (22 °C). The clotting time under these conditions is ∼75 s. This procedure allowed for full polymerization of the fibrin, complete cross-linking of the γ-chains, negligible cross-linking of the α-chains, removal of the αC regions, and negligible solubilization of the clot. The inclusion of plasmin in the clot was necessary to enable subsequent perfusion of fluid through the clot; clots formed in the absence of plasmin resist flow, resulting in channeling of the perfusate around the sides and not through the clot proper. Ten minutes after filling the column, the bottom of the column (under the bottom disk) was cleared of clotted fibrin by mechanical agitation and flushing with degassed, 0.2-μm-filtered HBS, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80 using a syringe fitted with a pipette tip. Following the 90-min incubation, the plasmin and factor XIIIa were inhibited by perfusing 60 ml of 1 μm valyl-phenylalanyl-lysyl chloromethylketone (VFKck; Calbiochem), 100 μm iodoacetamide in degassed, 0.2-μm-filtered HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.001% Tween 80 at 0.5 ml/min. The inhibitors were then washed from the clot with 60 ml of degassed, 0.2-μm-filtered HBS, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.001% Tween 80 at 0.5 ml/min. Following the wash, lysis was resumed by the perfusion of 0.05 nm plasmin in degassed, 0.2-μm-filtered HBS, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.001% Tween 80 through the clot at 0.475 ml/min. During the wash and subsequent lysis, the eluate was mixed with 30 μm VFKck in degassed, 0.2-μm-filtered 0.1 mm HCl at the exit from the clot at 0.025 ml/min and then passed through a 0.45-μm filter. The column, VFKck, and 0.45-μm filter were connected by a four-way stopcock. The eluate was analyzed in tandem for absorbance at 280 nm and multiangle laser light scattering. Eluate fractions (10 ml) were collected. All steps were performed at 22 °C. The inhibition of the initial plasmin followed by perfusion of 0.05 nm plasmin through the clot provided a simple system to produce large quantities of minimally degraded FDPs for further study. This system avoided the complexities that may be inherent in using a fibrin-dependent reaction to generate plasmin (eg. tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen) when the fibrin is undergoing degradation. Protein-containing fractions from the perfusion experiment were pooled, adjusted to 0.5m NaCl, concentrated by ultrafiltration at 22 °C under N2 to ∼10 ml in a stirred cell using a YM-100 membrane (Amicon, Oakville, Canada), passed through a 5-μm syringe filter, and then finally concentrated at 37 °C to ∼750 μl by centrifugal concentration (Ultrafree-15; Amicon). The concentrated sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 22 °C, degassed briefly (∼2 min) under vacuum in a Speed Vac®Plus (Savant, Farmingdale, NY), and then loaded into a 500-μl sample loop. The sample was injected onto a 110 × 1.5-cm Sephacryl S-1000 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in degassed, 0.2-μm-"
https://openalex.org/W2067332853,"The large subunit (LSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) in the illuminated lysates of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chloroplasts is broken down by reactive oxygen radicals into 37- and 16-kDa polypeptides. Analysis of the terminal amino acid residues of both fragments revealed that the C terminus of the 37-kDa fragment was Ser-328 and the N terminus of the 16-kDa fragment was Thr-330. Gly-329, which links the two fragments, was missing, suggesting that the fragmentation of the LSU in the lysates driven by oxygen-free radicals occurs at Gly-329. Purified rubisco, exposed to a hydroxyl radical-generating system, was also cleaved at the same site of the LSU. The cleavage site was positioned at the N-terminal end of the flexible loop (loop 6) within the β/α-barrel domain, constituting the catalytic site of rubisco. The binding of a reaction intermediate analogue, 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, to the active form of rubisco completely protected the enzyme from the fragmentation. The fragmentation was differentially affected by CO2, Mg2+, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, or 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. All these results indicate that the conformation of the catalytic site of the enzyme is involved as an important factor determining the breakdown of rubisco by reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species generated at its catalytic site by a Fenton-type reaction may trigger the site-specific degradation of the LSU in the lysates of chloroplasts in the light.

The cleavage site was positioned at the N-terminal end of the flexible loop (loop 6) within the β/α-barrel domain, constituting the catalytic site of rubisco. The binding of a reaction intermediate analogue, 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, to the active form of rubisco completely protected the enzyme from the fragmentation. The fragmentation was differentially affected by CO2, Mg2+, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, or 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. All these results indicate that the conformation of the catalytic site of the enzyme is involved as an important factor determining the breakdown of rubisco by reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species generated at its catalytic site by a Fenton-type reaction may trigger the site-specific degradation of the LSU in the lysates of chloroplasts in the light.

This enzyme is the most abundant protein, which accounts for 30–35% of total leaf protein in C3 plants, and the amount of rubisco can be a limiting factor for light-saturated photosynthesis in air (1Makino A.

In illuminated chloroplasts, in which light energy is harvested and converted to chemical energy, production of reactive oxygen species occurs as an unavoidable event, particularly under light or oxidative stress conditions (9Asada K.

Reactive oxygen species are known to inactivate and modify enzymes in diverse biological systems (16Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species could be one means by which rubisco degradation is triggered. For example, Mehtaet al. (5Mehta R.A. Fawcett T.W. Porath D. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2810-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Cu2+-induced oxidative stress caused intermolecular cross-linking of the large subunits of rubisco via disulfide bounds within the holoenzyme, rapid and specific translocation of the soluble enzyme complex to the chloroplast membranes, and finally rubisco degradation. In addition, Desimoneet al. (15Desimone M. Henke A. Wagner E. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Desimone M. Wagner E. Johanningmeier U. Planta. 1998; 205: 459-466Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that light stress induces reactive oxygen-mediated denaturation of rubisco followed by proteolytic degradation of the large subunit (LSU) in chloroplasts (15Desimone M. Henke A. Wagner E. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or its lysates (17Desimone M. Wagner E. Johanningmeier U. Planta. 1998; 205: 459-466Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These reports indicated that oxidative stress induces a modification of rubisco protein, which then leads to its subsequent degradation, perhaps by a protease. On the other hand, we recently found that the LSU of rubisco can be directly fragmented into 37- and 16-kDa polypeptides by reactive oxygen species in chloroplast lysates (18Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and in intact chloroplasts (19Ishida H. Shimizu S. Makino A. Mae T. Planta. 1998; 204: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) under illumination. This fragmentation of rubisco was completely inhibited in the presence of metal chelators (EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline), catalase, or hydroxyl radical scavenger (n-propyl gallate), but not in the presence of protease inhibitors. A similar fragmentation was also observed for the purified rubisco exposed to a hydroxyl radical-generating system. We have now identified the cleavage site where LSU of rubisco in the chloroplast lysates in the light and LSU of purified rubisco exposed to hydroxyl radicals are fragmented. In addition, we found that effectors potentially bound to its active site, such as CO2, Mg2+, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), and 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CABP), affect to different extents the susceptibility of the enzyme to fragmentation mediated by hydroxyl radicals. Of particular significance is the finding that CABP, a reaction intermediate analogue of the carboxylation reaction of the enzyme, which is known to tightly bind to the catalytic site of the activated form of rubisco (20Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 270-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Miziorko H.M. Sealy R.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), fully protected the enzyme from the fragmentation. We suggest that one mechanism of the site-specific fragmentation of rubisco in the illuminated lysates of chloroplasts may involve the generation of reactive oxygen species, probably hydroxyl radicals, at its catalytic site by a Fenton-type reaction. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Aoba) seeds were planted on a plastic net floating on tap water in a pot and grown in a phytotron with a day/night temperature of 20/18 °C and 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h, with a quantum flux density of 300 μmol of quanta·m−2·s−1 at plant height. Chloroplasts were isolated from the primary leaves of 12-day-old seedlings by a mechanical method using continuous Percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (18Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Rubisco was purified from wheat leaves as described previously (18Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The enzyme·CO2·Mg2+·CABP complex was produced as follows. The purified enzyme (5 mg/ml) was pretreated at 37 °C for 1 h and then activated with 10 mm NaHCO3 and 20 mmMgCl2 at 25 °C for 20 min in 50 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). A 2-fold excess (with respect to active sites) of CABP (a gift from Dr. Tadaaki Yamashita) was added and allowed to stand for 20 min. After the reaction, the enzyme·CO2·Mg2+·CABP complex was separated from unbound CABP by gel filtration through a column of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-PAGE was performed by the methods of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), except that SDS sample buffer was changed to 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol at final concentrations. Native PAGE was performed (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) with a 5% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel in which SDS was omitted. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out by the method of O'Farrell (23O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 2% (v/v) Ampholine (pH range, 3.5–10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in isoelectric focusing. Immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (18Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The chloroplast lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the light at 2000 μmol of quanta·m−2·s−1 in 50 mm2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid-NaOH, pH 5.7, containing 1 mm DTT and 10 μm E-64. After incubation, the lysates were centrifuged at 39,800 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction was subjected to 33–55% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, and passed through a column of Econo-Pac 10DG (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluted protein fractions were applied to an ion exchange column of RESOURCE Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with the same buffer using the FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were eluted with 40 ml of the same buffer containing a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing rubisco and its fragments were loaded onto a gel filtration column of Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the FPLC system. The 37- and 16-kDa fragments co-eluted with intact rubisco throughout the purification steps. For the isolation of 16-kDa fragment, the final fractions containing rubisco and its fragments were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the separated fragment was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For the isolation of the relatively large quantity of 37-kDa fragment, the eluted proteins from the gel filtration column were reduced in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 8 m urea and 40 mm DTT at 37 °C for 2 h under N2. Then, the proteins were incubated with 0.6% (w/v) 4-vinylpyridine for 30 min. The pyridylethylated proteins were applied to a preparative SDS-PAGE system (Mini Prep Cell; Bio-Rad). The acrylamide concentration in the separation gel was 11% (w/v), and the procedure was followed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted fraction of the 37-kDa fragment was precipitated and washed with acetone to remove SDS. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 8 m urea and loaded onto a reversed phase column (ProRPC; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using HPLC (LC-10Ai series; Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan). The 37-kDa fragment was eluted with a 120-min linear gradient of 5–80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Purified rubisco (1 mg/ml) was exposed to the hydroxyl radical-generating system comprising 1 mm H2O2, 10 μmFeSO4, and 20 mm ascorbic acid at 4 °C for 15 min in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mm DTT. The mixture was passed through a column of Econo-Pac 10DG previously equilibrated with 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmDTT. The 16-kDa fragment was isolated from this fraction by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described above. The 37-kDa fragment was also isolated by the same procedure using the preparative SDS-PAGE system and reversed phase HPLC as described above. The 37-kDa fragment (∼20 μg) was digested with 0.4 μg of lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 2m urea at 37 °C for 15 h. The peptides were separated by HPLC using a reversed phase column of μRPC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the column was washed with 10% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were eluted with a 100-min linear gradient of 10–25% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using a protein sequencer (model 491; Applied Biosystems) equipped with an on-line analyzer of the phenylthiohydantoin derivative of the amino acids. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a triple-quadruple mass spectrometer (API 365; Perkin-Elmer Sciex). The chloroplast lysates were incubated in the light, and proteins were electrophoretically separated and then immunoblotted. The N-terminal 37-kDa and C-terminal 16-kDa fragments of the rubisco-LSU were the most dominant degradation products. When a purified preparation of rubisco was exposed to a hydroxyl radical-generating system, the cleavage of the LSU into 37- and 16-kDa fragments was also observed (18Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To identify the cleavage site, we isolated the 37- and 16-kDa fragments of the LSU from the chloroplast lysates incubated in the light and those generated from the purified rubisco after exposure to the hydroxyl radical-generating system. The 37- and 16-kDa fragments always co-purified with the intact rubisco throughout the purification steps, (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography (RESOURCE Q), and gel filtration (Superdex 200) (Fig. 1 A). The purified fraction from gel filtration showed only a single band on native PAGE (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that both fragments co-exist as parts of the holoenzyme form comprising hexaoctamer. Fig. 2 shows the polypeptide profiles on two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified fraction containing the fragments of the LSU isolated from the chloroplast lysates (Fig.2 A) and those from the purified rubisco exposed to the hydroxyl radical-generating system (Fig. 2 B). The mobilities on the gels and isoelectric points of the 37- and 16-kDa fragments were the same in Fig. 2, A and B. Both the 16-kDa fragments were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and applied to a protein sequencer. The N-terminal sequences of the 16-kDa fragment generated in the chloroplast lysates and from the purified rubisco were TVVGKLEGEREMTLG andXVVXKLEGEXXMTLG, respectively. These sequences correspond to the deduced residues 330–344 in wheat LSU (24Terachi T. Ogihara Y. Tsunewaki K. Jpn. J. Genet. 1987; 62: 375-387Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the 37-kDa fragment electroblotted onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was applied to a protein sequencer, no phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids were released after three cycles of Edman degradative sequencing. This was expected because the N-terminal proline residue of wheat LSU is acetylated (25Houtz R.L. Stults J.T. Mulligan R.M. Tolbert N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore digested intact LSU and the 37-kDa fragments from the chloroplast lysates in the light and the purified rubisco exposed to a hydroxyl radical-generating system, with lysylendopeptidase, and the released peptides were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C). The elution profiles of the peptides were quite similar in Fig. 3 A–C, except that peptide 1 found in Fig.3 A was missing in Fig. 3, B and C, whereas peptide 2 or peptide 3 was found in Fig. 3, B orC, respectively. Peptides 2 and 3 eluted at the same retention time. The sequence of peptide 1 from intact LSU was ALRMSGGDHIHSGTVVGK. This corresponds to deduced residues 317–334 in wheat LSU. The sequences of peptide 2, from the 37-kDa fragment of the chloroplast lysates, and peptide 3, from the 37-kDa fragment of the purified rubisco exposed to hydroxyl radicals, were the same, ALRMSGGDHIHS, which correspond to residues 317–328 in wheat LSU. Because lysylendopeptidase cleaves the peptide bonds at the carboxylic side of lysine, and the C-terminal amino acid of peptides 2 and 3 is not lysine, both peptides are derived from the C-terminal region of the 37-kDa fragments. From electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis, masses of 1278.9 and 1295.0 were obtained for peptide 2. Because the theoretical mass of ALRMSGGDHIHS is 1279.6, these results indicated that peptide 2 was terminated at Ser-328 and did not contain the Gly-329 residue. From these results, we concluded that the LSU is cleaved at Gly-329 or at both ends of this residue into the 37- and 16-kDa fragments.Figure 3Elution profiles of the peptides after lysylendopeptidase digestion of the intact LSU, the 37-kDa fragment of the LSU from the chloroplast lysates, and the 37-kDa fragment from the purified rubisco exposed to the hydroxyl radical-generating system by reversed phase HPLC. A, intact LSU of rubisco; B, the 37-kDa fragment of the LSU purified from the lysates of chloroplasts that were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min in the light at 2000 μmol of quanta·m−2·s−1;C, the 37-kDa fragment produced by the exposure of purified rubisco to the hydroxyl radical-generating system comprising 1 mm H2O2, 10 μmFeSO4, and 20 mm ascorbic acid. Each sample was digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the products were separated on a C18 reversed phase column (μRPC). After the column was washed with 10% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 10–25% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cleavage site of the LSU, Gly-329, is one of the residues that constitutes the catalytic site of the enzyme (26Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is known that CABP, a reaction intermediate analogue of the enzyme carboxylation reaction, tightly binds to the active form (ternary complex of enzyme·CO2·Mg2+) of rubisco and masks the metal and the substrate binding sites (20Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 270-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Miziorko H.M. Sealy R.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to examine the effect of the binding of CABP on the fragmentation. The enzyme·CO2·Mg2+·CABP complex (active form·CABP complex) added to the thylakoid fraction was not fragmented even in the light, although the LSU of the purified rubisco (inactive form) added to the thylakoid fraction was fragmented in the light (Fig. 4). These results clearly indicated that the binding of CABP to the active form of rubisco protected the enzyme from the fragmentation. Purified rubisco was preincubated with various combinations of CO2, Mg2+, RuBP, and CABP. Then the mixtures were exposed to the hydroxyl radical-generating system. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The fragmentation of the rubisco LSU was most pronounced when the enzyme was incubated alone (Fig. 5, lane 2). Preincubation of the enzyme with CO2 (Fig. 5, lane 5) or Mg2+ (Fig. 5, lane 9) did not cause significant influence on the fragmentation. When the enzyme was, however, incubated with CO2 and Mg2+ together, and once the ternary complex (enzyme·CO2·Mg2+, active form) was formed, the fragmentation was significantly suppressed (Fig. 5, lane 6). The enzyme complex with RuBP (enzyme·RuBP) or CABP (enzyme·CABP) was degraded less than the enzyme alone but more than the enzyme·CO2·Mg2+ complex (Fig. 5,lane 4or 3). The complex of the active form with CABP (enzyme·CO2·Mg2+·CABP) was not fragmented at all (Fig. 5, lane 7), as in the case of the complex of activated rubisco with the illuminated thylakoid (Fig. 4). The active form complexed with RuBP (enzyme·CO2·Mg2+·RuBP) was resistant to fragmentation, as was the complex of the active form incubated with CABP (Fig. 5, lane 8). In the present study we determined the specific cleavage site of the LSU fragmented in the lysates of chloroplasts incubated in the light. The C-terminal amino acid residue of the 37-kDa fragment was Ser-328, and the N-terminal amino acid residue of the 16-kDa fragment was Thr-330, whereas the residue Gly-329 between them was missing. The same terminal amino acids were determined for the LSU fragments derived from the purified rubisco exposed to the hydroxyl radical-generating system. These results confirm our previous finding that rubisco is directly degraded into the N-terminal side fragment of 37 kDa and the C-terminal side fragment of 16 kDa by reactive oxygen species, probably hydroxyl radicals, in the lysates of chloroplasts (18Ishida H. Nishimori Y. Sugisawa M. Makino A. Mae T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Jakob and Huber (10Jakob B. Heber U. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 629-635Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that hydroxyl radicals are produced in illuminated thylakoids as a consequence of O2 reduction. They also indicated that the light-dependent hydroxyl radical formation might be brought about by a Fenton-type reaction. Unfortunately, the mechanism of protein fragmentation by the metal-catalyzed oxidation system is poorly understood. One of the proposed mechanisms is the cleavage of the peptide bond by either the diamide pathway or α-amidation pathway (16Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). After cleavage by either pathway, the derived peptide fragments should have blocked N termini, which are resistant to Edman degradation. However, in the present study, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 16-kDa fragment of the LSU could be identified by the standard sequencing procedure of the Edman degradation. There are some reports that the cleavage of polypeptide by reactive oxygen species produces fragments with free N termini (27Rana T.M. Meares C.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 2457-2458Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Barlow J.N. Zhang Z. John P. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as found in the present study. However, it could not be explained why the Gly-329 was missing. It is not likely that the residue Gly-329 was removed by proteases in the lysates from the terminal end of the 37- or 16-kDa fragment after the cleavage of the LSU by reactive oxygen species, because Gly-329 was also missing in the fragments derived from the purified rubisco exposed to the hydroxyl radicals. Another, as yet unknown, mechanism of protein fragmentation by reactive oxygen species needs to be considered. Rubisco from higher plants is a hexadecamer of eight LSUs and eight small subunits. The fragmentation of rubisco was specific to the LSU; no fragmented product was found for the small subunits (data not shown). In addition, the cleavage of the LSU was observed at a specific site. As reviewed by Stadtman and Oliver (29Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins is a site-specific process involving the interaction of oxygen or hydrogen peroxide and a redox-active metal at metal-binding sites on the protein. Rubisco requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for the formation of a ternary complex of the enzyme·CO2·Mg2+(Mn2+), which is an active form of the enzyme. All the active sites of rubisco are on the LSU. Fe2+ is potentially able to bind to the metal binding site of the LSU, because Fe2+ can activate rubisco instead of Mg2+ (30Christeller J.T. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts are especially rich in iron and contain ∼80% of the total iron of mesophyll cells (31Terry N. Low G. J. Plant Nutr. 1982; 5: 301-310Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rubisco possesses oxygenase activity, and the binding site of O2 is the same as that of CO2. Moreover, H2O2 competitively interacts with the binding site for O2 and CO2 (32Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Canvin D.T. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7870-7875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that, under our experimental conditions, namely certain light- or oxygen-stressed conditions, the production of hydroxyl radicals via a Fenton-type reaction occurs at the catalytic site of rubisco, which brings about the fragmentation of the LSU. The fragmentation of the LSU was completely protected by CABP binding to the catalytic sites of the enzyme (Figs. 4 and 5). The enzyme·CO2·Mg2+·CABP complex is so stable that neither activator CO2 nor Mg2+ can be readily replaced by unbound ligand (20Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 270-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Miziorko H.M. Sealy R.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, Fe2+ or H2O2 (O2) is unable to bind to their site at the active site, and the production of hydroxyl radical is prevented. As a consequence of this, under these conditions, LSU fragmentation does not occur even in the light. These results further support the above hypothesis. No cleavage of the LSU was observed in the presence of 0.1% SDS even when the enzyme was exposed to the hydroxyl radical-generating system (data not shown). In the presence of SDS, rubisco disrupts into subunits and loses the enzyme activity (33Sugiyama T. Akazawa T. J. Biochem. 1967; 62: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results strongly indicate that a correctly folded structure of the enzyme is required for the fragmentation of rubisco by reactive oxygen species. This is largely different from rubisco degradation mediated by a protease (34Bhalla P.L. Dalling M.J. J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 122: 289-302Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar,35Yokota S. Mae T. Makino A. Ojima K. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1990; 36: 91-96Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), because proteolytic degradation is often stimulated by SDS. The LSU consists of two separate domains, a smaller N-terminal domain and a larger C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is built from a five-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices on one side of the sheet, and the C-terminal domain is from an eight-stranded parallel β/α-barrel, which has a flexible loop (loop 6), as commonly observed among β/α-barrel proteins. The catalytic site of rubisco is located at the interface between the C-terminal domain of one LSU and the N-terminal domain of the other LSU. The cleavage site of the LSU was between Ser-328 and Thr-330, possibly at Gly-329. This is located at the N-terminal end of loop 6 within the β/α-barrel domain and composes one of the phosphate binding sites of RuBP (26Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The residue Gly-329 is highly conserved in plant species (36Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It is known that hydroxyl radicals are produced close to the site where the metal is bound, and that they can only attack atoms or chemical bonds located within a limited distance from their site of production. However, Gly-329 is likely not to be the closest amino acid residue to the O2 binding site (37Taylor T.C. Andersson I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4041-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, Asp-203 and Glu-204, constituting the metal binding site, or Gly-403 and Gly-404 are much closer to the O2 binding site than Gly-329, respectively. Therefore, preferential attack of Gly-329 or both of its sides by reactive oxygen species could not be simply attributed to one specific reason. Other factors, such as a primary structure (kinds and properties) of amino acid residues juxtaposed to the Gly-329 or the flexibility of loop 6, may come into play. The site-specific cleavage of the LSU strongly depends on the structural and conformational status of the catalytic site. Dissociation of the enzyme into its subunits did not cause any fragmentation. Binding of the activators (CO2 and Mg2+), substrate (RuBP), and intermediate analogue (CABP) to their binding sites within catalytic site changed the susceptibility of the enzyme to fragmentation. This is perhaps attributable to the structural and conformational status of the catalytic site induced by the effectors. The conformational nature of rubisco seems to be very important in vivo, because under high light conditions rubisco is in the active form, and the level of RuBP in chloroplasts is maintained at a higher level (38Perchorowicz J.T. Raynes D.A. Jensen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2985-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such conditions would make rubisco more resistant to photo-oxidative stress. Recently, Desimone et al. (17Desimone M. Wagner E. Johanningmeier U. Planta. 1998; 205: 459-466Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that reactive oxygen species first modify rubisco, which then makes it susceptible to proteolysis. Although they did not show how rubisco is modified by reactive oxygen species, they demonstrated that once rubisco is exposed to reactive oxygen species, it is fragmented by a protease(s) in a stromal fraction in an ATP-dependent manner (17Desimone M. Wagner E. Johanningmeier U. Planta. 1998; 205: 459-466Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that there are at least two triggering reactions driven by reactive oxygen species for the fragmentation of the LSU of rubisco in the lysates of chloroplasts: direct fragmentation shown here and modification followed by protease-dependent degradation reported by other authors. We thank Dr. Autar K. Mattoo for critical reading of the manuscript and Drs. Martin Parry and Tomohisa Ogawa for helping with computer analysis of the ternary structure of rubisco."
https://openalex.org/W2320140627,"The cdc25A phosphatase removes inhibitory phosphates from threonine-14 and tyrosine-15 of cyclin dependent kinase-2 (cdk2) in vitro, and it is therefore widely assumed that cdc25A positively regulates cyclin E- and A-associated cdk2 activity at the G1 to S phase transition of the mammalian cell division cycle. Human cdc25A was introduced into mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts co-expressing a form of the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor that is partially defective in transducing mitogenic signals. Cdc25A enabled these cells to form colonies in semisolid medium containing serum plus human recombinant CSF-1 in a manner reminiscent of cells rescued by c-myc. However, cdc25A-rescued cells could not proliferate in chemically defined medium containing CSF-1 and continued to require c-myc function for S phase entry. When contact-inhibited cells overexpressing cdc25A were dispersed and stimulated to synchronously enter the cell division cycle, they entered S phase 2 – 3 h earlier than their parental untransfected counterparts. Shortening of G1 phase temporally correlated with more rapid degradation of the cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and with premature activation of cyclin A-dependent cdk2. Paradoxically, tyrosine phosphorylation of cdk2 increased considerably as cells entered S phase, and cdc25A overexpression potentiated rather than diminished this effect. At face value, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cdc25A acts directly on cdk2 to activate its S phase promoting function."

To cope with a variety of adverse environmental influences, including temperature extremes, toxins, nutritional deprivation, and oxidative damage, cells from bacteria to mammals have developed common molecular responses, including alterations in gene expression that up-regulate heat shock or stress response proteins. These stress response proteins can act as molecular chaperones by binding to denatured or misfolded proteins, by regulating the correct folding of proteins, by dissociating protein aggregates, or by facilitating the transfer of proteins to specific cellular locations (for review, see Refs. 1Leppa S.

The cell line, named LY-as, was derived from a syngeneic mouse B cell lymphoma designated LY-TH (12Drewinko B. Jurin M. Howes T.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 140: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This cell line proved to be very susceptible to apoptotic cell death induced by ionizing radiation (13Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar) or chemotherapeutic drugs when maintainedin vitro. 2M. D. Story and R. E. Meyn, submitted for publication. However, during in vitro culture this cell line reproducibly loses its high susceptibility to apoptosis and becomes much more resistant to the cytotoxic agents mentioned (13Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar).2 This resistant cell type was designated LY-ar (13Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar). The gain in resistance is associated with an up-regulation of Bcl-2 oncoprotein and doubling of the cellular content of reduced glutathione (15Mirkovic N. Voehringer D.W. Story M.D. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Modulation of glutathione levels by cysteine deprivation or by treatment with diamide or diethyl maleate, agents that deplete cellular thiols, after radiation results in a restoration of radiosensitivity and apoptosis induction characteristic of the parental LY-as cell line (15Mirkovic N.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).2 The Bcl-2 protein level does not change as a result of cysteine deprivation (15Mirkovic N. Voehringer D.W. Story M.D. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), but it has been suggested that it is nuclear GSH levels that are critical in determining the extent of apoptosis and that nuclear membrane-associated Bcl-2 is responsible for maintenance of those levels (16Voehringer D.W.

To determine how the cellular phenotype changes from sensitive to resistant, we examined differences in the level of gene expression between the two cell lines by using the differential display technique. Apart from the expression differences of several known genes, 3R. Kodym and M. D. Story, submitted for publication. we also found a cDNA fragment exclusively expressed in the resistant cell line LY-ar that showed no homology to mRNAs of known mammalian proteins. Here we describe the cloning of the full-length cDNA of which this fragment is a part. The cDNA codes for a novel protein with a calculated molecular mass of 28 kDa. This protein shows homologies to small stress proteins and GSTs, which all belong to a large ancient protein superfamily of proteins that are related by their sequence and tertiary structure to class θ GSTs (18Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This superfamily, which includes GSTs, small stress proteins, the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1γ, bacterial dehalogenases, and etherases, as well as several uncharacterized proteins, is characterized by two conserved domains, a glutathione binding domain and a second domain of unknown function. The sequence homology of p28 to the conserved domains and the similar functional characteristics of p28 to other family members, in particular relocalization in response to thermal stress and ability to bind glutathione, argue for the inclusion of p28 as a new mammalian member of this superfamily. LY-as and LY-ar cells were passaged in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For thermal stress the cells, in tissue culture flasks, were submerged in a water bath (Haake DC1) at the appropriate temperature (±0.1 °C) for 1 h. Small scale RNA isolations for the differential display were performed using RNAzol B (TEL-TEST Inc.), which is a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A)Tract System III (Promega) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. Differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the cloning of the differentially expressed fragments, and the sequencing of these fragments was done as described previously.3 The full-length cDNA was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from LY-ar cells. The cDNA was ligated to adapters, and RACE PCR was performed with the gene-specific primer GGGGAAATCACAGTTTTCAGACATG and the adapter primer AP1 using the enzyme mix and the buffers of the Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). The cycling conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The major amplification product was recovered from the gel and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector and transfected into competent Eschericia coli from the TA-Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). After colony selection, sequencing was performed with a cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using33P-labeled primer according to the protocol given by the manufacturer. Tissue-specific expression levels of p28 mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis using a commercially available mouse multiple tissue Northern blot membrane (CLONTECH). The 32P-labeled probe was generated from the coding sequence of the cDNA using PCR as described previously.3 Hybridization and washes were performed exactly as proposed by the membrane manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The largest cDNA product produced by RACE PCR and subsequently subcloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid as described above was cut from pCR2.1 with EspI andEcoRV and then subcloned in frame into the EcoRV site of the pET32(+) vector (Novagen). The expression vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and protein expression was induced by incubating the cells with 1 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The vector coded for a fusion protein consisting of a thioredoxin tag, a 6xHis site, and an enterokinase cleavage site fused to the N terminus of p28. This fusion protein was purified using a His-Bind Ni2+ affinity column (Novagen). Antiserum was raised against the purified fusion protein in rabbits using standard immunization protocols. p28 was localized according to the protocol of Dyer and Herzog (20Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that dithiothreitol was not included, by producing subcellular fractions of LY-ar cells. A nuclear fraction was produced by lysis of the cells in isotonic buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g to pellet the nuclei. A mitochondria-rich fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and then the microsomal fraction was separated from the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) by a 2-h centrifugation at 100,000 ×g. To determine the localization of p28 after heat treatment, the cells were heated to the appropriate temperature for 1 h, immediately washed once in cold PBS, and then lysed for 3 min on ice in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The particulate and detergent-soluble fractions were separated by a 5-min centrifugation step at 16,000 × g. Further discrimination of the localization of p28 was carried out as in the work of Dyer and Herzog (20Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar) on cells heated or not to 44 °C for 1 h before lysis and separation into nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. Proteins were separated on a 12% acrylamide gel using the Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) buffer system and then electrotransfered to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the membrane was blocked with BLOTTO, it was incubated for 1 h in antiserum diluted 1:200 with BLOTTO. After three 15-min washes in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), the membrane was incubated for 1 h in a 1:1500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in BLOTTO. After three final 15-min washes in TBST, the blot was developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For GSH affinity precipitation, proteins from 5 × 106 LY-as and LY-ar cells were radiolabeled with 50 μCi [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) over 3 h. The cells were lysed in the same lysis buffer used as above for p28 localization after thermal stress. A 50-μl volume of lysate representing cytoplasmic proteins and containing ∼1.5 × 106 cpm was diluted with 450 μl of PBS and mixed with 30 μl of amino-linked GSH-Sepharose (Sigma G-9761). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the GSH-Sepharose was washed three times for 15 min in PBS at 4 °C. The bound proteins were solubilized and released from the GSH-Sepharose matrix by boiling the GSH-Sepharose in SDS gel loading buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and detected by autoradiography. p28 was identified on the same membrane by chemiluminescence as described above. GST activities were determined by monitoring the production of thioethers, as 1-chloro-2,4-nitrobenzene, trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, ethacrynic acid, and androstene-3,17-dione were conjugated with GSH, by UV absorbance spectrophotometry (22Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined with the substrate cumene hydroperoxide in a coupled enzymatic reaction with GSH-reductase and NADPH again by spectrophotometry as described previously (23Bompart G.J. Perevot D.S. Bascands J.L. Clin. Biochem. 1990; 23: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After using the random primer TCGATACAGG and the anchored primer T12VG for PCR and subsequent reverse transcription of LY-as and LY-ar mRNA, differential display resolved two bands with sizes of 135 and 128 bp that appeared only in the gel lane containing the LY-ar cDNA sample (Fig.1 A). Sequencing revealed that both fragments were similar to one another and only differed slightly in their polyadenylation site (Fig. 1 B). A data base search did not show any homology of these fragments to mRNAs coding for known proteins. Because these cDNA fragments are necessarily 3′ because of the anchored primer used, 5′ RACE PCR was used to obtain the upstream cDNA sequence. The position of the gene-specific primer used to amplify the cDNA is shown in Fig. 1 B. The 5′ RACE yielded a single product of ∼1.1 kb, which was homogeneous as judged directly from the cycle sequencing of this PCR product. Northern analysis of mRNA expression using the cDNA as probe against RNA from both cell lines confirmed that p28 RNA was expressed exclusively in LY-ar cells (Fig. 1 C). The full-length cDNA sequence is given in Fig. 2. The size of the cDNA, 1159 bp, was in good agreement with the size of the hybridization signal seen in the Northern blot, 1.3 kb. The position of the start codon was verified by an in-frame stop codon upstream at position 11.Figure 2Sequence of the full-length p28 cDNA. This sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number U80819. The position of the start codon (base 100) is verified by an upstream in-frame stop codon (underlined, base 11). Apart from the major polyadenylation site given in this sequence, a minor site was identified at base 891. The major site is preceded by a polyadenylation signal from bases 1129 to 1134 (underlined), which is an imperfect match to the consensus sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig.3 shows the expression levels of p28 mRNA in various mouse tissues as determined by Northern blot analysis. The highest levels of p28 mRNA were found in liver, lung, and heart tissues. Kidney, skeletal muscle, spleen, and brain showed low levels of p28 transcript, whereas it was almost undetectable in testicular tissue. In most of the tissues, a major, larger transcript with a size of ∼1.3 kb and a minor, smaller mRNA of ∼1.1 kb were detected. 3′ RACE amplification and sequencing of the smaller cDNA revealed that the size difference was caused by the alternative polyadenylation site located at base 891. The reason for the intermediate size of the transcript in spleen cells was not determined. The full-length cDNA described above contained one long open reading frame coding for a protein of 240 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27.5 kDa. The predicted protein had significant sequence homology to a diverse family of stress response proteins that contain a GST domain (18Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Protein sequence alignments with some important members of this family are shown in Fig. 4. The closest matching sequence, 33% identity and 52% similarity, was from a hypothetical 28.5-kDa protein of unknown function found by genomic sequencing ofCaenorabditis elegans (24Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). p28 also showed 40% identity and 67% similarity with a 92-amino acid-long protein fragment fromAplysia californica named protein 9. Its expression was found to be induced in Aplysia ganglia after depolarization and treatment with serotonin (25Noel F. Koumenis C. Nunez-Regueiro M. Raju U. Byrne J.H. Eskin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4150-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because protein 9 is a fragment, the statistical power of the seemingly greater sequence identity and similarity seen is low, which is why the C. elegans protein was considered a closer match to p28. p28 also showed significant homologies to a large number of plant proteins that have an either proven or suspected GST function and are induced as part of the plant stress response. Of these, the alignments for the GST GTX1, also called pathogenesis-related protein 1 (26Taylor J.L. Fritzemeier K.H. Hauser I. Kombrink E. Rohwer F. Schroder M. Strittmatter G. Hahlbrock K. Mol.

Further homologies existed with each domain of the TcAc2 protein (28Schoneck R. Plumas-Marty B. Taibi A. Billaut-Mulot O. Loyens M. Gras-Masse H. Capron A. Ouaissi A. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a Trypanosoma cruzi protein that contains a tandemly repeated domain structure that catalyzes the thiol-disulfide exchange between dihydrotypanothione and glutathione disulfide (29Moutiez M.

Finally, p28 showed a significant, albeit lesser, degree of homology to the sequence of the stringent starvation protein A (30Serizawa H. Fukuda R.

The stringent starvation protein A is considered a bacterial regulatory protein (31Williams M.D. Ouyang T.X. Flickinger M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1029-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that is heavily up-regulated after amino acid deprivation (32Reeh S. Pedersen S. Friesen J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 149: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An antiserum was raised in rabbits using the recombinant fusion protein described under “Experimental Procedures” that consists of an N-terminal thioredoxin linked to amino acids 29–240 of p28. This antiserum recognized a protein in the Western blot with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig. 5 A) that was not recognized by preimmune serum (Fig. 5 B). The difference between calculated and apparent molecular mass is likely not attributable to post-translational modification of the protein, because recombinant p28 expressed in E. coli also showed the apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa when separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5 C). The antiserum also detected high amounts of p28 in mouse fibroblast cell lines. In both NIH 3T3 and low passage mouse embryonal fibroblasts, the protein could be detected at precisely the same apparent molecular mass (data not shown). Because of the sequence homologies of p28 to proteins of the aforementioned GST superfamily, GSH binding by p28 was examined. Radiolabeled cytoplasmic proteins of LY-ar and LY-as cells were affinity precipitated with GSH linked to Sepharose, eluted from the GSH-Sepharose matrix, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A number of protein bands of various molecular masses were apparent in extracts from both LY-ar and LY-as cells, with the exception of a 32-kDa protein that is apparent in only the LY-ar protein preparations (Fig.6 A). The identification of this glutathione-binding protein as p28 was confirmed by its reactivity with p28 antiserum (Fig. 6 B). Using 1-chloro-2,4-nitrobenzene,trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, ethacrynic acid, and androstene-3,17-dione, which are regarded as representative substrates for many types of GSTs (33Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we were unable to demonstrate an enzymatic function for the recombinantly derived protein. Nor could we demonstrate glutathione peroxidase activity against the substrate cumene hydroperoxide. Crude nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and cytoplasmic protein extracts of LY-ar cells were prepared and analyzed for their p28 content (Fig.7 A). The greatest amount of p28 was found in the cytoplasmic fraction. Very small amounts of protein were also detected in the mitochondrial and nuclear fraction; however, because these two fractions likely contained small amounts of contaminating cytoplasmic proteins, the primary subcellular localization of p28 was considered cytoplasmic. It is well established that small heat shock proteins from mammalian cells localize into the nucleus or into the detergent-insoluble fraction of cellular protein preparations after exposure of cells to elevated temperatures (34Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). p28 was a cytoplasmic protein at 37 °C (Figs. 7 and 8). If LY-ar cells were incubated at elevated temperatures, in this case for 60 min, p28 relocalized from the detergent-soluble fraction,e.g. cytosol, into the particulate fraction (Fig.7 B). This effect could be observed at temperatures ranging from 42 to 44 °C. After 60 min at 44 °C, almost all of the p28 signal was found in the particulate fraction. Further fractionation of cellular proteins revealed that p28 relocalization as a result of heat exposure was predominantly to the nucleus (Fig. 8 A). Although hyperthermic treatment leads to a rapid induction of some small heat shock proteins (1Leppa S. Sistonen L. Ann. Med. 1997; 29: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we were unable to observe any heat inducibility of p28 in LY-as cells. The sequence homology of p28 suggests that it belongs to a broad family of proteins evolutionarily related to class θ GSTs (35Pemble S.E. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Proteins belonging to this class have two defined motifs, the first of which contains a glutathione binding domain, whereas the second is thought to be a core structural domain (18Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Amino acids 69–95 of p28 conform to the first motif, which comprises the glutathione binding domain. By way of comparison of the GST domain of p28 with class θ GSTs, analysis of the crystal structure of a GST θ class enzyme fromLucilla cuprina has identified the amino acids within the first motif that interact with glutathione (36Wilce M.C.J. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Amino acids 64–66 in the Lucilla enzyme, the highly conserved glutamate and serine and a less conserved arginine, interact with the γ-glutamyl residue of GSH. The corresponding amino acids in p28 are at positions 85 and 86, which are conserved, and position 87, which is a less-conserved valine. The crystal structure of the Lucillaenzyme also demonstrated that a serine residue at position 9 is responsible for activation of the thiol group of GSH. There are four serine residues in the N-terminal region of p28, at positions 5, 6, 8, and 13, that could fulfill that function. Finally, two other amino acids interact with the cysteinyl residue of GSH in theLucilla enzyme. They are isoleucine and tyrosine at amino acid positions 52 and 113, respectively, and although valine appears to be substituted for isoleucine in p28, no amino acid corresponding to the tyrosine could be identified on the basis of the protein sequence. The same holds true for the two histidines at positions 38 and 50 of the Lucilla enzyme, which were found to interact with the glycine of glutathione. The amino acid residues 162–189 in the p28 sequence conform to the second conserved motif described by Koonin et al. (18Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This domain is not involved in substrate binding, and its function is less clear. A conserved aspartic acid residue (amino acid 173 in p28) is considered important (18Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and this domain may be a key structural element in the conserved core of θ class GSTs. The presence of these conserved domains in p28 justified the assumption that it would bind glutathione and catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to other substrates. We were able to demonstrate that p28 binds to glutathione, but regardless of the substrate used, no enzymatic activity could be associated with the recombinant p28 protein. The substrates used to identify an enzymatic activity for p28 have been shown to be substrates for a number of GST isoenzymes (9Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). However, when compared with more common GSTs, recognition of a specific electrophilic ligand by p28 would be unusual because of the low specificity for electrophilic ligands by more common GSTs (33Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least 100 different chemicals are known to activate GSTs, and many also act as the substrate for the up-regulated GST; so it is conceivable that a substrate for p28 is among them. Another reason for the lack of measurable GST activity could be that the recombinant protein, despite its solubility, is incorrectly folded. We have, however, observed a similar lack of GST activity by p28 using the same substrates against mammalian cells that express p28 as part of their normal growth condition (data not shown). Induction of many of the plant proteins to which p28 shares homology is caused by a wide variety of stresses. Fungal infections induce protein GTX1 in S. tuberosum (26Taylor J.L. Fritzemeier K.H. Hauser I. Kombrink E. Rohwer F. Schroder M. Strittmatter G. Hahlbrock K. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 72-77PubMed Google Scholar), auxins induce GTXA inArabidopsis thaliana (37van der Kop D.A.M. Schuyer M. Scheres B. van der Zaal B.I. Hooykaas P.J.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and heavy metal exposure or heat shock induces heat shock protein 26A in soybean (38Czarnecka E. Edelman L. Schoffl F. Key J.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1984; 3: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that p28 might respond to stress, in this case heat shock. By fractionating cellular proteins based on detergent solubility, we first showed that with thermal stress p28 localized into the detergent-insoluble fraction of cellular protein isolates. When examined in more detail, p28 was shown to be localized in the nuclear fraction as a result of heat shock, an association that is a well known feature of small heat shock proteins (34Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For example, the constitutively expressed protein hsp27 relocalizes from a detergent-insoluble fraction to a soluble cytoplasmic fraction after stress (39Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Guillet D. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Mehlen P. Arrigo A.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas hsp70 relocalizes to the nucleoli when cells are stressed (41Velazquez J.M. Lindquist S. Cell. 1984; 36: 655-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the p28 localization, the inducibility of p28 after thermal stress was examined, but no increase in p28 levels were apparent in LY-ar cells (perhaps p28 is already expressed maximally) or in LY-as cells, in which p28 expression could not be measured. p28 contains a glutathione binding domain and is translocated after thermal stress. p28 mRNA was up-regulated in mouse tissues associated with higher oxygen tensions such as heart, lung, and kidney but was less evident in spleen, skeletal muscle, and testicular tissues. LY-ar cells, isolated from LY-as cells after extensive cell culture, also contain twice the level of cellular reduced glutathione. Note that although LY-ar cells have twice the glutathione concentration, bithionine sulfoximine, the specific inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, does not alter the apoptotic propensity of LY-ar cells (15Mirkovic N. Voehringer D.W. Story M.D. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and addition of N-acetyl cysteine in millimolar concentrations reduces apoptosis in LY-as cells only slightly (data not shown). Although generic inhibitors of thiols are effective in modulating apoptosis as stated in the introduction, it may be the specific compartmentalization of glutathione that is critical (16Voehringer D.W. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Brisbay S. Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4426-4430Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because p28 is abundantly expressed in 3T3 and mouse embryo fibroblasts, it argues against a role for p28 in apoptosis, because neither 3T3 nor embryo fibroblasts undergo radiation-induced apoptosis. In addition, altered gene expression in LY-ar cells3 could be attributable to LY-ar cells having become somewhat more differentiated. Admittedly, we have no evidence of that having occurred. However, lymphoid cells such as K562 cells are known to differentiate as a result of environmental stress. In fact, it is conceivable that although Bcl-2 up-regulation in LY-ar cells is responsible for blocking apoptosis, it may not be responsible for the radiation or chemoresistance of LY-ar cells, because sufficient evidence now exists showing that Bcl-2 up-regulation does not predict resistance (14Lock R.B. Stribinskiene L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4006-4012PubMed Google Scholar, 17Elliot M.J. Stribinskiene L. Lock R.B. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We speculate that p28 may be involved in the cellular defense against or in the adaptive response to altered cellular redox conditions. LY-as cells were originally isolated from a mouse B cell lymphoma grownin situ, and the conversion of LY-as cells to LY-ar cells is likely a prime example of the redox-adaptive response as these cells adapt to growth in culture conditions foreign to them, e.g.high oxygen tension. This may also be the case for 3T3 cells and especially low passage mouse embryo fibroblasts, in which p28 was highly expressed. Whether p28 functions directly to alter redox status by glutathione binding or modulates the activity of other proteins via binding through its translocation activity is unknown at this time but is under pursuit. However, the expression and translocation of p28 may provide cells with a greater diversity of mechanisms for coping with insults such as thermal stress or altered redox status that may be responsible for the radiation and chemoresistance of LY-ar cells.

Recently, an early role for LPS in the folding of outer membrane porin PhoE was demonstrated in vitro. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of LPS-protein interactions, folding of PhoE protein was studied with a large set of well characterized LPS chemotypes. We demonstrate that negative charges in the inner core region contribute to the high efficiency of folding of PhoE protein. In addition, the supramolecular structure of the LPS aggregate seems to be important. LPS with a lipid A part that prefers a lamellar or a direct micellar structure and a high state of order of its acyl chains is much less efficient to support folding as compared with LPS with lipid A that prefers a non-lamellar structure and a low acyl chain order. Thesein vitro data indicate that extensive interactions between the core and lipid A region of LPS with the protein are required to support protein folding. The LPS-PhoE binding might be promoted by the presence of hydroxy fatty acids in the lipid A moiety of LPS.

After their translocation across the inner membrane via the Sec machinery (1Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and processing to mature protein, they are assembled into the outer membrane (OM). 1The abbreviations OMouter membraneLPSlipopolysaccharideDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1The abbreviations OMouter membraneLPSlipopolysaccharideDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePore proteins, such as the PhoE protein, are assembled as a trimer in the OM. How membrane proteins fold and assemble into a specific membrane is largely unknown. Kinetic and equilibrium folding studies of mostly soluble, hydrophilic proteins have indicated the existence of at least three main stages in protein folding, the formation of secondary structure, the folding pattern, and detailed tertiary structure (2Ptitsyn O.B. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In vivo, the folding process is mediated by molecular chaperones that are proteins that will act primarily by preventing misfolding and aggregation of partially folded and unassembled protein subunits (3Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In contrast to soluble proteins, membrane proteins will expose much more hydrophobic surfaces, exposed to the lipid phase, whereas the hydrophilic areas will be buried during folding. It can therefore be anticipated that membrane protein folding and assembly in vivo will require a membrane environment and molecular chaperones at or in this membrane. Indeed, refolding of bacterial outer membrane proteins can be accomplished in the presence of detergent and phospholipids (4Eisele J.L. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the kinetics of refolding of these membrane proteins were slow and, in the case of the trimeric porin OmpF, the yield was also low. Interestingly, phosphatidylethanolamine has recently been demonstrated to act as a non-protein molecular chaperone in the assembly of a bacterial cytoplasmic membrane transporter (8Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, certain lipids might also be required as molecular chaperone in the folding and assembly of bacterial outer membrane proteins. outer membrane lipopolysaccharide 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine outer membrane lipopolysaccharide 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine Various in vivo and in vitro studies have implicated an important role for LPS in the folding and assembly of bacterial outer membrane proteins (9Koplow J. Goldfine H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 527-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ames G.F.-L. Spudich E.N. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 406-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tommassen J.

LPS are the major amphiphilic components in the outer leaflet of the bacterial OM (15Lugtenberg B. van Alphen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 51-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar,16Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After synthesis in the inner membrane, LPS are translocated in an as yet unknown manner to the OM. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with the antibiotic cerulenin interferes with the assembly of pore proteins into the outer membrane (12Ried G. Hindennach I. Henning U. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Bocquet-Pagès C. Lazdunski C. Lazdunski A. Eur. J.

Thus, there appears to be a direct relationship between de novo synthesis of lipids, LPS and/or phospholipids, and correct folding and assembly of pore proteins in vivo. Recently, an early role for LPS in folding of PhoE protein was demonstrated in vitro (14de Cock H. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5567-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both, LPS and divalent cations were shown to be involved in the formation of an early intermediate, i.e. a folded monomer of PhoE protein. The subsequent assembly of monomers into trimers requires an additional incubation with outer membranes and Triton X-100 (0.08% w/v). The kinetics of the folding of PhoE with LPS is much higher (20de Cock H. van Blokland S. Tommassen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12885-12890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as compared with the kinetics observed in refolding studies with OmpA and OmpF in the presence of phospholipids (5Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Surrey T. Jähnig F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These in vitro results implicate a special role for LPS in outer membrane protein folding. In order to understand how LPS can support outer membrane protein folding, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanism of LPS-protein interactions. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, involving the negatively charged phosphates in the core and at the C-1 and C-4′ positions of the lipid A backbone and the fatty acids, respectively, might be directly involved in LPS-protein interactions. In addition, the state of order of the acyl chains (described by the order parameter S37) and the three-dimensional supramolecular structures of LPS might directly influence the capacity to support protein folding (for an overview see Refs. 21Seydel U. Brandenburg K. Morrison D.C. Ryan Y. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 225-250Google Scholar and 22Seydel U. Wiese A. Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Morrison D.C. Brade H. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The relationship between the molecular shape of the lipid molecule and the structural polymorphism of its aggregates is well documented for phospholipids (23Israelachvili J.N. Marcelja S. Horm R.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 121-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The same principles also apply for LPS (21Seydel U. Brandenburg K. Morrison D.C. Ryan Y. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 225-250Google Scholar, 22Seydel U. Wiese A. Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Morrison D.C. Brade H. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Thus, the supramolecular structure of LPS aggregates can either be lamellar (L, M) or non-lamellar (cubic, Q or HII). Factors like degree of saturation of acyl chains, temperature, head group size and ionization (pH, divalent cation concentration), and water content can influence the type of aggregate structures (lamellar and various non-lamellar phases). We have used a large set of different LPS molecules, of which the chemical and biophysical properties were previously characterized, in the developed in vitro folding system to investigate which properties of LPS are involved in folding of PhoE protein into its folded monomeric, native-like state.

Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) and the in vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed as described previously (25De Vrije T. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Plasmid pJP370 (26de Cock H. Hekstra D. Tommassen T. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was used to direct the synthesis of the mature form of PhoE protein that was radioactively labeled due to the incorporation of [35S]methionine during protein synthesis. Folding of PhoE protein was initiated by addition of purified LPS and 0.015% Triton X-100 after inhibition of protein synthesis with puromycin and was essentially performed as described previously (14de Cock H. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5567-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In short, 20 μl of a mixture of LPS with Triton X-100 (0.0338%, w/v) in buffer L (50 mm triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.5, 250 mmsucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was mixed with 25 μl of a translation mixture and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were treated with trypsin (45 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added, and the samples were transferred to ice. Prior to electrophoresis, sample buffer containing 2% SDS was added to the protein samples which were divided into two equal portions. One portion was incubated for 10 min at room temperature (lane a in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and the other portion at 100 °C (lane c in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). In addition, 5 μl of the total translation mixture (lacking LPS, Triton X-100) was incubated for 10 min at 100 °C in sample buffer (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3,lanes TL) and was used for determining the total amount of full-length PhoE present in 25 μl of translation mixture. SDS-polyacrylamide gels (27Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) were run at 20 mA in a temperature-controlled room at 4 °C to prevent denaturation of the various folded forms of the PhoE protein during electrophoresis. The folded monomer (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, lanes a and designated m*) often runs as a smear originating from a species with a molecular mass of approximately 31 kDa up to the position of the denatured PhoE form (m; 38 kDa). Gels were incubated with Amplify, dried, and exposed to film (Fuji) at −70 °C. Data were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of trypsin-resistant PhoE is calculated from the amount of denatured PhoE (m) present in lanes designatedc (Figs.

The non-enterobacterial strain Chromobacterium violaceum was obtained from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka, Japan (IFO number 12614), and was cultivated in polypeptone growth media. LPS was extracted from phenol-killed bacteria, and rough mutant strains were extracted according to a modified PCP (PCP I, phenol/chloroform/petrol ether, 2:5:8 volume %) procedure (30Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) and for the wild type strain ofSalmonella minnesota by a phenol/water extraction (31Westphal O.

LPS in the water phase was enzyme-treated with proteinase K, RNase, and DNase (purchased from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany, and Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) and further purified by the PCP procedure (PCP II, phenol/chloroform/petrol ether, 5:5:8 volume %). LPS were lyophilized and usually used in their natural salt form. In some cases, LPS Re samples were converted to various defined salt forms (Na+, Li+, Mg2+, Ba2+, and Ca2+) by extensive dialysis for 48 h against the corresponding salts. The preparations of de-O-acylated LPS, de-O-acylated and de-phosphorylated LPS, de-acylated LPS and of lipid A from LPS of E. coli and K. pneumoniaeR20 were performed as described (33Müller-Loennies S.

The state of order of the hydrocarbon chains of the endotoxins was determined by Fourier-transform spectroscopy by evaluating the symmetric stretching vibration νs(CH2) of the methylene groups. The position of this vibrational band is a sensitive marker of lipid order, and an estimation of the order parameter S at 37 °C, S37, can be performed according to a procedure described earlier (37Brandenburg K. Mayer H. Koch M.H.J. Weckesser J. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), in which S can be calculated from the peak position x s of νs (CH2) by S = −941.8 + 0.7217x s −7.823 10−5 x s2 −2.068 10−8 x s3. It should be noted that S37 defined in this way should be similar but not identical to the order parameter used in NMR spectroscopy (S = 1 for perfectly aligned and 0 for isotropic acyl chains). The supramolecular structures of LPS and lipid A aggregates were deduced from x-ray diffraction patterns, which were obtained by measurements at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) outstation at the Hamburg synchrotron radiation facility HASYLAB kindly performed by M. H. J. Koch using the double-focusing monochromator-mirror camera X33 (38Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucleic Instr. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The evaluation of the x-ray spectra was achieved according to procedures described (39Luzzati V. Vargas R. Mariani P. Gulik A. Delacroix H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and in previous papers (37Brandenburg K. Mayer H. Koch M.H.J. Weckesser J. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Eur. J.

Here, in particular lamellar (L) and non-lamellar inverted cubic (Q) structures are of relevance. From this, the conformation of the individual molecules can be derived, which is cylindrical in the case of L-structures and conical, the cross-section of the hydrophobic moiety is larger than that of the hydrophilic moiety, in the case of inverted Q-structures. For some endotoxin derivatives, de-O-acyl-LPS and de-O-acyl-dephospho-LPS, for which only limited amounts were available, the aggregate structures were predicted according to procedures published earlier (42Brandenburg K. Kusumoto S. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were purified from E. coliMC4100 (24Casadaban M.J. J. Mol.

The phosphor content was determined by the methods of Rouseret al. (45Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). Folding of PhoE with LPS of a deep rough mutant, lacking the complete core region up to the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulopyranosonic acid residues, was previously shown to be much less efficient as compared with wild-type LPS (14de Cock H. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5567-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to identify which region of the core was important to support protein folding, we made use of a well characterized series of chemotypes of LPS derived from S. minnesota (Table I). The primary chemical structures of wild type LPS and of the LPS mutants down to the deep rough mutant (LPS Re) are largely known (Fig.1 A; 32, 46, and references therein) except for the precise substitution with phosphate groups, in particular for lipopolysaccharides with longer sugar chains (>LPS Rc). In addition to differences in total amount of negative charges, the type of supramolecular structure of the LPS aggregates (Refs. 40Seydel U. Koch M.H.J. Brandenburg K. J. Struct.

Folding of in vitro synthesized PhoE protein with LPS of chemotype S, Ra, Rb1, and Rd1/P+ were more efficient as compared with the folding efficiencies obtained with LPS of chemotypes Rc/P−, Rd1/P−, Rd2, and Re (Table I and Fig.2). The efficiency of folding is very reproducible and varies usually between 10% of the obtained average folding efficiency (as indicated in Tables I and II; e.g.60 ± 6%). The reduction of the folding efficiencies with this latter group appears to be mainly due to the absence of a negative charge in the inner core region. The negative charge of the phosphate group at the first heptopyranose, designated Hep I, appears to be most critical in this respect, as has been suggested previously (13Sen K. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 926-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A further reduction in folding efficiency, as observed with LPS of chemotype Re, should be due to a further reduction of the net negative charge present. The variations in the folding efficiencies were not due to changes in the supramolecular structure and changes in the state of order of the acyl chains since the lipid A moiety of all LPS chemotypes prefers a nonlamellar cubic phase (Q) and the order parameter S37 decreased gradually, due to the decrease ofT c from 37 to 30 °C accompanying the reduction of the size of the core structure (21Seydel U.

The amount of lipid A of J-5 and of R20 used was 291 nmol/ml and 311 μg/ml, respectively. M, direct micellar structure. For further details, see Table I. All LPS chemotypes used above were in their natural salt form. The folding efficiencies did not change significantly when the counterions in the LPS of chemotype Re were exchanged by dialysis for Na+ or Li+ (Table I and Fig.3 A). Interestingly, the folding efficiency of Re LPS in the Mg2+ salt form was significantly reduced, whereas those of the Ba2+ and Ca2+ forms had lost the capacity to support protein folding completely (Table I and Fig. 3 A). This reduced capacity to support folding seems to be correlated with a change in the supramolecular structure from a cubic, i.e. non-lamellar, to a lamellar phase and an increase in S37 (41Brandenburg K. Koch M.J.H. Seydel U. J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 108: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Parallel to the change in aggregate structure, there is also a further reduction of the amount of free negative charges that might influence the capacity to support folding. The exact charge density of the LPS in the divalent cation salt forms as indicated in Table I, however, can only be estimated to be ≤2 from the measurement of the electrophoretic mobility of the lipid aggregates (Zeta potential, kindly performed by B. Lindner, Borstel Research Institute). In order to further substantiate the influence of the supramolecular structure further, LPS purified from C. violaceum, R. capsulatus, and P. denitrificans were used. The LPS from these non-enterobacterial species contain a lipid A structure that is different to the basic chemical structure of enterobacterial lipid A, mainly at the level of fatty acid composition (28Mayer H.

https://openalex.org/W2333279736,"Par-4 is a widely expressed protein that sensitizes both prostatic and non-prostatic cells to apoptosis. Constitutive- or regulated- overexpression of Par-4 caused a reduction in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Replenishment of Bcl-2 levels abrogated susceptibility to Par-4-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that Par-4-mediated apoptosis requires downmodulation of Bcl-2 levels. The inverse correlation between Par-4 and Bcl-2 expression was recapitulated in human prostate tumors. Par-4 but not Bcl-2 was detected in the secretory epithelium of benign prostatic tumors and in primary and metastatic prostate cancers that are apt to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, xenografts of human, androgen-dependent CWR22 tumors showed Par-4 but not Bcl-2 expression. By contrast, androgen-independent CWR22R tumors derived from the CWR22 xenografts showed mutually exclusive expression patterns of Par-4 and Bcl-2. These findings suggest a mechanism by which Par-4 may sensitize prostate tumor cells to apoptosis."

To identify regions of Stat5B required for ligand-induced nuclear accumulation, we constructed a cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of Stat5B and performed site-directed mutagenesis. When co-expressed with growth hormone (GH) receptor in COS-7 cells, GFP-Stat5B is tyrosyl-phosphorylated, forms dimers, and binds DNA in response to GH in a manner indistinguishable from untagged Stat5B. In multiple cell types, laser scanning confocal imaging of GFP-Stat5B co-expressed with GH receptor shows that GFP-Stat5B undergoes a rapid, dramatic accumulation in the nucleus upon GH stimulation. We introduced alanine substitutions in several regions of Stat5B and assayed for GH-dependent nuclear localization. Only the mutation that prevented binding to DNA (466VVVI469) abrogated GH-stimulated nuclear localization. This mutant fusion protein is tyrosyl-phosphorylated and dimerizes in response to GH. These results suggest that either high affinity binding to DNA contributes to nuclear accumulation of Stat5B or that this region is crucial for two functions, namely accumulation of Stat5B in the nucleus and DNA binding. Thus, we have identified a mutant Stat5 defective in nuclear localization despite its ability to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated and to dimerize.

A general model for cytokine activation of STATs has been proposed, based primarily on Stats 1–3 (2Ihle J.N.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). In this model, STATs exist as monomers located in the cytoplasm prior to receptor activation, although evidence for preassociation prior to activation exists (4Stancato L.F. David M. Carter-Su C.

Upon cytokine stimulation, phosphotyrosine residues in the receptor recruit STATs through an SH2 domain interaction. Activated Janus kinases phosphorylate STATs on a carboxyl tyrosine, promoting STAT dimer formation by intermolecular SH2 domain interaction and dissociation from the receptor complex. Once dimerized, STATs translocate to the nucleus, bind DNA, and regulate gene transcription (2Ihle J.N.

Thus, it appears that beyond the general mechanism outlined above, there may be cell type-specific mechanisms that could further regulate some of the STATs.

The best characterized nuclear import pathway involves binding of the transported protein to the heterodimer protein complex importin α/β followed by energy-dependent transport through the nuclear pore complex requiring the GTPase activity of Ran/TC4 (10Gorlich D. Matta I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 11Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 12Koepp D.M.

STATs appear to lack a conventional nuclear localization sequence, the single or dual stretch of basic amino acids that bind to importin α. Yet, Stat1 dimers have recently been shown to associate with the importin α-homologue NPI-1 (13Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ifn-γ-stimulated Stat1 nuclear accumulation requires NPI-1 (13Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and the GTPase activity of Ran/TC4 (14Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Perhaps STAT dimers possess the structure required for binding to nuclear import proteins. In cells where STATs are found in the nucleus prior to activation, cytokine-induced nuclear accumulation might also arise from down-regulation of nuclear export. Insight into how STAT proteins interact with proteins needed for nuclear transport awaits identification of a mutant STAT that can dimerize but is unable to localize to the nucleus.

The simultaneous deletion of both genes results in the most severe growth and reproductive defects, revealing functional redundancy of the Stat5 proteins in physiological processes mediated by GH and PRL (25Teglund S.

To probe the mechanisms regulating Stat5B localization within cells, we constructed a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Stat5B fusion protein. We find that the fusion protein is tyrosyl-phosphorylated, dimerizes, accumulates in the nucleus, and binds DNA upon cytokine receptor stimulation in a manner indistinguishable from untagged Stat5B. We identify by site-directed mutagenesis residues required for DNA binding that are also needed for GH-dependent nuclear localization. These studies identify for the first time a region of Stat5 required for nuclear localization independent of those regions needed for dimerization.

Rat Stat5A cDNA (26Kazansky A.V. Raught B. Lindsey S.M. Wang Y.-F. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by J. Rosen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX); rat GH receptor (GHR) cDNA (27Mathews L.S. Enberg B. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9905-9910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was from G. Norstedt (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden), and recombinant human GH was the gift of Lilly. Prestained molecular weight standards were from Life Technologies, Inc. All chemicals were reagent grade or better. pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), which encodes a red-shifted variant of GFP optimized for fluorescence intensity and high expression in mammalian cells, was used to construct a cDNA encoding a GFP-Stat5B fusion protein. The BglII-EcoRI fragment of rat Stat5B cDNA (28Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was first subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (designated pEGFP-ΔStat5B). Polymerase chain reaction with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides 5′-GAAGATCTATGGCAATGTGGATACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCTGCGTGGCATAG-3′ as primers was used to engineer a BglII site and remove an in-frame stop codon upstream of the start codon of Stat5B. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified, digested with BglII, and inserted into pEGFP-ΔStat5B, yielding cDNA encoding GFP fused to the N terminus of full-length Stat5B by a five amino acid linker (SGLRS). DNA sequencing (Sequenase 2.0; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was performed to verify the region created by polymerase chain reaction and all junctions. GFP-Stat5B mutants were generated using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Amino acids Tyr568, Lys582-Lys583-Lys586, or466VVVI469 were replaced by alanine. The oligonucleotide primers were as follows (lowercase represents mutations): 5′-GCCAGGACGGAATgcCACTTTCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGAAAGTGgcATTCCGTCCTGGC-3′ (Tyr568); 5′-GGAGGTGTTAgcGgcACATCTCgcGCCTCACTGGAACG-3′and 5′-CGTTCCAGTGAGGCgcGAGATGTgcCgcTAACACCTCC-3′ (Lys582-Lys583-Lys586); and 5′-CCTTGTCGCTCCCGGcGGcGGcGgcCGTGCATGGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGCCATGCACGgcCgCCgCCgCCGGGAGCGACAAGG-3′ (466VVVI469). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. For the 466VVVI469 mutant, two clones were analyzed for tyrosyl phosphorylation, dimerization, and cellular localization with similar results. 2C4, 2C4-GHR, COS-7, and NIH-3T3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and either 10% fetal bovine serum (2C4, 2C4-GHR, COS-7) or 9% calf serum (NIH-3T3). Medium for all lines except COS-7 was further supplemented with 5 mmsodium pyruvate. COS-7, 2C4, and 2C4-GHR cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (29Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) by incubating subconfluent cultures with DNA precipitates for 6–16 h. For transfection of 2C4 and 2C4-GHR cells, 20 μg/ml CalPhos maximizer (CLONTECH) was used. The cultures were then rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fed with culture medium. To equalize the amount of DNA transfected in non-imaging experiments, empty pEGFP-C1 was used. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested or used for imaging between 48 and 72 h post-transfection. 2C4 cells stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing the cDNA for human GHR (2C4-GHR) have been described previously (30Han Y. Leaman D.W. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Groner B. Kerr I.M. Wood W.I. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5947-5952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 10-cm plates of cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 6–16 h and then treated with 500 ng/ml human GH at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4), and scraped from the plates on ice. Cellular proteins were precipitated from the supernatant (2 h on ice) with αStat5B (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100) or αStat5A (L-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100), immobilized on protein A-coated agarose beads (Repligen; 1.5 h at 8 °C), eluted by boiling, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5–12% gradient or 7.5% gels). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected by Western blotting using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Stat5B-specific, affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti-rat αStat5B (1:5000) (28Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Stat5A-specific αStat5A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2000), α-phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology; 1:7500), or α-GFP (8362-1, CLONTECH; 1:500). For the experiment shown in Fig. 9, cytosol and nuclear extracts were prepared (31Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) and divided for immunoprecipitation or electrophoretic mobility shift assay (see below). Extracts were diluted and supplemented where appropriate to make final volumes (500 μl) and concentrations of NaCl (150 mm), glycerol (7%), and Triton X-100 (0.2%) equal for immunoprecipitation from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. The Western blot data presented in the figures are representative of at least three separate experiments except for Fig. 9, which was performed twice with similar results. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αStat5B and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in 100 μl of dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.02 mm ZnCl2) containing 40 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP; Boehringer Mannheim). As controls, 10 mm Na3VO4 was added to the dephosphorylation buffer or AP was omitted. The reaction was terminated, and proteins were eluted by boiling in a 4:1 mixture of lysis buffer and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The resultant dephosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with αStat5B as described above. EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding rat GHR and either Stat5B or GFP-Stat5B (wild-type or VVVI mutant). Forty-eight hours after transfection and 16 h after serum deprivation, cells were treated with 500 ng/ml GH for 5–60 min and nuclear extracts prepared (31Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The extracts were incubated with or without 1 μg of αStat5B (C-17 10x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then with a probe corresponding to the PRL response element of the β-casein promoter (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAA-3′; 40,000 cpm, 5 × 10−15mol) (32Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. The EMSA experiments were performed twice with similar results. Confocal imaging was performed with a Noran OZ laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60× Nikon objective. GFP was excited at 488 nm by a krypton-argon laser, and fluorescence above 500 nm was captured. Cells were grown on glass coverslips attached to the bottom of a 60-mm culture dish, transfected with cDNA, incubated in serum-free medium for 6–16 h, and then imaged at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (128 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaHPO4, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The contribution of cellular autofluorescence was judged to be less than 1%. Preliminary experiments revealed that repeated laser exposure inhibited GH-dependent migration of GFP-Stat5B into the nucleus, presumably because of phototoxicity. Thus, the following protocol was adopted. Once control images were obtained, cell location was recorded by capturing a low-power image, and the cells were stimulated with GH in a 37 °C incubator. Following the times indicated in the figures, the same cells were found and imaged a second time. The presented images are representative of at least three separate experiments during which at least 20 cells were imaged. For quantitative analysis of fluorescence distribution, cells were fixed (3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min) following stimulation. The mean intensities of neighboring cytosolic and nuclear regions (approximately 5 μm2 each) were calculated using Adobe PhotoshopTM, corrected for background, and expressed as nuclear-to-cytosol fluorescence ratios. As a tool for the study of the cellular localization of Stat5B, we constructed a GFP-Stat5B fusion protein. We first examined whether this protein, when expressed in COS-7 cells, is regulated by GH in a manner similar to untagged Stat5B. To examine whether GH stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of GFP-Stat5B, cells transfected with cDNAs encoding rat GHR and either Stat5B or GFP-Stat5B were treated with or without GH for 15 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with αStat5B and analyzed by Western blotting using αStat5B, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (αPY), or αGFP (Fig.1 A). Antibodies directed against the C terminus of Stat5B (αStat5B) and the N-terminal GFP tag (αGFP) both recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass appropriate for GFP-Stat5B (∼120 kDa) in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with GFP-Stat5B cDNA (Fig. 1 A,lanes E–H). Neither antibody detected a protein of smaller size (except for endogenous Stat5B in the case of αStat5B; Fig.1 A, lanes E–H, and data not shown) indicating that the vast majority of expressed protein was full-length fusion protein. In immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with Stat5B cDNA, αStat5B recognized an approximately 90-kDa protein (Fig.1 A, lanes A–D), appropriate for untagged Stat5B. GH stimulated to similar extents tyrosyl phosphorylation of GFP-Stat5B (Fig. 1 A, lane H) and untagged Stat5B (Fig.1 A, lane D). Hence, GFP-Stat5B expressed in COS-7 cells is full-length (not truncated at either the N or C terminus), is recognized by both αStat5B and αGFP, and like untagged Stat5B is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to GH. We next sought to determine whether GFP-Stat5B is capable of forming dimers in response to GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation. To analyze dimer formation, we utilized the ability of Stat5B to form dimers with Stat5A in response to many cytokines, including GH (33Smit L.S. VanderKuur J.A. Stimage A. Han Y. Luo G. Yu-lee L.-Y. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding GHR, Stat5A, and either GFP, Stat5B, or GFP-Stat5B. Stat5A was immunoprecipitated with Stat5A-specific antibody, and precipitated proteins were probed with Stat5B-specific antibody. GH induced co-immunoprecipitation of Stat5B (Fig. 1 B, lanes C and D) and GFP-Stat5B (Fig. 1 B, lanes E and F) with Stat5A. No proteins were detected when Stat5A was co-expressed with GFP alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes A andB), showing that αStat5B did not cross-react with Stat5A. The Stat5B which co-immunoprecipitated with Stat5A in response to GH migrates as three distinct bands (Fig. 1 B, lane D). Similarly, three GFP-Stat5B bands also co-immunoprecipitate with Stat5A in response to GH (Fig. 1 B, lane F), although the relative amounts differ when compared with Stat5B. The lower level of GFP-Stat5B compared with Stat5B bound to Stat5A in Fig.1 B is assumed to be due to a lower level of expression of GFP-Stat5B since in all experiments where it was examined, GFP-Stat5B was expressed at lower levels than untagged Stat5B. Interestingly, co-expression of Stat5A with either Stat5B or GFP-Stat5B but not with GFP leads to a low level of constitutive tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stat5A (Fig. 1 B, lanes A, C, and E). In sum, these experiments show that activated GFP-Stat5B, like untagged Stat5B, forms heterodimers with Stat5A. Based on studies of Stat5B regulation by GH in liver (34Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we predicted that the multiple Stat5B and GFP-Stat5B bands seen in immunoprecipitates from GH-treated cells reflect differential phosphorylation of Stat5B on serines/threonines and tyrosines. To test for differential phosphorylation, we treated Stat5B immunoprecipitates with the general phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (AP). AP reduced the three Stat5B and GFP-Stat5B bands seen in immunoprecipitates from GH-treated cells to predominantly the fastest migrating band, with a variable amount of a slower migrating band (Fig.2, lanes B and C). The changes in band pattern produced by AP treatment are the result of dephosphorylation and not protein degradation since sodium orthovanadate inhibited the mobility changes (Fig. 2, lane D). The incomplete dephosphorylation of Stat5B seen in immunoprecipitates from GH-treated cells is thought to result from limited access of AP to one of the phosphorylated sites in the Stat5B dimer. In support of Stat5B being phosphorylated on serines/threonines as well as tyrosines, we have found that the serine/threonine-specific phosphatase PP2A condenses the three Stat5B bands from GH-treated cells to two, tyrosyl-phosphorylated bands (data not shown). Further support for the multiple GFP-Stat5B bands not being truncated forms of Stat5B is the finding that all bands are recognized by both antibody to the N-terminal GFP tag and antibody to the 10 amino acids at the C terminus of Stat5B which are unique to the B isoform (28Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also, the bands do not arise from adventitious proteolysis during the immunoprecipitation since the same bands are seen in blots of the cell lysates (Fig. 2,lane A). Overall, these data indicate that GFP-Stat5B, like untagged Stat5B, is phosphorylated at multiple sites. To assess the ability of GFP-Stat5B to bind DNA, we performed EMSAs with a probe corresponding to the GAS-like element of theβ-casein promoter and nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells overexpressing GHR with or without either Stat5B or GFP-Stat5B (Fig.3). GH produced a similar time-dependent increase in the formation of a DNA-binding complex in nuclear extracts from cells expressing Stat5B (Fig. 3,lanes A–E) or GFP-Stat5B (Fig. 3, lanes G–K) but not in extracts from cells expressing GHR alone (Fig. 3,lanes M and N). This DNA-binding complex contains Stat5B or GFP-Stat5B since pretreatment of the nuclear extracts with αStat5B results in a supershifted complex (Fig. 3, lanes Fand L). We find that the DNA complex containing GFP-Stat5B migrates slightly slower than the complex containing untagged Stat5B, consistent with the addition of the GFP tag. Overall, Figs. 1 and 3illustrate that the critical cytokine-regulated events of tyrosyl phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA binding are functionally intact for GFP-Stat5B. The EMSAs indicated that GFP-Stat5B was present in COS-7 cell nuclei following GH treatment (Fig. 3). We next sought to verify the presence of GFP-Stat5B in nuclei by directly visualizing GFP-Stat5B in single, living cells. For these experiments we employed human fibrosarcoma 2C4 cells because they possess a more uniform morphology than COS-7 cells and are easily transfected. Cells transiently expressing GHR and GFP, GFP-Stat5B alone, or GHR and GFP-Stat5B were imaged by confocal microscopy prior to and following stimulation with GH (Fig. 4). In cells expressing both GFP and GHR (Fig. 4, A and B), GFP was found throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, and this distribution did not change upon GH treatment. Likewise, in cells expressing GFP-Stat5B but not GHR (Fig. 4, C andD), GFP-Stat5B was present both in the cytoplasm and nucleus prior to and following GH addition. A similar subcellular distribution of GFP-Stat5B was seen in cells expressing GFP-Stat5B and GHR in the absence of GH (Fig. 4 E). GFP-Stat5B was also present in both the cytosol and nucleus prior to activation when expressed in COS-7, NIH-3T3, and 2C4-GHR cells (Fig. 5,A, C, and E). The presence of some GFP-Stat5B in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm is unlikely to be the result of the GFP tag or overexpression since a similar distribution was seen for the following: 1) untagged Stat5B expressed in COS-7 cells and endogenous Stat5B in CHO-GHR cells (both de"

The Src family kinase Lck is required for the initial events in TCR signaling, such as the phosphorylation of the TCR complex and the activation of ZAP-70, but little is known of its role in downstream signaling. Expression of a mutated form of Lck lacking SH3 domain function (LckW97A) in the Lck-deficient T-cell line JCaM1 revealed a requirement for Lck beyond the initiation of TCR signaling. In cells expressing LckW97A, stimulation of the TCR failed to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, despite normal TCR ζ chain phosphorylation, ZAP-70 recruitment, and ZAP-70 activation. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and MAPK kinase (MEK), as well as the induction of CD69 expression, was greatly impaired in JCaM1/LckW97A cells. In contrast, the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and corresponding elevations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were intact. Thus, cells expressing LckW97A exhibit a selective defect in the activation of the MAPK pathway.

Signaling through the TCR is dependent upon the activity of protein-tyrosine kinases which induce the phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including the subunits of the TCR complex itself. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR complex occurs within amino acid sequences known as immunoreceptor-based tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) and is required for receptor signaling function (4Letourneur F.

However, this does not preclude a role for Lck in TCR signaling which is independent of the activation of ZAP-70 (25Wong J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1998; 18: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Like other Src family kinases, Lck contains a C-terminal kinase domain, a single Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domain, and an N-terminal region that is distinct from other family members (26Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C. Tsygankov A.Y. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3403-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are able to mediate protein interactions by binding certain proline-rich amino acid sequences (27Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D.

The SH3 domain of Lck has also been proposed to stabilize the formation of Lck homodimers which may potentiate TCR signaling following co-ligation of the receptor and CD4 (34Eck M.J. Atwell S.K.

Previous work indicated that deletion of the Lck SH3 domain interfered with the ability of an oncogenic form of Lck to enhance interleukin-2 production, supporting a role for the Lck SH3 domain in regulating T-cell activation (36Caron L. Abraham N. Pawson T. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the involvement of the Lck SH3 domain in TCR signaling processes by expressing an altered form of Lck which contained an inactive SH3 domain in the Lck-deficient T-cell line JCaM1 (12Straus D. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). TCR signaling pathways displayed a differential sensitivity to loss of Lck SH3 domain function. The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the PIP2 pathway was independent of the Lck SH3 domain, whereas activation of the MAPK pathway was strictly SH3 domain-dependent. The inability of this altered form of Lck to activate the MAPK pathway despite ZAP-70 activation suggests that Lck participates directly in the stimulation of downstream signaling pathways following TCR ligation. Derivatives of the Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line JCaM1 were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The LckW97A mutant cDNA was generated from wild type human Lck cDNA using base pair mismatched primers and polymerase chain reaction amplification and was confirmed by sequencing. The Lck cDNA was subcloned into pBP1, a plasmid derived from pUCH-13 (37Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar) which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter sequence regulated by tetracycline operators, and a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin. Clones that express wild type Lck or LckW97A were generated by electroporation of a G418-resistant JCaM1 derivative, which expresses a VP16-tetracycline repressor fusion protein (37Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar), and were isolated by plating at limiting dilution in the presence of hygromycin and G418. Clones that expressed TCR and wild type Lck, or LckW97A, at levels equivalent to the parental Jurkat cell line were maintained for further analysis. TCR expression was measured by staining cells with a mouse antibody recognizing CD3 (Leu-4), followed by a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, and analyzed by fluorescence flow cytometry. To assess the induction of CD69, cells expressing wild type Lck or LckW97A, or Lck-deficient control cells, were incubated with media alone, PHA (0.3 μg/ml), or PMA (50 ng/ml) for 16–20 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with a mouse anti-CD69 antibody (PharMingen) and a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody then evaluated by flow cytometry. Cell suspensions (40 × 106 per ml in phosphate-buffered saline) were stimulated for 2 min at 37 °C with the anti-Jurkat TCR monoclonal antibody C305 (38Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 solution containing (in mm) 10 Tris (pH 7.8), 150 NaCl, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 sodium orthovanadate, 10 NaF, as well as 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Particulate matter was removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysates were precleared with fixed Staphylococcus aureus(Pansorbin, Calbiochem). Lck, ZAP-70, and PLCγ1 were immunoprecipitated using rabbit antisera (Upstate Biotechnology), and TCR ζ chain was immunoprecipitated using the 6B10.2 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose, washed twice each in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Monoclonal antibodies were used to detect Lck (1F6; A. Burkhardt and J. Bolen), phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), ZAP-70 (2F3.2; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), PLCγ1 (mixed monoclonal, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and TCR ζ chain (6B10.2;Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The activated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 or MEK1 and MEK2 were detected using rabbit antibodies which recognize phospho-ERK or phospho-MEK (New England Biolabs). Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. Lck immunoprecipitates were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer followed by two washes in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5m LiCl, 0.4 mm sodium vanadate, and a single wash in distilled H2O. The immobilized Lck was resuspended at 37 °C in Lck kinase buffer containing (in mm) 20 Tris (pH 7.4), 10 MnCl2, 0.01 ATP, as well as 1 μg of GST-ζ fusion protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Aliquots were withdrawn and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm ATP, and glutathione-agarose; after 30 min at 4 °C the samples were washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates were prepared from unstimulated and TCR-stimulated cells using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, washed twice in the same buffer, then twice 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 m LiCl, and once with ZAP-70 kinase buffer containing (in mm) 10 Tris (pH 7.4), 10 MnCl2, 10 MgCl2. The ZAP-70 kinase assay was conducted at room temperature for 10 min by resuspending in ZAP-70 kinase buffer with 20 μm ATP, 1 μg of GST-Band III fusion protein, and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue, the gels were dried to filter paper and exposed to x-ray-sensitive film (X-OMat, Eastman Kodak Co.). The regions corresponding to phospho-GST-ζ and phospho-Lck or phospho-GST-Band III were excised, and the incorporation of 32P was measured by counting Cerenkov radiation. Cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator indo-1, washed extensively in Hepes-buffered saline (HeBS, pH 7.4) solution containing (in mm) 25 Hepes, 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (w/v) d-glucose, and kept on ice. Prior to use, the aliquots were warmed to 37 °C for 10 min and then placed in a spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermally jacketed cuvette holder maintained at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity was monitored continuously at the emission wavelength of 400 nm following excitation at 334 nm. Fluorescence intensity values were corrected for cell autofluorescence and then converted to [Ca2+]iusing a K d value of indo-1 for Ca2+ of 250 nm (39Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Lck in TCR signaling, we have utilized the Lck-deficient JCaM1 T-cell line, derived from the Jurkat cell line (12Straus D. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar,40Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The advantage of using JCaM1 is that TCR signaling can be studied in clones expressing an altered form of Lck independent of the contributions of endogenous wild type Lck (41Straus D.B. Chan A.C. Patai B. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As such, the importance of the SH3 domain of Lck in TCR signaling was examined by transfecting JCaM1 cells with an Lck cDNA that encoded a protein containing an inactive SH3 domain. A conserved tryptophan in SH3 domains stabilizes their association with proline-rich target peptides (28Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); mutation of this tryptophan residue abolishes ligand binding (42Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 43Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, the SH3 domain of Lck was inactivated by mutating this essential tryptophan, located at position 97, to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis (LckW97A). In preliminary experiments, we observed that the SH3 domain of LckW97A, when expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), was unable to bind the known substrate c-Cbl (not shown). Thus, the LckW97A mutation represents a loss of function mutation for the Lck SH3 domain. Stable transfection of JCaM1 cells generated several independent clones expressing similar levels of TCR, and levels of wild type Lck or LckW97A, equivalent to those in the parental Jurkat cell line (Fig.1). Lck kinase activity is essential for the initiation of TCR signaling, and it is possible that disruption of the SH3 domain of Lck affects its catalytic activity. To determine if the SH3 domain of Lck influenced its catalytic activity in vitro, we incubated immunoprecipitates of LckW97A or wild type Lck with [γ-32P]ATP and an exogenous substrate consisting of the cytosolic domain of the ζ chain of the TCR fused to GST (Fig.2 A). Both wild type Lck and LckW97A displayed autophosphorylation and GST-ζ phosphorylation, indicating that the SH3 domain of Lck was not required for kinase activity. In fact, LckW97A displayed enhanced catalytic activity relative to wild type Lck, consistent with an autoinhibitory role for the Lck SH3 domain (Fig. 2 B). Thus, any disturbances in TCR signaling in cells expressing LckW97A cannot be attributed to a general loss of catalytic activity. Although LckW97A was active in vitro, mutation of the SH3 domain may disrupt TCR-induced substrate phosphorylation within the cell, possibly by altering Lck distribution or by interfering with the binding of potential substrates. Therefore, we examined the levels of cellular tyrosine phosphoproteins in unstimulated and TCR-stimulated JCaM1 transfectants expressing wild type Lck, or LckW97A, by immunoblotting lysates with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.3 A). The profiles of tyrosine phosphoproteins in unstimulated and TCR-stimulated cells expressing LckW97A closely resembled those of cells expressing wild type Lck, whereas TCR stimulation of plasmid vector-transfected JCaM1 cells failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation (not shown). Although cells expressing LckW97A displayed a slight, but reproducible, elevation in the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation, it is apparent that mutation of SH3 domain of Lck did not substantially alter the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular phosphoproteins prior to or following TCR stimulation. As such, LckW97A was capable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation. Although the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appeared to be intact, we examined in greater detail the effects of mutation of the Lck SH3 domain on the initiation of TCR signaling. Specifically, we focused on the induction of ITAM and ZAP-70 phosphorylation in cells expressing LckW97A since these events are mediated directly by Lck. Immunoprecipitates of TCR ζ chain were immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine to evaluate ITAM phosphorylation and associated ZAP-70 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). TCR stimulation of cells expressing either wild type Lck or LckW97A induced the phosphorylation of TCR ζ chain and association of tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP-70 (Fig. 3 B), but vector-transfected control cells failed to induce detectable levels of TCR ζ chain or ZAP-70 phosphorylation (not shown). To confirm that TCR stimulation of cells expressing LckW97A elicited ZAP-70 activation, we examined ZAP-70 phosphorylation in the JCaM1 transfectants and evaluated ZAP-70 kinase activityin vitro. Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates revealed that TCR stimulation induced similar levels of ZAP-70 phosphorylation in cells expressing either LckW97A or wild type Lck but not vector-transfected cells (Fig.4 A). The induction of ZAP-70 phosphorylation in TCR-stimulated cells corresponded to an elevation in ZAP-70 kinase activity in vitro, demonstrating that the SH3 domain of Lck is not required for the activation of ZAP-70 (Fig.4 B). Although a slight reduction in TCR-induced ZAP-70 activation was observed in JCaM1 cells expressing LckW97A, this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Thus, the previously identified roles for Lck in the initiation of TCR signaling, namely ITAM phosphorylation and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70, can occur independently of Lck SH3 domain function. Since mutation of the SH3 domain did not alter the initial TCR signaling events that are known to require Lck, we investigated the possibility that the SH3 domain of Lck participates in the activation of downstream signaling events. Specifically, we examined the ability of this altered form of Lck to activate the PIP2 and the MAPK signaling pathways following TCR stimulation. Activation of the PIP2 pathway upon TCR stimulation was assessed by measuring elevations in [Ca2+]i and the induction of PLCγ1 phosphorylation. Elevations in [Ca2+]ielicited by TCR stimulation were examined using cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye indo-1. We analyzed a range of anti-TCR antibody concentrations since subtle disturbances in the activation of the PIP2 pathway would be more apparent at submaximal levels of TCR stimulation. A deficit in the activation of the PIP2 pathway would be manifested as a shift in the concentration-response curve of TCR-stimulated elevations in [Ca2+]i. However, TCR stimulation of cells expressing wild type Lck or LckW97A induced similar elevations in [Ca2+]i at every concentration of anti-TCR antibody tested (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, the kinetics of these TCR-stimulated elevations in [Ca2+]i were identical in cells expressing wild type Lck or LckW97A (Fig. 5 B). The time-to-onset, peak elevation, decline phase, and plateau were all unaltered by inactivation of the Lck SH3 domain. We confirmed that the Lck SH3 domain was not required for the activation of the PIP2pathway by measuring PLCγ1 phosphorylation in cells expressing LckW97A. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of PLCγ1 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing LckW97A showed that PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 5 C). Although lower levels of inducible PLCγ1 phosphorylation were observed in JCaM1/LckW97A cells, it did not alter the ability of these cells to elicit elevations in [Ca2+]i following TCR stimulation. Thus, the activation of the PIP2 pathway following TCR stimulation is not dependent upon the SH3 domain of Lck. We also examined the activation of the MAPK pathway following TCR stimulation of cells expressing LckW97A. In contrast to the initiation of TCR signaling and the activation of the PIP2 pathway, the activation of the MAPK pathway was strictly dependent upon the SH3 domain of Lck. MAPK pathway activity was assessed initially by immunoblotting cell lysates with antibodies that specifically recognize the activated forms of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 and the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. TCR stimulation of cells expressing LckW97A failed to induce ERK or MEK phosphorylation, whereas stimulation of cells expressing wild type Lck elicited substantial ERK and MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 6 A). A kinetic analysis demonstrated that extending the period of TCR stimulation as much as 20 min did not enhance ERK phosphorylation in JCaM1 cells expressing LckW97A (not shown). TCR-independent activation of the MAPK pathway using PMA resulted in phosphorylation of both ERK and MEK irrespective of Lck expression (Fig. 6 A). The selective disruption of the MAPK pathway in cells expressing LckW97A demonstrates that an additional requirement for Lck exists in the activation of downstream signaling events, which is distinct from its previously identified role in mediating the initiation of TCR signaling. Engagement of the TCR initiates intracellular signaling processes that culminate in characteristic changes in gene expression, including expression of the cell-surface marker CD69 (44Testi R. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1854-1860PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the pronounced deficits in MAPK pathway activation, we suspected that TCR stimulation of JCaM1 cells expressing LckW97A would be incapable of inducing CD69 expression (45D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells expressing LckW97A with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) resulted in little or no induction of CD69 expression, whereas PHA treatment of cells expressing wild type Lck elicited a 10-fold elevation in median fluorescence intensity (Fig.6 B). TCR-independent stimulation with PMA elicited similar levels of CD69 expression in all cell lines, regardless of Lck expression. Thus, the SH3 domain of Lck is required for TCR-dependent CD69 expression. The inability of LckW97A to activate the MAPK pathway or induce CD69 expression demonstrates a critical role for the SH3 domain of Lck in TCR signaling and T-cell activation. We have identified a crucial role for the SH3 domain of Lck in activation of the MAPK pathway following TCR stimulation. The Lck-deficient cell line JCaM1 was transfected with an altered form of Lck in which a conserved tryptophan located within the SH3 domain was mutated to alanine, thereby abolishing Lck SH3 domain function. Substantial biochemical and genetic evidence has demonstrated that this conserved tryptophan is essential for ligand binding (28Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 42Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 43Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar); thus, it is very unlikely that LckW97A has any residual SH3 domain function. JCaM1 clones expressing LckW97A failed to induce CD69 expression and MAPK activation upon TCR stimulation, revealing a defect in TCR signaling. Since LckW97A possessed kinase activity in vitro, the block in T-cell activation in cells expressing LckW97A could not be attributed to loss of catalytic function. Furthermore, cells expressing LckW97A had only minor alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and exhibited inducible TCR ζ chain phosphorylation and ZAP-70 activation upon TCR stimulation. Thus, the Lck SH3 domain is not required for the initiation of TCR signaling but is essential for events that are independent of, or subsequent to, the recruitment and activation of ZAP-70. Additional analysis of downstream signaling pathways demonstrated that cells expressing LckW97A were capable of activating the PIP2 pathway following TCR stimulation; both PLCγ1 phosphorylation and subsequent elevations in [Ca2+]i were independent of Lck SH3 domain function. However, unlike the PIP2 pathway, TCR stimulation of cells expressing LckW97A failed to induce activation of ERK or MEK, indicating that there was a selective loss of this TCR signaling pathway. Thus, the Lck SH3 domain is required specifically for the activation of the MAPK pathway but not the initiation of TCR signaling or the activation of the PIP2 pathway. A current model of TCR signal transduction proposes that Lck and ZAP-70 function sequentially to initiate signaling (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar, 2Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 3Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Lck phosphorylates the TCR which allows ZAP-70 recruitment, followed by ZAP-70 phosphorylation and activation, which is also mediated by Lck. The subsequent stimulation of the PIP2 and MAPK pathways is dependent upon the activation of ZAP-70. In the simplest model, the sole role of Lck in TCR signaling would be to recruit and activate ZAP-70. However, our data demonstrate that the involvement of Lck in TCR signaling is more complex and establish that a selective requirement for Lck exists in the activation of downstream signaling pathways. TCR stimulation of JCaM1/LckW97A cells failed to activate the MAPK pathway, despite activation of ZAP-70 and the PIP2pathway. Recent studies with a constitutively active form of ZAP-70 support the notion that Lck is required for downstream signaling (25Wong J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1998; 18: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Constitutively active ZAP-70 is able to elicit interleukin-2 gene expression independently of TCR stimulation but only when co-expressed with Lck. Taken together, these studies indicate an additional role for Lck in TCR signaling beyond the recruitment and activation of ZAP-70. Several models could explain the requirement for both activated ZAP-70 and Lck in the stimulation of the MAPK pathway. Lck and activated ZAP-70 may provide separate signals, both of which are needed for activation of the downstream pathway. Alternatively, ZAP-70 and Lck may act together on a common substrate that is essential for the stimulation of the MAPK pathway. The Lck SH3 domain has been shown to bind several signaling molecules implicated in the regulation of the MAPK pathway. The binding of these target proteins by the Lck SH3 domain may modify their activity as a result of conformational changes, subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, or recruitment to the membrane. PI-3-K binds to the Lck SH3 domain (30Prasad K.V.S. Kapeller R. Janssen O. Repke H. Duke-Cohan J.S. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7708-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and is capable of activating the MAPK pathway in some cell types (47Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the loss of MAPK activation in JCaM1/LckW97A cells is due to alterations in the function of PI-3-K since we did not observe any alteration in PI-3-K localization or activity following TCR stimulation of JCaM1 cells expressing either wild type Lck or LckW97A (not shown). The proto-oncogene product c-Cbl also associates with the SH3 domain of Lck (29Reedquist K. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). c-Cbl acts as a negative regulator of MAPK activation (48Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), although this appears to be the result of a block in the activation of Syk/ZAP-70 making it unlikely that c-Cbl would selectively regulate the MAPK pathway (49Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Lck has also been shown to interact directly with the kinases comprising the MAPK signaling pathway, including Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK (50Ettehadieh E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Hess-Bienz D. Watts J.

Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to understand the specific function of the Lck SH3 domain in the activation of the MAPK pathway following stimulation of the TCR. The SH3 domains of Src family kinases have been proposed to be autoinhibitory. X-ray crystallographic studies examining the structure of Src and Hck revealed that the SH3 domain mediates an intramolecular interaction with an atypical binding site located in the region linking the SH2 and kinase domains (54Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 55Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Inactivating the SH3 domain of Src induces an 8–10-fold elevation in its kinase activity (42Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, mutation of the SH3 domain of Lck caused a comparatively modest 2-fold elevation in its kinase activity. Moreover, deleting the SH3 domain of Lyn reduces its kinase activity (56Abrams C.S. Zhao W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 333-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that despite their significant structural similarity, the SH3 domains of Src family kinases may not be functionally identical, although it is possible that other regulatory mechanisms may compensate for loss of SH3 domain function in Lck and Lyn. In summary, we have identified an additional role for Lck in TCR signaling which is distinct from its ability to mediate ITAM phosphorylation and ZAP-70 activation. Our results demonstrate that TCR-induced activation of the MAPK pathway, but not the PIP2 pathway, requires the SH3 domain of Lck. The selective requirement for Lck SH3 domain function in the MAPK pathway suggests that the activation of specific downstream signaling events could be controlled by regulating the function of Lck. Such a mechanism may be involved in thymocyte development where activation of the MAPK pathway is required for positive selection but not negative selection (57Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 58Swan K.A. Alberola-Ila J. Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Forbush K.A. Thomas J.F. Perlmutter R.M.

Type II restriction endonucleases (ENases) 1The abbreviations ENaserestriction endonucleaseMTasemethyltransferase are ideal models for investigating the molecular basis of specificity in the interaction of proteins with their specific DNA recognition sites. More than 2900 type II ENases isolated from different sources have been described, representing more than 200 individual DNA sequence specificities (1Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). They form one of the most comprehensive groups of functionally similar proteins with distinct DNA binding specificities. As phylogenetically diverse enzymes coded by eubacteria, archaebacteria, and viruses evolved to recognize identical DNA sequences, a variety of structures and mechanisms involved in DNA recognition can be expected. restriction endonuclease methyltransferase EcoRII belongs to the IIE type of ENases characterized by their essential interaction with two copies of the recognition site for DNA cleavage. This cooperative mode of action limits their efficiency of DNA restriction and may reflect additional biological functions besides the defense of the host cell against invading foreign DNA (for reviews, see Refs. 2Bickle T.A.

In bridging two DNA recognition sites incis or trans, type IIE ENases resemble proteins involved in DNA replication and recombination, as well as in transcription control, in pro- and eukaryotes (2Bickle T.A.

Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Up to now, functional domains of EcoRII have not been identified, and it is not known how DNA recognition is realized at the amino acid level. The crystal structure of anEcoRII-DNA complex remains to be determined. Restriction ENases are remarkably recognition site-specific enzymes. This is borne out in a high affinity (association constants,K a ≈ 108-109m−1) to their recognition sequence, a low affinity to sites differing by only 1 base pair, and the precise coupling of DNA recognition and site-specific cleavage. The structural elements that make specific contacts with DNA target sites differ in all ENase-DNA co-crystal structures analyzed so far, whereas their tertiary and quaternary structure and the residues involved in catalysis show a degree of conservation (cf. Refs. 11Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar and 12Aggarwal A.K. Wah D.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholarfor review). The structural data base of ENases is still too limited to infer rules of protein-DNA recognition and, in particular, to decide whether these may define a protein-DNA recognition code. The theoretical interest and practical impact of such recognition rules make faster methods of identifying DNA binding sites in proteins most desirable. We used spot synthesis (13Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9211-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar) to prepare EcoRII-derived peptide scans bound C-terminally to continuous cellulose membranes. Peptide scans have been applied successfully to the investigation of linear or discontinuous protein-protein (14Kramer A. Keitel T. Winkler K. Stöcklein W. Höhne W. Schneider-Mergener J.

The study presented here led to the identification of twoEcoRII peptides capable of sequence-specific DNA binding.EcoRII mutants constructed with mutations in these DNA binding sites had altered DNA binding and scission properties. The sequence of one of the two DNA binding sites led to the discovery of a putative family of DNA binding peptides in diverse restriction enzymes. At the onset of this study, there were two GenBankTM entries for the complete nucleotide sequence of the ecoRII ENase gene, X16025 (18Kossykh V. Repyk A. Kaliman A. Buryanov Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and M26404 (19Bhagwat A.S. Johnson B. Weule K. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 767-773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which differ in six nucleotides and include two frameshifts. Before synthesizing peptide scans, it was necessary to clarify these uncertainties. We sequenced ourEcoRII expression plasmid (10Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) originating from pR209 (19Bhagwat A.S. Johnson B. Weule K. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 767-773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in both directions. By using the Thermo Sequenase de-AzaG-Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), it was possible to resolve a track of four guanines, otherwise appearing as three, corresponding to nucleotide position 676–678 of the sequence M26404. Except for this one additional G and the deletion of a C at nucleotide position 710, our results match sequence M26404. The revised nucleotide sequence was submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AJ224995). All cellulose-boundEcoRII-derived peptides were prepared semiautomatically on a spot synthesizer (Abimed GmbH, Langefeld, Germany) as described previously in detail (20Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). For testing the specific binding of DNA to EcoRII peptides the following synthetic oligonucleotide duplex (30-mer) was used: 5′CGTAACGAATATCCAGGGTTACGACGTCGA/ 5′TCGACGTCGTAACCCTGGATATTCGTTACG (theEcoRII-specific recognition site is underlined). Competition experiments were performed in the presence of an excess of the above specific duplex or the following unspecific oligonucleotide duplex: 5′CGATCGACGATCGCGTATTATACGCGATCG/5′CGATCGCGTATAATACGCGATCGTCGATCG. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals GmbH) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas) and purified by gel filtration on probequant columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cellulose-bound peptide scan was rinsed for 5 min in methanol and then preincubated for 1 h in 100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), pH 7.5, followed by three washes with EcoRII binding buffer (33 mmTrisOAc, 66 mm KOAc, 10 mmMg(OAc)2; pH 7.6) for 10 min. Usually the peptide scan was incubated with 25 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled substrate DNA in a total volume of 10 ml of EcoRII binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times for 5 min withEcoRII binding buffer and air-dried. The bound radioactivity per peptide spot was quantitated by phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager, type SI) and processed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics GmbH). To compare data from different experiments, a serial dilution of a 14C standard was included with each experiment, and the absolute amount of radioactivity was taken into account. Peptide scans were stripped of bound radioactivity either by electroblotting and/or extended washing steps in EcoRII binding buffer supplemented with 2 m NaCl or 1 mK2HPO4, pH 8.0. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Vandeyar et al.(21Vandeyar M.A. Weiner M.P. Hutton C.J. Batt C.A. Gene. 1988; 65: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The 1294-base pair EcoRI/PstI fragment from expression vector pQE-30 containing the coding region for ENaseEcoRII (10Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was cloned in M13mp18. Potential active site mutants were obtained by replacement of Glu at positions 96 and 234 and Asp at position 130 by Ala. DNA binding site I double mutants were obtained by substituting both lysines 92 and 97 by either Ala or Glu. Analogously, Ala or Glu substituents were introduced into DNA binding site II for lysines 263 and 268. The mutations were verified twice by sequencing, after mutagenesis and again after re-cloning into the expression vector pQE-30. The sequence of the whole ecoRIIRgene was determined as described above. The quadruple mutations in the DNA binding sites were constructed by ligating suitableKpnI/EcoRV DNA fragments of the four double mutants. After DNA transformation and propagation in Escherichia coli JM109 (pDK1 R−M+), the cloning sites, as well as the mutations themselves, were confirmed by resequencing. Mutant and wild-type N-terminally His6-taggedEcoRII proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns as described (10Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In a further purification step, the most concentrated protein fractions were loaded onto HiTrap® Heparin Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).EcoRII of ≥95% purity eluted at 600 mm NaCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 1 mm EDTA. Protein-containing fractions were analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. After electroblotting of polyacrylamide gels for 1 h, the nitrocellulose membrane was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4; pH 7.3) and blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% neonatal calf serum and 0.2% Tween. The blot was incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit EcoRII antiserum) diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution. After five 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween, peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (donkey-anti-rabbit peroxidase, Pierce) was added 1:2500 for 1 h in blocking solution followed by five washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween. EcoRII bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignalTMULTRA (Pierce) diluted 1:5 in water. The plasmid pBR322 (0.1 pmol; sixEcoRII sites per molecule) was cleaved to completion withBamHI, extracted with phenol and chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The redissolved DNA was incubated with 0.3 pmol of EcoRII wild-type or mutant proteins in 20 μl at 37 °C. Cleavage was monitored on 0.9% agarose gels. The capacity of the enzyme variants to be activated to cleave resistant DNA was tested by incubating 200 ng of phage T3 DNA (3 sites per 40,000-base pair genome) in the presence of an approximately 200-fold molar excess of an EcoRII site-containing oligonucleotide duplex and 1 pmol of the enzyme in 20 μl for 90 min at 37 °C. DNA fragments were separated on 0.7% agarose (22Pein C.-D. Reuter M. Cech D. Krüger D.H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A radioactively labeled 191-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment (0.025 pmol) containing one EcoRII-specific DNA recognition sequence was incubated with increasing protein concentrations (0–5 pmol) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 33 mm TrisOAc (pH 7.6), 66 mm KOAc, 10 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions were immediately loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was run at 4 °C. Results were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics GmbH). The ratio of protein-bound to total radioactivity was calculated for each lane, and the apparent K D was determined as the enzyme concentration at which 50% of the total radioactivity was bound. Comparison of DNA-protein complexes formed by EcoRII and its mutants, shown in Fig. 5 b, was made after incubating 0.025 pmol of polymerase chain reaction fragment with 2 pmol of the respective protein for 20 min at room temperature. For circular dichroism spectroscopy, the proteins purified to ≥95% were used at concentrations of about 1 mg/ml except for the quadruple mutants K92E/K97E/K263E/K268E (0.26 mg/ml) and K92E/K97E/K263A/K268A (0.15 mg/ml). Three successive runs from 250 to 190 nm were performed in a cuvette with a 0.1-mm light path in a Jobin Yvon Dichrograph III at a bandwidth of 5 nm, a scanning rate of 0.01 nm/s, and a time constant of 1 s. Phage λ grown on a Dcm− E. coli strain was diluted in SM buffer (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.7Google Scholar), and 0.5 ml was incubated with 0.3 ml of E. coli JM109 carrying plasmids coding for the different EcoRII mutants or the wild-type enzyme for 20 min at 37 °C. To improve phage adsorption, the indicator cells were grown in the presence of 0.2% maltose. The virus-host cell mixture plus 3 ml of top agar was then poured on LB plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. A BLAST search was conducted of the sequences of the EcoRII DNA binding peptides against the SwissProt data base. Sequences of isoschizomers of EcoRII,SsoII, NgoPII and LlaII were accessed through REBASE (1Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and GenBankTM. The multiple alignment (Higgins-Sharp) and the homology matching (Lipman-Pearson FASTA) routines of the PC-based sequence analysis package DNAsis 2.5 (Hitachi) were initially used for alignments of the total EcoRII sequence to other ENases in the data base. Taking account of the unusual length of the EcoRII sequence and the locations of the two DNA binding sites, the search was repeated for the left and the right halves of the EcoRII sequence. Sets of ENase sequences were submitted to the multiple alignment program DIALIGN 2.0 (24Morgenstern B. Werner T. Dress A.W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12098-12103Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) at the Web site http://bibiserv.TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE/dialign/. The entire amino acid sequence presented as a set of 132 covalently cellulose-bound dodecapeptides overlapping by 9 amino acids was screened for its ability to bind EcoRII recognition site-containing oligonucleotide duplexes. The length and overlap of the peptides in the scan were chosen because individual segments of discontinuous DNA binding sites generally do not exceed 9–12 amino acids. Fig. 1 a shows that peptides from two regions distant in the primary sequence exhibit high affinity to the oligonucleotide. The influence of Mg2+ ions on DNA-peptide binding is evident by comparing Fig. 1 a and Fig. 1 b. The quantitative effect of Mg2+ is shown in Fig. 1 c. Because Mg2+ ions clearly diminished unspecific DNA binding to several EcoRII peptides, all subsequent DNA binding experiments were carried out in the presence of 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. To examine whether the interaction with the DNA substrate was specific to the EcoRII recognition sequence CCWGG, the following series of competition experiments was carried out: (i) binding of the labeled specific oligonucleotide duplex alone, (ii) binding as in i with saturating amounts of an unlabeled, unspecific oligonucleotide, and (iii) binding as in i with saturating amounts of an unlabeled, specific oligonucleotide. The unspecific competitor was designed so as to avoid any homology with the EcoRII recognition sequence at the dinucleotide level. Competing oligonucleotide duplexes were saturating with respect to total peptide in the spots and represented a 104–105 molar excess of unlabeled over labeled substrate. Data from series of competition experiments were compared quantitatively on the basis of a 14C standard. Under stringent competitive conditions, only five dodecapeptide spots specifically bound oligonucleotides containing the EcoRII DNA recognition site (Fig. 2). The binding of labeled specific oligonucleotide duplex to the peptides was not reduced by saturating concentrations of unlabeled unspecific oligonucleotides. In contrast, the same concentration of unlabeled specific competitor DNA decreased the binding of labeled specific substrate below 1%. In comparison to an EcoRII-specific substrate, the labeled unspecific oligonucleotide duplex itself bound to these peptides with an efficiency between 1% and, maximally, 10% (data not shown). Two specific DNA binding regions spanning 15 and 18 amino acids, located between EcoRII amino acid positions 88–102 (binding site I) and 256–273 (binding site II) were thus identified under highly competitive binding conditions. Both potential binding regions share the minimal consensus motif KXRXXK (Fig.2), which does not occur elsewhere in the EcoRII sequence. Substitution analogues of both potential DNA binding sites of EcoRII were synthesized in which every amino acid of the original sequence is replaced by all others. Fig.3 depicts the layout of the peptide scan, where each binding site is represented by 15 rows and 21 columns. The original (wild-type) sequence occurs twice in each row: in the left-most spot and in the column of the substituent corresponding to the original residue. To evaluate the influence of single substitutions on DNA binding, we calculated the initial binding efficiency (i.e. to the wild-type peptide) as the average over all 30 original peptide spots plus or minus the 3-fold S.D. All binding efficiencies outside this range were considered significant. It is evident that certain basic amino acids had a significant influence on DNA binding to both sites. Considerable effects of amino acid exchanges on DNA binding are seen at the consensus motif lysine and arginine residues at positions 92, 94, 97, and 98, as well as tryptophan 102 in the first binding region and, more pronounced, at positions 263, 265, and 268 in the second binding region (cf. Fig. 2). Following the leads from the substitution experiment, both lysines (boldface letters) in each potential binding site (site I, RHFGKTRNEKRITRW; site II, NSVSNRRKSRAGKSLELH) were replaced by neutral alanine or acidic glutamic acid residues, yielding the double mutants K92A/K97A, K92E/K97E, K263A/K268A, and K263E/K268E and the quadruple mutants K92A/K97A/K263A/K268A, K92A/K97A/K263E/K268E, K92E/K97E/K263A/K268A, and K92E/K97E/K263E/K268E. On expression inE. coli, wild-type and mutant EcoRII appeared in both the soluble and the insoluble fractions (cf. Ref. 9Kupper D. Reuter M. Mackeldanz P. Meisel A. Alves J. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The quadruple mutants K92E/K97E/K263E/K268E and K92E/K97E/K263A/K268A produced the lowest yields of soluble endonuclease proteins. AllEcoRII derivatives eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. Western blot analysis of the purified wild-type and the eight DNA binding site mutant proteins confirmed their reactivity toward polyclonalEcoRII antibodies and the presence of one predominant band at the molecular weight of the wild-type protein (data not shown). Three CD spectra for each EcoRII mutant enzyme were accumulated, and the secondary structure was calculated according to Chen et al. (25Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 22: 4120-4131Crossref Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the CD spectra of the wild-type and the DNA binding site mutants do not reveal obvious differences in secondary structure of the proteins. Because of the lower protein concentrations available for the spectrometric measurements of the quadruple mutants K92E/K97E/K263E/K268E and K92E/K97E/K263A/K268A, their spectra exhibited a lower signal-to-noise ratio than those from the other proteins. The DNA binding behavior of wild-type EcoRII and its derivatives mutated in one or both binding sites was compared by gel retardation assays in the absence of Mg2+ ions to prevent DNA cleavage (Fig. 5). Constant low DNA concentration and varying protein concentrations, covering at least 2 orders of magnitude, were employed to determine the apparent dissociation constants K D(app) ofEcoRII-DNA complexes. For the calculation ofK D(app) values, we made the simplifying assumption that given the excess of enzyme over DNA, only one substrate (S) binding site of the enzyme dimer (E) was occupied. The obtained constants shown in Fig. 5 a were therefore calculated according to K D = [S][E]/[SE]. The replacement of both K residues by A in DNA binding site I (K92A/K97A) led to a 6-fold decrease in DNA binding and the formation of slower migrating complexes in comparison to wild-typeEcoRII, whereas the introduction of E in place of K (K92E/K97E) nearly abolished DNA binding. In contrast, both binding site II mutants showed dissociation constants comparable to wild-type. The K D values of the quadruple mutants substituted in both binding sites exceeded those of the individual binding site mutants from which they were composed. Furthermore, the gel mobility shift assay with the quadruple mutant enzymes reproducibly separated a number of complexes distinct in size and/or conformation from theEcoRII wild-type-DNA complex (Fig. 5 b). It was evident from competition experiments with a 1000-fold molar excess of unspecific or specific unlabeled DNA that the residual binding capacity of the EcoRII mutants was still recognition sequence-specific (data not shown). The catalytic activity of the eight mutant enzymes was tested on linearized pBR322 DNA and compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6 a). Alanine substitutions in DNA binding site I at positions 92 and 97 did not reduce cleavage activity compared with the EcoRII wild-type ENase. However, lysine exchanges to glutamic acid caused a strong decrease in DNA cleavage activity, without a concomitant change in recognition site specificity (Fig. 6 a). This was apparently correlated to the extremely weak substrate binding of the mutant enzyme K92E/K97E (cf. Fig. 5), consistent with a repulsion of DNA phosphates by the introduced negative charges. Monitoring the time dependence of pBR322 cleavage confirmed the low but still measurable cleavage rate of K92E/K97E (data not shown). Both mutations in DNA binding site II and all of the quadruple mutations resulted in catalytically inactive enzymes (Fig. 6 a). Even after 2 h, no DNA hydrolysis could be detected under standard EcoRII reaction conditions (data not shown). Table I summarizes the properties of all constructed EcoRII mutants and additionally includes the ability of the enzymes to be activated by site-containing oligonucleotides to cleave resistant DNA sites, as well as their efficiency of restricting phage λ reproduction in E. colihost cells. EcoRII can be activated in trans to cleave single, resistant recognition sites, e.g. on viral T3 and T7 DNA, by co-incubation with another, susceptible DNA (26Krüger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M.

https://openalex.org/W2333035633,"In mammals Cdk4 (or Cdk6 in some cell types) is required for starting the cell cycle. Recently we showed that Cdk4 is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and that this regulation is required for a DNA damage-induced G1 arrest. We report here that a generic anti-phosphotyrosine antibody can detect tyrosine-phosphorylated Cdk4 and that as revealed by immunoblot detection and kinase assay, this regulation is employed for DNA damage-responsive checkpoint control during cell cycle start from quiescence. In rat fibroblasts traversing G1 or arrested in G1 by deprivation of anchorage, Cdk4 does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurs only during cell's arrest in quiescence and dephosphorylation during their cell cycle start. Ultraviolet irradiation blocks dephosphorylation and concomitant activation of Cdk4, thereby preventing the start of cell cycling. Thus, unlike tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2, which controls phase transition in the regular cell cycle, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk4 is employed for controlling cell cycle start from quiescence in a rat fibroblast."
https://openalex.org/W1987723450,"Mapping approaches employing blocking antibodies and synthetic peptides have implicated the 727–767 segment at the NH2 terminus of C3b α′-chain as contributing to the interactions with factor B, factor H, and CR1. Our previous mutagenesis study on the NH2-terminal acidic cluster of this segment identified residues Glu-736 and Glu-737 as contributing to the binding of C3b to factor B and CR1 but not factor H. We have now extended the charged residue mutagenic scan to cover the remainder of the segment (738–767) and have assessed the ability of the C3b-like C3(H2O) form of the mutant molecules to interact with factor H, CR1, and membrane cofactor protein (MCP) using a cofactor-dependent factor I cleavage assay as a surrogate binding assay. We have found that the negatively charged side chains of Glu-744 and Glu-747 are important for the interaction between C3(H2O) and factor H, a result in general agreement with an earlier synthetic peptide study (Fishelson, Z. (1991) Mol. Immunol. 28, 545–552) which implicated residues within the 744–754 segment in H binding. The interactions of the mutants with soluble CR1 (sCR1) revealed two classes of residues. The first are residues required for sCR1 to be an I cofactor for the first two cleavages of α-chain. These are all acidic residues and include the Glu-736/Glu-737 pair, Glu-747, and the Glu-754/Asp-755 pairing. The second class affects only the ability of sCR1 to be a cofactor for the third factor I cleavage and include Glu-744 and the Lys-757/Glu-758 pairing. The dominance of acidic residues in the loss-of-function mutants is striking and suggests that H and CR1 contribute basic residues to the interface. Additionally, although there is partial overlap, the contacts required for CR1 binding appear to extend over a wider portion of the 727–767 segment than is the case for factor H. Finally, none of the mutations had any effect on the interaction between soluble MCP and C3(H2O), indicating that despite its functional homology to H and CR1, MCP differs in its mode of binding to C3b/C3(H2O).

Stringent regulation of the alternative complement pathway C3 convertase is essential for the prevention of C3 hypercatabolism and for the protection of host tissue from the deleterious effects of alternative pathway propagation. In particular, it is important to regulate alternative pathway propagation that can employ as a nidus C3b molecules that have become adventitiously bound to host cell membrane. In primates, this regulation involves primarily the soluble serum proteins factor H and factor I, as well as the membrane-resident proteins decay-accelerating factor (CD55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, 1The abbreviations MCPmembrane cofactor proteinCCPcomplement control proteinCRcomplement receptorCVFcobra venom factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDMEM/K76DMEM containing K76-COOH-treated fetal calf serumEACsheep erythrocytes coated with antibody and the indicated complement components or fragments thereofELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinerC3recombinant C3RCAregulators of complement activationRIAradioimmunoassaySCRshort consensus repeatsCR1soluble CR1sMCPsoluble MCPVBSveronal-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pairHuhumanTrtroutXeXenopus 1The abbreviations MCPmembrane cofactor proteinCCPcomplement control proteinCRcomplement receptorCVFcobra venom factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDMEM/K76DMEM containing K76-COOH-treated fetal calf serumEACsheep erythrocytes coated with antibody and the indicated complement components or fragments thereofELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinerC3recombinant C3RCAregulators of complement activationRIAradioimmunoassaySCRshort consensus repeatsCR1soluble CR1sMCPsoluble MCPVBSveronal-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pairHuhumanTrtroutXeXenopusCD46), and complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) (reviewed in Ref. 1Liszewski M.K.

With the exception of the serum protease factor I, the other regulatory molecules are members of a superfamily consisting almost entirely of varying numbers of a sequence motif alternatively referred to as a short consensus repeat (SCR) or complement control protein (CCP) module. Although this motif is also found in many non-complement proteins, the genes encoding the complement regulatory molecules are clustered on the long arm of chromosome 1 at what has been termed the RCA locus, for regulators of complement activation. Structural analyses of single and paired CCP modules have directly demonstrated that they each form independently folded compact globular domains consisting of two interacting layers of anti-parallel β-sheet (2Barlow P.N.

It has been speculated that the protruding loops, some of which are of variable length, are good candidates for mediating interaction with ligand.CCP-containing proteins that bind to C3b exert their regulatory effect via two mechanisms as follows: decay-accelerating activity and factor I-cofactor activity. Specifically, the binding of H, decay-accelerating factor, and CR1 to C3bBb, the alternative pathway C3 convertase, leads to an accelerated rate of unidirectional dissociation of the serine protease Bb from the C3b modulatory subunit of the convertase. I cofactor activity refers to the accessory role of the SCR-containing protein in the I-mediated cleavage of C3b COOH terminus to residues 1281 and 1298 (mature C3 numbering), yielding the major fragmentation product iC3b and a minor fragment termed C3f. Since the iC3b fragment can no longer associate with factor B, this permanently inactivates the C3 molecule with respect to being a nidus for alternative pathway C3 convertase formation. However, this factor I-mediated cleavage can only take place when the C3b is complexed with one of three cofactors, these being the soluble protein factor H and the host membrane-associated proteins CR1 and MCP. Although there is some suggestive evidence in the literature that binding of H to C3b causes a conformational change in the latter (5DiScipio R.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2592-2599PubMed Google Scholar), thereby increasing the affinity for factor I, there is also recent evidence that factor I can simultaneously bind to both H and C3b, thereby stabilizing the intrinsically weak C3b-I interaction sufficiently to permit cleavage (6Soames C.J. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whether factor I similarly binds directly to cofactors CR1 or MCP is as yet unknown. At physiological ionic strength, only CR1 can efficiently act as an I cofactor for the further cleavage of iC3b COOH-terminal to residue 932, yielding fragments C3c and C3dg (7Ross G.D. Lambris J.D. Cain J.A. Newman S.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2051-2060PubMed Google Scholar).Domain deletion and domain exchange studies have succeeded in identifying CCP/SCR regions within the complement regulatory proteins that are required for their C3b-binding and I cofactor activity (8Kuhn S.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar). Usually 3–4 SCR domains are required for functional activity. For example, in the case of factor H, SCRs 1–4 are minimally required for the expression of its I cofactor activity (8Kuhn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sharma A. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Factor H has also been shown to possess C3b-binding sites involving SCRs 6–10 and 16–20, although these sites do not contribute to the I cofactor activity of the molecule (9Sharma A. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The two C3b-binding sites of human CR1 are contributed by SCRs 8–11 and 15–18, respectively, and these entities are each capable of mediating full I cofactor activity (10Kalli K.R. Hsu P. Bartow T.J. Ahearn J.M. Matsumoto A.K. Klickstein L.B. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A recent study on CR1 has shown that the first three SCR domains in each case account for most of the functional activity (11Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and critical residues within these functionally important domains have also been identified (11Krych M.

Nevertheless, several independent groups have used a variety of other approaches to putatively identify segments within C3 that mediate association with its membrane-bound receptors and soluble protein ligands. The approaches have included functional site blocking antibodies against C3, together with the identification of the polypeptide segments to which they bind (16Alsenz J. Becherer J.D. Nilsson B. Lambris J.D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immun. 1990; 153: 235-248PubMed Google Scholar, 17Garred P. Mollnes T.E. Kazatchkine M.D. Complement Inflammation. 1989; 6: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the combined use of proteolytic fragments and synthetic peptides derived from C3 as functional mimetics of the intact physiologic fragments (18Lambris J.D. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 387-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,19Fishelson Z. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, once one has a candidate site, xenogeneic sequence comparisons, together with knowledge about whether a particular non-human species of C3b can or cannot interact with the human ligands, can provide additional evidence for the involvement of a particular C3 segment in a binding interaction (20Alsenz J. Avila D. Huemer H.P. Esparza I. Becherer J.D. Kinoshita T. Wang Y. Oppermann S. Lambris J.D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1992; 16: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lambris and co-workers (21Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer D.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar) have in some cases used this information to construct and assess the ligand binding activities of C3 molecules in which a segment of human C3 has either been deleted or replaced with the homologous segment of the non-human ligand-binding xenogeneic species in order to verify a proposed binding site. Ultimately, one can employ site-directed mutagenesis to test further the validity of proposed binding sites, to identify important residues, and in some cases to establish the chemical nature of the side chains that are required for a particular binding reaction (22Taniguchi-Sidle A. Isenman D.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5285-5302PubMed Google Scholar, 23Farries T.C. Napper C.M. Harrison R.A. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 58Google Scholar).All of the above described approaches have implicated the NH2-terminal segment of C3 α′-chain (residues 727–767) as contributing at least one contact site to the interaction of C3b with factor B, factor H, and CR1. In particular, an anti-peptide antibody directed against this segment recognizes a neoepitope in C3b and can block the interaction with factor B, factor H, and CR1 (24Becherer J.D. Alsenz J. Esparza I. Hack C.E. Lambris J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 727–767 peptide can compete with factor H and CR1 for binding to C3b (24Becherer J.D. Alsenz J. Esparza I. Hack C.E. Lambris J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Ganu V.S. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Complement. 1985; 2 (abstr.): 27Google Scholar), and in one study (24Becherer J.D. Alsenz J. Esparza I. Hack C.E. Lambris J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but not the other (25Ganu V.S. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Complement. 1985; 2 (abstr.): 27Google Scholar), was capable of inhibiting the interaction between C3b and factor B. Finally, a recombinant molecule in which the 727–767 segment was deleted lost the ability to interact with all three proteins (21Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer D.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar).Fishelson (19Fishelson Z. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) had analyzed a series of overlapping hexameric and heptameric peptides spanning the 727–767 region for their ability to bind factor B and factor H. The results suggested that the segment730DEDIIAEENI contributed to factor B binding, whereas the segment 744EFPESWLWNVE contributed to the binding of factor H. Site-directed mutagenesis work on intact C3 examined the role of the carboxylate side chains within the 730–739 segment and identified those of glutamic acid residues 736 and 737 as being important not only for the interaction of C3b with factor B but also for the ability of target-bound C3b and iC3b to bind, respectively, to CR1 and CR3 on phagocytes (22Taniguchi-Sidle A. Isenman D.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5285-5302PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with the predictions of the Fishelson work, these mutations did not alter the interaction with human factor H. In the present work, we have extended our previous mutagenesis study on human C3 to cover the remainder of the charged residues in the 727–768 segment, initially with the aim of identifying residues crucial for the interaction with factor H. Since like factor H, CR1 and MCP also act as cofactors for the factor I-mediated cleavages of C3, the same series of mutants were also examined for their ability to interact with soluble forms of CR1 (sCR1) and MCP (sMCP). We have identified Glu-744 and Glu-747 within the predicted “Fishelson” segment as residues whose carboxylate side chains contribute to the interaction with factor H. We have also found that the charged residue contacts with CR1, although partially overlapping with factor H, extend over a much larger portion of the segment. In contrast, none of the mutations examined had any effect on the interaction with MCP.DISCUSSIONAs summarized in Table I, the observations in this study have identified critical residues within the hydrophilic 42 amino acid segment at the NH2 terminus of C3b α′-chain that contribute to the binding interaction with factor H and CR1. In contrast, we were unable to show any defect in the association of MCP with any of mutant proteins examined. With respect to a number of criteria including level of expression, biosynthetic processing, reaction with two conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies and hemolytic activity, the mutant molecules examined can be considered to be native-like with respect to their conformational state. Although the extent of hemolytic activity, which largely reflected the extent to which the C3 convertase cleavage site was affected, ranged from 73 to 46% of wild-type levels, it is important to note that there was no correlation between the extent of the hemolytic defect and whether or not an I cofactor binding site was affected.Table ISummary of cofactor binding activities of mutant C3 molecules examined in this studyRecombinantFactor HsCR1sMCPWild-type+++aActivity relative to wild-type based on disappearance of α-chain in the cofactor-dependent factor I cleavage assay using the indicated cofactor.++++++R742A+++++++++E744EA+++++bNormal with respect to I cofactor activity for the C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) conversion but no cleavage by I of iC3(H2O) to C3dg and a C3c-like molecule.+++E747A++++++K761A+++++++++K767A+++++++++E744A/E747A+++++E754A/D755A+++++++K757A/E758A++++++bNormal with respect to I cofactor activity for the C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) conversion but no cleavage by I of iC3(H2O) to C3dg and a C3c-like molecule.+++E744A/E747A/E754A/D755A+++++E744Q+++++bNormal with respect to I cofactor activity for the C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) conversion but no cleavage by I of iC3(H2O) to C3dg and a C3c-like molecule.+++E747Q++++++D730N/E731Q+++++++++E736Q/E737Q+++++++D730N/E731Q/E736Q/E737Q++±+++The symbols used are: ±, <25%; +, 25–50%; ++, 50–75%; +++, 75–100%.a Activity relative to wild-type based on disappearance of α-chain in the cofactor-dependent factor I cleavage assay using the indicated cofactor.b Normal with respect to I cofactor activity for the C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) conversion but no cleavage by I of iC3(H2O) to C3dg and a C3c-like molecule. Open table in a new tab Although the factor H and CR1 sites of interaction within the 727–767 segment partially overlap, the charged residue contacts required by CR1 extend over a wider portion of the segment than is the case for factor H. In particular, whereas the negatively charged side chains of Glu-744 and Glu-747 appear to be most important for the interaction with factor H, for CR1 there were 3 clusters of charged residues, namely Glu-736/Glu-737, Glu-747, and Glu-754/Asp-755 that had approximately equal effects on the CR1-dependent cleavage of C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) upon replacement of the negative charge by a neutral residue. Additional contacts with Glu-744 and the Lys-757/Glu-758 pair appeared to be required for CR1 to act as a cofactor for the third factor I-mediated cleavage. This additional requirement is reminiscent of previous results using factor H as the I cofactor for the third cleavage. Whereas H is not a cofactor for this cleavage at physiologic ionic strength, it becomes one at low ionic strength (7Ross G.D. Lambris J.D. Cain J.A. Newman S.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2051-2060PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a need for additional contacts facilitated by relatively weak ionic bonds in order to alter either the conformation of iC3b/iC3(H2O) or more likely to position the factor I appropriately to enable the third cleavage of C3 α-chain. The recent observation that factors H and I directly interact with one another (6Soames C.J. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) would be consistent with the latter possibility.The observation that residues Glu-744 and Glu-747 are crucial for the binding of factor H to C3(H2O) is fully consistent with the data of the Fishelson (19Fishelson Z. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) overlapping hexa/heptapeptide study which suggested that C3 residues 744–754 contribute to the binding of factor H. The only other mutant in which the interaction with H appeared to be compromised was the tetra mutant D730N/E731Q/E736Q/E737Q. Since the magnitude of impairment is the same as that seen with either E744Q or E747Q alone, it would suggest that either the contributions of the Asp-730/Glu-731 and Glu-736/Glu-737 charged pairs on their own to the binding of factor H were too small to be detectable in our assay or, more likely, that there is sufficient local conformational distortion caused by the loss of four negative charges over a space of seven amino acids to have had an effect on the nearby segment which now by two independent approaches has been shown to make a measurable contribution to H binding.We believe it noteworthy that all of the mutant proteins for which the I cofactor assay suggested a diminished interaction with either factor H or CR1 had lost at least one negative charge, whereas none of the single positive charge substitutions, representing one-third of the non-overlapping mutations examined, showed any defect. The only ambiguity involves the K757A/E758A mutant which showed resistance to only the third factor I cleavage obtainable with CR1 as the cofactor. It is thus possible that Lys-757 is not involved at all in the interaction with CR1 or that at most it contributes only to the additional cofactor binding site required to mediate the third factor I cleavage. The dominance of negatively charged residues as putative contacts on the C3 side of the interactions with CR1 and factor H, together with the documented ionic strength dependence of these interactions (44DiScipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Arnaout M.A. Dana M. Melamed J. Medicus R. Colten H.R. Immunology. 1983; 48: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggests that ionic bonds to positively charged residues on the cofactor side of the interaction form an essential component of the binding interface. Indeed, with respect to the extensively studied C3b- and C4b-binding sites within human CR1, Krych et al. (11Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8623-8629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) noted that all loss-of-function mutations either resulted from the loss of a positive charge or the addition of a negative charge. These observations are therefore in keeping with the hypothesis that the ionic interface is formed between positively charged residues of CR1 and negatively charged residues contributed by C3b and C4b. Similar point mutagenesis studies of factor H SCR domains have yet to be done. Based upon other known structures of protein-protein interfaces, it is likely that there is also a hydrophobic component to the interactions of C3b with CR1 and factor H (51Young L. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 52Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 53Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Indeed within the peptide segment suggested by the Fishelson study (19Fishelson Z. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to contain a binding site for factor H, there is a fairly hydrophobic stretch of residues, 749WLWNV, some of which may contribute a hydrophobic patch to the binding interfaces for factor H and CR1.Lambris et al. (21Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer D.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar) have examined the contribution of the NH2-terminal α′-chain segment of human C3 to the interactions with factor H, factor B, sCR1, and sMCP, all of human origin, by either deleting most of the segment or by replacing it with the homologous segments from Xenopus and trout C3 and from the C3-related molecule cobra venom factor (CVF). As summarized in Fig.7, these molecules differ in their abilities to bind to the human ligands (20Alsenz J. Avila D. Huemer H.P. Esparza I. Becherer J.D. Kinoshita T. Wang Y. Oppermann S. Lambris J.D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1992; 16: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although it does not necessarily follow that the NH2-terminal α′-chain segment on its own dictates the inter-species compatibilities. The recombinant molecule in which the 727–767 segment was deleted lost the ability to interact with human H, B, and sCR1 but not sMCP (21Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer D.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the conformational integrity caveat about the interpretation of loss-of-function data from a molecule containing a 36-residue deletion, there is general agreement between the major conclusions reached from the deletion study and those from our point mutation study. There are, however, some inconsistencies with respect to the results obtained with the homologous replacement mutants as the only deleterious effects seen were on the third factor I-mediated cleavage with sCR1 as the cofactor. In all other respects, the chimeric molecules displayed wild-type behavior. As a point of reference, a minimum gap alignment of the relevant peptide segments from the various species, along with a denotation of point mutants determined in our study to affect the interaction with human H and sCR1, is shown in Fig. 7. One can easily rationalize the lack of effect of the interaction with factor H of the Hu/Xe chimera, since residues Glu-744 and Glu-747 are conserved inXenopus C3. However, in the case of the Hu/Tr and Hu/CVF chimeras, one of the two crucial acidic residues is replaced by either its isosteric amide (Gln-744 in Tr C3) or a positively charged residue (Lys-747 in CVF), and based on our current findings, these changes would have been expected to decrease the extent of cleavage in the H-cofactor assay. One possible technical reason why this was not seen is that the assay performed by Lambris and colleagues (21Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer D.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar) may not have been performed under limiting conditions of cofactor. We would have also expected compromised CR1-mediated cleavages in the case of the Hu/Tr and Hu/CVF chimeras that were not limited solely to the third factor I cleavage site because of the presence of Lys at residue 747 in the Hu/CVF chimera and the replacement of Glu-754/Asp-755 by a neutral TN pairing in the Hu/Tr chimera. However, in the case of the latter change, the presence of an ED pairing at residues 752 and 753 may compensate for the loss of negative charge at residues 754 and 755. Similarly, it is perhaps not surprising that substitutions of the human Glu-736/Glu-737 pairing in the various chimeric molecules were without effect in the CR1-dependent conversion of C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) because in each case a triplet composed of two negative side chains and one neutral side chain (EEN in human C3) is replaced by a similarly composed triplet (Xe and CVF have DSD and Tr has SED). At least with respect to factor B binding activity, we have previously shown that the human EEN triplet can be replaced by the CVF-like DSD triplet without effect (22Taniguchi-Sidle A. Isenman D.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5285-530"

Termination of RNA transcription in Escherichia coli is mediated by two distinct mechanisms. Intrinsic termination requires only RNA polymerase and specific signals in the DNA template. Factor-dependent termination is mediated by the action of Rho protein (1Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 822-848Google Scholar) with the assistance of NusG (2Sullivan S.L. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 989-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although Rho can act by itself to terminate transcription efficiently in vitro at a number of terminators, an in vivo requirement for NusG has been shown to exist for several terminators. The nature of this intracellular requirement for NusG and the mechanism by which NusG acts to enhance Rho function must be understood to present a clear picture of factor-dependent termination in E. coli. The action of NusG has been examined for several Rho-dependent terminators in vitro (3Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Li J. Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Nehrke K.W. Zalatan F. Platt T. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 119-133PubMed Google Scholar). When reactions are carried out under conditions that are optimized for Rho function, NusG does relatively little. It can enhance the efficiency of termination somewhat and also activate promoter proximal termination stop points that are not normally used by Rho. However, a requirement for NusG in Rho function was identified for the first intragenic terminator in lacZ (tiZ1) when transcription reactions were performed using in vivo concentrations of NTPs which allow RNA polymerase to elongate RNA chains at the in vivo rate (3Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this case, NusG is required to overcome a kinetic limitation to Rho function which is likely to exist in the intracellular environment. However, under these same conditions a second terminator downstream from tiZ1 on that same template, tiZ2, functioned as well in the absence of NusG as in its presence, suggesting that either it is a NusG-independent terminator or its position with respect to the start point of transcription can influence the relative requirement for NusG as a cofactor. Several individual activities of Rho factor are required to achieve termination of RNA transcription (6Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar). Rho must first bind to the RNA. This interaction then activates an ATPase activity that allows the Rho hexamer to track along the RNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction (7Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 8Howard B. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2520-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lowery-Goldhammer C. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and to dissociate the RNA from the transcription complex at a pause site (10Richardson J.P. Conaway R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4293-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,11Shigesada K. Wu C.-W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3355-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each of these steps has a kinetic component that could be affected by NusG. The effects of NusG on many of these steps of Rho action have been measured. NusG does not change the K d of the Rho-RNA binding interaction, the K m for RNA to activate ATPase, the V max of ATP hydrolysis, the concentration of Rho necessary for half-maximal termination, or the rate with which it can dissociate a single-stranded DNA base pairing to the 3′-end of the transcript (the helicase activity) (4Li J. Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Nehrke K.W. Zalatan F. Platt T. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 119-133PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Burns, C. M., Nus Factor Modulation of RNA Chain Elongation and Rho-dependent Transcription Termination in Escherichia coli Ph.D. Dissertation, 1996, 109, 110, Indiana University.Google Scholar). It has been shown to slow the dissociation rate of Rho from nascent RNA from 2 to 5 min (13Nehrke K.W. Platt T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, because RNA polymerase passes through the tiZ1 terminator in about 5 s, it is not clear how such a stabilization of the Rho-RNA interaction might enable termination of rapidly elongating polymerases at tiZ1. The final component activity is the dissociation of RNA from the transcription complex. This has been examined for transcription complexes randomly stopped in the trp t′ terminator region (5Nehrke K.W. Zalatan F. Platt T. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 119-133PubMed Google Scholar). NusG was shown to increase the rate of dissociation of RNA from complexes that were stopped at the promoter proximal termination points, sites at which Rho-dependent termination occurs very slowly, if at all, in the absence of NusG. Thus, this result did not distinguish whether NusG enhances the rate of Rho-mediated RNA release or was simply allowing Rho to act at positions where it normally does not. In this report we investigate further the generality of the requirement for NusG to allow Rho to cause termination of rapidly moving RNA polymerase and the effects of NusG on the rate of transcript release. Specifically, we test the effects of NusG on two terminators,lac tiZ2 and λ tR1, placed at two different positions in transcription units. Our results indicate that both the location of the terminator sequence and the nature of the terminator itself influence greatly the kinetic restraints on Rho function and the requirement for NusG to overcome these restraints. To examine the effects of NusG on the rate of RNA release caused by Rho factor we made use of homogeneously stopped transcription complexes that were positioned at termination stop points within tiZ1 and λ tR1 which were normally used by Rho alone. The results from these assays reveal that Rho can mediate release of RNA from the complex at tR1 much more rapidly than from that at tiZ1 and that NusG enhances the rate of release for both. This action of NusG suggests that its effects on release are what allows it to overcome the kinetic limitations of Rho to function alone at certain terminators. Wild-type Rho, purified as described previously (14Nowatzke W.L. Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P.

The 8,073-bp fragment of pTL61T is missing the lac DNA sequences from −171 to + 277. The region from −171 to +75 was prepared by amplification of pCBZ4 from −178 to +75 with Vent DNA polymerase followed by cleavage withEcoRI, which reduces this segment to −171 to +75. The two fragments were then joined with DNA ligase. pCBZ6 has a deletion of 202 bp in the lacZ DNA from position +76 to +277. base pair(s) pCBC1, a 4,086-bp plasmid, was constructed by insertion of the 751-bpSau3A fragment of pDE13 (22Erie D.A.

Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which contains a C to G change at position 6 of the cro gene, into pIF2 (23Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) cut withBglII. This generates a complete cro gene driven by its natural pR promoter. The C6G change allows preparation of stable ternary transcription complexes (A24 complexes) by transcription in the absence of CTP. pCBC2, a 3,979-bp plasmid, was constructed from pCBC1 by digestion withBglII and AvaI, filling in the ends with Klenow DNA polymerase and recircularization with DNA ligase. It contains a 107-bp deletion in the early region of the cro gene from position +86 to +192. The integrity of the DNA sequence of each plasmid in the transcription template region was confirmed by sequencing the DNA (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The DNA templates used for in vitrotranscription from pCBZ4 and pCBZ6 were prepared by amplification of a segment of the lacZ DNA from (−167 to +839) with Vent DNA polymerase using primers designed to add EcoRI sites to both ends of the product DNA for cloning purposes. Both templates contain the C10T mutation necessary for A16 complex formation as well as the UV5 and L8 promoter mutations. The transcription templates derived from the plasmids pCBC1 and pCBC2 were prepared by digestion of the plasmids with PvuI. This enzyme cuts the DNA downstream from the cro gene (at position 649) and allows examination of all stop points in tR1. Both templates contain the C6G mutation necessary for A24 complex formation. The DNA templates used for the release assays were prepared by amplification of pCBZ4 or pCBC2 with Vent DNA polymerase. The pCBZ4 template is from position −167 to +189 of the lacZ DNA, and the pCBC2 template is from position −188 to +219. In both templates, primer-directed EcoRI sites were added immediately downstream from the gene segments as is required for this experiment. In vitro transcription reactions were carried out using ternary transcription complexes that were stopped by omission of CTP. A16 complexes on lacZtemplates from pCBZ4 and pCBZ6 were prepared as described (3Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A24 complex formation on cro templates from pCBC1 and pCBC2 was carried out by a modification of this procedure. 3 pmol of RNA polymerase was mixed with approximately equal molar amounts of DNA template in transcription buffer (150 mm potassium glutamate, pH 7.8, 40 mm Tris-HOAc, pH 7.8, 4 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.002% acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol) and preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. GTP, UTP, and [α-32P]ATP (350 nCi/pmol) were then added to 4 μm each and the reactions incubated at 16 °C for 10 min. The transcription complexes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300HR columns as described (3Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All enzymes used for transcription studies were diluted in transcription buffer containing 0.012% acetylated bovine serum albumin and 0.12% Nonidet P-40. Termination reactions (20 μl) were done using approximately 5 fmol of isolated complex in transcription buffer. Transcription factors were mixed with transcription complexes on ice and preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C. NTP mixtures were then added to either low (0.2 mm GTP, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.02 mm UTP, 0.2 mm CTP, 4 mm Mg(OAc)2) or high (1.1 mm GTP, 2.7 mm ATP, 1.4 mmUTP, 0.7 mm CTP, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2) concentrations and the reactions incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide and 7m urea gel electrophoresis as described (3Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Quantitation of autoradiograms was done using a Molecular Dynamics scanning densitometer. Ternary transcription complexes were prepared with lacZ (A16 complexes) or cro (A24 complexes) DNA templates containing EcoRI sites. After complex formation, but prior to isolation, EcoRI-Gln111 mutant endonuclease (17Wright D.J. King K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11816-11821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to 400 nm and the reactions incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. NTPs were then added to the low level with 10 μg/ml rifampicin and the reactions incubated an additional 3 min at 37 °C. The EcoRI-stopped complexes were then isolated by gel filtration chromatography.EcoRI-Gln111 acts as a roadblock to stop RNA polymerase 14 bp upstream from the EcoRI binding site (25Pavco P.A. Steege D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9960-9969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of RNA polymerase stopped on the lacZ template was +175, and on the cro template it was +205 (which corresponds to position +312 of wild-type cro). These positions were verified by gel electrophoretic analysis of the RNA from the complex. Release assays were done in transcription buffer at 37 °C. Transcription factors were mixed with the transcription complexes on ice, preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and the reactions started by addition of 1 mm ATP. The 50-μl reactions were stopped after different times by the addition of 500 μl of 0.5 mKCl, 10 μg/ml poly(C), and 10 μg/ml heparin. The reactions were then incubated on ice for 5 min and filtered through BioTrace NT filters. The filters were washed three times with 2 volumes of stop solution. The amount of RNA that remained associated with the transcription complexes was determined by measuring radioactivity with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. To determine the importance of terminator position within a transcription unit on the ability of Rho to act on rapidly moving RNA polymerase, we prepared a derivative of the lacZ DNA template with the segment from bp 76 to bp 276 deleted (Fig. 1). The deleted segment contains the termination stop point region for tiZ1 (bp 140 to bp 229) plus its likely rut sequences. In this derivative, called tiZ2d (in the plasmid pCBZ6), the stop point region of the tiZ2, which normally runs between bp 360 and bp 480, is now between bp 160 and 280 or nearly in the same position as the stop point region of tiZ1 in the normal template (pCBZ4). This was verified by examination of the size distributions of the RNA molecules produced from transcription of the two templates with low NTPs in the presence of Rho (shown in Fig. 2 A). As expected, the addition of NusG under these conditions caused some RNA polymerase molecules to terminate transcription at earlier stop points in the tiZ1 region of pCBZ4 and in similar places in the tiZ2d region of pCBZ6. The overall efficiencies of termination at each terminator, determined by scanning densitometry of the autoradiogram shown in Fig.2 and others like it, are presented in Fig.3 A. The results demonstrate that tiZ2 functions in the absence of tiZ1 and thus confirms that tiZ1 and tiZ2 are distinct terminators.Figure 2Rho-dependent termination on wild-type and deletion templates. RNA transcription reactions were carried out with 50 nm Rho (hexamers) with and without 25 nm NusG, using both the low and high NTP levels as indicated in the figure. The lanes designated Uand C were generated by RNA chain terminating sequence reactions using 3′-dUTP or 3′-dCTP. The sizes of the transcripts were determined from the mobility of RNAs in these sequence lanes.Panel A, transcription of the lacZ DNA templates. pCBZ4 is the wild type, and pCBZ6 is a deletion variant that repositions tiZ2 202 bp closer to the promoter. These reactions were analyzed on a single polyacrylamide gel, but some lanes have been deleted from this figure.

Transcription reactions were done without any addition (open bars), with 50 nm Rho (stippled bars), or with 50 nm Rho plus 25 nm NusG (black bars). RNAs were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated by scanning densitometry. The efficiency of termination is the percent of RNA polymerase molecules that encounter a terminator which terminate at that terminator. tiZ1 and tiZ2 were measured on the pCBZ4 template and tiZ2d from the deletion construct pCBZ6. tR1 was measured on a template from pCBC1 and tR1d from the deletion construct in pCBC2. Panel A, termination with the low NTP condition. Panel B, termination with the high NTP condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The critical test is whether tiZ2 can still function in this new position when transcription is done with high NTPs in the absence of NusG. The results (Figs. 2 A and 3 B) show that virtually no termination occurred at tiZ2d in the pCBZ6 template in the absence of NusG and that only low levels of termination occurred with NusG present. As was found previously, however, Rho by itself terminated transcription in tiZ2 when it was in its normal position (pCBZ4; see Figs. 2 A and 3 B). Hence, deletion of 202 bp upstream of tiZ2 introduced a kinetic limitation to Rho function which was similar to that observed for tiZ1 in the normal template. This suggests that the amount of upstream RNA is an important determinant of the ability of Rho to act alone with rapidly moving RNA polymerase. The results also show that the weak intrinsic terminator located within tiZ2 (26Ruteshouser E.C. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is partially affected by the deletion and by the level of NTPs. This confirms similar observations on the importance of the overall sequence context (27Goliger J.A. Yang X. Guo H.-C. Roberts J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the elongation rate (28McDowell J.C. Roberts J.W. Jin D.J. Gross C.

Biol. 1992; 224: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in the Rho-independent termination process. The λ tR1 terminator is the only terminator to be studied in vitro which has been shown to be NusG-dependentin vivo (2Sullivan S.L. Gottesman M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 989-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been examined at the low NTP level and also at an intermediate NTP level (200 μm each NTP). In neither case was Rho function greatly dependent on NusG (4Li J. Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Washburn R.S. Jin D.J. Stitt B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Martinez A. Burns C. Richardson J.P. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We examined Rho function at tR1 during transcription with the low and high concentrations of NTPs which revealed the kinetic limitation to Rho function at tiZ1. With both NTP levels, Rho functioned very efficiently on its own, and the addition of NusG did not significantly improve the termination efficiency (Fig. 2 B, pCBC1 template, and Fig. 3). Like tiZ2, tR1 has a longer upstream sequence than tiZ1 does (Fig. 1). To determine if this extra upstream DNA was responsible for the ability of Rho to act alone at tR1 with the high NTP level, a deletion variant (referred to as tR1d) lacking residues +86 to +192 was made in which the tR1 stop points are positioned at a distance from the promoter similar to those in tiZ1, while leaving the rutregion (residues 224–380; (30Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) intact (Fig. 1). The ability of Rho to act was not greatly affected by this deletion. The distribution of stop points closely resembled those of the natural tR1 terminator but shifted closer to the promoter by the expected 107 nucleotides (Fig. 2 B). With the low NTP level, termination at tR1 and tR1d was indistinguishable with and without NusG (Fig. 3). With the high NTP level, termination at tR1d was reduced slightly compared with tR1 and was not affected by NusG (Fig. 3). Thus, although position within a transcription unit with its consequent effect on the size of the nascent transcript can influence whether Rho action depends on NusG, other aspects of the terminator also contribute to this requirement. We have shown previously that NusG can partially compensate for a defective Rho factor. F62S Rho is partially defective in vivo but almost completely defective in vitro at tR1, giving only 8% termination with low NTPs. NusG was able to restorein vitro termination to 65%, nearly the in vivoefficiency (18Martinez A. Burns C. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We test here the ability of F62S Rho to terminate transcription at the lacZ intragenic terminators (Figs.4 and 5). The results with the low NTP level closely parallel those for the tR1 terminator in that F62S Rho caused very little termination on its own, but it was able to terminate transcription with moderate efficiency when NusG was also present (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 5Efficiencies of termination by different Rho factors at tiZ1 and tiZ2. The amounts of Rho and NusG used were as described in Fig. 4. Efficiencies were determined as described in Fig.3. Panel A, with low NTP level; panel B, with high NTP level. Open bars, at tiZ1 with Rho alone;gray bars, at tiZ1 with Rho and NusG; stippled bars, at tiZ2 with Rho alone; solid bars, at tiZ2 with Rho and NusG. The extents of termination in the absence of Rho were the same as shown in Fig. 3. For tiZ2, which has a weak intrinsic terminator, those values were the same as with the F62S Rho in the absence of NusG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) F62S Rho did not cause significant termination of transcription at tiZ1 with the high NTP level, even when NusG was present (Figs. 4 and 5). The inability of F62S Rho to terminate at tiZ1 with the high NTP level suggests that the kinetic limitation that exists for wild-type Rho factor is more substantial for F62S Rho because NusG can no longer overcome this limitation. Further, F62S Rho was unable to cause any increase of termination above the intrinsic levels at tiZ2 (Figs. 4 and5) or any termination at all at tR1 (not shown) with the high NTP level, even with NusG present. This was not expected as wild-type Rho was able to act at these terminators as efficiently with high NTPs as with low NTPs. This suggests that the rate of chain elongation imposes limitations on Rho action at all terminators but that wild-type Rho can normally overcome these limitations on its own for many terminators. The Rho factor from M. luteus is unusual. It terminates with higher efficiency and at more promoter proximal positions than E. coli Rho at tR1 (19Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have examined the ability of this Rho and a deletion variant that behaves more like E. coli Rho (20Nowatzke W.L. Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to terminate at the lacZ intragenic terminators. The wild-type M. luteus Rho terminated transcription at tiZ1 with near 100% efficiency at both the low and high NTP levels and was only slightly affected by NusG (not shown). The deletion variantM. luteus des(60–300) Rho factor behaved very similarly to the E. coli Rho protein during transcription of thelacZ template with E. coli RNA polymerase. The positions of the stop points were similar to those caused by E. coli Rho, although some earlier points were also observed (Fig.4). Using the low NTP level, this Rho factor terminated transcription with very high efficiency (>90%) at both tiZ1 and tiZ2 (Fig. 5). With the high NTP level, the efficiency of termination was somewhat lower at both terminators. Termination efficiency at tiZ2 was similar to that with E. coli Rho (about 60%). However, the efficiency of termination at tiZ1 was very different from that caused by E. coli Rho (Fig. 5). At this terminator, the deletion variant of M. luteus Rho terminated transcription on its own with high efficiency (about 50%). This efficiency was enhanced by NusG to about 70%. These results suggest that the kinetic limitation of E. coli Rho to cause termination at tiZ1 does not exist for M. luteus des(60–300) Rho and also that E. coli NusG can activate the termination activity of a heterologous Rho factor. Because NusG allows Rho to function within a kinetic window that is too short for the action of Rho alone, NusG likely affects the rate of Rho action to allow termination of rapidly elongating polymerase. To determine if NusG changes the rate of Rho-mediated dissociation of RNA from transcription complexes, RNA release assays were done using transcription complexes in which RNA polymerase had been elongated to position 175 on th"

Here we have examined the functional roles of domains of the yeast pore membrane protein Pom152p in establishing its topology and its interactions with other NPC proteins. The topology of Pom152p was evaluated by alkaline extraction, protease protection, and endoglycosidase H sensitivity assays. The results of these experiments suggest that Pom152p contains a single transmembrane segment with its N terminus (amino acid residues 1–175) extending into the nuclear pore and its C terminus (amino acid residues 196–1337) positioned in the lumen of the nuclear envelope. The functional role of these different domains was investigated in mutants that are dependent on Pom152p for viability. The requirement for Pom152p in strains containing mutations allelic to the NPC protein genes NIC96and NUP59 could be alleviated by Pom152p's N terminus, independent of its integration into the membrane. However, complementation of a mutation in NUP170 required both the N terminus and the transmembrane segment. Furthermore, mutations inNUP188 were rescued only by full-length Pom152p, suggesting that the lumenal structures play an important role in the function of pore-side NPC structures.

These massive structures extend across the nuclear envelope (NE) and are bound to the pore membrane domain (see Refs. 1Fabre E. Hurt E. Annu. Rev.

Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins associated with the NPC are speculated to play an important role in the molecular organization of the NPC and its biogenesis. In metazoan cells, two pore membrane proteins have been identified and characterized: gp210 and Pom121p (4Gerace L. Ottaviano Y. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 5Wozniak R.W. Bartnik E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Hallberg E.

Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). An important step in evaluating the function of these proteins and their interactions with other components of the NPC has been the determination of their topology within the pore membrane domain. Both gp210 and Pom121p have been proposed to be type I integral membrane proteins, i.e.they contain a single transmembrane segment with their N terminus positioned in the lumen of the NE and their C terminus located within the nuclear pore in a position to directly interact with other NPC proteins (termed nucleoporins; Refs. 5Wozniak R.W.

A marked difference between these two proteins is the size of their lumenal and pore-side domains. Whereas most of the mass of gp210 is positioned in the lumen of the NE (5Wozniak R.W. Bartnik E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Greber U.F. Senior A. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the majority of Pom121p is on the pore side of the membrane, including a region containing repetitive sequences of the type FXFG also found in a subset of nucleoporins (6Hallberg E.

It has been proposed that after their integration into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, these proteins laterally diffuse through the lipid bilayer to their destination within the pore membrane (10Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For gp210, the transmembrane segment is the dominant sorting determinant for its targeting to the pore membrane (10Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Its short cytoplasmic tail, however, also appears to contain sorting information. Although directing its integration into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane system, the transmembrane segment of Pom121p does not act as a pore membrane sorting determinant. Instead, the sorting signal is present in the pore-exposed portion of Pom121p (11Söderqvist H. Imreh G. Kihlmark M. Linnman C. Ringertz N. Hallberg E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whereas several nucleoporins found in vertebrates have homologues in yeast, neither gp210 nor Pom121p shares any significant sequence similarity with open reading frames present in the yeast genome. However, we have recently identified an integral pore membrane protein in yeast termed Pom152p (12Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It represents one of the most abundant proteins in the highly enriched yeast NPC fraction. Surprisingly, a yeast strain lacking the POM152 gene is viable, suggesting that Pom152p might be a member of a group of functionally overlapping proteins. This phenotype was utilized in genetic screens to identify a number of genetically interacting nucleoporins including Nup170p (13Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Marelli M. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), Nup188p (14Nehrbass U. Rout M.P. Maguire S. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J.

Like Pom152p, each of these proteins is an abundant constituent of the yeast NPC. Their abundance has led us to hypothesize that they are components of the repetitive substructures that form the 8-fold symmetrical core of the NPC (15Zabel U. Doye V. Tekotte H. Wepf R. Grandi P. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the functional basis for the observed genetic interactions between Pom152p and these nucleoporins remains unclear. In a continuing effort to understand the function of Pom152p, we have conducted a series of experiments aimed at defining its topology in the pore membrane and examining functional interactions between its different domains and several of the abundant nucleoporins. Our data demonstrate that Pom152p is a type II integral membrane protein with its N-terminal domain positioned on the pore side of the membrane and its C terminus located within the lumen of the NE. With this information, we tested a series of deletion mutations to identify regions of Pom152p that are capable of rescuing the viability of strains containing mutations allelic to NUP170,NIC96, NUP188, and NUP59. Although the N terminus in each case is necessary to rescue the mutants examined, differing requirements exist for the transmembrane segment and the lumenal domain.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the isolation of crude nuclei, we used the following mini-scale procedure. Cells were grown in the appropriate media to mid-log phase. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Cells were harvested from a 100-ml culture (∼1–2 × 109 cells) and washed two times with water and two times with 1.1 msorbitol. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of 1.1 msorbitol. To digest the cell wall, 40 μl of glusulase (DuPont) and 10 μl of 1% zymolyase (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) were added, and the cells were incubated for 2–3 h at 30 °C with occasional shaking. After digestion, spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation (5,000 ×g for 20 min), washed one time with 1.1 msorbitol, and resuspended in 800 μl of 1.1 m sorbitol. This cell suspension was then layered over a cushion of 7.5% Ficoll 400 in 1.1 m sorbitol and then sedimented at 5,000 ×g for 20 min. Spheroplasts were then resuspended in 1 ml of 8% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5, (PVP medium) containing 1% of solution P (0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.4 mg/ml pepstatin A (Boehringer Mannheim)) and lysed with a Polytron (4 × 30 s). 1 ml of 0.6 msucrose in PVP medium containing solution P was then added, and nuclei were sedimented at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing crude nuclei was resuspended in 500 μl of 1.5m sucrose, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5. This procedure typically yielded ∼1 mg of crude nuclei. 100 μl of yeast crude nuclei (∼100–200 μg of protein) were diluted with 400 μl of BTM buffer (10 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 0.1 mmMgCl2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 500 μl of 40 mm NaOH, pH 12.0, were added and incubated on ice for 20 min. Extracted proteins were separated from the membrane fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). This precipitate and the membrane pellet were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Yeast NE (or nuclei) containing Pom152p-HA or the p170-1337-HA deletion variant were diluted in BTM buffer and sedimented through a sucrose cushion (1 msucrose in BTM buffer) at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in BTM buffer and divided into equal aliquots. These aliquots were incubated with different concentrations of trypsin (from 0 to 500 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1% of Triton X-100 for 20 min at 0 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (to 10%) or solution P (to 1%) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim). To examine the membrane association of protease protected fragments of Pom152p, the membranes were sedimented through a sucrose cushion (1 msucrose in BTM buffer) at 100,000 × g for 15 min after trypsin digestion and the addition of trypsin inhibitors. The pellet was then washed with BTM buffer, and alkaline was extracted as described above. Crude yeast nuclei (∼100 μg of total protein) were washed several times with BTM buffer and then resuspended in endoglycosidase H (Endo H) buffer (50 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Samples were incubated at 75 °C for 20 min to denature proteins and solubilize membranes. 5 milliunits of Endo H (Boehringer Mannheim) or a mock solution as a control and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm were added. Samples were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Proteins in the reaction mixtures were then recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham). Antibody incubations using the monoclonal antibodies mAb 12CA5 and mAb118C3 and subsequent washes were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20. Binding was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham). For the Western blot analysis of total cell lysates, cells from liquid cultures were collected by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 2m NaOH containing 8% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated on ice for 10 min. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, sonicated, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A series of POM152 deletion mutations were constructed to examine the functions of different domains of Pom152p. Schematic representations of these deletions are shown in Fig.1. The majority of these constructs contain two tandem repeats of an epitope derived from the HA antigen inserted after amino acid residue 295 (12Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody mAb 12CA5. Plasmids containing POM152-HAand the different deletion variants were introduced into apom152-null strain (PMY17). Synthesis of the encoded proteins was evaluated by Western blotting of total cell extracts using mAb 12CA5 (Fig. 2 A). With the exception of the p1-1219 construction, which lacks the HA tag, each of the deletion variants was detected with mAb 12CA5 and was visible migrating at an apparent molecular mass near that predicted by their sequence. Using these deletion variants, we have mapped by Western blotting the region of Pom152p that is recognized by mAb118C3 (Fig. 2 B), a previously identified monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to Pom152p (21Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We observed that C-terminal truncations as short as 118 amino acid residues (including p1-1219 and p1-1025-HA) abolished mAb118C3 binding (Fig. 2 B). Conversely, all deletion constructions that contained the last 301 amino acid residues of Pom152p (including p170-1337-HA, pΔ176-263-HA, and pΔ295-1036) bound to mAb118C3, suggesting that this antibody binds to an epitope within this region. Moreover, taking into account that variant p1-1219 is functionally expressed in yeast (see the complementation data below), it is likely that the epitope for mAb118C3 is located within the last 118 amino acid residues of Pom152p. On the basis of its primary structure, we previously proposed that Pom152p is a type II integral membrane protein containing a single transmembrane segment (TMS) with a pore-side N-terminal domain and a lumenal C-terminal segment (12Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, this and other plausible models have not been experimentally tested. As a first step in defining its topology, we have attempted to identify the region(s) of Pom152p that acts as a transmembrane segment(s). Hydropathy analysis of Pom152p (Fig.3 A) revealed two hydrophobic regions of sufficient length to serve as TMSs extending from amino acid residues 111–131 and 176–195. To test the ability of each of these regions to act as a membrane anchor, alkaline extraction experiments were performed on crude nuclear fractions isolated from yeast expressing deletion constructions of POM152 encoding one or both of the potential TMSs. Consistent with previous results (12Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), full-length Pom152p was resistant to extraction and was quantitatively present in the membrane pellet, whereas peripheral nucleoporins, including Nup116p, were extracted (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, a truncated form of Pom152p containing the N terminus and both of the potential TMSs, p1-301-HA, was resistant to alkaline extraction and remained associated with the membrane. However, the ability of Pom152p to integrate into the membrane was dependent on the 176–195 segment alone. A deletion construct lacking the 111–131 segment and containing the 176–195 segment (p170-1337-HA) was resistant to alkaline extraction. Conversely, a deletion mutant lacking the 176–195 segment and containing the 111–131 segment was quantitatively extracted from the membrane (pΔ176-263-HA; Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that Pom152p contains a single TMS. We therefore concluded that the molecule is divided into three segments: (a) an N-terminal segment (consisting of amino acid residues 1–175), (b) a TMS (amino acid residues 176–195), and (c) a long, C-terminal segment (amino acid residues 196–1337). The presence of a single membrane anchoring domain suggested four possible orientations for Pom152p in the membrane (Fig.4). Models I and II represent a situation in which the hydrophobic segment crosses the membrane, whereas in models III and IV the anchoring domain loops into the membrane. To assess the topology of Pom152p, we performed limited protease digestion experiments of NEs containing Pom152p-HA. We predicted that the cisternal domain of Pom152p should be largely protected by the nuclear membrane, whereas a cytoplasmic, pore-exposed segment would be accessible to the protease and would be at least partially degraded. As shown in Fig. 5, the digestion of intact NEs with trypsin produced a fragment of Pom152p-HA with an apparent molecular mass ∼7 kDa less than that of the wild-type protein (termed Pom152p-7). The Pom152p-7 fragment was largely resistant to proteolysis at various concentrations of trypsin, and it was recognized by both mAb 12CA5 and mAb118C3. Because these antibodies bind epitopes that lie near opposite ends of the C-terminal segment, it is likely that Pom152p-7 contains the majority, if not all, of this segment. Under similar conditions, the nucleoporins Nup53p and Nup188p were rapidly degraded (data not shown). The Pom152p-7 fragment, however, was quickly degraded in the presence of Triton X-100. In this case, several distinct fragments were detected with mAb 12CA5 and mAb118C3, suggesting that the C terminus was now accessible to the protease. To a far lesser degree, these smaller fragments were also present in intact NEs treated with high concentrations of trypsin (50 and 500 μg/ml). This likely reflects the accessibility of the protease to the perinuclear cisterna in unsealed NEs. To further evaluate whether the Pom152p-7 fragment is the result of a cleavage at the N terminus or the C terminus, we performed similar trypsin digestion experiments on nuclear fractions isolated from cells expressing Pom152p-HA or a deletion variant lacking the N terminus (p170-1337-HA). As shown in Fig.6 A, the molecular mass of p170-1337-HA was unaffected by trypsin treatment, whereas full-length Pom152p was cleaved to the Pom152p-7 form. These results demonstrate that the cleavage that generates Pom152p-7 occurs at the N terminus and that the TMS and the C terminus are protected. Interestingly, the protease-resistant Pom152p-7 truncation migrated more slowly than the p170-1337-HA deletion, suggesting that the Pom152–7 fragment contains a portion of the N terminus. On the basis of these results, we would predict that Pom152p-7 is anchored to the membrane. To test this, alkaline extractions were performed on NEs after treatment with a high concentration of trypsin (100 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 6 B, Pom152p-7 was present within the pellet fraction, suggesting that it was anchored to the membrane. Similarly, smaller fragments recognized by mAb 12CA5 were also bound to the membrane, which is consistent with the location of the HA epitope near the TMS. The results of the experiments described above are consistent with a model for the topology of Pom152p in which the N terminus is located on the pore side of the membrane and the C terminus is positioned in the lumen of the NE (Fig. 4, II). However, we could not exclude the possibility that the C-terminal segment is positioned at the pore side of the membrane and is highly protected from proteolysis by other NPC proteins (Fig. 4, IV). Two observations argue against this model: (a) Pom152p binds concanavalin A, suggesting that it is glycosylated (12Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); and (b) concanavalin A binding to Pom152p can be abolished by treatment with endoglycosidase H (data not shown). The specificity of this enzyme for oligosaccharide modifications made in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum/NE suggests that in fact a domain of Pom152p lies within the NE lumen. To clearly establish that the C-terminal segment is glycosylated, Endo H treatment was performed on Pom152p-HA- and p170-1337-HA-containing nuclear fractions. The presence of N-linked oligosaccharides was assessed by a change in the molecular mass of the proteins after Endo H digestion. As shown in Fig. 7, Endo H treatment reduced the molecular masses of both Pom152p-HA and p170-1337-HA by ∼7 kDa. This reduction in mass corresponds to the elimination of three to four polysaccharide chains from theN-glycosylation sites. This is in agreement with the number of potential sites (four) in the C-terminal region. These results confirm that the C-terminal segment is N-glycosylated and is localized in the lumen. Finally, in similar experiments performed with a Pom152p mutant lacking the TMS (pΔ176-263-HA; Fig. 7), Endo H treatment had no effect on the protein's mass, suggesting that the TMS is necessary for translocation of the C-terminal segment into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum/NE (Fig. 7). Together, these data demonstrate that Pom152p is a type II integral membrane protein. We have previously identified a battery of mutants allelic to the nucleoporin genes NUP59, NUP170,NUP188, and NIC96, which are dependent on the presence of Pom152p for their viability (13Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Marelli M. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Nehrbass U. Rout M.P. Maguire S. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J.

This may reflect the ability of Pom152p to perform a function similar to these nucleoporins and/or stabilize structures effected by various nucleoporin mutations. To determine what regions of Pom152p are required to complement these various mutants, different deletion constructions were tested for their ability to replace wild-type Pom152p. Because each of the mutant strains is dependent on aURA3-containing plasmid, pCH1122-POM152 (URA3), they fail to grow on 5-FOA-containing plates (13Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Marelli M. Blobel G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Functional complementation of these mutants by various truncated forms of Pom152p was scored by their ability to rescue growth on 5-FOA-containing plates. The results of these experiments are summarized in TableII. As previously shown (13Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Marelli M. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Nehrbass U. Rout M.P. Maguire S. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1813-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), all of these mutants could be complemented by wild-type Pom152p (pPom152p). In addition, strains containing the mutant alleles nic96-7(psl7), nup170-21 (psl21), and nup59-40 (psl40) were each rescued by all deletion variants containing the N terminus and the TMS (amino acids residues 1–301), suggesting that this region is sufficient for complementation. The TMS region, however, was not strictly required to complement psl7 (nic96-7) and psl40 (nup59-40) because the construct pΔ176-263, which lacks the TMS but contains the N terminus, also rescued growth on 5-FOA-containing media. However, in the absence of the TMS, the majority of the C-terminal domain was required, because deletions in this segment (p1025 and p424) abolished complementation of psl7 and psl40. For the complementation of the psl21 (nup170-21) mutant, the N terminus and the TMS were both necessary and sufficient. Surprisingly, strains containing mutations allelic to NUP188(psl4 and psl44) were rescued only by full-length POM152. Although capable of complementing other psl mutants, all deletions of the C terminus that we tested failed to complement psl4 and psl44. These results suggest an important role for the lumenally disposed C-terminal domain.Table IIComplementation of psl mutants with pom152 deletions mutantsPlasmidAlleles (psl mutant)nic96–7 (psl7)nup170–21(psl21)nup59–40(psl40)nup188–4(psl4)nup188–44 (psl44)pRS315 alone−−−−−pPom152p+++++p1–1219+++−−p1–1025+++−−p1–424+++−−p1–301+++−−p170–301−−−−−p170–1337−−−−−pΔ176–263+−+−−pΔ295–1036+++−−p1025−−−−−p424−−−−−The plasmid pRS315 alone or containing the indicated constructs was introduced into various POM152 synthetic lethal mutants.

The resulting strains were then tested for growth on 5-FOA-containing plates at 30 °C. A plus sign indicates growth, and a minus sign no growth. The data presented in this study provide experimental evidence for the topology of Pom152p. In addition, we have used this information to identify functional domains of Pom152p that are necessary for its genetic interactions with other NPC proteins. Using Pom152p and various deletion constructs in combination with alkaline extraction, protease protection, and endoglycosidase H assays, we have demonstrated that Pom152p is a type II integral membrane protein with its N-terminal 175 amino acid residues positioned within the nuclear pore and its C-terminal 1141 amino acid residues located within the lumen of the NE. Pom152p is anchored to the membrane by a single TMS extending from amino acid residues 176–195. This segment is both necessary and sufficient for its attachment to the membrane. Adjacent to the TMS, two positively charged amino acid residues are positioned on its N-terminal side, and two negatively charged amino acid residues flank the C-terminal side. This charge distribution flanking the TMS is similar to that observed in other type II membrane proteins and has been used as a tool for predicting membrane protein topology (22Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19101-19109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kim H. Paul S. Jennity J. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As is the case for other type II membrane proteins, Pom152p does not contain a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence for integration into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (12Wozniak R.W. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, the TMS of Pom152p is likely to function both as a signal sequence and as a stop-transfer sequence to integrate the protein into the membrane. Our data showing that all of the constructs containing the TMS are integrated into the membrane support this idea. Moreover, if a small region containing the TMS is deleted, the remainder of the protein (pΔ176-263-HA) is no longer resistant to alkaline extraction, and the C-terminal segment is not glycosylated (Figs. 3 and 7). The N-terminal 175 amino acid residues of Pom152p are located on the pore side of the nuclear envelope membrane. This region is thus positioned to directly interact with nucleoporins that compose the core domain of the NPC. These are likely to include a subset of the abundant nucleoporins that have been localized to the NPC core including Nup188p, Nup170p, Nup157p, and Nic96p (13Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Marelli M. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1133-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Nehrbass U. Rout M.P. Maguire S. Blobel G. Wozniak R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, in mutants that are allelic to the NUP59,NUP170, NUP188, and NIC96 genes and require Pom152p for viability, the N terminus of Pom152p is uniformly required for complementation. Interestingly, we observed that the N-terminal truncation of Pom152p that is resistant to trypsin (Pom152p-7) migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mass larger than a deletion mutant lacking the N terminus (p170-1337-HA). This result can not be explained by the positioning of trypsin cleavage sites (data not shown). Instead, it is likely due to the partial protection of the N terminus, perhaps by its association with other NPC proteins or the periphery of the pore membrane. Whereas the N terminus was necessary for the complementation of all of the POM152 synthetic lethal mutants that we examined, the requirements for the TMS and the lumenally disposed C-terminal segment were dependent on the particular nucleoporin mutants examined. For example, the complementation of the nic96-7 andnup59-40 mutant alleles required the N terminus in combination with either the TMS or the complete C-terminal segment. The necessity for either of these two segments suggests that they can act indirectly to sequester two or more N-terminal segments in a conformation that is capable of binding nucleoporins. For wild-type Pom152p, the spatial orientation of N termini may be established by lateral interactions between adjacent TMSs (either homotypic or heterotypic) and the C-terminal segments of neighboring Pom152p molecules. By comparison, the complementation of thenup170-21 mutant strictly required both the N terminus and the TMS, suggesting that integration into the membrane is essential for rescuing this mutant. Such varying requirements for the context in which the N terminus is presented may reflect the involvement of Pom152p in different stages of NPC biogenesis. It is likely that the large lumenal domain of Pom152p (∼85% of the molecule) contributes a significant amount of mass to NPC structures located in the lumen of the NE. In this regard, it is similar to the mammalian pore membrane protein gp210 (5Wozniak R.W. Bartnik E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Greber U.F. Senior A. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which has 95% of its mass positioned on the lumenal side of the membrane. This region of gp210 likely contributes to lumenal structures such as the lumenal spokes or radial arms, and it has been proposed that this region plays a role in pore formation and the maintenance of NPC structure (5Wozniak R.W. Bartnik E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Greber U.F. Senior A. Gerace L.

Moreover, antibodies to the lumenal domain of gp210 partially inhibit nuclear import of classical nuclear localization signal-containing substrates (25Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the complementation of mutants allelic to NUP188 requires full-length Pom152p including the lumenally disposed C-terminal segment. Even a deletion as short as 118 amino acid residues from the C terminus abolishes complementation. These results further underscore the importance of the lumenal region of Pom152p in the function of its N terminus. Moreover, they represent a functional link between structures located within the lumen of the NE and those positioned on the pore side of the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2036126626,"We have investigated interstitial deletions of chromosome 8 in 70 colorectal carcinomas and 11 colonic adenomas using 11 microsatellite markers, including eight spanning the centromeric region of chromosome 8p (p11.2-p12). Allelic loss or imbalance was observed in 38 (54%) cancers and four (36%) adenomas. Twenty-eight (40%) of the cancers had deletions of 8p11.2-p12. Two distinct and independent regions of interstitial loss were found within this region. Fluorescent in situ hybridization, using an alpha satellite repeat probe to the centromere of 8p and two probes to the P1 region, was performed in four tumours that demonstrated allelic imbalance. Localized heterozygous deletions were confirmed in all four tumours. Eleven (16%) cancers had localized deletion in the region ANK-1 to D8S255 (P1) and a further eleven (16%) cancers had a less well localized deletion in the region defined by the markers D8S87 to D8S259 (P2). Loss of both centromeric loci was identified in a further six (9%) tumours. A functional significance for these two deletion regions was sought by correlation with primary and secondary tumour characteristics. Isolated P2 deletion was associated with 'early' T1 cancers (2p=0.0002), and were also identified in 3/11 adenomas. Conversely, interstitial deletions of the P1 locus were more frequently seen in 'locally invasive' T3/4 cancers (2p=0.015), and isolated P1 deletions were also associated with the presence of liver metastases (2p=0.016). Our data provide evidence of at least two genes within the 8p11.2-p12 region, mutations in which may confer different and independent roles in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2159322132,"The Cbl proto-oncogene product is a complex adapter protein that functions as a negative regulator of protein tyrosine kinases. It is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with Crk(L) and p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) upon engagement of numerous receptors linked to tyrosine kinases. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) underlying Cbl deregulation is therefore of considerable interest. The 70Z Cbl oncoprotein shows increased baseline tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts and enhances nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity in Jurkat T cells. Its transforming ability has been proposed to relate to its increased phosphotyrosine content. We demonstrate that 70Z Cbl shows increased basal and activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Crk(L) and p85 PI3K in Jurkat T cells. 70Z Cbl, however, retains the ability to enhance NFAT and activating protein 1 (AP1) activity in the absence of Crk(L)/p85 PI3K association. In contrast, the G306E mutation, which inactivates the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Cbl, blocks NFAT/AP1 activation by 70Z Cbl. We conclude that 70Z Cbl-induced NFAT/AP1 activation requires the phosphotyrosine binding domain but not Crk(L)/p85 PI3K association. We hypothesize that 70Z Cbl acts as a dominant negative by blocking the negative regulatory function of the Cbl phosphotyrosine binding domain on protein-tyrosine kinases. The Cbl proto-oncogene product is a complex adapter protein that functions as a negative regulator of protein tyrosine kinases. It is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with Crk(L) and p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) upon engagement of numerous receptors linked to tyrosine kinases. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) underlying Cbl deregulation is therefore of considerable interest. The 70Z Cbl oncoprotein shows increased baseline tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts and enhances nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity in Jurkat T cells. Its transforming ability has been proposed to relate to its increased phosphotyrosine content. We demonstrate that 70Z Cbl shows increased basal and activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Crk(L) and p85 PI3K in Jurkat T cells. 70Z Cbl, however, retains the ability to enhance NFAT and activating protein 1 (AP1) activity in the absence of Crk(L)/p85 PI3K association. In contrast, the G306E mutation, which inactivates the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Cbl, blocks NFAT/AP1 activation by 70Z Cbl. We conclude that 70Z Cbl-induced NFAT/AP1 activation requires the phosphotyrosine binding domain but not Crk(L)/p85 PI3K association. We hypothesize that 70Z Cbl acts as a dominant negative by blocking the negative regulatory function of the Cbl phosphotyrosine binding domain on protein-tyrosine kinases. The proto-oncogene product c-Cbl is a ubiquitously expressed complex adapter protein that associates with numerous signaling molecules in a variety of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 1Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 359-379Crossref Google Scholar). It was originally identified as a viral oncogene product (v-Cbl) that causes B-lymphomas and myeloid leukemias in mice (2Langdon W.Y.

Cloning of its cellular homolog revealed that c-Cbl is a 906 amino acid protein that lacks any obvious catalytic domain (3Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y.

Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).Cbl is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to engagement of numerous receptors that activate protein-tyrosine kinases, including immunoreceptors, receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, hematopoietic growth factor receptors, and integrins, as well as oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl associates with the SH2 domains of the adapter proteins Crk(L) and/or p85 PI3K upon engagement of many of these receptors (reviewed in Ref. 1Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 359-379Crossref Google Scholar). Similar to Grb2, Crk family adapter proteins are composed almost exclusively of SH2 and SH3 domains. CrkI and CrkII are alternatively spliced products of a single gene that contain a N-terminal SH2 domain followed by one or two SH3 domains, respectively (13Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). CrkL is the product of a different gene; it has a structural organization similar to CrkII (14ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that Crk(L) proteins may promote transformation, either when expressed as truncated isoforms or when overexpressed (13Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 15Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3581-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Senechal K.

Moreover, a multimolecular complex of Abl, CrkL, Cbl, and, possibly, p85 PI3K has been postulated to mediate, at least in part, the transforming ability of oncogenic Abl (16Senechal K. Halpern J.

Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1 (21Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y.

Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In various model systems, overexpression of Rap1 can antagonize Ras signaling, presumably through competitive inhibition of Ras-GTP binding to downstream effector molecules (Ref. 23Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, it is possible that the interaction of Cbl with Crk(L) regulates Ras signaling through C3G and Rap1 and that Cbl serves as a docking protein to recruit the Crk(L)-C3G complex (24Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Druker B.J. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This is analogous to the well described role of activated receptor tyrosine kinases, which recruit the Grb2-Sos complex to the plasma membrane to activate membrane-bound Ras (25van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the functional significance of the Cbl-Crk(L)/p85 PI3K interaction for normal as well as oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways is therefore of considerable interest.Several lines of evidence indicate that Cbl functions as a negative regulator of protein-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. First, in the flatworm C. elegans, the G315E loss-of-function allele of Sli-1 rescues vulval development induced by a reduction-of-function allele of the Let23 epidermal growth factor receptor homolog (12Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Second, in D. melanogaster, overexpression of D-Cbl in transgenic flies inhibits the sevenless protein-tyrosine kinase-induced development of the R7 photoreceptor neuron (11Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, in RBL 2H3 mast cells, overexpression of mammalian Cbl inhibits FcεRI-induced Syk-tyrosine kinase activity and serotonin release (26Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Given the strong evolutionary conservation of the N-terminal half of the Cbl protein and the observation that the Cbl G306E mutation, which corresponds to the Sli-1 G315E loss-of-function mutation, inactivates its PTB domain (4Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), it is possible that the negative regulation of protein-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways by mammalian Cbl requires direct interaction of its PTB domain with protein-tyrosine kinases.Several oncogenic variants of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene product have been identified. The c/v-Cbl oncoprotein (also referred to as Cbl-N) consists of the N-terminal 357 amino acids of the c-Cbl protein, which includes the PTB domain (2Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of the G306E mutation into c/v-Cbl blocks its association with activated (receptor) tyrosine kinases in vivo (5Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as its transforming activity in vitro (27Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that transformation caused by overexpression of c/v-Cbl results from competitive inhibition of endogenous Cbl binding to phosphotyrosine residues on activated protein-tyrosine kinases, thereby blocking the negative regulatory role of Cbl on tyrosine kinases (27Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the oncogenic 70Z Cbl mutant protein, which contains a 17-amino acid internal deletion including the N-terminal cysteine residue of the Ring finger, shows increased baseline tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts (28Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and enhances NFAT transcription in Jurkat T cells (31Liu Y.C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we tested two alternative models that have been suggested to explain 70Z Cbl-mediated transformation and activation of NFAT in Jurkat T cells. In the first model, 70Z Cbl acts through increased tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Crk(L) and p85 PI3K adapter proteins, which may lead to deregulation of Rap1 and, perhaps, Ras activation. In the second model, 70Z Cbl acts through its PTB domain, possibly to competitively inhibit the PTB domain dependent regulatory function of endogenous Cbl on protein-tyrosine kinases. Our study demonstrates that 70Z Cbl-induced NFAT/AP1 activation requires an intact PTB domain but not Crk(L) or p85 PI3K interaction. Our findings are most consistent with the possibility that 70Z Cbl acts as a dominant negative to inhibit the negative regulatory role of endogenous Cbl on protein-tyrosine kinases.DISCUSSIONThe Cbl proto-oncogene product is a ubiquitously expressed complex adapter protein that functions as a negative regulator of protein-tyrosine kinases (1Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 359-379Crossref Google Scholar, 11Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell.

Cbl is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with Crk(L) and p85 PI3K adapter proteins upon engagement of numerous protein-tyrosine kinase-linked receptors in a variety of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 1Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 359-379Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 70Z Cbl oncoprotein shows increased tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts (28Bonita D.P. Miyake S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and this study), but the molecular mechanisms underlying 70Z Cbl-induced NFAT activation and transformation have not been previously identified. Here we demonstrate that 70Z Cbl shows increased basal and CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to increased association with Crk(L) and p85 PI3K adapter proteins in Jurkat T cells. However, disruption of Crk(L) and p85 PI3K association with oncogenic 70Z Cbl did not block NFAT and AP1 activation. In contrast, 70Z Cbl-induced NFAT/AP1 activation was completely blocked by the G306E mutation, indicating that 70Z Cbl requires an intact PTB domain for NFAT/AP1 activation in Jurkat T cells.Our studies confirm the previous finding (31Liu Y.C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that oncogenic 70Z Cbl but not wt or c/v-Cbl activates NFAT and further extends these findings to show that 70Z Cbl also enhances AP1 activity. Our study differs from that of Liu et al. (31Liu Y.C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in that we did not detect cooperation of 70Z Cbl with ionomycin to induce NFAT activation, even when Jurkat T cells were stimulated after serum starvation or when using lower concentrations of ionomycin (data not shown). We also did not confirm the data from Rellahan et al. (40Rellahan B.L. Graham L.J. Stoica B. DeBell K.E. Bonvini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30806-30811Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), who reported a 3-fold reduction in AP1-mediated reporter activity in cells overexpressing Cbl relative to the vector control. The cause of the discrepancies between our study and these other studies is not clear at present, but we note that we used PMA plus ionomycin stimulation as an internal control to normalize for reporter gene activity between different groups of transfected cells.The 70Z Cbl oncoprotein shows increased baseline tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts (28Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and, as demonstrated in this study, in Jurkat T cells. However, the tyrosine residues in 70Z Cbl that undergo increased phosphorylation relative to wt Cbl have not been identified thus far. In vitro studies have previously identified Tyr(P)-774 and Tyr(P)-731 in wt Cbl as binding sites for the SH2 domains of Crk and p85 PI3K, respectively (24Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G.

Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 110-116PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo studies have demonstrated a role for both Tyr(P)-700 and Tyr(P)-774 in CrkL binding in Abl transformed cells (33Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar) and for Tyr(P)-731 in p85 PI3K binding (31Liu Y.C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37Ueno H. Sasaki K. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 91: 46-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have confirmed and further extended these findings in determining that CrkI, CrkII, and CrkL associate with both Tyr(P)-700 and Tyr(P)-774 in vivoand that increased phosphorylation of Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 in 70Z Cbl results in increased recruitment of Crk(L) and p85 PI3K adapter proteins. Interestingly, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z is not restricted to these three residues, as increased basal and activation-induced phosphorylation was also observed in 70Z Y700F/Y731F/Y774F relative to wt Y700F/Y731F/Y774F Cbl. Our findings apparently contrast with those recently reported by Feshchenko et al. (41Feshchenko E.A. Langdon W.Y. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8323-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), who did not detect appreciable tyrosine phosphorylation of the wt Cbl Y700F/Y731F/Y774F triple mutant in response to pervanadate treatment of transiently transfected Jurkat T cells. We suggest that this difference may be due to the higher sensitivity of the recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. Taken together with the general finding that the Cbl 1–655 truncation mutant is not appreciably tyrosine-phosphorylated (Refs. 34Ota Y. Beitz L.O. Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 41Feshchenko E.A. Langdon W.Y. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8323-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and data not shown), we tentatively conclude that there is at least one other tyrosine in the C-terminal (amino acids 655–906) region that shows increased basal and activation-induced phosphorylation in 70Zversus wt Cbl.The molecular mechanisms underlying 70Z Cbl-induced transformation and NFAT/AP1 activation have not been previously identified. In theory, the 70Z Cbl oncoprotein may itself act as a positive signal transducer or, alternatively, it may inhibit a negative regulator that prevents or down-regulates an activating signal. Consistent with the former possibility, several groups have previously suggested that 70Z Cbl-induced transformation may, at least in part, be due to its increased phosphotyrosine content and association with Crk(L) adapter proteins (1Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 359-379Crossref Google Scholar, 28Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 30Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), perhaps through regulation of Ras signaling via the C3G-Rap1-Ras pathway. Indeed, our initial results demonstrated increased basal and activation-induced association of 70Z Cbl with Crk(L) and p85 PI3K adapter proteins. However, neither increased association of Crk(L) and p85 PI3K adapter proteins with 70Z relative to wt Cbl nor disruption of Crk(L)/p85 PI3K association with wt or 70Z Cbl detectably affects basal or anti-CD3-induced Erk1/2 activation. Consistent with these findings, Thien and Langdon (30Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been unable to detect an effect of 70Z Cbl overexpression on Erk activation in fibroblasts. As Ras activation is both necessary and sufficient to activate Erk (Ref. 39Genot E. Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and references therein), these findings suggest that the Cbl-Crk(L) and Cbl-p85 PI3K interactions do not affect Ras signaling. Moreover, our study clearly demonstrates that the 70Z Cbl oncoprotein retains its ability to activate NFAT and AP1 in the absence of Crk(L) and p85 PI3K binding, indicating that 70Z-induced NFAT/AP1 activation is not mediated through increased association with these adapter molecules.Although we can exclude the possibility that 70Z Cbl-mediated NFAT activation is mediated through increased phosphorylation of Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774, our findings demonstrate increased phosphorylation of 70Z Cbl on additional tyrosine residues. Therefore, it remains possible that increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z Cbl on these additional tyrosine residues contributes to its oncogenic and NFAT/AP1 activating properties. Our finding that 70Z Cbl requires its PTB domain for induction of NFAT and AP1 is consistent with the model that mutation of the Ring finger domain of 70Z Cbl activates or exposes its N-terminal PTB domain, which would allow increased recruitment to activated protein-tyrosine kinases. Although it is not known whether the reported enhanced association of 70Z Cbl with the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (27Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y.

Indeed, our findings also demonstrate that the G306E mutation blocks increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z Cbl, suggesting that increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z Cbl results from increased or prolonged recruitment to activated tyrosine kinases via its PTB domain. Considering this model, however, it seems paradoxical that the PTB domain of Cbl associates with phosphotyrosine residue 292 of ZAP70 bothin vitro and in vivo (4Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A.

As studies in D. melanogaster (11Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), C. elegans (12Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W.

Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) indicate that Cbl functions as an evolutionary conserved negative regulator of protein-tyrosine kinases, it is possible that 70Z Cbl acts as a dominant negative by blocking the negative regulatory role of endogenous Cbl on protein-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Significantly, c/v-Cbl has previously been proposed to act as a dominant negative by competing with endogenous Cbl for phosphotyrosine binding sites on activated (receptor) tyrosine kinases (27Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Most important, our study demonstrates that 70Z Cbl-induced NFAT/AP1 activation in unstimulated Jurkat T cells is completely blocked by the G306E mutation. This observation is consistent with a dominant negative effect of 70Z Cbl on the evolutionary conserved PTB domain-dependent negative regulatory role of endogenous Cbl on protein-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. In this model, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z Cbl, which depends on its PTB domain, may be the consequence of increased recruitment to an activated tyrosine kinase via its PTB domain and/or the inability of endogenous Cbl to inhibit or down-regulate activated protein-tyrosine kinases in the presence of the 70Z Cbl PTB domain. Importantly, competitive inhibition of endogenous Cbl binding to the ZAP70 phosphotyrosine residue 292 by the 70Z Cbl PTB domain is consistent with a negative regulatory role for the interaction of endogenous Cbl with the ZAP70"

Although this enzyme must create transient double-stranded breaks in the genetic material in order to carry out its indispensable DNA strand passage reaction, the factors that underlie its nucleotide cleavage specificity remain an enigma. Therefore, to address the critical issue of enzyme specificity, a modified systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) protocol was employed to select/evolve DNA sequences that were preferentially cleaved by Drosophila melanogastertopoisomerase II. Levels of DNA scission rose substantially (from 3 to 20%) over 20 rounds of SELEX. In vitro selection/evolution converged on an alternating purine/pyrmidine sequence that was highly AT-rich (TATATATACATATATATA). The preference for this sequence was more pronounced for Drosophila topoisomerase II over other species and was increased in the presence of DNA cleavage-enhancing anticancer drugs. Enhanced cleavage appeared to be based on higher rates of DNA scission rather than increased binding affinity or decreased religation rates. The preferred sequence for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage is dramatically overrepresented (∼10,000-fold) in the euchromatic genome of D. melanogaster, implying that it may be a site for the physiological action of this enzyme.

DNA topoisomerase II is an enzyme that is necessary for the survival of all proliferating cells (1Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects.

In addition to its normal functions in replication and mitosis, it is the target for some of the most widely prescribed drugs used in the treatment of human cancers (3Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Google Scholar). The essential nature of topoisomerase II, as well as its role as a target for anticancer chemotherapy, extend from its unique status in the cell; it is the only enzyme known to create transientdouble-stranded breaks in the genetic material (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem.

Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This ability to cleave and religate DNA in a concerted fashion allows topoisomerase II to disentangle topologically linked DNA molecules or alter the supercoiled state of nucleic acids without compromising the integrity of the genome (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Conversely, when the cleavage/religation cycle of the enzyme is perturbed by anticancer drugs that enhance cleavage or inhibit religation, topoisomerase II is converted to a lethal enzyme that generates high levels of breaks in the DNA of treated cells (3Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L.

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The reversibility of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission results from the fact that the enzyme forms a proteinaceous bridge that spans the double-stranded break and never releases its cleaved nucleic acid intermediate (15Liu L.F. Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 16Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout its scission reaction, topoisomerase II remains covalently linked to the newly generated 5′ termini of the cleaved DNA through the active-site tyrosyl residue of each of its two identical subunits (17Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although the covalent topoisomerase II-DNA “cleavage complex” is a fleeting intermediate in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 11Berger J.M. Curr. Opin.

Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), it ensures resealing of the double-stranded DNA break and prevents illegitimate recombination that would result from ligation of DNA termini to different nucleic acid molecules. Sites of covalent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex formation on any given nucleic acid substrate are reproducible and nonrandom, but the basis of this DNA sequence specificity remains obscure. Consensus DNA cleavage sequences have been determined for topoisomerase II from several eukaryotic species, ranging from Drosophila melanogaster to humans; however, these consensus sequences are generally weak and vary significantly from one another (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Sander M. Hsieh T.S.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1463-1471PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DNA sequences that contain strong sites of enzyme-mediated scission have been identified that bear little relation to the published consensus for topoisomerase II from that species (16Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sander M. Hsieh T.S.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6237-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the predictive value of consensus DNA cleavage sequences for the eukaryotic type II enzyme appears to be limited. Because the nucleic acid sites at which topoisomerase II acts probably govern (to at least some extent) the ability of the enzyme to carry out its physiological functions (1Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it is critical to understand the basis by which topoisomerase II selects its specific sites of action on DNA. Therefore, a systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) 1The abbreviations SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichmentMARmatrix-associated regionSARscaffold-associated regionbpbase pair(s) 1The abbreviations SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichmentMARmatrix-associated regionSARscaffold-associated regionbpbase pair(s)approach (28Tuerk C.

This approach differs from previous studies that mapped and compared enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage sites in that it identifies “preferred” (i.e. highly selected) rather than consensus (i.e. average) sites of topoisomerase II scission. Following 20 rounds of selection/evolution based on enzyme-mediated DNA scission, a predominant 18-mer sequence emerged.

Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construct utilized for the overexpression of ytop2Y783F was the generous gift of Dr. J. E. Lindsley (University of Utah) and has been described previously (31Lindsley J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The α and β isoforms of human topoisomerase II were overexpressed in S. cerevisiae and purified as described previously (32Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Etoposide and amsacrine were purchased from Sigma, and the quinolone CP-115,953 was the generous gift of Drs. T. Gootz and P. McGuirk (Pfizer Central Research, Groton, CT). All drugs were stored at −20 °C as 10 mm stocks in Me2SO. Tris and urea were purchased from Sigma; SDS was from Merck; proteinase K was from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; restriction endonucleases, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and polynucleotide kinase were from New England BioLabs; Klenow and Taq DNA polymerases were from Promega; [α-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and Sequenase DNA polymerase were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; and Bluescript SK+ phagemid was from Stratagene. All chemicals were analytical reagent grade. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer, followed by purification on 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The initial substrate was constructed as a single-stranded 60-mer oligonucleotide with the following sequence: 5′-TAGTGGATCCGCTAACGCAGN20CAGTTAAATTGAATTCGATA-3′, where the central 20 bp contained random sequence (N) based on equal incorporation of A, G, C, and T at each position. The complementary strand was synthesized by annealing an oligonucleotide primer with the sequence 5′-TATCGAATTCAATTTAACTG-3′ (primer 1) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min with Sequenase in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 1 mm each TTP, dCTP, dGTP, and dATP. The double-stranded DNA product was gel-purified on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Additional oligonucleotides used in this study were: 5′-TAGTGGATCCGCTAACGCAG-3′ (primer 2), 5′-TAGTGGATCCGCTAACGCAGTATATATACATATATATACAGTTAAATTGAATTCGATA-3′ (clone 1, top), 5′-TATCGAATTCAATTTAACTGTATATATATGTATATATACTGCGTTAGCGGATCCACTA-3′ (clone 1, bottom), 5′-TAGTGGATCCGCTAACGCAGTATATATACATGTATATACAGTTAAATTGAATTCGATA-3′ (clone 17, top), and 5′-TATCGAATTCAATTTAACTGTATATATCATGTATATATACTGCGTTAGCGGATCCACTA-3′ (clone 17, bottom). Annealing of oligonucleotides was accomplished by mixing equimolar amounts of each strand, heating at 70 °C for 20 min, and then gradually cooling to room temperature over at least 1 h. Cleavage complexes were established at 30 °C by incubating 200 ng of oligonucleotide substrate (100 nm) with 2 μg of Drosophila topoisomerase II (100 nm) for 10 min in 50 μl of cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol) containing 5 mm CaCl2. CaCl2, rather than MgCl2, was employed because topoisomerase II generates significantly higher levels of single-stranded DNA breaks in the presence of Ca2+ (33Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This is important because the subsequent amplification of the cleavage products requires an intact template DNA strand. Cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of 50 μl of 4% SDS, followed by 50 μl of 4 mm EDTA, and were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of 400 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.9, 250 mm KCl, and 5 μg/ml tRNA. After incubation on ice for 10 min, precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml tRNA for 10 min at 45 °C, reprecipitated by shifting the temperature from 45 °C to ice for 10 min, and collected by centrifugation as above. Precipitates were resuspended at 45 °C for 10 min in 200 μl of water containing 5 μg/ml tRNA, ethanol-precipitated twice, washed with 95% ethanol, and dried under partial vacuum at room temperature. Selection reactions were carried out in quadruplicate and pooled prior to the second ethanol precipitation. Selected DNA molecules (i.e. molecules isolated from cleavage complexes) were amplified under mutagenic conditions (34Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) as follows. The dried pellets from the selection procedure were resuspended in 198 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 7 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm TTP, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dGTP, and 0.01% gelatin containing 2 ng/μl each of primers 1 and 2. Amplification was initiated by the addition of 2 μl (10 units) of Taq polymerase. Samples were overlaid with 100 μl of light mineral oil and cycled in an Ericomp TwinBlock thermal cycler, using the following program: 5 min at 94 °C; followed by 20 cycles each consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, followed by 1 min at 50 °C and 1 min at 72 °C. After the last cycle, 2 μg of each primer was added, reactions were incubated at 94 °C for 5 min, and one additional cycle was run as above. Since the template DNA molecules for this procedure were heterogeneous, this last annealing and extension in the presence of excess primer was important to ensure that both strands of the DNA substrate used for the next round of selection were properly base-paired and exactly complementary for any individual DNA molecule. Experiments with a control oligonucleotide of known sequence indicated that the rate of misincorporation was ∼0.4 bp/oligonucleotide molecule/round (which included 20 cycles of amplification) of SELEX. Therefore, the products of the final cycle of amplification for any given round of SELEX should have contained no more than a single base pair mismatch for every 50 oligonucleotide molecules. Since there is no mechanism by which mismatched base pairs can be specifically maintained from round to round of the SELEX protocol, it is unlikely that the potential existence of a low level of mismatches in the DNA affected the overall selection process. Following amplification, samples were ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 40 μl of water and 4 μl of loading buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.9, 60% sucrose), and subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 10 watts for ∼2 h. Amplification products were located by shadowing with ultraviolet light, and the DNA band was excised from the gel and eluted overnight in 400 μl of 0.5m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA. The eluted DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of water, and its concentration was determined by measuring its absorbance at 260 nm. This DNA was then used as the substrate for a new round of selection. To control for the possibility of contamination during the SELEX protocol, samples with no added DNA were run alongside the normal samples for every step of the selection and amplification procedures. When the DNA from the amplification reactions was gel-purified, a corresponding gel slice from the contamination control reaction lane was also excised and incubated overnight in the elution buffer. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension, the same volume of the control sample was used as the “DNA” for the contamination control reaction of the next round of selection and amplification. None of the contamination controls produced a band upon UV shadowing of the gel. Levels of cleavage complex formation were monitored by the K+/SDS precipitation assay (35Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Trask D.K. DiDonato J.A. Muller M.T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide pools (from each round that was assayed) were digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, and the ends were filled in using Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP in the presence of nonradioactive nucleotides (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.51-10.53Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified as described above. DNA cleavage reactions contained 100 nm Drosophila topoisomerase II and 5 nm oligonucleotide substrate and were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of cleavage buffer containing either 5 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2. For reactions that utilized yeast topoisomerase II, no KCl was used, and the NaCl concentration was 100 mm. For reactions that utilized human topoisomerase IIα or β, the cleavage buffer was the same except that no NaCl was used and the KCl concentration was 100 mm. When DNA cleavage reactions were carried out in the presence of drugs, 100 μm drug was included such that the final Me2SO concentration was 1%. Unless stated otherwise, DNA cleavage reactions were always carried out in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. As a prelude to determining rates of DNA religation, cleavage complexes were established in cleavage buffer containing CaCl2 and trapped by the addition of EDTA (5 mm final concentration). Following incubation at 30 °C for 2 min, NaCl was added (250 mm final concentration of additional salt), and samples were equilibrated at 30 °C for 1 min. DNA religation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 μm final concentration) and terminated by the addition of SDS (2% final concentration) at various time points. Levels of DNA cleavage complex remaining were determined by the K+/SDS precipitation protocol described above. Binding of the mutant yeast topoisomerase II, ytop2Y783F, or the wild-type Drosophilaenzyme to oligonucleotide pools was determined using a nitrocellulose filter assay (38Higgins N.P. Cozzarelli N.R.

Reactions were carried out in 10 μl of the appropriate cleavage buffer in the presence (yeast) or absence (Drosophila) of 5 mm MgCl2. Concentrations of oligonucleotide (radioactively labeled) and enzyme were as described above for the K+/SDS assays. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, reactions were spotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Millipore; presoaked in assay buffer), and the filters were washed three times with 1 ml of cold cleavage buffer. Filters were dried, and the radioactivity retained was determined by scintillation counting. The oligonucleotide pool from round 20 of the SELEX procedure was reselected as above and amplified under nonmutagenic conditions: 30 cycles as above, but with 20 fmol of round 20 DNA as the template in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.0); 50 mm KCl; 0.1% Triton X-100; 1 mm each TTP, dATP, dGTP, and dCTP; and 1 μg each of primers 1 and 2. Oligonucleotide products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and ligated into linearized Bluescript SK+ phagemid. Ligation was performed using the Boehringer Mannheim Rapid DNA Ligation Kit. Ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli, and colonies were selected that contained the phagemid plus insert as described by the manufacturer. Phagemid from the individual clones was purified using the Boehringer Mannheim High Pure Plasmid Isolation kit, and the sequences of the inserts were determined using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Sequenase kit and a sequencing primer that was complementary to phagemid sequence near the insert (5′-AAAGCTGGAGCTCCACCGCG-3′). Sites of DNA cleavage were determined as described previously (39Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The composition of cleavage reactions was as above for the K+/SDS assays except that the concentration of oligonucleotide was 80 nm. In order to verify that scission of the selected sequences was double-stranded, DNA cleavage reactions were carried out as above for the K+/SDS assays (in Mg2+-containing buffer), terminated with SDS, digested with proteinase K (0.8 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 14% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (cooled to 10 °C) at 10 watts for ∼2 h. Radioactive DNA cleavage products were visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Searches of the EuropeanDrosophila Genome Project data bases were conducted using the blastn search program (40Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to define the mechanism by which the enzyme recognizes its site of action on nucleic acid substrates, previous studies have mapped sequences at which topoisomerase II cleaves DNA. This approach has resulted in a series of weak consensus cleavage sequences for several eukaryotic type II enzymes including Drosophila, chicken, mouse, and the α and β isoforms of human (19Sander M.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1463-1471PubMed Google Scholar). However, these consensus sites exhibit little sequence agreement among themselves and even disagree regarding the position of preferred bases relative to the point of cleavage. The variability between reported sequences notwithstanding, topoisomerase II displayed at least some level of specificity for 6–10 sequence positions in each of these studies (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Sander M. Hsieh T.S.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1463-1471PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming an average of eight base-specific points of contact between topoisomerase II and its DNA cleavage site, it would be necessary to determine every site of action for the enzyme in ∼65,000 bp of random DNA in order to generate all possible sequences (i.e. 48combinations) at these positions. Since the size of DNA substrates utilized for the generation of consensus sequences generally ranged between 1000 and 10,000 bp (19Sander M. Hsieh T.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1057-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1463-1471PubMed Google Scholar), it is clear that (on average) only a small fraction of the necessary cleavage sites have been sampled in order to confidently define the intrinsic specificity of topoisomerase II. In light of the above, we have utilized an alternative approach to address this fundamental issue of topoisomerase II specificity. Rather than attempting to generate a consensus sequence for enzyme action based on mapping sites in a larger fragment of DNA, a SELEX protocol (28Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7993) Google Scholar) was employed to select/evolve preferred sites of DNA cleavage mediated by Drosophila topoisomerase II from a pool of ∼1012 potential sequences. The scheme utilized for the present study is shown in Fig.1. The initial DNA substrate employed for the SELEX protocol was a 60-mer oligonucleotide that incorporated two critical features: 1) it included 20 bp of defined flanking sequences (derived from pBR322) at each end that were devoid of topoisomerase II cleavage sites (16Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contained the indicated restriction endonuclease recognition sites for eventual cloning; and 2) it included a 20-bp core of random DNA sequence that was synthesized using an equimolar ratio of all four bases. This random portion of the substrate allowed the type II enzyme to select/evolve preferred sites of DNA cleavage from among as many as 420 sequences, affording topoisomerase II the opportunity to"
https://openalex.org/W2318821196,"The cell cycle-regulated transcription factor E2F is a family of heterodimers composed of E2F and DP protein subunits. While DP proteins stabilize DNA binding of E2F proteins, and influence the entry of E2F-4 and E2F-5 into the nucleus, the role of DP proteins in E2F-dependent gene expression is not well understood. Using immunolocalization, immunoprecipitation, and cell fractionation experiments, here we show association with E2F subunits governs intracellular trafficking and ubiquitination of DP-1. In transient transfection experiments, DP-1 polypeptides that stably bound E2F-1 entered the nucleus. DP-1 proteins that failed to associate with E2F subunits accumulated in the cell cytoplasm as polyubiquitinated DP-1. A Chinese hamster cell line that conditionally expresses HA-DP-1 was used to examine the effect of DP-1 on cell cycle progression. In serum response experiments, moderate increases in HA-DP-1 led to a threefold increase in E2F DNA binding activity in vitro, a corresponding increase in dhfr gene expression during transition of G1, and higher rates of S phase entry. However, flow cytometry showed cells expressing very high levels of HA-DP-1 failed to enter the S phase. Inhibition of cell cycle progression by high levels of HA-DP-1 was associated with the accumulation of other ubiquitinated cellular proteins, including c-jun and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, indicating that degradation of ubiquitinated proteins is required for progression from G0 to S phase even in the presence of activated E2F. Under similar conditions, expression of E2F-1 reduced the levels of ubiquitinated cellular proteins and accelerated cell cycle progression. Our studies indicate association with E2F subunits prevents ubiquitin-dependent degradation of DP-1 in the cytoplasm by promoting nuclear entry of E2F/DP heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W2329839671,"We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of the ectopic expression of the pRb2/p130 cell cycle regulator on c-erbB-2-associated tumorigenicity. SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells, which display c-erbB-2 gene amplification and oncoprotein (p185HER2) overexpression, were stably transfected with a plasmid containing the coding sequence for human wild-type pRb2/p130 (wtRb2), or with pcDNA3 empty vector. Three wtRb2-transfected clones (cl. 24, cl. 49, cl. 100) and one empty vector-transfected clone (cl. mock) were randomly picked and further analysed. Western blot analysis revealed high levels of pRb2/p130 in the three clones compared to mock cells. Levels of p185HER2 and the extent of its tyrosine phosphorylation were similar in all transfectant clones, as were levels of pRb1 and p107. In anchorage-independent growth assays, the number of colonies from wtRb2 clone-transfectants was about 90% less than that arising from mock cells (P<0.001). Tumor take rates of the three wtRb2-transfected clones xenografted in nu/nu mice were much lower than those of mock cells, and tumor volume was decreased by 80% (P<0.001). A mutant version of pRb2/p130 deleted of the pocket region (mut-Rb2) was also transfected into SKOV3 cells and studied in parallel with the wtRb2-transfected and pcDNA empty vector-transfected bulk populations. mut-Rb2 transfected cells showed no inhibition of in vitro colony formation and were fully tumorigenic. Together, these findings indicate that Rb2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in vivo and in vitro in SKOV3 cells and that the intact pocket region is required for the suppressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2334598502,"Expression of viral proteins may result in susceptibility of cells to the cytotoxic effect of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF). While murine C127 cells containing the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) genome were reported to exhibit increased TNF sensitivity, the gene(s) responsible was not identified. The BPV-1 E6 oncoprotein induces tumorigenic transformation of murine C127 cells and stimulates transcription when targeted to a promoter. BPV-1 E6 was introduced into C127 cells (PBE6) by retroviral infection and stable clones were isolated. These cells showed increased apoptosis in response to TNF, as measured by several criteria. TNF-induced apoptosis in PBE6 cells was accompanied by increased release of arachidonic acid, indicating that phospholipase A2 was activated. We also provide evidence that BPV-1 E6 mediated-sensitization of cells to TNF-induced apoptosis can occur in the absence of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2316651206,"Dideoxy fingerprinting (ddF) is a hybrid technique which combines aspects of single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and dideoxy sequencing to detect the presence of single base changes in a defined fragment of nucleic acid. ddF is no more technically demanding than SSCP, yet it is more sensitive in detecting point mutations. We describe here the adaptation of conventional ddF to an automated sequencing system using fluorescent Cy5 labeled primers. We show that automated RNA-based ddF (ARddF) has several advantages over conventional radioisotope-based ddF, including: (1) analysis of larger nucleic acid fragments (up to 10(3) bp), due to the ability to continuously analyse and compile sequencing information; (2) greater reliability for distinguishing mutant sequences from wild type sequences (particularly when the mutation leads to gain or loss of a dideoxy termination segment); (3) the use of fluorescent labeled primers, making ARddF less hazardous than methods requiring radionucleotides. The use of ARddF in conjunction with new methods for isolating RNA from a [corrected] small number of cells facilitates mutational analysis of small tissue biopsies and other limited samples, and will allow more widespread application of mutational screening in the setting of clinical diagnostic laboratories."
