https://openalex.org/W1659584317,"The prostaglandin synthetase system of bovine vesicular gland microsomes was solubilized and separated into Fractions I and II. The former fraction catalyzed the conversion of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid to prostaglandin H1 (9 alpha, 11alpha-epidioxy-15(S)-hydroxy-13-trans-prostenoic acid). This compound was isomerized to prostaglandin E1 (11alpha, 15(S)-dihydroxy-9-keto-13-trans-prostenoic acid) by the action of Fraction II (Miyamoto, T., Yamamoto, S., and Hayaishi, O. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 3645-3648). Fraction I was further purified by isoelectric focusing and about a 700-fold purification was achieved starting from the microsomes. When the enzyme was incubated with 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid in the presence of hematin, an unstable compound which was distinguishable from prostaglandin H1 accumulated. The chemical properties of this compound were identical with those of prostaglandin G1 (9 alpha, 11 alpha-epidioxy-15(S)-hydroperoxy-13-trans-prostenoic acid). The enzyme also catalyzed the conversion of prostaglandin G1 to H1 when heme and tryptophan were supplied. Thus, the purified enzyme, which was provisionally referred to as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase, exhibited two enzyme activities: the synthesis of prostaglandin G1 and its conversion to prostaglandin H1. Either free or protein-bound heme was required for both reactions, and only protoheme was active. Tryptophan stimulated the conversion of prostaglandin G1 to H1, and this stimulatory effect was also observed with various other aromatic compounds. Indomethacin and aspirin inhibited prostaglandin G1 synthesis, but not the other steps of prostaglandin biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1554198147,"Para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) from Pseudomonas fluorescens is one of a group of flavoproteins which insert molecular oxygen into aromatic rings to form phenols. To determine the mechanism of oxygen insertion by this enzyme, an extensive study was made of the reaction with O2 of reduced enzyme in complex with various aromatic molecules. Reactions were studied by following absorbance changes with time with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Analysis of multiphasic reactions led to the detection of a minimum of three transient intermediates with characteristic absorption spectra involved in the process of hydroxylation. The initial interaction of oxygen with the reduced enzyme characteristically produces a derivative of FAD (maximum absorbance 380 to 390 nm) which is probably C(4a) peroxyflavin. Depending on the aromatic compound bound to the enzyme, this intermediate decays either to oxidized, enzyme-bound flavin and H2O2 or transfers an atom of oxygen to the aromatic compound. The process of oxygen transfer forms a derivative of FAD of unknown structure (maximum absorbance 390 to 420 nm), which subsequently decays to the third intermediate observed (maximum absorbance 380 to 385 nm), which is probably C(4a) hydroxyflavin. The decay of this last intermediate results in the formation of oxidized enzyme, and the liberation of hydroxylated product and H2O. In an extension of substrate specificity studies it was found that p-aminobenzoate is a substrate and 5-hydroxypicolinate is an effector for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The binding of aromatic compounds to the reduced enzyme was observed by following shifts in the absorption spectrum of enzyme bound FADH2, permitting the determination of dissociation constants and kinetics of binding."

This ability of blue-green algae to suppress other algae may be determined by the abailability of iron. Iron deprivation induces the production of hydroxamate chelators, which appear to be the agent suppressing other algae."
https://openalex.org/W2146023328,"Methods are described for the purification of a heparin-neutralizing protein from human platelets. The protein, obtained by conventional or affinity chromatographic techniques, is homogeneous by disc and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and gel electrofocusing and can be obtained in a final yield of 75%. The protein has a subunit molecular weight of 9600, an isoelectric point at pH 7.6, and 18% basic and 22% acidic amino acid residues. The purified heparin-neutralizing protein forms dissociable complexes with heparin as measured by electrophoretic and Millipore filtration techniques employing [3H]heparin. The ability of a series of sulfated glycosaminoglycans to displace [3H]heparin from the binding protein was compared. The mole ratios required were: heparin less than heparan sulfate less than dermatan sulfate less than chondroitin 6-sulfate less than chondroitin 4-sulfate. Although the degree of sulfation of the aminoglycans correlated with the ability to displace [3H]heparin, the conformation fo the carboxyl group of the uronic acid and the location of the sulfate groups on the amino sugar also influenced the affinity for the protein. Evidence is also presented that binding to aminoglycans occurs via ionic interactions between lysine residues on the protein and negatively charged groups on the aminoglycan. Chemical modification of lysines by guanidination decreased heparin-neutralizing and binding activity, while modification of arginine residues had no effect. Heparin could prevent lysine modification when specifically bound to the heparin-neutralizing protein, but did not prevent lysine modification of other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1530602575,"The NADPH-dependent reduction of rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 has been studied as a function of temperature. In the temperature range 4-37 degrees the reduction reaction was found to be biphasic and composed of two concurrent first order processes. This phenomenon was observed with microsomes from untreated and phenobarbital-induced animals in the presence or absence of exogenous Type I substrates. The amount of cytochrome P-450 reduced in the fast phase comprised approximately 70% of the total cytochrome P-450 at temperatures above 20 degrees. The temperature dependence of the fast phase was unusual for a membrane-bound enzyme system in that it lacked a discontinuity in the Arrhenius plot at a presumed phase transition temperature for the microsomal membrane. The slow phase of reduction behaved in a normal fashion for a membrane-bound enzyme system with a break in the Arrhenius plot at about 20 degrees. The data presented here combined with previous observations which include (a) the ratio of cytochrome P-450 to NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (NADPH:ferricytochrome oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.2.4) is 20:1, (b) the catalytic portion of the reductase molecule probably protrudes above the surface of the membrane, and (c) the cytochrome P-450 molecules are presumably embedded in the membrane support the hypothesis that the hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing system exists as clusters with most of the cytochrome P-450 molecules arranged about a central reductase molecule. This central flavoprotein reductase is able to randomly reduce those cytochrome P-450 molecules within the cluster without translational motion through the microsomal membrane. The slow phase of reduction represents the reduction of those molecules not directly associated with the clusters."
https://openalex.org/W1589012184,"Washed membrane particles from pig Graafian follicles larger than 6 mm in diameter were found to contain an adenylyl cyclase system that is highly responsive to luteinizing hormone (LH). Under the assay conditions used (1.5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.4 mM EDTA, and 1.0 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, pH 7.0) LH stimulated enzyme activity up to 7-fold. Half-maximal activation was obtained between 3 and 6 X 10(-10) M of added LH, provided the reaction was carried out under equilibrium conditions. In contrast to findings in large follicles, adenylyl cyclase activity was found to be unresponsive to LH in small immature follicles (1 to 2 mm in diameter) and partially responsive to LH (2- to 3-fold stimulation over basal) in follicles of medium size (3 to 5 mm in diameter). Washed membrane particles from follicles larger than 6 mm were found to contain also an ATP- and Mg2+-dependent process which, upon incubation at 30 degrees, causes the adenylyl cyclase system to lose its susceptibility to respond to LH. Because this loss of LH-stimulated activity was not accompanied by a concomitant loss of basal activity, it was concluded to be the expression of a desensitization reaction. Desensitization was almost undetectable at 5 mM total added MgCl2 and required, to be readily detectable, addition of MgCl2 concentrations in excess of 10 mM. LH was found to stimulate desensitization in the presence of 1 mM cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate by diminishing the requirement for MgCl2. Loss of LH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was readily detectable at 5.0 mM total added MgCl2 in the presence of 10 mug per ml of LH. Half-maximal stimulation of desensitization by LH was found to occur at about 25 X 10(-10) M, i.e. at about 4 to 6 times higher concentrations than needed for half-maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Half-maximal LH-stimulated desensitization was obtained with 0.5 to 0.7 mM ATP in the incubation. Neither GTP, nor adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, the nonphosphorylating imidodiphosphate analogue of ATP, supported the desensitization reaction, suggesting that this process may be mediated via phosphorylation of one or more of the components of the adenylyl cyclase system. LH-stimulated desensitization was detected also in washed membrane particles derived from dissected rabbit Graafian follicles, whose adenylyl cyclase becomes desensitized in vivo within minutes after human chorionic gonadotropin injection (Hunzicker-Dunn, M., and Birnbaumer, L., Endocrinology, in press), but not in membrane particles from corpora lutea of pregnant or pseudopregnant rabbits, whose adenylyl cyclase becomes desensitized in vivo only several hours or days after human chorionic gonadotropin injection (Hunzicker-Dunn, M., and Birnbaumer, L., Endocrinology, in press). It is suggested that both actions of LH (stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and stimulation of desensitization) are receptor-mediated, and that neither of them is mediated by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate..."

https://openalex.org/W1605794343,"Using a radioimmunoassay method for thyrotropin-releasing hormone, the presence of thyrotropin-releasing hormone-metabolizing activity in various hamster tissues was demonstrated. While there was substantial activity degrading thyrotropin-releasing hormone in hypothalamus, there was a notable absence of such activity in pituitary. The enzymatic activity in the hypothalamus was shown to be soluble and separable into two fractions. Analysis of the metabolic products formed by the two enzymes indicated that one possessed an amidase activity (less than Glu-His-Pro-NH2 leads to less than Glu-His-Pro) and the other possessed pyroglutamylpeptidase activity (less than Glu-His-Pro-NH2 leads to less than Glu+His-Pro-NH2). Other peptides containing NH2-terminal pyroglutamic acid or COOH-terminal amide groups did not block the hydrolysis of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, suggesting that the enzymes were specific. Some inhibitors preferentially blocked the activity of one or the other enzymes. Of possible biological significance is the observation that thyroid-stimulating hormone inhibited the amidase activity while hydrocortisone inhibited the pyroglutamylpeptidase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1604192511,"An iron-sulfur protein has been isolated from chick kidney mitochondria and purified (200-fold as determined enzymatically by its NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity in the presence of adrenodoxin reductase) on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The purified protein showed an absorption peak at 411 nm with a shoulder at 460 nm. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum was typical of a ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur protein with g values: gx=gy-1.94 and gz=2.02. The molecular weight was estimated by gel filtration to be 12,500. When tested against anti-adrenodoxin gamma-globulin, the protein showed a precipitin line that fused completely with that of adrenodoxin. Based on these findings it is concluded that this protein is an iron-sulfur protein quite similar to adrenal ferredoxin. In the presence of adrenoxodin reductase, NADPH, and carbon monoxide, the purified renal ferredoxin was found to be active in the reduction of cytochrome P-450 solubilized from chick kidney mitochondria. It was also effective in the reconstituted 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1alpha-hydroxylase composed of the cytochrome P-450 from rachitic chick kidneys and adrenodoxin reductase. A ferredoxin reductase isolated from chick kidney mitochondria could replace adrenodoxin reductase in the reconstituted system. These results strongly support a previous conclusion that the kidney mitochondrial 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1alpha-hydroxylation system consists of a renal ferredoxin reductase (presumably a flavoprotein), renal ferredoxin, and cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1488177638,"Nine samples of purified rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (UDP-glucose:glycogen 4-alpha-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.11) were obtained with alkali-labile phosphate contents ranging from 0.27 to 3.49 residues per 85,000 molecular weight subunit. The enzyme samples appeared essentially homogeneous when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and had relatively constant specific activity under standard conditions with saturating UDP-glucose and glucose-l-P concentrations (37.1 +/- 1.0 mumol of glucose incorporated/mg/min). When the UDP-glucose concentration was varied, deviations from Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed for all samples (Hill slopes of 0.79 +/- 0.02), but these deviations were virtually abolished by the presence of 5 mM glucose-6-P. Glucose-6-P decreased the S0.5 (concentration required for half-maximal rate) for UDP-glucose. The plots of activity increase caused by glucose-6-P versus glucose-6-P concentration became progressively more sigmoid in shape with enzyme samples of higher phosphate content. Both the S0.5 for UDP-glucose and the M0.5 for glucose-6-P (concentration for half-maximal activation) were sensitive functions of the alkali-labile phosphate content of glycogen synthase. The M0.5 increased from 3.3 muM at 0.27 phosphate/subunit to 2.7 mM at 3.5 phosphates/subunit, and the S0.5 varied from 0.75 mM (0.27 phosphate/subunit) to at least 61 mM (2.3 phosphates/subunit). Both parameters increased continuously with phosphate content, with the greatest absolute changes occurring at values greater than 2 residues of phosphates/subunit. The effects of both phosphorylation and activation by glucose-6-P appeared to be mediated primarily through alteration of the apparent affinity for UDP-glucose. With the phosphorylating conditions used, the results suggested that phosphate could not be introduced into the glycogen synthase molecule without altering its kinetic properties. Further, either the different phosphorylation sites were not equivalent, or else identical sites interacted in determining the kinetic properties of glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1564558573,"Initial rate parameters obtained with bovine galactosyltransferase at saturating Mn2+ concentrations, and a variety of acceptors including N-acetylglucosamine, glucose, ovalbumin, and di-N-acetylglucosamine are inconsistent with an ordered addition of UDP-galactose and acceptor substrates to the enzyme-Mn2+ complex. Inhibition patterns with N-acetylglucosamine or UDP-glucose as inhibitors of the galactosylation of ovalbumin indicated that either UDP-galactose or N-acetylglucosamine can bind to an enzyme-Mn2+ complex by a random equilibrium mechanism. Initial rate studies also indicate that alpha-lactalbumin may bind to either an enzyme-Mn2+-acceptor complex or an enzyme-Mn2+-UDP-galactose complex, suggesting that lactose synthesis also proceeds by a random equilibrium addition of substrates and alpha-lactalbumin. From the initial rate data assuming the random equilibrium mechanism, the dissociation constants for UDP-galactose, acceptor substrates, and alpha-lactalbumin from the appropriate complexes have been calculated. These values are in good agreement with those obtained independently by nonkinetic methods, providing additional support for the proposed random equilibrium mechanism. From similar studies with a cross-linked complex of alpha-lactalbumin and transferase, dissociation constants for UDP-galactose and acceptor substrates from the enzyme-Mn2+-alpha-lactalbumin complex were calculated. Comparison of each of the dissociation constants in the substrate addition phase shows that the binding of acceptor substrates and alpha-lactalbumin to enzyme-Mn2+ complexes is highly synergistic; the affinity of alpha-lactalbumin for the enzyme-Mn2+ acceptor complex is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than for the enzyme-Mn2+ complex. Similarly, the affinity of the acceptor for the enzyme-Mn2+-alpha-lactalbumin complex is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the enzyme-Mn2+ complex. Synergism is also observed between alpha-lactalbumin and UDP-galactose binding but the synergism is much less than that observed with acceptor substrates and alpha-lactalbumin. Thus, the large decrease in the Michaelis constant for glucose in the presence of alpha-lactalbumin, which is observed for lactose synthesis by the galactosyltranferase, is primarily the result of the high degree of synergism in the binding of alpha-lactalbumin and glucose to enzyme-Mn2+ complexes. This synergism also accounts for the activation of N-acetyllactosamine synthesis by alpha-lactalbumin at low concentrations (less than 2 mM) of N-acetylglucosamine. An abortive enzyme-Mn2+-UDP-acceptor complex in the product release phase of the reaction appears to account for the inhibition of either lactose, or N-acetyllactosamine synthesis at a high concentration of either N-acetylglucosamine or glucose. This abortive complex is further stabilized by alpha-lactalbumin, thus the resulting substrate inhibition is observed at much lower acceptor concentrations in the presence of alpha-lactalbumin."

https://openalex.org/W1557733310,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.34) was purified from rat liver microsomes after solubilization by a slow freezing and thawing method. The purification was accomplished by a five-step procedure involving incubation at 37 degrees, ammonium sulfate fractionation, ultrafiltration, and column chromatography on Bio-Gel A-0.5m and Sephadex G-200. The specific activities of the purified enzyme preparations were up to 480 nmol of mevalonate formed/min/mg of protein, which represented an increase of 350-fold above that of the microsomes. The purified enzyme was found to be essentially homogeneous as evidences by the usual criteria. A subunit molecular weight of 120,000 was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On gel filtration a number of different molecular weight forms were observed which seem to be influenced by temperature, method of purification, and possibly an enzyme-Bio-Gel A-0.5m interaction. The solubilized enzyme consisted predominantly of a species with a molecular weight slightly greater than 200,000 by gel filtration and may be a dimer of two 120,000 subunits. The purified preparation contained lipids; the total cholesterol content was 18 mug/mg of enzyme protein and corresponds to a ratio of 5 mol of cholesterol/enzyme subunit of 120,000 daltons. The specificity of rabbit antiserum prepared against the purified enzyme was demonstrated by double diffusion analysis and quantitative precipitin reactions with solubilized enzyme. The antiserum, in addition to inhibiting the activity of solubilized enzyme also blocked the activity of intact microsomes. The microsomal HMG-CoA reductase is accessible to the antibody, indicating a localization of the enzyme on the outer cytoplasmic surface of the membranes. Intestinal microsomal HMG-CoA reductase was shown to cross-react with antibody to the liver enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1986631817,"BIOSYNTHESIS of prostaglandins (PGs) from unsaturated fatty acid precursors involves a complex sequence of reactions that seem to proceed rapidly in response to physiological stimuli. Studies in vitro have revealed a capacity for biosynthesis greater than would be expected from measures of tissue content1,2 or daily prostaglandin (PG) production3. Biosynthesis requires release of esterified precursor from tissue lipids4,5, and control of the hydrolytic event may be a major means of controlling PG biosynthesis (for example, in brain6 or spleen7). Another possible type of regulation is control of cyclo-oxygenase activity. Many chemical agents have been examined as modifiers of the PG-forming oxygenase (for example, reviews in refs 8 and 9). The enzyme can be inhibited by fatty acids10 although they appear only in limited amounts in the cytosol. In addition, inhibition of the oxygenation reaction has been observed in vitro with added glutathione peroxidase (GSP) and reduced glutathione (GSH)11–14. We have further investigated this form of enzymatic regulation, and propose that it inhibits by destroying an essential activator of the oxygenase which forms the PGs and thromboxanes."
https://openalex.org/W1539308691,"The characteristics of 5'-nucleotidase in a clonal line (C6) of rat glioma cells has been examined in detail. The cells liberated 6.80 +/- 0.33 mumol of inorganic phosphate/mg of cell protein/hour, producing nearly equimolar amounts of adenosine and inorganic phosphate from AMP in the extracellular fluid. No 5'-nucleotidase was released by the cells into the medium. Most of the 5'-nucleotidase activity was found to be located in the outer surface of the plasma membrane of C6 cells and rapidly accessible to exogenous AMP, by experiments based upon differential labeling of extracellular and intracellular compartments with 32P and 33P. The ecto-enzyme was active in the absence of divalent cations. However, Mn2+ or Co2+ were somewhat stimulatory. Zn2+ suppressed activity very markedly. The relationship of enzymatic reaction velocity to pH was complex, with an optimum at pH 7.4 for all substrates tested. The ecto-5'-nucleotidase readily hydrolyzed 5'-AMP and 5'-UMP. Other 5'-nucleoside monophosphates, including 5'-deoxy-AMP, were also hydrolyzed, but more slowly; 2'- or 3'-nucleoside monophosphates were not attacked. The ecto-5'-nucleotidase in the intact cell obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Apparent Km for AMP was 0.22 mM; apparent Km values for other substrates were similar and ranged from 0.16 to 0.18 mM. ADP exerted a very powerful inhibitory effect, behaving as a competitive inhibitor, and 5'-UMP behaved as a strictly competitive substrate for 5'-AMP. ATP and ITP were inhibitory. Of these, ITP served to increase Km for AMP. ATP did likewise, but also greatly lowered Vmax. These findings indicate that the intact cell is capable of rapid hydrolysis of exogenous 5'-AMP, to produce adenosine at the cell surface at a rate which responds directly to extracellular AMP concentration but which can be suppressed by extracellular ADP or ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1518372828,"Lindberg's combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques for the analysis of partially methylated alditol acetate sugar derivatives were used to study the structures of polysaccharides from the envelopes of heterocysts and spores of Anabaena cylindrica. Polysaccharides from both envelopes are highly branched. Glucose, mannose, galactose, and xylose are at terminal positions, whereas glucose and mannose are at internal positions in these polymers. The molar percentages of the 11 partially methylated alditol acetate derivatives observed were approximately the same for both envelopes, suggesting that the envelope polysaccharides may be identical or almost identical. Smith degradation (periodate oxidation followed by reduction with sodium borohydride and mild acid hydrolysis) of the polysaccharides from the two kinds of envelopes removes the side branches without measurable fragmentation of the backbones. Gas chromatographic analysis of partially methylated alditol acetate derivatives of the sugars showed that the backbones of both envelope polysaccharides consist of glucose (Glc) and mannose (Man) linked by 1 leads to 3 glycosidic bonds. Disaccharides, trisaccharides, and tetrasaccharides obtained from the backbone polysaccharides by partial acid hydrolysis were fractionated by column chromatography and separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis. Analysis of these oligosaccharides established that the backbone polysaccharides from both heterocysts and spores consist of repetitions of the structural unit Glc leads to Glc leads to Glc leads to Glc leads to Man, and that all linkages in the backbones are in the beta configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1641594889,"Transport of D-[3H]deoxyglucose and D-[3H]glucose by purified fat cell plasma membranes was markedly inhibited by cytochalasin B,dipyridamole, or phlorizin. The rate of L-[3H]glucose uptake was significantly slower and was unaffected by cytochalasin B. Both the rates of association of [3H]cytochalasin B with the fat cell plasma membrane and its dissociation from the membrane was significantly enhanced by the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Scatchard plot analysis of [3H]cytochalasin B binding to fat cell membranes indicated the presence of high affinity and low affinity sites which exhibited apparent dissociation constants of about 6 X 10(-7) M and 5 X 10(-6) M, respectively. The concentration of cytochalasin B which half-maximally inhibited D-glucose transport was about 5 X 10(-7) M, indicating the high affinity sites are involved in transport inhibition. D-Glucose at concentrations as high as 100 mM had no effect on the binding of [3H]cytochalasin B to these high affinity sites, while the transport inhibitors phlorizin, phloretin, and dipyridamole markedly inhibited this binding. The protein reagents N-ethylmaleimide, 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylbromide, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, dithiothreitol, and trypsin also reduced binding. Extracted fat cell plasma membrane lipids dispersed by sonication did not bind [3H]cytochalasin B nor take up glucose by a cytochalasin B-sensitive pathway. The results indicate that cytochalasin B inhibits hexose transport in fat cells secondary to its interaction with membrane protein sites distinct from those which bind D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1675506246,"Transport of labeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-H4PteGlu) and 5-methyl-H4PteGlu5 by Lactobacillus casei was via a carrier-mediated system. Both the natural (l) and unnatural (d) diastereoisomers were transported. Active transport was only demonstrated with the monoglutamate. Comparisons of growth rates with transport rates demonstrated that pteroypolyglutamates were more effectively utilized by L. casei than the monglutamate derivatives. The rate-limiting step in the utilization of higher polyglutamates was their transport into the cell, and in the case of the oxidized polyglutamates, their reduction. Utilization of monoglutamates was not limited by their transport but by metabolism, which also explains the different types of growth response curves observed between monoglutamates and higher polyglutamates. This phenomenon, sometimes called positive drift, prevents normalization of these growth curves. The rate-limiting step with the monoglutamates appears to be either the metabolism of 5-methyl-H4PteGlu or their conversion to polyglutamate forms."

Ribosomes from the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli translated synthetic poly(U,G) but ribosomes from the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum translated poly(U,G) very poorly, mRNA from Gram-negative bacteria was translated only in the presence of a high salt ribosomal wash containing initiation factors. mRNA from Gram-positive bacteria and synthetic poly(U,G) were translated much more efficiently when wash components were present, but were also translated to a small, but significant, extent in the absence of wash components. The translation specificity of each type of ribosome was independent of the source of ribosomal wash components. When the radioactively labeled products of in vitro protein synthesis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, it was found that each different bacterial and phage RNA preparation directed the synthesis of a unique set of polypeptide products of discrete sizes. Three different types of ribosomes were used to translate each of several Gram-positive bacterial messenger preparations; the overall patterns of products obtained with a given mRNA are similar, but some differences in the products formed or the relative amounts of the various products synthesized can be detected."

https://openalex.org/W1550858216,"The kinetic mechanism of ATP sulfurylase was established from initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead-end inhibition studies. In the forward direction, the reaction is steady state ordered, with MgATP=A, sulfate=B, MgPP1=P, and APS=Q.KmA=0.38 mM, Kia=0.71 mM, KmB=0.50 mM. Nitrate and chlorate are competive with sulfate and uncompetitive with MgATP. KiNO3-=0.25 mM; KiC1O3-= 0.15 mM. AMP and various MgATP analogs are competitive with MgATP and mixed-type inhibitors with respect to SO42-. The Ki for AMP is 0.55 mM. The reaction is rapid equilibrium ordered in the reverse direction with Kiq=0.3 to 1.0 muM and Kmp=0.65 muM. Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) exhibits competitive substrate inhibition (KIQ=0.3 mM). The ratio Vmaxf/Vmaxr is 0.018. In the forward direction the ratio VmaxMoO42-/VmaxSO42- is 20. The Keq at pH 8.0 and 30 degrees calculated from the Haldane equation is 6 X 10(-9) to 3.3 X 10(-8) (depending on the Kiq value chosen). The experimental Keq is about 2.5 X 10(-9). The fact that Vmax/Vmaxr is about 1 million times greater than Keq is consistent with the assumed physiological role of the enzyme (APS synthesis). The mechanistic basis of the ordered binding sequence was probed by multiple inhibition analysis. Dead-end inhibitors competitive with MgATP (such as free ATP, Mg alpha,beta-methylene ATP, CrATP, and CaATP) do not induce substrate inhibition by sulfate or alter the inhibition patterns displayed by nitrate. This result suggests (but does not prove) that catalytic action on MgATP must precede the formation of the sulfate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1575706813,"Incubation of purified skeletal muscle glycogen synthetase I with trypsin (10 mug/ml) for 15 min decreased the Stokes radius of the enzyme from 68 A to 62 A and the subunit molecular weight from 90,000 to about 73,000. No decrease in the sedimentation coefficient of 13.3 S could be detected. It was calculated that native synthetase I is a tetramer of molecular weight 360,000 to 370,000. Trypsin also catalyzed a decrease in the synthetase activity ratio (minus glucose-6-P to plus glucose-6-P) largely by reducing minus glucose-6-P activity. The magnitude of the trypsin effect on the synthetase activity ratio was very similar to that produced by phosphorylation of synthetase by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The activity ratio could be lowered from that characteristic of synthetase I, 0.85, to 0.25 either by trypsin digestion or by incorporation of 1 mol of Pi per mol of synthetase subunit. An activity ratio of less than 0.05 could be obtained in three ways as follows, (a) phosphorylation to 2 Pi/subunit, (b) phosphorylation to 1 Pi/subunit (ratio=0.25) followed by trypsin treatment, (c) trypsin treatment (ratio=0.25) followed by phosphorylation. When trypsinized synthetase was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, 1 Pi/subunit was incorporated. Trypsin (6 mug/ml) led to a rapid release of about 50% of the radioactivity from 32P-synthetase regardless of whether the enzyme contained 1 or 2 phosphates per subunit. It was concluded that two sites on the enzyme subunit are highly susceptible to phosphorylation catalyzed by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The data indicate that the 1st mol of Pi incorporated is distributed about equally between the two sites. A model is proposed to account for these observations. The data further indicate that a peptide containing one site is removed by trypsin. This reduces enzyme activity to the same extent as does phosphorylation of the site in the intact protein."

https://openalex.org/W1496939831,"The chromophore of C-phycocyanin, phycocyanobilin, was cleaved from the protein with methanol, concentrated hydrochloric acid, or subtilisin BPN'. The pigments obtained were converted to their dimethyl esters and purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography and examined for purity by analytical high pressure chromatography on silica gel. They were characterized by proton transfer and electron impact mass spectroscopy. The principal product obtained by the three cleavage procedures was phycocyanobilin. Methanol and hydrochloric acid adducts of phycocyanobilin were obtained with methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid cleavages, respectively. Methanol adduct formation of phycocyanobilin can occur subsequent to cleavage and requires acid catalysis. No adduct formation was observed with mesobiliverdin under similar conditions. These results and mass spectral data support the conclusion that adduct formation takes place at the exocyclic olefin linkage of ring A in phycocyanobilin. The ease of co-valent adduct formation strongly suggests that the ethylidene side chain is an important binding site of phycocyanobilin to the polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1585043062,"Pentasaccharide 6-sulfate and hexasaccharide 6-sulfate were prepared from chondroitin 6-sulfate. Each oligosaccharide was incubated with a chick cartilage microsomal enzyme preparation and UDP [14C] glucuronic acid and/or UDP-N-[3H] acetylgalactosamine. As previously reported by other investigators, a single sugar was added from UDP-[14C] glucuronic acid to the nonreducing end of pentasaccharide 6-sulfate and from UDP-N-[3H] acetylgalactosamine to the nonreducing end of hexasaccharide 6-sulfate. The labeled oligosaccharides were characterized by gel chromatography and degradation by chondroitinase ABC followed by identification of products. The oligosaccharides in concentrations above their Km inhibited chondroitin synthesis on endogenous primers, reinforcing the assumption that the enzymes involved in the additions to exogenous oligosaccharides are the same as those involved in chondroitin polymerization. When either the pentasaccharide 6-sulfate or hexasaccharide 6-sulfate was incubated in reaction mixtures containing both of the sugar nucleotides there was generally growth of oligosaccharide by two or three sugars. With longer incubation under conditions of limiting oligosaccharide concentration, as many as 14 to 16 sugars could be added but no further chondroitin polymerization took place. Addition of each sugar was shown to depend upon the concentration of appropriate acceptor but was otherwise independent of the addition of the alternate sugar. No paired addition of sugars was noted. It was concluded that two specific enzymes are involved in alternate additions of sugars to the oligosaccharides and that the two enzymes have no apparent interaction with one another. It is suggested that the rapid polymerization to form large chondroitin chains which previously has been shown to take place on endogenous primers is facilitated by interaction of the two enzymes with a component of the endogenous primer. This component is not present in the exogenous oligosaccharides since they do not serve in the same fashion as primers for polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W1552513992,"Bovine placental lactogen (bPL), a polypeptide hormone functionally related to bovine growth hormone (bGH) and bovine prolactin (bPL), has been isolated from placentas by pH and ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE- and CM-cellulose. The hormone has been purified to approximately 99% homogeneity, as determined by end group analysis. On disc gel electrophoresis at pH 9.0 bPL migrates as a pair of closely spaced bands (Rf = 09517 and 0.541) between the positions of bGH and bPR. Its molecular weight, as estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 6.5 mM dithiothreitol, is 22, 150 and its isoelectric point is 5.9. The amino acid composition of bPL closely resembles that of bGH and bPR except for a higher content of serine and glycine and a lower leucine content. Like bPR, it has 2 tryptophans and 6 cysteines, but its COOH-terminal sequence is identical with that of bGH: -Cys-Ala-Phe-OH. By Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, bPL forms lines of partial identity with bGH against bGH antisera and with ovine placental lactogen (oPL) against oPL antisera. In the bPL-antibPL system, oPL forms a line of partial identity while bGH and bPR do not cross-react. However, bPL does not form a precipitin line with bPR antisera. These data would indicate that in terms of structure, and hence molecular evolution, bPL and other subprimate placental lactogens occupy a position more intermediate between growth hormone and prolactin than do the primate placental lactogens."
https://openalex.org/W2121506892,"Hepatic citrate synthase activity has been shown to be increased 2- to 3-fold in vitamin B12 deficiency. Immunochemical titrations of the affinity chromatography-purified enzyme obtained from liver of animals with B12 deprivation demonstrated that this increase in activity was the result of a true increase in enzyme protein content. When fixed ratios of aliquots of normal and B12-deprived rat liver homogenates were mixed, the activity measured showed no change from the expected total citrate synthase activity based on the admixture ratios. Partial purification of the enzyme resulted in the expected recovery of the enzyme at each of the purification steps. Thus, it is unlikely that the change in enzyme activity in B12 deprivation was due to the presence of a soluble or easily dissociable normally occurring activator or inhibitor. Ouchterlony double diffusion studies, immunochemical titration, and determination of Km vlaues for exalacetate and acetyl-CoA (substrates for citrate synthase) and Ki values for ATP (inhibitor of citrate synthase) all indicated that the enzyme from the B12-deprived livers was structurally the same as that from normal liver. Hepatic citrate synthase degradation rate constants were shown to be essentially unchanged in B12deficiency. The rate of hepatic citrate synthase synthesis, under steady state conditions, was shown to be 2.8-fold greater in the B12-deficient animal than in the normal animal. The increased rate of synthesis appeared to explian the increased enzyme content. Finally, no change in specific activity of the enzyme was seen in brain, heart, or kidney in the B12-deprived animal."

https://openalex.org/W1533639832,"Spirochaeta aurantia possesses a phosphoenolpyruvate:mannitol phosphotransferase system which catalyzes the transmembrane transport and phosphorylation of mannitol. In vitro studies showed that both phosphoenolpyruvate and mannitol 1-phosphate could serve as phosphate donors. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent reaction required two soluble proteins, Enzyme SI and HPr, and an integral membrane complex, Enzyme SII. Only Enzyme SII was required for the mannitol 1-phosphate-dependent reaction. Enzyme II-dependent transphosphorylation of sugars was also demonstrated in eubacterial extracts. The results lead to the suggestion that the Enzyme II complexes of bacterial phosphotransferase systems possess nonoverlapping binding sites for sugar and sugar phosphate."

The evidence suggests a phylogenetic affinity between the cyanophytes and bacteria, such as Clostridium and Rhizobium, and the euglenoid flagellates, which also use the cofactor-dependent reductase. In contrast, the ribonucleotide reductase reaction in the few green algae surveyed shows no dependence on cobalamins."

We have used these antibodies as specific probes to study the roles that these polypeptides play in the in vitro replication of Qbeta RNA by the Qbeta replicase as well as the poly(C)-directed synthesis of poly(G) by this enzyme. The poly(C)-directed reaction is much less sensitive to antibody inhibition than is the Qbeta RNA-directed reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1486048801,"A protein factor, called PG-I, can be solubilized from toluene-treated Bacillus megaterium cells by LiCl extraction. After LiCl extraction, peptidoglycan synthesis by the toluene-treated cells is decreased. Protein PG-I can be added back to the extracted cells to stimulate peptidoglycan synthesis. This factor has now been purified 124-fold. It has a molecular weight of 42,000 as estimated by Sephadex gel filtration in the presence of 0.4 M KCl and 52,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. Periodate-Schiff staining of the polyacrylamide gel indicates that factor PG-I is a glycoprotein. The reconstitution of LiCl-extracted cells requires Mg2+ with an apparent Km of 1.9 X 10(-3) M. The Mg2+ ions can be replaced by Ca2+ and by Mn2+ ions to some extent; Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions had no effect. The available data suggest that factor PG-I is essential for peptidoglycan synthesis and requires at least one thiol group for stimulatory activity."

Incorporation of fatty acids into phosphatidylcholine is unaffected by A23187. This calcium-dependent stimulation of membrane phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acid turnover by A23187 may be related to the changes in erythrocyte membrane function induced by A23187 that have been observed previously."

https://openalex.org/W1490105743,"Homogenization of guinea pig liver in isotonic sucrose solution followed by the separation of the subcellular fractions by differential centrifugation releases the liver L-asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.1) activity into the supernatant fraction. Electron micrographs of the liver L-asparaginase-antibody complexes, precipitated from the clear supernatant phase by addition of L-asparaginase-specific antiserum, show membrane-liek structures and some amorphous material. The attachment of L-asparaginase to the membrane-like structures is indicated by the ferritin-labeled antibody technique. The immunoprecipitates possess low activities of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphodiesterase I, NADPH cytochrome c reductase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase. This observation suggests that L-asparaginase found in the liver supernatant fraction is associated with cytomembrane components. Analysis of guinae pig serum L-asparaginase-antibody complexes is polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gives three distinct protein bands. These bands correspond to heavy and light chains of rabbit immunoglobulins and the L-asparaginase subunits. Analysis of the liver L-asparaginase-antibody complexes by the above procedure shows similar but more diffuse protein bands."
