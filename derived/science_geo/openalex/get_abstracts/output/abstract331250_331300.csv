https://openalex.org/W2001557842,"Damage by insect herbivores to neighboring individuals of the shrub Piper arieianum in a neotropical wet forest varies greatly. This differential damage has a genetic basis and results in a 2-year decrease in growth, seed production, and seed viability, with larger plants recovering before smaller plants. The results provide evidence that leaf herbivores represent a potentially strong selective force for the evolution of plant defenses."
https://openalex.org/W1996074769,The mechanism of nonself recognition by the immune system of insects is unknown. In this report the activation of the prophenoloxidase system in the wax moth Galleria mellonella by a microbial product is shown to enhance the recognition of nonself material. These results explain previous observations of the interaction of two different blood cell populations in the cellular defense reactions of insects.

The source of these compounds is the atmospheric transport of dioxins and furans formed by combustion of domestic and chemical waste."

The design is unusually stable mechanically, and thus it should be possible to use the new cell to study most materials, including hydrogen, in the unexplored pressure region above 1 megabar."

Conservation of mechanical energy and momentum have been used to explain rebounding droplet interactions, and impaction criteria have been established regarding the absorption of droplet streams. Surface tension is the dominant mechanism governing the observed behavior. Single droplets were never observed to rebound."

It is measured in units of the mass of the sun, which is 2 x 10/sup 33/g: stars with masses very much less than, or very much more than the mass of the sun are relatively infrequent. The current theories of stellar structure and evolution derive their successes largely from the fact that the following combination of the dimensions of a mass provides a correct measure of stellar masses: natural constant = (hc/G)/sup 3/ /sup 2/ 1/H/sup 2/ approx. = 29.2 times the mass of sun where G is the constant of gravitation and H is the mass of hydrogen atom. There is an upper limit, M sub limit, to the mass of stars which can become degenerate configurations, as the last stage in their evolution; and stars with M > M sub limit must have end states which cannot be predicted from the considerations presented in this paper. For stars with mass less than 0.43 x the mass of the sun, the end stage of evolution can only be that of the white dwarfs. The inability of massive stars to become white dwarfs must result in the development ofmore » much more extreme conditions in their interiors and eventually in the onset of gravitational collapse attended by the supernova phenomena. Neutron stars or black holes form as the natural end products of stellar evolution of massive stars. 24 references, 7 figures, 2 tables.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2034842349,"Iridium and 26 other elements were determined in shale from the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary at the locus classicus (for iridium anomalies) at Woodside Creek, New Zealand. Iridium, gold, copper, cobalt, chromium, nickel, arsenic, molybdenum, and iron were enriched in the basal 2 millimeters of the 8-millimeter shale parting as compared with the rest of the stratigraphic column. No other shale partings in the column had anomalous concentrations of any element when the data were expressed on a carbonate-free basis. The boundary material showed striking compositional similarities with the Stevns Klint Danish boundary shale. Elemental concentrations were in general much higher in the New Zealand material than in nonboundary shales from elsewhere in the world. The high concentration of iridium (153 nanograms per gram) in the basal layer of the boundary, together with the enrichment of other siderophile elements supports the idea of an extraterrestrial source for much of the material. The iridium/gold ratio of 2.1 is also in accordance with such a source. The iridium content of the basal layer is higher than for any other marine boundary shale obtained on land. The integrated iridium value is 187 nanograms per square centimeter of boundary surface."
https://openalex.org/W2047908626,"The first two-dimensional images of the source region of Io's neutral sodium cloud have been acquired by ground-based observation. Observed asymmetries in its spatial brightness distribution provide new evidence that the cloud is supplied by sodium that is ejected nonisotropically from Io or its atmosphere. Complementary, high-time-resolution, calibrated image sequences that give the first comprehensive picture of the variations of the fainter regions of the cloud extending more than 105 kilometers from Io were also obtained. These data demonstrate that the cloud exhibits a persistent systematic behavior coupled with Io's orbital position, a distinct ""east-west orbital asymmetry,"" a variety of spatial morphologies, and true temporal changes. The geometric stability of the sodium source is also indicated. Isolation of the cloud's temporal changes constitutes an important milestone toward its utilization as a long-term probe of Io and the inner Jovian magnetosphere."

https://openalex.org/W87589488,"Europe's fusion research program is a successful example of international scientific and political collaboration, but a debate over the optimum strategy for fusion research bears many of the characteristics of the current US debate over budget priorities. At $560 million for the 1985-89 period, fusion is currently the largest single item in the European Economic Community Commission's proposed budget. A commitment to the full experimental exploitation of the Joint European Torus (JET) and support to research at laboratories run by national nuclear research organizations throughout Europe which are linked to the Euratom fusion program will retain their top priority. Cuts are likely to occur in the Next European Torus (NET) program. Member countries disagree on the importance of sticking to the original research timetable."

https://openalex.org/W2024807270,"The $46 million budget cut in the US magnetic fusion program introduced a new approach that abandons the race to build a working power reactor in favor of a long-term emphasis on science, technology, and international cooperation. Administration policies which favor private funding for demonstration projects and general concern over the deficit have changed the overall fusion policy, although there is some concern among research groups that the program will become unfocused without its detailed timetable. If this happens, they see the program becoming even more vulnerable to future budget cuts. 2 references."
