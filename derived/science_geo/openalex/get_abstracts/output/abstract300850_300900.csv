Recent fieldwork has ihdicated that much more intensive cultivation patterns were used than was previously thought. Data from the use of synthetic aperture radar in aerial surveys of the southern Maya lowlands suggest that large areas were drained by ancient canals that may have been used for intensive cultivation. Ground checks in several limited areas have confirmed the existence of canals, and excavations and ground surveys have provided valuable comparative information. Taken together, the new data suggest that Late Class period Maya civilization was firmly grounded in large-scale and intensive cultivation of swampy zones."

Material cross-reactive to antiserum prepared against the purified agglutinin is present in all alfalfa varieties that were tested but is absent in corn and other legumes not nodulated by Rhizobium meliloti. Studies with nonnodulating mutants of this microorganism incapable of binding to alfalfa roots suggest that the agglutinin is responsible for specific recognition between Rhizobium meliloti and alfalfa and that this recognition is an essential step in nodule formation."

Very hot sulfur ions have been detected in the Io torus with gyrospeeds comparable to the corotation speed, a phenomenon that would result from a neutral sulfur cloud. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that extensive neutral clouds of oxygen and sulfur exist in the Jupiter magnetosphere and that they are important sources of ions and energy for the Io torus."

The mechanism of the biological action is discussed in connection with this finding."
