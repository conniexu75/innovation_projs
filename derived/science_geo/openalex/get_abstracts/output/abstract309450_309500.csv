https://openalex.org/W2033018797,"The surface microstructures of c-axis-oriented films of YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7), deposited by off-axis magnetron sputtering on MgO and SrTiO(3) single crystal (100) substrates, have been investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. There is strong evidence that the films nucleate as islands and grow by adding material to the edge of a spirally rising step. This results in columnar grains, each of which contains a screw dislocation at its center. This microstructure may be of significance in determining superconducting properties such as critical current, and represents a significant difference between thin films (especially those grown in situ) and bulk materials."
https://openalex.org/W2094261541,"Microearthquake seismograms from the borehole seismic network on the San Andreas fault near Parkfield, California, provide three lines of evidence that first P arrivals are ""head"" waves refracted along the cross-fault material contrast. First, the travel time difference between these arrivals and secondary phases identified as direct P waves scales linearly with the source-receiver distance. Second, these arrivals have the emergent wave character associated in theory and practice with refracted head waves instead of the sharp first breaks associated with direct P arrivals. Third, the first motion polarities of the emergent arrivals are reversed from those of the direct P waves as predicted by the theory of fault zone head waves for slip on the San Andreas fault. The presence of fault zone head waves in local seismic network data may help account for scatter in earthquake locations and source mechanisms. The fault zone head waves indicate that the velocity contrast across the San Andreas fault near Parkfield is approximately 4 percent. Further studies of these waves may provide a way of assessing changes in the physical state of the fault system."
https://openalex.org/W2007150962,"Factors widely reported to explain record prison population increases since 1973 were generally not substantiated in national data. No clear evidence was found that prosecutors were increasingly using mandatory prison sentencing laws, that judges were imposing longer prison sentences than previously, or that parole boards were making prisoners serve longer before their first release. Changes since 1973 in population demographics and in police-recorded crime and arrest rates were found to have only a modest impact on prison population growth. The war on drugs was found to have only a small impact despite increased drug arrest and imprisonment rates. One change found to have a major impact was the increased chance of a prison sentence after arrest for nearly every type of crime. This change has helped to drive incarceration rates to their highest levels ever. Accompanying rising incarceration rates have been gradual reductions in U.S. crime rates after 1973, according to annual crime victimization surveys. The possibility that rising incarceration rates are helping to reduce crime must be weighed in debates about America's prisons."
https://openalex.org/W1965022073,"Nonequilibrium states of surface composition can be extremely long-lived when polymer chains adsorb competitively. In a model system (polymethylmethacrylate adsorbed from CCl(4) onto oxidized silicon previously saturated with polystyrene), it is shown that a weakly adsorbing polymer was sterically pinned to a surface by a more strongly adsorbing polymer. The dynamical evolution of the surface composition was strongly nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature; the phenomenology is analogous to bulk glasses. This interpretation offers a new mechanism to explain why weakly adsorbing chains may bind to surfaces, as well as a direction in which to look for a method to release them."
https://openalex.org/W2085526941,"The properties of glassy spherules found in sedimentary deposits of a late Pliocene asteroid impact into the southeast Pacific are similar to those of both microtektites and microkrystites. These spherules probably formed from molten silicate droplets that condensed from an impact-generate vapor cloud. The spherules contain inclusions of magnesioferrite spinels similar to those in spherules found at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, indicating that both sets of spherules are impact debris formed under similar physical and chemical conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2057433745,"An unusual distribution of particle sizes has been observed following the formation of molybdenum particles by argon ion sputtering. Many of the molybdenum particles produced by sputtering at the threshold pressure for particle formation in the vapor appear to be single crystalline cubes. There are two prominent peaks in the edge length distribution of the cubes, one centered at 4.8 nanometers with a halfwidth of approximately 1.3 nanometers and the other at 17.5 nanometers. The peak for the larger cubes is approximately square and has a total width of 7.0 nanometers. Evidence is presented that the larger cubes are formed by a 3 by 3 by 3 self-arrangement of the smaller cubes, which contain approximately 7000 atoms. Self-arrangement in inorganic structures is normally only observed when the building blocks are atoms, molecules, or clusters of less than 100 atoms."
