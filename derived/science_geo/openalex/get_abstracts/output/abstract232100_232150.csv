https://openalex.org/W2074106269,"Argonaute proteins and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the known signature components of the RNA interference effector complex RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). However, the identity of “Slicer,” the enzyme that cleaves the messenger RNA (mRNA) as directed by the siRNA, has not been resolved. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Argonaute protein from Pyrococcus furiosus at 2.25 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a crescent-shaped base made up of the amino-terminal, middle, and PIWI domains. The Piwi Argonaute Zwille (PAZ) domain is held above the base by a “stalk”-like region. The PIWI domain (named for the protein piwi) is similar to ribonuclease H, with a conserved active site aspartate-aspartate-glutamate motif, strongly implicating Argonaute as “Slicer.” The architecture of the molecule and the placement of the PAZ and PIWI domains define a groove for substrate binding and suggest a mechanism for siRNA-guided mRNA cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W2028613789,"A subset of quiescent memory CD4 T cells harboring integrated but transcriptionally silent proviruses poses a currently insurmountable barrier to the eradication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in infected patients. Induction of HIV gene expression in these latently infected cells by immune activating agents has been proposed as one approach to confer sensitivity to antiretroviral therapy. Interest has recently focused on the non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, prostratin, as a potential agent to activate latent HIV proviruses. Using multiple Jurkat T cell lines containing integrated but transcriptionally latent HIV proviruses (J-Lat cells), we now demonstrate that prostratin effectively activates HIV gene expression in these latently infected cells. We further show that prostratin acts by stimulating IKK-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, leading to the rapid nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in a κB enhancer-dependent manner. In contrast, NFAT and AP-1 are not induced by prostratin. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify host transcription factors recruited to the latent HIV-1 promoter in living cells, we find that prostratin induces RelA binding. Analysis of potential upstream signal transducers demonstrates that prostratin stimulates membrane translocation of classical, novel, and atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Studies with isoform-specific PKC inhibitors suggest that the novel PKCs play a particularly prominent role in the prostratin response. These findings provide new insights into the molecular pathway through which prostratin antagonizes HIV latency highlighting a central role for the action of NF-κB.

A small but clinically important fraction of CD4+ memory T cells in HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; ART, antiretroviral therapy; LTR, long terminal repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PMA, 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PKC, protein kinase C.1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; ART, antiretroviral therapy; LTR, long terminal repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PMA, 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PKC, protein kinase C.-infected patients contain integrated but transcriptionally inactive proviruses (1Chun T.W.

Nature. 1997; 387: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). These latently infected cells retain the ability to produce infectious virus following cellular activation by specific antigen or various cytokines (2Chun T.W. Stuyver L. Mizell S.B. Ehler L.A. Mican J.A. Baseler M. Lloyd A.L. Nowak M.A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13193-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The half-life of these CD4+ memory T cells is at least 44 months; consequently, elimination of this viral reservoir is projected to require administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 60 years (3Siliciano J.D. Kajdas J. Finzi D. Quinn T.C. Chadwick K. Margolick J.B. Kovacs C. Gange S.J. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 727-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 4Finzi D. Blankson J.

Med. 1999; 5: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the rebound viremia routinely observed in patients terminating effective ART probably involves viral reseeding from this long-lived latent reservoir. Indeed, studies examining the genetic characteristics of rebound virus have found substantial similarities between virus present in the latent pool and that emerging after cessation of therapy (5Zhang L. Chung C. Hu B.S. He T. Guo Y. Kim A.J. Skulsky E. Jin X. Hurley A. Ramratnam B. Markowitz M. Ho D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). New approaches to the elimination of these latently infected cells are urgently needed (6Pomerantz R.J. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 2002; 3: 1133-1137PubMed Google Scholar).One proposed strategy to eliminate this pool of latently infected cells is to purge the virus by activating the CD4+ memory lymphocytes in concert with ART administration (7Forsdyke D.R. Med. Hypotheses. 1991; 34: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, clinical efforts aimed at eliminating the pool of latently infected cells by induction with IL-2 or anti-CD3 OKT3 antibodies have yielded discouraging results (8Chun T.W. Engel D. Mizell S.B. Hallahan C.W. Fischette M. Park S. Davey Jr., R.T. Dybul M. Kovacs J.A. Metcalf J.A. Mican J.M. Berrey M.M. Corey L. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Nat.

Immunol. 2001; 21: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The failure of initial attempts to deplete the latently infected pool of CD4 T cells reflects in part our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing HIV latency. HIV latency is characterized by transcriptional inactivity, but the underlying cause of this inactivity remains unknown and may be multifactorial. The HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) is a well-characterized transcription regulatory element that contains DNA-binding domains for a broad range of transcription factors, including AP-1, NFAT, Sp1, and NF-κB (see Ref. 10Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar for a review). NF-κB and Sp1 have been demonstrated to be key factors in the stimulation of HIV replication, and viruses lacking binding sites for either factor display attenuated replicative capacity (11Leonard J. Parrott C. Buckler-White A.J. Turner W. Ross E.K. Martin M.A. Rabson A.B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of active NF-κB in the nuclei of quiescent memory CD4 lymphocytes could play a key role in promoting proviral latency in this lymphocyte subset.Study of the latently infected reservoir in vivo is greatly hampered by the fact that infected patients may contain only 105 to 106 latently infected CD4 memory T cells and that in their latent state these cells are virtually impossible to distinguish from uninfected CD4 memory T cells (12Blankson J.N. Persaud D. Siliciano R.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 557-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). We have employed a recently developed Jurkat T-cell model of postintegration HIV latency termed J-Lat (13Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). J-Lat T-cell clones are infected with full-length HIV proviruses and contain the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in lieu of Nef, thus permitting epifluorescence monitoring of viral transcriptional activity. Under basal conditions, little or no GFP expression is detected; however, transcriptional activation of the latent provirus leads to GFP expression, which can be detected at the single-cell level by flow cytometry. In contrast to other previously studied models of HIV latency where mutations have been detected in the HIV Tat gene or TAR element, the J-Lat cells contain wild-type Tat and TAR and appear to be highly representative of the latently infected cells present in vivo. Because multiple latently infected clones have been independently established, clone- and integration locus-specific phenotypes can be excluded.Recent interest has focused on prostratin, a nontumorigenic phorbol ester, as a potential antagonist of HIV latency (14Kulkosky J. Culnan D.M. Roman J. Dornadula G. Schnell M. Boyd M.R. Pomerantz R.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Korin Y.D. Brooks D.G. Brown S. Korotzer A. Zack J.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8118-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Prostratin is derived from the Samoan plant Homalanthus nutans and has been used in traditional medicine to treat yellow fever and other conditions (16Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5355-5360PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gustafson K.R. Cardellina 2nd, J.H. McMahon J.B. Gulakowski R.J. Ishitoya J. Szallasi Z. Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Weislow O.S. Beutler J.A. Buckheit R.W. Cragg G.M. Cox P.A. Bader J.P. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Early studies of prostratin demonstrated that this agent inhibits HIV replication in vitro at micromolar concentrations via down-regulation of the cellular HIV receptors CD4 and CXCR4 (14Kulkosky J. Culnan D.M. Roman J. Dornadula G. Schnell M. Boyd M.R. Pomerantz R.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Gulakowski R.J. McMahon J.B. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Gustafson K.R. Boyd M.R. Antiviral Res. 1997; 33: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that prostratin also promotes transcriptional activation of latent HIV proviruses in latently infected thymocytes present in the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model (15Korin Y.D. Brooks D.G. Brown S. Korotzer A. Zack J.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8118-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Prostratin may also not elicit the broader and less desirable changes in cellular activation associated with IL-2 and OKT3 therapies (15Korin Y.D. Brooks D.G. Brown S. Korotzer A. Zack J.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8118-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and thus may be clinically useful. Currently, the precise molecular basis of prostratin antagonism of HIV latency is unknown. We now describe a series of studies dissecting the mechanism of prostratin induction of latent HIV provirus in J-Lat cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—J-Lat clones 6.3, 8.4, 9.2, and 10.6 and sorted peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. Cells were stimulated with 0.1-10 μm prostratin (LC Laboratories), 10 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems), or 10 μm 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the presence or absence of 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for 8 or 14 h as indicated. For PKC inhibition studies, cells were incubated with 10-1000 nm Gö6983, 5 μm Gö6976 (Calbiochem), 5 μm Gö6850 (Biomol), or 100 nm TER14687 (Sigma) for 1 h prior to cellular activation.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells were expanded to 0.5 to 1 × 106 cells/ml and resuspended in serum-free RPMI at 4 × 107 cells/ml. 15 μg of expression vector DNA was added (adjusted with pCMV4 carrier DNA as necessary) to 0.4-ml aliquots of the cell suspension followed by electroporation (250 V, 950 microfarads in 0.4-cm cuvettes; Invitrogen) and resuspension in 6 ml of complete RPMI. Reporter plasmids containing the luciferase gene positioned immediately downstream of the full-length, ΔκB, ΔAP-1, or ΔSp1 LTR of HIV-1 or transcription cassettes containing tandem copies of the NFAT, NF-κB, AP-1, or Sp1 enhancers. These reporter plasmids were cotransfected with 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase expression vector (Promega) to monitor differences in transfection efficiency. 15-20 h after electroporation, cells were stimulated as indicated for 5 h at 37 °C. The dual luciferase assay system (Promega) was employed to measure resultant luciferase activity using a Wallac microbeta 1450 luminometer.Flow Cytometry Analysis and FACS—J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pMACS-Kk (H2Kk) and 13 μg of empty pCMV4 or pCMV4-IκBαSR expression vector DNA 48 h prior to stimulation. Transfected and nontransfected cells were stimulated as indicated for 14 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were stained with biotin-anti-H2Kk antibody, washed, and stained with streptavidin-APC (Pharmingen). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For intracellular anti-Gag immunostaining, J-Lat 9.2 cells were fixed in 4.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-p24 RD1 (Coulter) antibody in buffer containing 0.1% Triton for permeabilization. Samples were washed once and resuspended in PBS prior to analysis. Compensation was performed with monostained cultures. Data were analyzed with FloJo software (Treesoft). For FACS sorting experiments, J-Lat 9.2 cells were incubated with 2 μm prostratin or 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h, washed twice in complete medium, and incubated for an additional 24 h prior to FACS sorting on a FACS DIVA cell sorter. GFP-negative cells were collected and incubated in complete medium for 3 days, followed by incubation with either prostratin or TNF-α for 24 h. GFP expression was assessed by flow cytometry.Immunoblotting Analysis—J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with TNF-α or prostratin for various times. Cells were then lysed on ice in egg lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) for 20 min and clarified by microcentrifugation. Lysates were next added to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer (25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with various antibodies.In Vitro Kinase Assay—J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells were adjusted to 2 × 106 per ml in serum-free medium and stimulated with 10 μm prostratin, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, or 10 μm PMA for various times. Cells were lysed in egg lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-NEMO antibodies to isolate IKK-containing signalsomes as previously described (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (19Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were performed as described utilizing glutathione S-transferase-IκBα-(1-62) as an added exogenous substrate. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and exposed to HyperFilm at -80 °C. Following autoradiography, membranes were probed with anti-IKK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to determine the amounts of kinase immunoprecipitated in each sample.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells or sorted peripheral blood lymphocytes were adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or 2 μm prostratin for various times. After stimulation, nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (20Foehr E.D. Bohuslav J. Chen L.F. DeNoronha C. Geleziunas R. Lin X. O'Mahony A. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34021-34024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For analysis of κB enhancer binding proteins, 2.5 μl of the nuclear extracts were incubated with poly(dI-dC) and salmon sperm DNA for 10 min, followed by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled consensus κB or Oct-1 enhancer oligonucleotides (Promega). For supershift analysis, 2 μl of anti-p65 or anti-Hck polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-p50/p105 antiserum were added prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Samples were separated on nondenaturing gels and analyzed by autoradiography.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—J-Lat 6.3 and 9.2 T cells were adjusted to 1 × 107 cells/ml and stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or 2 μm prostratin for 30 or 45 min, respectively. Cells were incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by termination of the reaction with 125 mm glycine. Cells were washed twice in PBS and three times in run-on lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and resuspended in micrococcal nuclease reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were digested with 100 units of micrococcal nuclease for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 3 mm EGTA. DNA was then sheared by sonication to achieve an average size of 0.5-1 kb. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. For immunoprecipitations, 5 μl of anti-RelA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were mixed with 600 μl of extract for 2 h, followed by the addition of agarose protein A beads for 2 h. A nonspecific agarose protein A bead binding control performed in the absence of added antibody was included with each sample. Following incubation, beads were washed exhaustively, and proteins were eluted in elution buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) with a 15-min incubation at 60 °C. Eluates were digested with Pronase (Sigma) and de-cross-linked by incubation at 65 °C for 12 h. DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction, and PCR analysis was performed. For detection of the HIV-1 LTR, DNA oligonucleotide primers LTRκBprimer5 (5′-AGGTTTGACAGCCGCCTA-3′) and LTRκBprimer3 (5′-AGAGACCCAGTACAGGCAAAA-3′) specific for a 203-bp region encompassing the κB binding sites in the HIV LTR were used for PCR amplification. For detection of control β-actin DNA, two primers β-actin5 (5′-GTCGACAACGGCTCCGGC-3′) and β-actin3 (5′-GGTGTGGTGCCAGATTTTCT-3′) specific for a 239-bp region in the β-actin gene were used. 35 cycles of amplification were performed using Taq polymerase (Qiagen), and the products were analyzed on a 2.5% agarose gel. Images were acquired using an EagleEye digital camera.PKC Translocation Assay—J-Lat 6.3 cells were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with either 10 μm prostratin, 10 μm PMA, or 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 7 or 30 min. After stimulation, cells were washed in PBS and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 5 min on ice, followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Lysates were thawed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and cytosolic supernatant was collected. Remaining lysate pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and membrane extract supernatant was collected. Cytosolic and membrane extract preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with various isotype-specific anti-PKC antibodies (BD Biosciences).Isolation of Primary CD45RO+CD4+T-lymphocytes—Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from erythrocytes by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. CD4+ cells were isolated from PBMCs by negative selection bead sorting (Miltenyi). CD45RO+ T cells were subsequently sorted from this pool by FACS. >99% purity of CD45RO+, CD4+, and CD3+ sorted cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis.RESULTSProstratin Induces HIV Gene Transcription in Latently Infected J-Lat T Cells—To examine the effect of prostratin in a lymphocyte-based model of HIV postintegration latency, J-Lat clones 6.3, 8.4, 9.2, and 10.6 were incubated for 14 h with 10 μm prostratin, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, or 0.1% Me2SO as a buffer control. In the absence of stimulation, J-Lat 6.3, 8.4, and 9.2 cells expressed virtually no GFP, whereas J-Lat 10.6 cells were ∼4% positive, indicating low-level HIV gene expression (Fig. 1A, left column). Following treatment with prostratin, GFP expression was induced to various and characteristic degrees in each of the four J-Lat T cell lines (Fig. 1A, right column). Of note, a higher proportion of J-Lat 10.6 cells displayed GFP epifluorescence following prostratin stimulation. TNF-α activated GFP expression in each of the latently infected cell lines to levels comparable with that induced by prostratin. Short term (<24-h) prostratin treatment induced little or no toxicity as assessed by the forward and side light scattering properties of the treated cells (data not shown). Prolonged exposure to prostratin (>2 days), however, induced substantial growth arrest and cell death at concentrations greater than 500 nm (data not shown). To more precisely define the dose-response relationship for prostratin, J-Lat 9.2 cells were stimulated with 0.1-10 μm concentrations of the agonist. Prostratin induced latent HIV LTR-driven expression of GFP at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm, with minimal toxicity (Fig. 1B). When concentrations of prostratin higher than 10 μm were tested, increased short-term toxicity was observed (data not shown).Because the GFP gene is substituted for the early expressed Nef gene of HIV-1 in the J-Lat model, we investigated whether prostratin also activated HIV late gene expression. Following 14 h of stimulation with prostratin or TNF-α, immunostaining for intracellular Gag expression revealed expression of this Rev-dependent late gene product in a majority of the GFP positive subset of cells (Fig. 1C). Together, these studies demonstrate that prostratin induces dose-dependent transcriptional activation of the latent HIV provirus present in four independently derived J-Lat cell lines. Further, prostratin stimulation leads to expression of both early and late HIV gene products. However, at high doses or after prolonged exposure, prostratin induces cytotoxic effects.Both prostratin and TNF-α induce GFP expression in only a subset of the J-Lat cells. Given that the J-Lat cell lines are clonal, the nonuniform response of these lines to activating stimuli suggested a variegated response. However, it was unclear whether the unresponsive cells were permanently inactivated or able to undergo activation in a second round of stimulation. To distinguish between these possibilities, J-Lat 9.2 cells were incubated with either prostratin or TNF-α, and the initially unresponsive cells were purified and stimulated in a second round with prostratin or TNF-α. In parallel, previously unstimulated, unsorted J-Lat 9.2 cells were stimulated with prostratin or TNF-α. The second round of either prostratin or TNF-α stimulation induced GFP expression in ∼20% of originally nonresponsive cells, a fraction that was equivalent to that observed in the previously unstimulated cells (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that an increasingly greater proportion of the entire J-Lat cell population is activated by serial stimulation, with the fractional response during each cycle remaining constant.Prostratin Activation of the HIV LTR Is Mediated through NF-κB—We next explored the signaling pathway activated by prostratin in J-Lat cells that mediates activation of the latent HIV proviruses. The HIV-1 LTR contains binding sites for several inducible transcription factors, including NF-κB, NFAT, AP-1, and Sp1 (10Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of prostratin on the induction of these transcription factors, J-Lat 9.2 cells were transfected with NF-κB-, AP-1-, Sp1-, or NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmids and stimulated with either 2 μm prostratin, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 10 μm PMA, or combinations of PMA and 1 μm ionomycin. Prostratin activated the NF-κB- and AP-1-responsive reporter constructs but failed to activate the Sp1 or NFAT luciferase reporters (Fig. 2A). The magnitude of the NF-κB response to prostratin was less than that obtained with PMA either added alone or in combination with ionomycin but was comparable with TNF-α.Fig. 2Prostratin activates the HIV-1 LTR through induction of NF-κB.A, prostratin activates κB- and AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmids. J-Lat 9.2 cells were transfected with κB-, AP-1-, Sp1-, or NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and stimulated with 2 μm prostratin, TNF-α, PMA, or a combination of PMA and ionomycin. Luciferase activity was measured 5 h later. The error bars indicate S.D. Note that prostratin activates the κB and AP-1 reporter plasmids but not the Sp1 or NFAT reporter plasmids. Similar results were obtained in JLat 6.3 cells. B, an HIV LTR lacking the κB enhancers is not induced by prostratin. J-Lat 9.2 cells were transfected with HIV1-LTR-, HIV1-LTRΔκB-, HIV1-LTRΔ AP-1-, and HIV1-LTRΔSp1-luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and 14 h later were stimulated with 2 μm prostratin, TNF-α, PMA, or PMA/ionomycin. Luciferase activity was measured after 5 h of stimulation. The error bars depict S.D. Note the lack of prostratin activation of the HIV1-LTRΔκB reporter plasmid. Similar results were obtained in J-Lat 6.3 cells. C, prostratin induction of the HIV LTR is not inhibited by cyclosporin A. J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells were preincubated with cyclosporin A for 1 h followed by stimulation with 2 μm prostratin, TNF-α, PMA, or PMA/ionomycin. Note that the prostratin response is not inhibited by cyclosporin A, whereas the PMA/ionomycin response is partially impaired, suggesting a component of NFAT-mediated stimulation under these conditions of activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess more directly the role of NF-κB/Rel factors in prostratin activation of the HIV LTR, J-Lat 9.2 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing either the wild type HIV-1 LTR, the LTR lacking the two κB enhancers, the LTR lacking the AP-1 enhancers, or the LTR lacking the Sp1 enhancers. Prostratin induced 4-fold stimulation of the HIV-LTR-Luc reporter relative to unstimulated controls (Fig. 2B) but failed to activate the HIV-LTRΔκB-Luc reporter. However, co-incubation with PMA and ionomycin stimulated luciferase activity with this ΔκB reporter, indicating the induction of a non-NF-κB/Rel transcription factor with LTR-activating properties. Additionally, prostratin induced ∼2.5-fold stimulation of the HIV-LTRΔAP-1 and HIV-LTRΔSp1 reporters, indicating that neither AP-1 nor Sp1 is required for HIV LTR responsiveness to prostratin. Together, these findings support a central role for NF-κB/Rel induction in prostratin-mediated activation of the latent HIV LTR and exclude a necessary role of AP-1 and Sp1.Because NFAT has been implicated in the activation of the LTR involving a site overlapping the κB sites (21Bassuk A.G. Anandappa R.T. Leiden J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3563-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we further tested the potential involvement of NFAT as a mediator of prostratin antagonism of HIV latency by treating cells with cyclosporin A. This agent blocks the activation of NFAT by antagonizing calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT (22Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). J-Lat 6.3 or 9.2 cells were preincubated with cyclosporin A or with medium containing comparable quantities of Me2SO used to dissolve cyclosporin A and then stimulated with prostratin, TNF-α, PMA, or combinations of PMA and ionomycin for 14 h, followed by assessment of GFP expression. Prostratin, TNF-α, and PMA each induced strong GFP responses, and these responses were not impaired by the addition of cyclosporin A (Fig. 2C). Conversely, combined stimulation of these cells with PMA and ionomycin induced higher levels of GFP expression than observed with PMA alone, and this response was partially inhibited by cyclosporin A. These findings suggest that NFAT induction plays a role in the activation of latent HIV provirus in J-Lat cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. The cyclosporin-resistant component of HIV proviral activation observed in these cells probably reflects the induction and action of NF-κB/Rel factors. These findings support a central role for NF"
https://openalex.org/W2075325752,"Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a pluripotent cytokine whose major biological effects are mediated through a pathway in which STAT1 is the predominant and essential transcription factor. STAT3 can also be activated weakly by IFNγ, but the mechanism of activation and function of STAT3 as a part of the interferon response are not known. Here we show that STAT3 activation is much stronger and more prolonged in STAT1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts than in wild-type cells. In response to IFNγ, SRC-family kinases are required to activate STAT3 (but not STAT1) through tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the receptor-bound kinases JAK1 and JAK2 are required to activate both STATs. Tyrosine 419 of the IFNγ receptor subunit 1 (IFNGR1) is required to activate both STATs, suggesting that STAT1 and STAT3 compete with each other for the same receptor phosphotyrosine motif. Activated STAT3 can replace STAT1 in STAT1-null cells to drive the transcription of certain genes, for example, socs-3 and c/ebpδ, which have γ-activated sequence motifs in their promoters. Work from Ian Kerr's laboratory reveals that the gp130-linked interleukin-6 receptor, which usually activates STAT3 predominantly, activates STAT1 efficiently when STAT3 is absent (Costa-Pereira, A. P., Tininini, S., Strobl, B., Alonzi, T., Schlaak, J. F., Is'harc, H., Gesualdo, I., Newman, S. J., Kerr, I. M., and Poli, V. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 8043–8047). Because STAT1 and STAT3 have opposing biological effects (STAT3 is an oncogene, and STAT1 is a tumor suppressor), the reciprocal activation of these two transcription factors in response to IFNγ or interleukin-6 suggests that their relative abundance, which may vary substantially in different normal cell types, under different conditions or in tumors is likely to have a major impact on how cells behave in response to different cytokines. Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a pluripotent cytokine whose major biological effects are mediated through a pathway in which STAT1 is the predominant and essential transcription factor.

The major biological responses to interferon-γ (IFNγ), 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GAS, γ-activated sequence; JAK, Janus kinase; IFNGR1, IFNγ receptor subunit 1; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; IP-10, interferon-inducible protein 10; SOCS-3, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3; C/EBPδ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ; SH2, Src homology domain 2; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; IL, interleukin. including inhibition of proliferation, antiviral responses, immune modulation, and tumor suppression, are mediated through the well known JAK-STAT pathway (1Stark G.R.

Biochemical and genetic studies show that STAT1 plays a critical role in IFNγ-dependent signaling, and cells lacking STAT1 are defective in IFN-mediated antiviral activity. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active STAT1 mutant protein can enhance IFNγ-induced antiproliferative activity (4Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of STAT1-null mice also demonstrate that STAT1 is the major transcription factor in IFNγ-dependent signaling (5Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar, 6Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C.

However, recent work reveals that additional signals are required for the full range of responses to IFNγ (7Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). First, expression of the c-myc gene was induced in STAT1-null cells but suppressed in wild-type cells, revealing an alternative pathway activated by IFNγ (8Ramana C.V. Grammatikakis N. Chernov M. Nguyen H. Goh K.C. Williams B.R. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Second, microarray analysis showed that a number of genes are regulated by IFNγ in STAT1-null primary bone marrow-derived macrophages or mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (9Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Han Y. Ransohoff R.M. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6674-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B. Stark G.R. Virgin H.W. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Third, the physiological relevance of the STAT1-independent responses to IFNγ has been demonstrated in vivo: IFNγ induced the proliferation and survival of primary bone marrow cells from STAT1-null mice but not wild-type mice, and STAT1-null mice are more resistant to infection with murine cytomegalovirus or sindbis viruses than are mice lacking both type I and type II IFN receptors (10Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B. Stark G.R. Virgin H.W. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection selectively inhibits the transcriptional responses to IFNγ without inhibiting STAT1 function (11Kincaid E.Z. Ernst J.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently, IκB kinases have been shown to be required for activation of a subset of IFNγ-stimulated genes, and this requirement is independent of NFκB activation. Furthermore, STAT1 activation is not impaired in IκB kinase α/β-null MEFs in response to IFNγ (12Sizemore N. Agarwal A. Das K. Lerner N. Sulak M. Rani S. Ransohoff R. Shultz D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7994-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). STAT1-independent pathways are also important for responses to type I interferon. During viral infection IFNα/β negatively regulates IFNγ production through STAT1, and in the absence of STAT1, type I interferons promote IFNγ production (13Nguyen K.B. Cousens L.P. Doughty L.A. Pien G.C. Durbin J.E. Biron C.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, STAT1 deficiency leads to earlier onset and more severe neurological disease with increased lethality in response to IFNα. Thus, in the absence of STAT1, alternative signaling pathways mediate pathophysiological actions of IFNα in the living brain (14Wang J. Schreiber R.D. Campbell I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16209-16214Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Type I interferon can also inhibit interleukin-7 (IL-7)-mediated growth or survival of T and B lymphoid progenitors through a STAT1-independent pathway (15Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Schreiber R.D. Cooper M.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang Z. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is likely that type I interferon activates at least two alternative pathways independently of STAT1; one is normally undetectable or inhibited when STAT1 is present (13Nguyen K.B. Cousens L.P. Doughty L.A. Pien G.C. Durbin J.E. Biron C.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14Wang J. Schreiber R.D. Campbell I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16209-16214Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the other is effective whether STAT1 is present or not (15Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Schreiber R.D. Cooper M.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang Z. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the IFNγ-induced, STAT1-independent signaling is clear, the mechanism is not. Previous studies showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its effector kinase AKT (17Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (18Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Mitani Y. Miyazaki T. Fujii H. Sato M.

Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) are activated by IFNγ, but their activities are involved in the serine phosphorylation of STAT1, which in turn is important for its maximum transcriptional activation (21Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). STAT1 and STAT3 have similar structures, both are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon cytokine or growth factor stimulation, and both form dimers through the reciprocal SH2 domain/phosphotyrosine interactions, move to the nucleus, bind to γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements, and activate transcription of many genes (2Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 22Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat Rev Mol. Cell.

STAT1 and STAT3 dimers bind selectively to very similar but not identical elements (24Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 25Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to the tumor suppressor function of activated STAT1 (26Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y.

Here, we report that, in the absence of STAT1, IFNγ activates STAT3 strongly, SRC-family kinases are required for the activation, and the activated STAT3 can drive the expression of some genes that normally respond to activated STAT1 in IFNγ-treated wild-type cells. Constructs—Plasmids expressing murine IFNGR1 and IFNGR1Y-419F were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Schreiber (Washington University, St. Louis, MO); IFNGR1 and IFNGR1Y419F cDNAs were subcloned into pBABEpuro3. Mutations of tyrosine residues Tyr-285 and Tyr-370 in the cytoplasmic domain to phenylalanines were generated by PCR-splicing overlapping extension using the Y285F mutagenic forward primer, 5′-CTGAATCGAAGTTTTCACTTGTCAC-3′, reverse mutagenic primer, 5′-GTGACAAGTGAAAACTTCGATTCAG-3′, Y370F forward mutagenic primer, 5′-GCCTCACCGCCTTTCACTCCCGAAAC-3′, and reverse mutagenic primer, 5′-GTTTCGGGAGTGAAAGGCGGTGAGGC-3′.

The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with XhoI and BglII, and ligated into pBABEpuro3. The identity of each plasmid has been confirmed by DNA sequencing. The tyrosine residues are numbered according to Hemmi et al. (42Hemmi S. Peghini P. Metzler M. Merlin G. Dembic Z. Aguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biological Reagents and Cell Culture—Recombinant murine IFNγ (Pepro Tech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) was used at 1000 IU/ml, and SU6656 (Calbiochem) was used at 2 μm. Bosc cells (American Type Culture Collection), primary wild-type or STAT1-null MEFs, immortalized wild-type or STAT1-null MEFs (obtained from Dr. Robert D. Schreiber, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), JAK1-null MEFs (obtained from Dr. Schreiber), JAK2-null MEFs (obtained from Dr. James N. Ihle, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), IFNGR1-null MEFs (obtained from Dr. Schreiber), STAT3-null MEFs (obtained from Dr. David E. Levy, New York University, New York, NY), and SYF fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Virus-infected cells were maintained in complete medium plus 2 μg/ml puromycin. Retroviral Infection—Bosc packaging cells were transfected transiently with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the supernatant medium was collected, filtered through sterile 0.2-μm syringe filters, and used to infect the target cells in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After 24 h, the cells were fed with fresh complete medium. After 48 h, the infected cells were trypsinized and seeded at a dilution of 1:10 to 1:100 in complete medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Oligonucleotide Microarrays—STAT1-null MEFs were treated with IFNγ for 2 or 4 h, and total RNA was prepared by using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). cRNAs were prepared and hybridized to murine genome arrays (Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 chips) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, San Jose, CA). The stained arrays were read and analyzed by using an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner and the accompanying software. Western Analyses—After treatment, cells at 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell extracts were fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The following antibodies were used for Western analyses: anti-phospho-Tyr-701 STAT1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-N-terminal STAT1 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-Tyr-705 STAT3 (Cell Signaling), anti-STAT3 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-JAK2 (BIOSOURCE), anti-IFNGR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin (Neomarkers). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin was used for visualization using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro SRC Kinase Assay—After treatment, cells at 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C using sequential incubations with c-SRC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with icecold lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol), then incubated with kinase reaction buffer and substrates ATP (20 μm) and [32P]ATP (1 μm) (Amersham Biosciences) and enolase (5 μg; Sigma). The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated SRC and enolase were visualized by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Cells at 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were stimulated with IFNγ for 20 min and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells in hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) with 5 μg of poly(dI-dC). A 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides –75 to –55 of the SOCS-3 promoter (5′-75CAGTTCCAGGAATCGGGGGGC55-3′) was used as a probe (60,000 cpm, 5 fmol per reaction mixture for 20 min). For supershift experiments, 2 μg of polyclonal anti-STAT-1 p84/p91 (Santa Cruz) or anti-STAT-3 (Santa Cruz) was added to the preincubation reaction, with incubation for an additional 10 min at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed in a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× 45 mm Tris, 32 mm boric acid, 1.25 mm EDTA, and the gels were dried before autoradiography. Northern Analyses—Total RNA was isolated by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (15 μg) was denatured, separated by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). socs-3, ip-10, c/ebpδ, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) mRNAs were detected with cDNAs labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by nick translation using the DNA megaprime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by autoradiography. Luciferase Assay—The murine socs-3 promoter constructs, clone 6 and clone 6M, were kindly provided by Dr. Shlomo Melmed (Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA). For transient transfections, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates, incubated for 24 h, and transfected by using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) with 0.5 μg of clone 6 or clone 6M and 0.1 μgof pSV-β-galactosidase. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with IFNγ for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Results are shown for one of at least three independent experiments. Phosphorylation of STAT3 in Response to IFNγ—STAT3 is phosphorylated transiently in response to IFNγ in wild-type MEFs, but its phosphorylation is much stronger and more prolonged in STAT1-null cells (Fig. 1). When STAT1 was reexpressed in STAT1-null cells, the intensity of STAT3 phosphorylation was again attenuated (data not shown). Note the very strong induction of STAT1 expression in wild-type cells treated with IFNγ for 6 or 16 h and the higher levels of STAT3 in STAT1-null cells. Previous work has demonstrated that STAT3 is a substrate for SRC (38Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). To test for SRC activation in response to IFNγ, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with SRC immunoprecipitated from IFNγ-treated wild-type or STAT1-null MEFs (Fig. 2A). IFNγ treatment increased both the autophosphorylation of SRC and the SRC-dependent phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate enolase. The requirements for JAK1 and JAK2 were checked in the same in vitro kinase assay; SRC is not activated in response to IFNγ in JAK1- or JAK2-null cells, although higher basal SRC activities were observed (Fig. 2B). To determine whether SRC mediates the activation of STAT3 in response to IFNγ, we performed Western analyses of cells pretreated with the SRC inhibitor SU6656 (44Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 45Bowman T. Broome M.A. Sinibaldi D. Wharton W. Pledger W.J. Sedivy J.M. Irby R.

IFNγ induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 in both wild-type and STAT1-null cells treated with the Me2SO solvent only, and this phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by SU6656 (Fig. 3A). We also tested SYF cells, which lack the three SRC-family members, SRC, FYN, and YES. Western analysis showed that, in response to IFNγ, STAT3 phosphorylation was abolished in SYF cells, whereas the activation of JAK2 and STAT1 was intact (Fig. 3B). When SRC was put back into SYF cells, the basal level of STAT3 phosphorylation increased, and treatment with IFNγ caused a further increase (Fig. 3B). Cells with kinase-dead SRC behaved the same as cells infected with the vector only. Together, the data indicate that IFNγ activates STAT3 through SRC in a manner that requires both JAK1 and JAK2.Fig. 3SRC-family kinases are required for STAT3 activation in response to IFNγ. A, wild-type (WT) or STAT1-null MEFs were pretreated with solvent (Me2SO (DMSO)) or SU6656 for 30 min before being stimulated with IFNγ for 20 min. Total cell extracts were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the Western method for activated, phosphorylated STAT3 (pYSTAT3) and STAT1 (pYSTAT1). B, SYF cells lacking SRC, FYN, and YES were infected with empty vector pBABEpuro3 or wild-type or a kinase-dead (KD) mutant of SRC in pBABEpuro3; stable pools were generated. Cells were exposed to IFNγ, total cell extracts were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the Western method for activated, phosphorylated STAT3 (pYSTAT3), JAK2 (pY-JAK2), and STAT1 (pYSTAT1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tyrosine 419 of Murine IFNGR1 Is Required for the Activation of Both STAT1 and STAT3 in Response to IFNγ—Previous work has shown that tyrosine 419 of murine IFNGR1 is required for STAT1 activation in response to IFNγ (43Woldman I. Varinou L. Ramsauer K. Rapp B. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45722-45728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether the same site is also required for STAT3 activation, IFNGR1-null MEFs reconstituted with various receptor mutants were tested. Western analyses showed that STAT3 activation was observed only in cells expressing wild-type or mutant Tyr-419, in which residue 419 is the only tyrosine remaining in the cytoplasmic domain of IFNGR1 (Fig. 4). Mutation of Tyr-419 to phenylalanine abolished the activation of both STAT3 and STAT1. Tyr-419 is absolutely required for the activation of both STAT3 and STAT1 in response to IFNγ, and therefore, we conclude that these two STATs compete for this phosphorylated binding site on IFNGR1. Identification of Genes Regulated by IFNγ in STAT1-null MEFs—About 30 genes were found to be induced by IFNγ in serum-starved STAT1-null MEFs (9Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Han Y. Ransohoff R.M. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6674-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In our previous work, serum starvation was used to allow genes induced rapidly by growth factors to be observed. To analyze the response in the presence of serum, we performed another array experiment. Total RNA samples were prepared from STAT1-null MEFs treated with IFNγ for 2 or 4 h and analyzed by using murine U74Av2 arrays (Affymetrix), which contain sequences corresponding to about 6000 known genes. Eleven genes were induced within 2 h, and an additional six genes were induced after 4 h (Table I). The induction of most of these genes was confirmed by Northern analysis (Table I). For the genes induced at 4 h, induction might be due to secondary rather than primary effects. Many of these genes had been identified previously as induced in serum-starved cells (9Ramana C.V.

These compounds play an important role in nucleic acid function due to their binding to DNA and RNA. It has been shown that biogenic polyamines cause DNA condensation and aggregation similar to that of inorganic cobalt(III)hexamine cation, which has the ability to induce DNA conformational changes. However, the nature of the polyamine.DNA binding at the molecular level is not clearly established and is the subject of much controversy. In the present study the effects of spermine, spermidine, putrescine, and cobalt(III)hexamine on the solution structure of calf-thymus DNA were investigated using affinity capillary electrophoresis, Fourier transform infrared, and circular dichroism spectroscopic methods. At low polycation concentrations, putrescine binds preferentially through the minor and major grooves of double strand DNA, whereas spermine, spermidine, and cobalt(III)hexamine bind to the major groove. At high polycation concentrations, putrescine interaction with the bases is weak, whereas strong base binding occurred for spermidine in the major and minor grooves of DNA duplex. However, major groove binding is preferred by spermine and cobalt(III)hexamine cations. Electrostatic attractions between polycation and the backbone phosphate group were also observed. No major alterations of B-DNA were observed for biogenic polyamines, whereas cobalt(III)hexamine induced a partial B --> A transition. DNA condensation was also observed for cobalt(III)hexamine cation, whereas organic polyamines induced duplex stabilization. The binding constants calculated for biogenic polyamines are K(Spm) = 2.3 x 10(5) M(-1), K(Spd) = 1.4 x 10(5) M(-1), and K(Put) = 1.02 x 10(5) M(-1). Two binding constants have been found for cobalt(III)hexamine with K(1) = 1.8 x 10(5) M(-1) and K(2) = 9.2 x 10(4) M(-1). The Hill coefficients indicate a positive cooperativity binding for biogenic polyamines and a negative cooperativity for cobalt(III)hexamine."

https://openalex.org/W2149974992,"Scaling laws express a systematic and universal simplicity among complex systems in nature. For example, such laws are of enormous significance in biology. Scaling relations are also important in the physical sciences. The seminal 1986 discovery of high transition-temperature (high-T_c) superconductivity in cuprate materials has sparked an intensive investigation of these and related complex oxides, yet the mechanism for superconductivity is still not agreed upon. In addition, no universal scaling law involving such fundamental properties as T_c and the superfluid density \rho_s, a quantity indicative of the number of charge carriers in the superconducting state, has been discovered. Here we demonstrate that the scaling relation \rho_s \propto \sigma_{dc} T_c, where the conductivity \sigma_{dc} characterizes the unidirectional, constant flow of electric charge carriers just above T_c, universally holds for a wide variety of materials and doping levels. This surprising unifying observation is likely to have important consequences for theories of high-T_c superconductivity."

We showed that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-deficient cells were largely resistant to apoptosis induced by both staurosporine (STS) and B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. Expression of either the wild-type IP3R1 or an N-terminal deletion mutant (Δ1-225) that lacks inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release activity restored sensitivity to apoptosis and the consequent rise in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Expression of caspase-3-non-cleavable mutant receptor, however, dramatically slowed down the rate of apoptosis and prevented both Ca2+ overload and secondary necrosis. Conversely, expression of the “channel-only” domain of IP3R1, a fragment of the receptor generated by caspase-3 cleavage, strongly increased the propensity of the cells to undergo apoptosis. In agreement with these observations, caspase inhibitors impeded apoptosis and the associated rise in [Ca2+]i. Both the staurosporine- and B-cell receptor-induced apoptosis and increase in [Ca2+]i could be induced in nominally Ca2+-free and serum-free culture media, suggesting that the apoptosis-related rise in [Ca2+]i was primarily because of the release from internal stores rather than of influx through the plasma membrane. Altogether, our results suggest that IP3R1 plays a pivotal role in apoptosis and that the increase in [Ca2+]i during apoptosis is mainly the consequence of IP3R1 cleavage by caspase-3. These observations also indicate that expression of a functional IP3R1 per se is not enough to generate the significant levels of cytosolic Ca2+ needed for the rapid execution of apoptosis, but a prior activation of caspase-3 and the resulting truncation of the IP3R1 are required.

Apoptosis is a highly regulated and evolutionarily conserved form of cell death that plays an important role in normal embryonic development and maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis (1Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death involves a characteristic sequence of morphological and biochemical features (2Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar, 3Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Most, but not all, forms of apoptotic cell death processes are characterized by the activation of a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases called caspases that cleave a wide range of cellular proteins leading to the manifestation of the major phenotypes in apoptosis (4Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). Early studies of glucocorticoid-induced cell death suggested that an increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was a key component of the apoptotic process (5Kaiser N. Edelman I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Various reports have since then established that a prolonged and up-regulated intracellular Ca2+ signal is a general feature of apoptosis (6McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Amador-Perez J.F. Orrenius S. Jondal M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1801-1806PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 8Berridge M.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). Apoptosis-related cleavage of a range of regulatory proteins and ion channels seems to be common to many apoptotic paradigms. During apoptosis, caspase-3, the main effector caspase, cleaves a wide array of cellular proteins including many that play significant roles in intracellular Ca2+ regulation such as the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (10McGinnis K.M.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Caspase cleavage could bring about a gain or loss of function on the target proteins leading to aberrant intracellular Ca2+ regulation that can directly influence the commitment of cells to apoptosis. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; BCR, B-cell antigen receptor; IICR, IP3-induced Ca2+ release; IP3R-KO cells, DT40 cells lacking all three IP3R isoforms; STS, staurosporine; WT-, wild-type; F, farad; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. receptors (IP3Rs) are ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ release channels, and their involvement in apoptosis has been demonstrated in different cell types. It was initially reported that the mRNA and protein levels of IP3R3 increase during apoptosis in lymphocytes, with no change in the IP3R1 level (15Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Also, expression of an antisense cDNA construct of IP3R3 blocked the dexamethasone-induced apoptosis and increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas that of IP3R1 had no effect. Subsequently, however, it was reported that Jurkat cells deficient in IP3R1 were resistant to apoptosis induced by Fas, dexamethasone, and γ-irradiation despite the presence of IP3R3 (16Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). IP3Rs are functionally redundant in chicken B-lymphocytes as apoptosis induced by B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation was significantly inhibited only in cells deficient of all three receptors (17Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The reason for these discrepancies is a matter of speculation, but together the reports indicate that Ca2+ flux through IP3Rs plays a fundamental role in apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli. A more direct involvement of IP3Rs in apoptosis was demonstrated by reports that identified IP3R1 as a substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis (18Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Haug L.S. Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IP3R1, but not IP3R2 or IP3R3, contains a single DEVD-specific cleavage site for caspase-3 at amino acids 1888-1891 (mouse sequence), and this sequence is conserved in rat and human proteins. Caspase-3-mediated degradation may actually explain a previous observation that the IP3R1 level shows a dramatic decrease following dexamethasone treatment of thymocytes and S49 cells (15Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cleavage by caspase-3 removes the cytoplasmic segment of IP3R1 comprising the IP3-binding domain and most of the regulatory domain. This cleavage obviously abolishes the IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) activity of the receptor and produces a “channel-only” domain that apparently remains constitutively open in transiently transfected COS-1 and HeLa cells (20Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The significance of this cleavage either to the process of cell death or to the apoptosis-related increase in [Ca2+]i is not yet clear. Because IP3R1 is the most ubiquitous isoform of the IP3R family, its direct involvement in apoptosis as a caspase-3 substrate could have a far reaching physiological significance. Therefore, we set out to investigate the functional relevance of IP3R1 and its cleavage by caspase-3 to apoptosis induced by staurosporine (STS) and BCR stimulation using IP3R-deficient chicken B-lymphocytes (IP3R-KO) that stably express various mutants of the IP3R1. We report here that expression of either the wild-type IP3R1 or a mutant receptor that is no longer activated by IP3 could render the IP3R-KO cells susceptible to apoptosis and support the consequent rise in [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment of the cells with caspase inhibitors blocked the cleavage of IP3R1 and the rise in [Ca2+]i as well as apoptosis. A functional receptor that was mutated at the caspase-3 cleavage site significantly slowed down the kinetics of apoptosis and prevented both Ca2+ overload and secondary necrosis. In contrast, stable expression of the channel-only domain, corresponding to the C-terminal fragment generated by caspase-3, predisposed the cells to undergo apoptosis. Both STS- and BCR-induced apoptotic cell death and the associated rise in [Ca2+]i could also be induced in nominally Ca2+-free culture medium, suggesting Ca2+ release from internal stores as the primary cause of the [Ca2+]i rise rather than a major influx from the extracellular medium. Our data also indicate that IP3R1 plays a pivotal role in apoptosis not necessarily through its IICR activity but mainly as a substrate of caspase-3. The perturbance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis during the execution phase of apoptosis seems to be related to the cleavage of IP3R1 by caspase-3. Accordingly, the amplification of apoptotic signals and the rapid execution of apoptosis necessitate a prior activation of caspase-3 and the resulting truncation of the IP3R1. In addition, our results suggest that the specific pattern of changes in [Ca2+]i during apoptosis in different cell types may be related to the relative distribution of IP3R1 among the different tissues. Reagents—The polyclonal antibody (Rbt04) raised against amino acids 2735-2749 of mouse IP3R1 has been described previously (21Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). STS was purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-chicken IgM (clone M-4) was from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Caspase inhibitors and colorimetric caspase-3 substrate were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Cells and Culture Conditions—The DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes lacking all three IP3Rs (IP3R-KO) were a kind gift from Dr. T. Kurosaki (Tokyo, Japan). IP3R-KO cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 85 units/ml penicillin, 85 μg/ml streptomycin, and 3.5 mml-glutamine in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. These culture media and additives and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with no added calcium (catalog no. 21068) were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA Constructs and Transfection—Mouse cerebellum IP3R1 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. K. Mikoshiba, Tokyo, Japan) in pcDNA-3.1(+) vector was used as a template to generate different mutants of the receptor. Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To construct the caspase-3-non-cleavable mutant of IP3R1 (IP3R1Δcasp), a fragment containing the region 2129-6819 of the full-size IP3R1 cDNA, flanked by two BamHI restriction sites, was first subcloned into the pBlueScript II SK(+) vector. This construct was then used as template for the insertion of the mutations using 5′-GGGAAACAAAAAGAAAGATATCGAAGTGGCCAGGGATGCCCCGTC-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-GAGGGGGCATCCCTGGCCACTTCGATATCTTTCTTTTTGTTTCCC-3′ as a reverse primer (underlined are the inserted mutations). These oligonucleotides replace the known caspase-3 cleavage site DEVD, encoded between nucleotides 2584 and 2594 with IEVA, thereby mutating the aspartic acids at positions 1888 and- 1891 to isoleucine and alanine, respectively. The mutated IP3R1 region in the recombinant vector was then recovered with BamHI and religated into a BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1(+)/IP3R1. The N-terminal deletion mutant of the IP3R1 lacking the first 225 amino acids ((Δ1-225)- IP3R1) was constructed as described earlier (22Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Nadif Kasri N. Assefa Z. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the deletion mutant (Δ1-1891)IP3R1 encoding the 95-kDa caspase-3-generated C-terminal region of the receptor was constructed by PCR amplification of the relevant region and subsequent substitution in the pcDNA3.1(+)/IP3R1 plasmid. The sequences of the different constructs were confirmed by the automated fluorescent sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs, including that of the wild-type receptor (WT-IP3R1), were transfected into IP3R-KO cells by electroporation using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Briefly, about 107 cells in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium were transferred to a 4-mm electroporation cuvette (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and pulsed at 550 V and 25 μF in the presence of 100 μg of plasmids. The electroporated cells were incubated in 30 ml of normal culture medium for 24 h before starting the selection with 1.5 mg of G418/ml to generate stable cell lines. IP3R1 Subcellular Localization—The cells (5 × 105) were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated, 2-well chambered slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) for 3 h before fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 20% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with the Rbt04 primary antibody in PBS containing 1.5% goat serum. Subsequently, the slides were washed three times with PBS and incubated with the Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 5% goat serum. BODIPY-thapsigargin and MitoTracker dyes (Molecular Probes) were used to visualize endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, respectively. BODIPY-thapsigargin was added together with the secondary antibody. Mitochondria were visualized by incubating the cells with MitoTracker for 30 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. Images were acquired using an LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a Plan-Neofluar ×100 numerical aperture 1.3 oil immersion objective. Excitation wavelengths of 488 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 and 543 nm for BODIPY-thapsigargin and MitoTracker were used. Emission fluorescence was monitored by a photomultiplier fitted with a BP filter of 505-530 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 and with an LP filter of 585 nm for BODIPY-thapsigargin and MitoTracker. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Microsomes—Following treatments, cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS before preparation of lysates as described previously (23Assefa Z. Vantieghem A. Garmyn M. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Vandenheede J.R. Bouillon R. Merlevede W. Agostinis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21416-21421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Total microsomes were prepared as described previously with minor modifications (21Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g and washed twice with ice-cold PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cell pellets were then resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.8 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and homogenized on ice with a probe sonicator (MSE Ltd., UK). Total microsomes were obtained by centrifugation for 25 min at 125,000 × g. The membranous pellet was then resuspended in end medium (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 0.8 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates and microsomal preparations were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using either the BCA protocol (Pierce) or the Lowry method (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cleavage of IP3R1 by Recombinant Caspase-3—For in vitro assay of IP3R1 cleavage by caspase-3, microsomes (200 μg) were incubated with purified active recombinant human caspase-3 (Pharmingen, BD Biosciences) at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot using the Rbt04 antibody against the C-terminal region of IP3R1. Briefly, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 3-8% Trisacetate SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody (1:3000 dilution) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:8000 dilution). The immunoreactive bands were developed using the enhanced chemifluorescence reagent from Amersham Biosciences and then detected by the Storm840 FluorImager equipped with the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Induction and Analysis of Apoptosis—Cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml (1.5 ml of medium) in 12-well plates before treatment with either STS or anti-chicken IgM and then incubated for a specified period of time before harvesting. In some experiments, the anti-chicken IgM antibody was supplemented with anti-mouse IgM to further cross-link the surface IgM. For analysis of apoptosis, the protocol included in the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit from Pharmingen was used as provided. Cell death detection was performed on a Coulter Epics flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter Inc., Miami, FL) using the standard emission filters for green (FL1) and red (FL3) fluorescence photomultipliers. The Expo32 MultiCOMP software from Coulter Corporation was used to analyze the data. Cells having a reduced overall volume and staining with annexin V-FITC while retaining the plasma membrane integrity (propidium iodide (PI)-negative) were regarded as apoptotic. Primary necrosis was identified as the loss of plasma membrane integrity without a clear reduction in cell volume and no annexin staining. Primary necrotic cells stain with PI only. Cells that stain with both annexin V-FITC and PI were considered as those undergoing secondary necrosis, subsequent to apoptotic cell death. Caspase-3 Assay—Cells treated with STS or anti-chicken IgM antibody and incubated for the indicated time were harvested in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of each/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100. Caspase-3 assay was then performed by the colorimetric CaspACE assay system (Promega) exactly as recommended by the manufacturer, using 50-100 μg of protein/assay. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, A405 readings were taken using a 96-well plate reader. Analysis of [Ca2+]iby Flow Cytometry—Measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed essentially as described previously (25Vermes I. Haanen C. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 243: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 26Scoltock A.B. Bortner C.D. St. J. Bird G. Putney Jr., J.W. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30586-30596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were first treated with STS or anti-chicken IgM for a specific period of time and then loaded with either 3 μm Fluo-3/AM or 6 μm Fura red/AM (Molecular Probes) in 200 μl of culture medium for 30 and 90 min, respectively, at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, extra medium was added to make the final cell density up to about 106 cells/ml. 15,000 cells/sample were analyzed for the Ca2+-dependent increase in Fluo-3 fluorescence and the Ca2+-dependent decrease in the Fura red fluorescence emission by a Coulter Epics flow cytometer by exciting the cells at 488 nm. Expression of Different IP3R1 Constructs in IP3R-deficient Cells—The basic structure of IP3R1 comprises the N-terminal IP3-binding domain, the regulatory domain, and the C-terminal channel domain as shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Previous studies have shown that caspase-3 mediates the cleavage of mouse IP3R1 at Asp-1891 in cells undergoing apoptosis (18Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Haug L.S. Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to investigate the exact role of the IP3R1 channel activity and the significance of this cleavage in apoptotic cell death. For this purpose, we first generated a caspase-non-cleavable mutant (IP3R1Δcasp) by introducing the mutations D1888I and D1891A (Fig. 1B) using mouse IP3R1 as a template. IP3R1Δcasp possesses the same level of IICR activity as that of the WT-IP3R1 in stably expressing cell lines (data not shown). We also generated a deletion mutant lacking the first 225 amino acids ((Δ1-225)IP3R1). This segment immediately precedes the ligand-binding core (Fig. 1C) and has been designated as a suppressor domain because of the observation that its deletion significantly enhances the affinity of the receptor for IP3 binding (27Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 28Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T.

Nadif Kasri N. Assefa Z. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and others (29Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have observed that despite the higher level of IP3 binding, (Δ1-225)IP3R1 lacks any detectable IICR activity. The use of this mutant will help clarify whether the role of IP3R1 in apoptosis requires its IICR activity. Finally, a mutant receptor that lacks amino acids 1-1891 ((Δ1-1891)IP3R1) and mainly comprising the channel domain (as generated by caspase-3 cleavage of IP3R1) was created by PCR amplification of the specific region (Fig. 1D). All constructs including the WT-IP3R1 were transfected by electroporation into chicken embryonic B-lymphocytes (DT40 cells) lacking all three IP3R isoforms (IP3R-KO cells), and permanent cell lines were then established by selection with G418. The level of expression of all constructs in cell lines was comparable, as determined by Western blot analysis of membrane preparations (data not shown). In addition, the subcellular localization of the constructs was determined using confocal laser-scanning microscopy by co-staining of the IP3R1 (Rbt04 antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody) and the ER (BODIPY-thapsigargin) or mitochondria (MitoTracker). Representative images from the cells expressing the (Δ1-1891)IP3R1 construct are shown in Fig. 1, E and F. The truncated IP3R1 was expressed exclusively in the perinuclear region and was strongly associated with the distribution of the ER. It was excluded from mitochondria and the plasma membrane. These results are in agreement with the subcellular localization of a similar construct in other cell types (20Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cleavage of IP3R1 in Vitro and in Cells Undergoing Apoptosis—The first data demonstrating a possible involvement of IP3R1 in cell death were published a few years ago showing that cells deficient in IP3R1 were resistant to apoptosis (16Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This study, together with reports that caspase-3 mediates the cleavage of IP3R1 (18Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Haug L.S. Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the relevance of IP3R1 cleavage to the cell death processes and its effect on intracellular Ca2+ distribution. First, to examine whether the cleavage process could occur in vitro as well as in stable cell lines, crude microsomal preparations from WT-IP3R1 and IP3R1Δcasp cells were incubated with recombinant human caspase-3. In addition, we also studied IP3R1 degradation in cells treated with 50 nm STS to induce apoptosis. The extent of receptor degradation was then analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, recombinant caspase-3 cleaved IP3R1 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner generating exactly the same 95-kDa fragment as in cells undergoing STS-induced apoptosis. No such cleavage product could be detected in microsomal preparations from IP3R1Δcasp cells. Pretreatment of WT-IP3R1 cells with 100 μm z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) or z-DEVD-fmk (a specific inhibitor of caspase-3) completely inhibited the degradation of IP3R1 during STS-induced apoptosis (data not shown). These results confirm that caspase-3 was responsible for the cleavage of IP3R1 in cells undergoing apoptosis. The same 95-kDa fragment was also generated in (Δ1-225)IP3R1 cells induced to undergo apoptosis by either 50 nm STS or BCR cross-linking using 15 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM (Fig. 2B). Again, no cleavage product was detected in IP3R1Δcasp cells. These results suggest that the process of IP3R1 cleavage by caspase-3 is probably common to a wide range of apoptosis-inducing agents. Importantly, the results from the (Δ1-225)IP3R1 cells indicate that the initial caspase-3 activation during both STS- and anti-chicken IgM-induced apoptosis does not require IICR activity. Role of Caspase-3-mediated Cleavage of IP3R1 in the Process of Apoptotic Cell Death—Previous studies have shown that the degradation of IP3R1 by caspase-3 inhibits IICR activity in microsomal preparations from cerebellum (18Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in digitonin-permeabilized A7r5 cells. 2Z. Assefa, G.

https://openalex.org/W2132561180,"Aldose reductase (AR), a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, has been implicated in the development of vascular and neurological complications of diabetes. Recently, we demonstrated that aldose reductase is a component of myocardial ischemic injury and that inhibitors of this enzyme protect rat hearts from ischemia-reperfusion injury. To rigorously test the effect of aldose reductase on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, we used transgenic mice broadly overexpressing human aldose reductase (ARTg) driven by the major histocompatibility complex I promoter. Hearts from these ARTg or littermate mice (WT) (n=6 in each group) were isolated, perfused under normoxic conditions, then subjected to 50 min of severe low flow ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Creatine kinase (CK) release (a marker of ischemic injury) was measured during reperfusion; left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), end diastolic pressure (EDP), and ATP were measured throughout the protocol. CK release was significantly greater in ARTg mice compared with the WT mice. LVDP recovery was significantly reduced in ARTg mice compared with the WT mice. Furthermore, ATP content was higher in WT mice compared with ARTg mice during ischemia and reperfusion. Infarct size measured by staining techniques and myocardial damage evaluated histologically were also significantly worse in ARTg mice hearts than in controls. Pharmacological inhibition of aldose reductase significantly reduced ischemic injury and improved functional recovery in ARTg mice. These data strongly support key roles for AR in ischemic injury and impairment of functional and metabolic recovery after ischemia. We propose that interventions targeting AR may provide a novel adjunctive approach to protect ischemic myocardium."

Here we provide evidence that the MEK1/ERK module preferentially provides proliferative signals, whereas the MEK2/ERK module induces growth arrest at the G1/S boundary. Depletion of either MEK subtype by RNA interference generated a unique phenotype. The MEK1 knock down led to p21cip1 induction and to the appearance of cells with a senescence-like phenotype. Permanent ablation of MEK1 resulted in reduced colony formation potential, indicating the importance of MEK1 for long term proliferation and survival. MEK2 deficiency, in contrast, was accompanied by a massive induction of cyclin D expression and, thus, CDK4/6 activation followed by nucleophosmin hyperphosphorylation and centrosome over-amplification. Our results suggest that the two MEK subtypes have distinct ways to contribute to a regulated ERK activity and cell cycle progression.

It is predominantly involved in the control of cell proliferation, migration, cell division, and differentiation (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv.

This pathway, consisting of Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, regulates cell proliferation via its impact on cell cycle control (4Roovers K. Assoian R.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). A number of observations demonstrate the importance of this cascade in the regulation of cell cycle progression. Activated variants of Raf and MEK are capable of promoting cell cycle reentry and even transformation (5Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R.

Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8096) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the ERK pathway by different means results in G1 arrest in a variety of cell types (5Kerkhoff E.

Activation of the ERK cascade has also been shown under certain conditions to induce cell cycle arrest (4Roovers K. Assoian R.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and even differentiation (9Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Activated ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus (10Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and phosphorylates transcription factors like Ets and AP-1 family members, thereby positively regulating their activity (11Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The magnitude and duration of ERK activity are, therefore, the crucial parameters determining the quality of gene expression (4Roovers K. Assoian R.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Activation of this mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway promotes the expression of cyclin D1 (12Coqueret O. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 13Coqueret O. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and the CDK2 inhibitory protein p21cip1 (14Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3085-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These key events result in the activation of the cyclin-dependent protein kinases CDK4/6, which promote cell cycle entry by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb), leading to the release of the transcription factor E2F (15Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). This in turn promotes the transcription of cyclins A and E, resulting in the activation of CDK2. Activated CDK2 phosphorylates Rb at additional sites and, thus, enables DNA synthesis and centrosome duplication via further liberation of E2F (16Meraldi P. Lukas J. Fry A.M. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sustained expression of p21cip1 has been shown to be responsible for the ERK-mediated proliferation inhibition (6Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). MEK1 and MEK2 show high homology only in their kinase domains. The N termini and the characteristic proline-rich inserts, which contribute to the interaction of MEK1/2 with their activators and substrates (17Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), are quite divergent (40% identity). These differences in sequence and also prior reports suggest that MEK1 and MEK2 may not have fully overlapping functions. In several cell lines only MEK1 is activated in response to serum despite ample expression of both subtypes (19Xu S. Khoo S. Dang A. Witt S. Do V. Zhen E. Schaefer E.M. Cobb M.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1618-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MEK1 knock-out mice die due to placental vascularization defects, whereas MEK2 seems to be dispensable for growth and development (20Giroux S. Tremblay M. Bernard D. Cardin-Girard J.F. Aubry S.

Erikson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) could show that both MEK1 and MEK2 are necessary for proliferation in HeLa cells. In this study we investigated to what extent the loss of MEK1 and MEK2 contribute to the divergent effects of ERK signaling on either induction or inhibition of cell proliferation in several cell lines. Complete inhibition of MEK1/2 activity with PD184352 resulted in G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis (8Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The selective ablation of either subtype by RNAi, however, generated completely different effects. Loss of MEK1 protein resulted in sustained ERK activation, resulting in p21cip1 up-regulation. This led to a gradual appearance of cells with a senescence-like phenotype and eventually to a reduced colony-forming potential. In contrast, MEK2 depletion and the double knock down led to centrosome over-amplification and, thus, to multipolar spindle formation. These data showed that MEK1 and MEK2 activities have a different impact on the intensity and duration of ERK signaling and, thus, the biological response. Stimulus-dependent specific activation of either MEK1 or MEK2 might, therefore, represent a switch mechanism between induction or inhibition of cell proliferation. Reagents and Cell Culture—HCT-116, HT-29 (both colon cancer cell lines), AspC-1 (pancreatic cancer), and HS-27 (human foreskin fibroblasts) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and supplements (0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all stocks were from BioWhittaker)). Antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (ERK, Phospho-ERK (pERK), MEK, pMEK, cyclins D1, D3, pRB Ser-780, pRSK Thr-359/Ser-363), BD Biosciences (MEK1, MEK2, cyclin B1-fluorescein isothiocyanate), Santa Cruz (cyclins A and E, Fra-1, p27kip), Sigma (α- and γ-tubulin), and Calbiochem (p21cip). pNucleophosmin Thr-199 antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Spevak. RNA Interference—Two different sequences for each MEK1 and MEK2 were selected for the generation of siRNA oligonucleotides based on published suggestions (23Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Lehmann R. Bartel D.P. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3191-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). BLAST searches were performed to verify the specificity of the following sequences: MEK1, AAGCAACTCATGGTTCATGCTTT and, alternatively, AAGTCCTGAAGAAAGCTGGAA; MEK2, AAGAAGGAGAGCCTCACAGCA and, alternatively, AAGGTCGGCGAACTCAAAGAC. The p21cip1 knock down was performed with the p21 siRNA SmartPool (Dharmacon) consisting of four p21cip1-specific siRNAs. The unspecific random sequence AAGGGTCGTCTATAGGGATCGAT was used for control transfections. 100 nm siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon Research) were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the double knock down 100 nm each siRNA was used. Suppression of MEK1, MEK2, and p21cip1 was verified by Western blotting with MEK1, MEK2, and p21cip1-specific antibodies. Vector Construction—Short hairpin (sh) RNA-expressing constructs (shMEK1, shMEK2) were based on the pSilencer 3.1-H1 neo vector (Ambion) containing a H1 promoter and a neomycin resistance gene. Sixty-four-bp-long inserts specific for MEK1 and MEK2 were designed and prepared following the Ambion guidelines. The inserts contained a BamH1 restriction site at the 5′ and a HindIII restriction site at the 3′ end for ligation into the pSilencer vector as well as a TTCAAGAGA loop sequence. Forward sequence for MEK1, GATCCCGCAACTCATGGTTCATGCTTTCAAGAGAAGCATGAACCATGAGTTGCTTTTTTGGAAA; reverse sequence, AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGCAACTCATGGTTCATGCTTCTCTTGAAAGCATGAACCATGAGTTGCGG; MEK2 forward sequence, GATCCCGAAGGAGAGCCTCACAGCATTCAAGAGATGCTGTGAGGCTCTCCTTCTTTTTTGGAAA; reverse sequence, AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGAAGGAGAGCCTCACAGCATCTCTTGAATGCTGTGAGGCTCTCCTTCGG. The resulting siRNAs were identical to the oligonucleotides used for transient transfection. Colony-forming Assay and Single Cell Clone Preparation—shMEK1, shMEK2, and a scrambled shRNA-expressing plasmid were linearized using ScaI before transfection. HCT-116 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were replated onto 10-cm dishes with 80,000 cells/plate in selection medium containing 500 mg/liter G418 (Calbiochem). Medium was changed twice a week, and cells were maintained until all cells in the untransfected control had died (∼2 weeks). Cells were either stained with 2% methylene blue in methanol and counted subsequently, or single colonies were transferred onto 96-well plates. Single cell clones were expanded onto 6-well plates, and Western blots with MEK1- and MEK2-specific antibodies were performed to determine the knock down efficiency of each individual clone. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HCT-116 using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptII polymerase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol with an oligo(dT) primer. Real time PCR for cyclin D1 was carried out using Syber-Green incorporation with TCCGGCGAGGGGCAGAAGAG as the forward primer and GCAGCACCCGGTCGTTGAGGA as reverse primer. The cytokine EMAP was used as normalizing gene (forward primer, TGCTTTCCCAGGAGAGCCT; reverse, CACCTCAAAGGGAACTCCTTTG). Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), 1 mm Na3VO4, 30 mm NaF, 5% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate supplemented with phosphatase (Sigma) and protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient Tris-glycine gels, MES buffer; Invitrogen), and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Proteins transferred to the membrane were detected by various antibodies, including horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To separate pMEK1 and pMEK2, 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) with a MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) was used, and gels were run until the 28-kDa prestained marker (SeeBlue; Invitrogen) band reached the bottom. CDK2 Kinase Assay—HCT-116 cell lysates were prepared as described above. CDK2 immunoprecipitation was performed with 500 μg of precleared lysates using an agarose-coupled CDK2 antibody (2 μg/sample; Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using spin columns (Sigma) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Phosphorylation of histone H1 (1 μg/reaction; Sigma) was performed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Tween 20, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors) containing 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min and resolved on 10% Tris-glycine gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Proliferation Assay—HCT-116 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates with 2000 cells/well, cultured for 24 h, and transfected with the indicated siRNAs. [3H]Thymidine (5 μCi, Amersham Biosciences) was added per well 20 h before measurement. Cells were transferred onto filter plates, dried, covered with 25 μl of scintillation mixture, and sealed. Thymidine incorporation was measured with a scintillation counter (1450 Microbeta, Wallac). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were trypsinized, PBS-washed, and fixed overnight with 80% EtOH at –20 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cyclin B1 antibody (BD Biosciences) in 100 μl of PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and PBS-washed, and DNA was stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) supplemented with 1 mg/ml RNase for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. DNA content and cyclin B1 levels were determined using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with the CellQuest software package. Immunofluorescence—HCT-116, HT-29, and AspC-1 were cultured in 4 chamber slides (BD Biosciences) for 24 h, transfected as described, and maintained for further 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min at –20 °C. Slides were blocked with 10% goat serum in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS. The primary antibodies γ-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), cyclin D1 (1:100; Cell Signaling), and cyclin B1 (1:100; BD Biosciences) were used according to the manufacturer's suggestions. A Texas Red (549 nm)-labeled secondary monoclonal anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) was used. α-Tubulin staining was performed with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (1:75; Sigma) for 20 min. Slides were washed with 0.1% Triton X, PBS for 30 min, mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) containing 50–100 ng/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and examined under epifluorescent illumination. Photos were either taken with an Axioplan2 or a LSM510 (confocal), both from Zeiss with an 63× objective. Metabolic Labeling of Cyclin D1—HCT-116 were transfected with the indicated siRNAs 48 h before labeling. Cells were washed twice with PBS and transferred to methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 24 mg/liter cysteine containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (555 MBq/ml, Amersham Biosciences). Cells were labeled for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HCT-116 cells were lysed as described above, and labeled cyclin D1 was precipitated with mouse anti-cyclin D1 antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling) overnight. The antibody was bound to protein G-beads (Sigma) for 2 h, washed 5 times with lysis buffer, and resolved on denaturing 10% Tris-glycine gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. MEK1 and MEK2 Act Differently on ERK Activation—Depletion of MEK1, MEK2, or both in HCT116 colon cancer cells using RNAi was very efficient as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The minimal amount of siRNA required to get this down-regulation was determined in a titration experiment. The transfection procedure itself did not affect MEK1 and MEK2 levels (Fig. 1A, controls). Nevertheless, slightly reduced MEK1 protein was detected 48 h after transfection in MEK2-deficient (siMEK2) and control cells. Furthermore MEK2 protein levels increased during the time span observed in control and MEK1-deficient (siMEK1) cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection neither MEK1 nor MEK2 was detectable with subtype-specific antibodies. Slightly reduced knock down results were obtained with the alternative siRNAs, targeting a different region of MEK1 and MEK2 (data not shown). The effect of MEK depletion on MEK and ERK activity was assessed in Western blots using antibodies specifically recognizing phosphorylated and, thus, activated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Either knock down resulted in a total loss of the respective phospho-MEK (pMEK) levels (Fig. 1B). Within the first 48 h after transfection no additional MEK2 was phosphorylated, as a consequence of the MEK1 knock down, as indicated by a clear reduction of total pMEK. The increased amount of pMEK2 72 h after transfection in siMEK1 cells could be explained by the higher levels of total MEK2 protein. MEK2 deficiency, in contrast, could be complemented efficiently by MEK1. The presence of residual pMEK in the double knock down revealed that the depletion was not as completed as suggested by the MEK1/MEK2 blots (Fig. 1A). The 35-kDa band was recently identified as mitotically phosphorylated nucleophosmin cross-reacting with the pMEK antibody (24Cha H. Hancock C. Dangi S. Maiguel D. Carrier F. Shapiro P. Biochem. J. 2003; 378: 857-865Crossref Google Scholar). pERK levels were analyzed as a readout for MEK activity upon MEK1 or MEK2 knock down. In the control transfection pERK levels decreased over time as a consequence of increasing cell density and contact inhibition. This observation could be further confirmed since the amount of G1 cells continuously increased, as verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). pERK levels were rather low in the MEK1 knock down 24 h after transfection but exceeded the control levels at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 1B). This suggested an over-compensation by MEK2. In contrast, the MEK2 and, in particular, the double knock down resulted in clearly reduced pERK levels. To investigate whether ablation of MEK1 and MEK2 also interferes with the activation kinetics of ERK, we performed re-stimulation experiments that were carried out 48 h after transfection. The control cells exhibited the expected biphasic behavior (10Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with pERK peak maxima at 5 and 20 min followed by a decrease at later times (Fig. 1C). The MEK2 knock down showed only one maximum around 10–20 min followed by a slow decrease. The MEK1 knock down, in contrast, resulted in constitutively high ERK activation from the beginning throughout the entire observation period. Since the sustained activation of ERK would cause a change in the expression of downstream targets, we decided to investigate the levels of the AP-1 family member Fra-1. Fra-1 expression was shown to require sustained ERK activity (14Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3085-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) in a c-Fos-dependent process. Indeed we could observe an induction of Fra-1 (Fig. 1D) beginning 24 h after transfection. This sustained strong ERK activity, therefore, might be attributed to the enforced activation of ERK by MEK2. These findings were further supported by previous reports that showed MEK2 to be an ∼7-fold better activator of ERK than MEK1 (25Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This would explain the above-described sustained activation of ERK by MEK2 in MEK1 knock down cells. Colony-forming assays with HCT-116 cells transfected with the respective shRNA-expressing plasmids demonstrated an important role of MEK1 in long term cell proliferation, as recently published (22Liu X. Yan S. Zhou T. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the pSilencer vector expressing a short hairpin targeting MEK1 (shMEK1) formed significantly fewer colonies (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, none of 24 single cell clones derived from this transfection showed reduced levels of MEK1, indicating that in these cells only the neomycin resistance gene had integrated. In contrast, at least six of 24 clones with clearly reduced MEK2 levels were obtained from the transfection with the respective shMEK2 plasmid (selected clones shown in Fig. 2B). To address the early effects of MEK depletion on cell proliferation, thymidine incorporation was examined in transiently transfected cells. A significant reduction of the proliferation rate was observed in both the MEK2 and the double knock down cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the colony-forming assay, no decreased proliferation was observed in MEK1-deficient cells within 72 h after transfection. The specific MEK inhibitor PD184352 caused a complete proliferation arrest and even a loss of cells (Fig. 3A). Cell cycle analyses were performed 48 h after transfection to further characterize the observed proliferation differences. A slight but significant increase in the S-phase population was observed in the MEK1 knock down (Fig. 3B), whereas the MEK2-deficient cells exhibited an obvious increase in G2/M. This key effect of G2/M delay upon MEK2 depletion was verified using an alternative siRNA (Fig. 3, B and C, siMEK2_2). The double knock down resembled the MEK2 knock down, demonstrating the dominant effect of MEK2 loss. A detailed analysis by cyclin B1/DNA double-staining (Fig. 3C) revealed that the MEK2-deficient cells had a nearly 2-fold increase in the tetraploid cell population and, within this population, a 60% increase of a cyclin B1 negative cell population, suggesting a delay at a late mitotic stage. In contrast, the addition of 10 μm PD184352 for 24 h resulted in a clear G1 arrest (Fig. 3B) as previously shown (8Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MEK Depletion Alters Cyclin D Stability and Transcription—The G1 arrest induced by PD184352 is due to the inhibition of cyclin D transcription (8Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We, therefore, analyzed the effect of MEK1 and MEK2 depletion on cyclin D1 and D3 levels between 24 and 72 h after transfection (Fig. 4A). In control cells cyclin D1 and D3 levels decreased over time, following the decreasing pERK levels (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, upon depletion of either MEK1 or MEK2, cyclins D1 and D3 were elevated (Fig. 4A; cyclin D2 was not detectable in HCT-116 cells; data not shown). The cyclin D kinetics were clearly different for the MEK1 and the MEK2 knock down. MEK1 deficiency induced a gradual accumulation of cyclin D1 levels, reaching a maximum 72 h after transfection. In contrast, the MEK2-deficient cells exhibited an immediate induction of high cyclin D1 levels. The double knock down seemed to integrate both effects as the cyclin D1 levels were slightly higher at 24 h compared with the MEK1 knock down but further increased over time. Induction of cyclin D1 upon MEK1 and MEK2 depletion was observed in HT-29, AspC1, and HS-27 cells too (data not shown). Although the double knock down had reduced cyclin D3 compared with the single knock downs, cyclin D3 levels nevertheless showed basically the same kinetics as cyclin D1. Therefore, in all following experiments only cyclin D1 levels were analyzed. These observations were identical when alternative siRNA oligos were used, proving that they are not the result of RNAi-mediated off-target effects (data not shown). The gradual accumulation of cyclin D1 in MEK1-deficient cells and the consistently high levels in MEK2-deficient cells indicated possible changes in either cyclin D1 protein stability or transcription. Pulse-chase experiments performed 48 h after transfection demonstrated a clear stabilization of cyclin D1 in the MEK1 and the double knock down (t½ = ∼40 min versus ∼20 min in the control and MEK2 knock down, Fig. 4B). Similar stabilization kinetics of cyclin D had been shown earlier for the inactivation of GSK3β (26Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). The cyclin D1 signal was nearly absent after pretreatment of cells with 10 μm PD184352 for 24 h, as described earlier (8Squires M.S. Nixon P.M. Cook S.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GSK3β is known to be regulated by Akt and to control the degradation of cyclin D. Therefore, we investigated the total amount and phosphorylation status of these two regulators of cyclin D (Fig. 4C). Both the total amount and phosphorylation of GSK3β were increased in MEK1-deficient and double knock down cells from 48 h after transfection. However, MEK2 knock down also resulted in an increase of pGSK3β and total GSK3β compared with the control (Fig. 4C). Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 remained unchanged in MEK1-deficient cells, whereas it was slightly decreased in MEK2 and the double knock down. However, pAkt Thr-308 was clearly increased in the MEK1 knock down. Cyclin D1 protein was increased in MEK2-deficient cells at all time points, but the stability seemed to remain unchanged. Thus, the expression levels of cyclin D1 were determined using real time PCR (Fig. 4D). The transcription of cyclin D1 was highly increased in MEK2-deficient (>15-fold) and double knock down cells (10-fold), but even the MEK1 deficient cells had increased cyclin D1 mRNA levels (3-fold). The high expression of cyclin D1 in MEK2-deficient cells resulted in a high de novo synthesis of cyclin D1 protein during the chase period of the pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 4B), which could mimic a decreased stability. This, however, seems unlikely, because the half-life is in the same range as the one observed for the control transfection exhibiting the lowest transcription level (Fig. 4D). The potentially different impact of MEK1 or MEK2 deficiency on either stabilization or transcription could explain the different cyclin D1 kinetics. MEK1 deficiency-induced stabilization led to a gradual accumulation of the protein, wher"

We show here that CH-ILKBP/actopaxin/α-parvin and affixin/β-parvin (abbreviated as α- and β-parvin, respectively), two structurally closely related integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-binding focal adhesion proteins, are co-expressed in human cells. Depletion of α-parvin dramatically increased the level of β-parvin, suggesting that β-parvin is negatively regulated by α-parvin in human cells. Loss of PINCH-1 or ILK, to which α- and β-parvin bind, significantly reduced the activation of Rac, a key signaling event that controls lamellipodium formation and cell spreading. We were surprised to find that loss of α-parvin, but not that of β-parvin, markedly stimulated Rac activation and enhanced lamellipodium formation. Overexpression of β-parvin, however, was insufficient for stimulation of Rac activation or lamellipodium formation, although it was sufficient for promotion of apoptosis, another important cellular process that is regulated by PINCH-1, ILK, and α-parvin. In addition, we show that the interactions of ILK with α- and β-parvin are mutually exclusive. Overexpression of β-parvin or its CH2 fragment, but not a CH2 deletion mutant, inhibited the ILK-α-parvin complex formation. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that inhibition of the ILK-α-parvin complex is sufficient, although not necessary, for promotion of apoptosis. These results identify Rac as a downstream target of PINCH-1, ILK, and parvin.

At the molecular level, cell-ECM adhesion is mediated by transmembrane cell adhesion receptors (e.g. integrins) and a number of highly selective, receptor-proximal cytoplasmic proteins (9Burridge K.

Determining the functions of each of the focal adhesion proteins, therefore, is a prerequisite for fully understanding the molecular basis underlying the cell-ECM adhesion-mediated signaling and regulation of cell behavior. Recent studies have implicated protein complexes consisting of PINCH, ILK, and members of the CH-ILKBP/actopaxin/affixin/parvin (abbreviated as parvin) family as key components of cell-ECM adhesions (12Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). CH-ILKBP/actopaxin/α-parvin and affixin/β-parvin (abbreviated as α- and β-parvin, respectively) were independently identified through their interactions with ILK (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y.

Although mammalian α- and β-parvins are encoded by two different genes, they possess identical domain architecture and share a high level of sequence similarity (human α- and β-parvins are 75% identical and 87% similar at the amino acid sequence level). Full-length human α- and β-parvins contain 372 and 364 residues, respectively (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that α- and β-parvin are co-expressed in human cells and that α-parvin negatively regulates the cellular level of β-parvin. In addition, we show that despite sharing a high level of structural similarity and certain biochemical and cellular properties such as binding to ILK and localizing to cell-ECM adhesions, α- and β-parvin play distinct and sometimes even contrasting roles in signaling and regulation of cell behavior. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that the formation of the ILK-α-parvin complex is crucial for protection of cells from apoptosis and β-parvin promotes apoptosis, at least in part, via inhibition of the ILK-α-parvin complex formation. Generation of GST and Maltose-Binding Protein β-Parvin Fusion Proteins—DNA fragments encoding human β-parvin sequences (as specified in each experiment) were prepared by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of a pGEX-5x-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) or the EcoRI/BamHI sites of a pMAL-C2 vector (New England Biolabs). The recombinant vectors were then used to transform Escherichia coli cells. The expression of the GST and maltose-binding protein fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and they were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and amylose-agarose, respectively. Generation of Monoclonal Anti-β-Parvin Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibodies were prepared using a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal region (residues 1–91) of human β-parvin as an antigen based on a method described previously (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were initially screened for anti-β-parvin antibody activities by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting using a maltose-binding protein fusion protein containing full-length β-parvin sequence. Antibodies that recognize maltose-binding protein-β-parvin were selected and further characterized by Western blotting using lysates of cells expressing GFP- or FLAG-tagged α- and β-parvin proteins. Construction of Mammalian β-Parvin Expression Vectors and DNA Transfection—To generate expression vectors encoding the N-terminally GFP-tagged full-length or mutant forms of β- or α-parvin, the full-length or fragments of human β-or α-parvin cDNA were generated by PCR and cloned into the pEGFP-C2 expression vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). To generate FLAG-β-parvin expression vectors, DNA fragments encoding the full-length (364 residues) or the short form (350 residues) (14Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) of β-parvin were cloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-6C vector (Sigma). To generate expression vectors encoding untagged full-length, short or mutant forms of β-parvin, or the wild-type or mutant forms of α-parvin, DNA fragments encoding the corresponding forms of α- or β-parvin (including the stop codon) were cloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites in the p3xFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector (Sigma). The expression vector encoding the C-terminally FLAG-tagged α-parvin was described previously (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To express GFP- or FLAG-tagged or untagged α- or β-parvin proteins, Hela cells were transfected with the corresponding expression vectors using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of the GFP- or FLAG-tagged or untagged α- or β-parvin proteins in the transfectants was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-GFP, anti-FLAG, anti-α-parvin, or anti-β-parvin antibodies as specified in each experiment. RNA Interference—The sequences of β-parvin siRNAs were selected based on a method described previously (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The 21-nucleotide synthetic siRNA duplexes were prepared by Dharmacon Research. In preliminary experiments, we screened siRNAs for their effects on suppression of β-parvin expression. We found that two siRNAs (only the sense sequences of the targeted sites are shown), 5′-AACCTGTTCACCAAGTACAAG-3′ (β-parvin siRNA-2) and 5′-AACAAGCTGAATTTGGAGGTG-3′ (β-parvin siRNA-3), effectively mediate the silencing of β-parvin expression. The β-parvin siRNA-3 was used in all the sequential experiments. The sequences of siRNAs that target ILK, PINCH-1, and α-parvin, respectively, were described previously (18Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Fukuda T. Guo L. Shi X. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hela cells were transfected with siRNAs that specifically target β-parvin, α-parvin, PINCH-1, or ILK or were transfected with a 21-nucleotide irrelevant RNA duplex as a control, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The cells were analyzed 2 days after the RNA transfection as specified in each experiment. The transfection efficiency of the siRNA experiments was at least 70% based on Western blotting analyses of the targeted proteins. Rac Activation Assay—To analyze the effects of depletion of β-parvin, α-parvin, PINCH-1, or ILK on Rac activation, Hela cells were transfected with siRNAs that specifically target β-parvin, α-parvin, PINCH-1, or ILK or the control RNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after RNA transfection, the cells were harvested and then plated in 60-mm dishes pre-coated with collagen I (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware), and incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere for 10 min. Activated Rac was detected using a Rac activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the cells in the 60-mm dishes were lysed with 600 μl of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m NaCl, and 2% Igepal). The cell lysates were immediately centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl of beads/500 μl of cell lysate) that were immobilized with GST-fusion protein containing the p21-binding domain of PAK1 (GST-PBD) and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. At the end of incubation, the beads were washed twice with the wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm NaCl), and then mixed with 30 μl of Laemmli SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Rac protein bound to the GST-PBD-containing beads (the activated Rac) was detected by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-Rac antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). In parallel experiments, total Rac protein was detected by Western blotting analyses of the cell lysates (20 μl of cell lysates/lane) with the monoclonal anti-Rac antibody under identical conditions. The amounts of the activated and the total Rac proteins were quantified using a chemiluminescence documentation system (Bio-Rad), and the ratio of the activated Rac protein versus the total Rac protein (Rac activity) was determined using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The relative Rac activity in the ILK, PINCH-1, β-parvin, or α-parvin siRNA transfectants were expressed as: the Rac activity in the siRNA transfectants/the Rac activity in the control transfectants (the relative Rac activity of the control transfectants = 1). To analyze the effect of overexpression of β-parvin on Rac activation, Hela cells were transfected with the expression vector containing the full-length β-parvin sequence or a vector lacking β-parvin sequence as a control. The relative Rac activities in the β-parvin-overexpressing cells and the control cells were determined as described above. Cell Morphology and Actin Cytoskeleton Staining—Cells (as specified in each experiment) were plated in Opti-MEM I serum-free medium (Invitrogen) on fibronectin- or collagen I-coated surface. Cell morphology was observed under an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hoffman Modulation Contrast system and recorded with a digital camera. To visualize actin cytoskeleton, the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Immunoprecipitation—Hela cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-ILK, FLAG-PINCH-1, and/or GFP-tagged or untagged wild-type or mutant forms of α- or β-parvin, or empty vector lacking protein coding sequence as a control, as specified in each experiment. The transfectants were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The cell lysates were mixed with agarose beads conjugated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) (650 μg lysates/35 μl of 50% (v/v) M2 beads). The beads were washed four times, and the proteins bound were released from the beads by boiling in the Laemmli SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to FLAG, GFP, ILK, α-parvin, β-parvin or PINCH-1 as specified in each experiment. Immunoprecipitation of α-parvin was performed as described previously (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 27Zhang Y. Chen K. Guo L. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38328-38338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (as specified in each experiment) were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The cell lysates (500 μg) were mixed with 500 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing monoclonal anti-α-parvin antibody 1D4. After incubation for 3 h, they were mixed with 40 μl of UltraLink Immobilized Protein G (Pierce) and then incubated for an additional 1.5 h. The beads were washed four times, and the proteins bound were released from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies as specified in each experiment. Apoptosis—Hela cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected with the expression vector encoding the wild-type or mutant forms of α- or β-parvin or a control vector lacking parvin sequences using LipofectAMINE Plus. Two days after transfection, apoptosis was analyzed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 assays. The TUNEL assay was performed using an In Situ cell death detection kit (Roche). The caspase-3 activities were measured using fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate VII (N-acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin) from Calbiochem according to the manufacturer's protocol. ILK and PINCH-1 Are Crucially Involved in the Rac Activation—Activation of Rac is among the earliest cell-ECM adhesion-induced signaling events that are essential for cell spreading (22Schwartz M.A. Shattil S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We recently found that ILK and PINCH-1 are indispensable for prompt cell spreading (18Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To determine whether ILK and PINCH-1 function upstream of Rac, we transfected Hela cells with siRNAs that specifically target ILK and PINCH-1, respectively. Western blotting analyses showed that, as expected, the level of ILK (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2), but not that of actin (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2), was greatly diminished in the cells that were transfected with the ILK siRNA. Likewise, transfection of the cells with the PINCH-1 siRNA effectively depleted PINCH-1 in the cells (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Equal loading was confirmed by probing the samples with an anti-actin antibody (Fig. 1D). To analyze the effects of depletion of ILK or PINCH-1 on Rac activation, we isolated activated Rac protein from the cells that were depleted of ILK or PINCH-1 as well as the control cells using GST-PDB beads based on methods described previously (28Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The total Rac and the activated Rac were detected by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-Rac antibody and quantified. The results showed that depletion of ILK or PINCH-1 significantly reduced the level of Rac activation (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that both ILK and PINCH-1 are crucially involved in the activation of Rac. Generation and Characterization of Monoclonal Anti-β-Parvin Antibodies—We next sought to test whether α- and β-parvin, which are known to interact with ILK (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), are required for the activation of Rac. To this end, we first determined whether β-parvin is co-expressed with α-parvin in Hela cells. To facilitate this, we generated a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal region (residues 1–91) of human β-parvin and used it to develop monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To characterize the monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibodies, we transfected Hela cells with expression vectors encoding GFP-α-parvin and GFP-β-parvin, respectively. The expression of the N-terminally GFP-tagged α-parvin (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and β-parvin (Fig. 2A, lane 2) in the corresponding transfectants was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies. GFP-β-parvin (Fig. 2A, lane 4), but not GFP-α-parvin (Fig. 2A, lane 3), was readily detected by monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody 11A5, suggesting that it preferentially recognizes the β-parvin fusion protein. In a parallel experiment, GFP-α-parvin (Fig. 2A, lane 5), but not GFP-β-parvin (Fig. 2A, lane 6), was readily detected by monoclonal anti-α-parvin antibody 3B5 (13Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To further characterize the monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody, we transfected Hela cells with an expression vector encoding a C-terminally FLAG-tagged α-parvin and a FLAG vector lacking α-parvin sequence as a control, respectively. Overexpression of the FLAG-α-parvin protein in the FLAG-α-parvin transfectants (Fig. 2B, lane 1), but not in the control transfectants (Fig. 2B, lane 2), was confirmed by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-α-parvin antibody. It is interesting that a relatively weak band that migrated to the position of FLAG-α-parvin was detected by the monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody in the transfectants that overexpress the C-terminally FLAG-tagged α-parvin (Fig. 2B, lane 3) but not in the control transfectants (Fig. 2B, lane 4), suggesting that whereas the monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody preferentially recognizes β-parvin, it can weakly recognize α-parvin protein that lacks the N-terminal GFP tag. α- and β-Parvin are Co-expressed in Human Cells and α-Parvin Negatively Regulates β-Parvin—We next tested whether α- and β-parvin are co-expressed in human cells. To do this, we probed the lysates of Hela cells with the monoclonal anti-α-parvin and anti-β-parvin antibodies. The results showed that, as expected, the monoclonal anti-α-parvin antibody recognized a single band in Hela cells (Fig. 3B, lane 1). The monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody, on the other hand, recognized several bands with apparent molecular masses in the range of 45–51 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 1). To test whether any of these bands represent the full-length or the short form of β-parvin, we transfected Hela cells with expression vectors containing the full-length β-parvin (β-parvin(l)) and the short form of β-parvin (β-parvin(s)) sequences, respectively, and analyzed the transfectants by Western blotting with the monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody. β-parvin(s) was readily detected in cells transfected with the β-parvin(s) expression vector (Fig. 3A, lane 2). In cells transfected with the β-parvin(l) expression vector, β-parvin(l) and, to a greater extent, β-parvin(s) were detected (Fig. 3A, lane 3), which is consistent with the notion that β-parvin(s) is produced from an active, alternative initiation codon downstream of the initiation codon nearest the 5′ end (14Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A close inspection of the anti-β-parvin Western blot derived from the Hela cells (Fig. 3A, lane 1) revealed that the lowest band recognized by the monoclonal anti-β-parvin antibody migrated to the same position as β-parvin(s) (Fig. 3A, lane 2). These results indicate that β-parvin (specifically β-parvin(s)) is co-expressed with α-parvin in human Hela cells. No protein band with apparent molecular mass that is identical to that of β-parvin(l) was detected in Hela cells, suggesting that β-parvin(l) is either not expressed or is expressed at a level much lower (below the detection level under the condition used) than that of β-parvin(s), which is consistent with the finding that β-parvin(s) is preferentially expressed in cells transfected with the expression vector encoding β-parvin(l) (Fig. 3A, lane 3). As expected, neither β-parvin(s) nor β-parvin(l) that was overexpressed in the corresponding transfectants was recognized by the monoclonal anti-α-parvin antibody (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). Co-expression of α- and β-parvin proteins was also found in many other mammalian cells including human WI-38 fibroblasts, Caco-2 adenocarcinoma cells, and mouse C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown). To confirm that the endogenous protein that co-migrated with the exogenously expressed β-parvin protein is indeed β-parvin, we transfected Hela cells with an siRNA that specifically targets β-parvin. Transfection of the cells with the β-parvin siRNA, but not that with an irrelevant small RNA, effectively depleted this protein (Fig. 4A, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). The bands that migrated slower than β-parvin(s), however, were not affected by the β-parvin siRNA (Fig. 4A, lane 3), indicating that they most probably represent proteins that share a common epitope with β-parvin but are encoded by genes other than that of β-parvin or β-parvin variants that lack the siRNA target sequence. It was striking that depletion of α-parvin (Fig. 4B, lane 4) dramatically increased the levels of both β-parvin(s) and β-parvin(l) (Fig. 4A, lane 4)"
https://openalex.org/W2068792255,"To determine the effects of deamidation on structural and functional properties of αA-crystallin, three mutants (N101D, N123D, and N101D/N123D) were generated. Deamidated αB-crystallin mutants (N78D, N146D, and N78D/N146D), characterized in a previous study (Gupta, R., and Srivastava, O. P. (2004) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 45, 206–214) were also used. The biophysical and chaperone properties were determined in (a) homoaggregates of αA mutants (N101D, N123D, and N101D/N123D) and (b) reconstituted heteroaggregates of α-crystallin containing (i) wild type αA (WT-αA): WT-αB crystallins, (ii) individual αA-deamidated mutants:WT-αB crystallins, and (iii) WT-αA:individual αB-deamidated mutant crystallins. Compared with the WT-αA, the three αA-deamidated mutants showed reduced levels of chaperone activity, alterations in secondary and tertiary structures, and larger aggregates. These altered properties were relatively more pronounced in the mutant N101D compared with the mutant N123D. Further, compared with heteroaggregates of WT-αA and WT-αB, the heteroaggregates containing deamidated subunits of either αA- or αB-crystallins and their counterpart WT proteins showed higher molecular mass, altered tertiary structures, lower exposed hydrophobic surfaces, and reduced chaperone activity. However, the heteroaggregate containing WT-αA and deamidated αB subunit showed lower chaperone activity, smaller oligomers, and 3-fold lower subunit exchange rate than heteroaggregate containing deamidated αA- and WT-αB subunits. Together, the results suggested that (a) both Asn residues (Asn-101 and Asn-123) are required for the structural integrity and chaperone function of αA-crystallin and (b) the presence of WT-αB in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate leads to packing-induced structural changes which influences the oligomerization and modulate chaperone activity. To determine the effects of deamidation on structural and functional properties of αA-crystallin, three mutants (N101D, N123D, and N101D/N123D) were generated. Deamidated αB-crystallin mutants (N78D, N146D, and N78D/N146D), characterized in a previous study (Gupta, R., and Srivastava, O. P. (2004) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 45, 206–214) were also used. The biophysical and chaperone properties were determined in (a) homoaggregates of αA mutants (N101D, N123D, and N101D/N123D) and (b) reconstituted heteroaggregates of α-crystallin containing (i) wild type αA (WT-αA): WT-αB crystallins, (ii) individual αA-deamidated mutants:WT-αB crystallins, and (iii) WT-αA:individual αB-deamidated mutant crystallins. Compared with the WT-αA, the three αA-deamidated mutants showed reduced levels of chaperone activity, alterations in secondary and tertiary structures, and larger aggregates. These altered properties were relatively more pronounced in the mutant N101D compared with the mutant N123D.

However, the heteroaggregate containing WT-αA and deamidated αB subunit showed lower chaperone activity, smaller oligomers, and 3-fold lower subunit exchange rate than heteroaggregate containing deamidated αA- and WT-αB subunits. Together, the results suggested that (a) both Asn residues (Asn-101 and Asn-123) are required for the structural integrity and chaperone function of αA-crystallin and (b) the presence of WT-αB in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate leads to packing-induced structural changes which influences the oligomerization and modulate chaperone activity. α-Crystallin, the most abundant protein in lens mature fiber cells, constitutes ∼35% of the total lens protein. In vivo, the αA and αB subunits at a ratio of 3:1 form an oligomer of 800 kDa. Both αA- and αB-crystallins are small heat shock proteins (Hsps), 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; AIAS, 4-acetamido-4′-[(iodoacetyl)amino]stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic, disodium salt; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; LYI, lucifer yellow iodoacetamide; WT, wild type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SLS, static light scattering; CS, citrate synthase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. and show molecular chaperone activity to protect proteins from aggregation in the eye lens (1Groenen P.J.

Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Because of this property, α-crystallin is believed to play a crucial role in maintaining the lens transparency. Like other small heat shock proteins, α-crystallin also contains a highly conserved sequence of 80–100 residues (residues 62–143 in αA- and 66–147 in αB-crystallin) called the α-crystallin domain (3Caspers G.J.

Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Based on similarities with the structure of other Hsps, it is believed that the N-terminal region (residues 1–62 in αA- and 1–66 in αB-crystallin(s)) of α-crystallin forms an independently folded domain, whereas the C terminus (referred as the C-terminal extension; residues 143–173 in αA- and 147–175 in αB-crystallin) is flexible and unstructured (4deJong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Previous reports show that the removal of N-terminal residues (56 residues) and C-terminal extensions (32–34 residues) of αA- and αB-crystallins lead to improper folding, reduced chaperone activity, and formation of trimers or tetramers (5Bova M.P.

The α-crystallin domain is believed to be engaged in the subunit-subunit interactions, but the individual amino acids in subunit interactions and chaperone activity have not been fully identified. Nevertheless, two disease-related point mutations of a highly conserved Arg at equivalent positions in αA (R116C) and αB (R120G) caused structural changes that lead to hereditary cataracts (10Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 11Cobb B.A. Petrash M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). During cataract development, the conformational changes, unfolding, and subsequent cross-linking of crystallins are believed to lead to accumulation of insoluble cross-linked product of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. Present literature suggests a multifactorial mechanism for the development of cataract-specific cross-linked species, which might be driven by post-translational modifications. These included disulfide bonding (12Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 130-145PubMed Google Scholar), glycation (13Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10257-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), oxidation of Trp and His residues (14McDermott M. Chiesa R. Roberts J.E. Dillon J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8653-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Andley U.P. Clark B.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 706-713PubMed Google Scholar), deamidation (16Takemoto L. Boyle D. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 164-168PubMed Google Scholar), and transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking (17Lorand L. Zappia V. Advances in Post-translational Modifications of Proteins and Aging. Plenum Press, New York1988: 79-94Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, despite identification of these modifications in crystallins, their exact roles in the mechanism of crystallin cross-linking remain poorly understood. Age-related deamidation of crystallins seems to be one of the major post-translational modifications that occurs frequently. In vivo, the deamidation of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins has been shown in several studies (18Takemoto L. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19van Kleef F.S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12494-12502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In αA-crystallin, greater deamidation of Gln-50 and Asn-101 has been reported compared with Gln-6 and Asn-123 in high molecular weight and water-insoluble proteins (18Takemoto L. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Hanson S.R.A. Hasan A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 23Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 110-118PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, in αB-crystallin, deamidation of Gln and Asn residues has been shown (23Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 110-118PubMed Google Scholar). 2O. P. Srivastava, unpublished results. Because deamidation introduces a negative charge, it is believed to cause alterations in protein tertiary structure, affecting their structural and functional properties. However, the effects of deamidation on structure and function of αA- and αB-crystallins have not been investigated until recently. Our recent report showed that the deamidation of the Asn-146 residue and not the Asn-78 residue in human αB-crystallin resulted in significant changes in its structural and functional properties (24Gupta R. Srivastava O.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although both Asn-78 and Asn-146 are present in the conserved regions of the αB-crystallin, the dramatic effects of deamidation of Asn-146, which is close to the C-terminal region, were surprising. A similar investigation of the effect of deamidation of Asn-101 and Asn-123 (also present in the conserved region) of αA-crystallin on its structural and functional properties has been lacking in the literature. Additionally, although interaction between αA- and αB-crystallins in their oligomeric form is needed for the molecular chaperone activity and for the maintenance of lens transparency (25Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41004-41010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Bera S. Abraham E.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the effect of deamidation on subunit interactions and chaperone activity is also presently unknown. However, another intriguing question is how deamidation in αA and αB subunits affects the formation of the α-crystallin heteroaggregate and affects its structural and functional properties. It has been reported that the αA- and αB-crystallin subunits constantly undergo rapid exchange, which might be responsible for oligomer stability and suppression of the nonspecific aggregation of crystallins (28Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation was a recent report (29Shroff N.P. Cherian-Shaw M. Bera S. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showing that mutation of R116C in αA-crystallin resulted in altered subunit composition with WT-αB in the heteroaggregates and increased oligomer size compared with the oligomers of WT-αA and WT-αB subunits. Similarly, the mutation of Arg to Asp in αA-crystallin resulted in a drastic change in protein structure (30Bera S. Thampi P. Cho W.J. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12421-12426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is consistent with Studer's study, which showed that chaperone activity is coupled to multimerization in bacterium α-HSP protein from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (31Studer S. Obrist M. Lentze N. Narberhaus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To answer the questions raised above, the objectives of this study were to determine: (a) the effect of deamidation of Asn on structural and functional properties of αA-crystallin and (b) the effect of deamidation of αA- or αB-crystallins on oligomerization with WT-αA/WT-αB subunits and their structural and functional properties. The results presented show that the deamidation of both Asn-101 and Asn-123 in αA-crystallin altered its structural and functional properties but relatively more so by deamidation of the Asn-101 residue. Similarly, compared with heteroaggregates of WT-αA- and WT-αB-crystallins, the heteroaggregates containing deamidated αA or αB mutants and their counterpart WT proteins showed higher molecular mass, altered tertiary structure, lower exposure of hydrophobic surface, and reduced chaperone activity. Further, heteroaggregate-containing WTαA-crystallin and deamidated αB mutants showed lower chaperone activity, smaller sized oligomers, and a 3-fold lower subunit exchange rate compared with heteroaggregates containing deamidated αA mutants and WTαB-crystallin. The restriction endonucleases NcoI and EcoRV, the molecular weight protein markers and DNA markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Promega (Madison WI), respectively. The T7 promoter, T7 terminator, and other primers used in the study were obtained either from Invitrogen or from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Oligo Synthesizing Core Facility. Molecular biology grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. All chemicals for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were from Amersham Biosciences or Bio-Rad (South San Francisco, CA). DEAE-Sephacel, agarose gel A1.5, and butyl-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Two fluorescent probes, lucifer yellow iodoacetamide (LYI) and 4-acetamido-4′-[(iodoacetyl) amino]stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic, disodium salt (AIAS) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Unless indicated otherwise, all other chemicals used in this study were purchased from Fisher or Sigma. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacterial strain was obtained from Promega. The human αB-crystallin cDNA cloned on a plasmid pDIRECT was received from Dr. Mark Petrash (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Cells were propagated in Luria broth, and recombinant bacteria were selected using ampicillin. Deamidation of Asn to Asp at position 101 or 123 or both in αA-cDNA was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human αA-crystallin coding sequence was cloned in pDIRECT as described earlier (32Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These constructs were used as templates with the mutated primers (where Asn was replaced by Asp) (Table I) to generate site-specific mutations. Briefly, 25 ng of template was used, and the PCR conditions were as follows: predenaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 16 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extensions at 68 °C for 5 min. After digestion with DpnI, 2 μl of the PCR product was used to transform XL1-Blue supercompetent cells provided with the above Stratagene kit. The positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in the site-specific mutagenesis of Asn-101, Asn-123, and Asn-101/123 to Asp in human lens αA-crystallinConstructsPrimersN101DForward5′-ATCCACGGAAAGCACGACGAGCGCCAGGACGACC-3′Reverse5′-GGTCGTCCTGGCGCTCGTCGTGCTTTCCGTGGAT-3′N123DForward5′-GCTACCGCCTGCCGTCCGACGTGGACCAGTCGGCC-3′Reverse5′-GGCCGACTGGTCCACGTCGGACGGCAGGCGGTAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS was transformed with mutant amplicons using a standard E. coli transformation procedure. The crystallin constructs were grown in LB medium to a cell density of ∼0.5–0.6 at 600 nm and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The purification method for the WT and three αA mutants was similar to one used previously to purify the WT and deamidated αB mutants (24Gupta R. Srivastava O.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and, after a freezethaw cycle, were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.3 mm NaCl (TEN buffer). Following centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant fraction was collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT (TED buffer), and subjected to DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography using a 3 × 30-cm column. The bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in TED buffer. The αA-crystallin species-containing fractions, identified by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 5 °C for 24 h. Next, the preparation was subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a butyl-Sepharose column (3 × 20 cm). The column equilibration buffer was 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, and the bound proteins were eluted with a decreasing (NH4)2SO4 concentration (i.e. 0.5 m to 0 m). The crystallin-containing fractions were identified as above by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon stirred cell (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The purity of WT and mutant αA-crystallin species was examined by SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described below. The protein concentrations were determined with either a Pierce protein determination kit or absorbance at 280 nm. The total protein yields of different αA species were as follows: WT-αA-crystallin, 1 mg/ml; mutant N101D, 1.6 mg/ml; mutant N123D, 1.3 mg/ml; and mutant N101D/N123D, 1 mg/ml. The protein samples were mixed with resolubilization buffer (5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% caprylylsulfobetaine 3–10, 2 mm tributyl phosphine, 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0) in the ratio 2:1, respectively (34Herbert B.R. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Each preparation was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension). Isoelectric focusing separation was carried out using Immobiline dry strips (pH range of 3–10) by following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE in the second dimension was performed using a 15% polyacrylamide gel by Laemmli's method (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue in recombinant αA-crystallin species was covalently labeled with LYI (8.4 mm) by following the method of Bova et al. (28Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). The desired crystallin species (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.9, containing 100 mm NaCl. The disulfide bonds in proteins were reduced using a 10-fold molar excess of Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (15 μlof1 m solution) to liberate free thiol for maximum labeling followed by incubation first at room temperature for 14 h and then at 37 °C for 6 h. Upon completion of the reaction, a 5-fold excess of β-mercaptoethanol was added to consume excess thiol-reactive reagent. Similarly, using exactly the above conditions, the recombinant αB-crystallin species were labeled with AIAS (8.4 mm) by incubation at room temperature for 12 h. The extent of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients of 47,000 mol–1 cm–1 at 336 nm for AIAS and 11,000 mol–1 cm–1 at 426 nm for LYI (values given by Molecular Probes), and corrected protein concentration for the contribution of the dye at 280 nm was determined. The unbound (AIAS) dye was then separated from fluorescence-labeled protein by a Sephadex G-25 column chromatography, using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA for column equilibration and sample elution. Similarly, the unbound LYI was separated from the protein preparations by dialysis against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 24 h at 4 °C with three changes of the buffer. The purified WT-αA was mixed with purified WT-αB or the individual purified αB-deamidated mutants (i.e. N78D, N146D, or N78D/N146D) at a 3:1 ratio. Similarly, purified WT-αB was mixed with purified individual αA-deamidated mutants (i.e. N101D, N123D, or N101D/N123D) at a 1:3 ratio. The molecular weights of the resulting heteroaggregates were determined using the static light scattering (SLS) method as described below. The chaperone activities, surface hydrophobicity, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the heteroaggregates were also determined using the methods described below. The rate of subunit exchange in the heteroaggregates (WT-αA:WT-αB, WT-αA:αB-N146D, αA-N101D:WT-αB, αA-N123D:WT-αB, and αA-N101D/N123D:WT-αB) was determined by mixing the AIAS-labeled WT-αB or individual αB mutants with LYI-labeled WT-αA or individual αA mutants and using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method as described below. In a separate experiment, the formation of heteroaggregates following denaturation of αA or αB species by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and renaturation after the removal of GdnHCl by dialysis was determined. Using this method, the heteroaggregate formation between the following species at a ratio of 3:1 (αA:αB) was examined: (a) WT-αA:WT-αB; (b) αA-N101D mutant:WT-αB; (c) αA-N123D:WT-αB; (d) αA-N101D/N123D mutant:WT-αB; (e) WT-αA:αB-N146D mutant. The purified WT-αA/deamidated αA mutants were mixed with their purified counterparts in a 3:1 ratio (αA:αB), followed by denaturation in 4 m GdnHCl and renaturation as described by the Bera et al. method (30Bera S. Thampi P. Cho W.J. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12421-12426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the individual heteroaggregates were mixed to 4 m GdnHCl (final concentration) and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h. This was followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 5 °C for 48 h with four changes of the buffer. To ascertain whether the GdnHCl denaturation and renaturation treatment provided a functionally active heteroaggregate, their chaperone activity against insulin as a target protein was determined. Chaperone Activity Assays—The chaperone activity was determined by using three target proteins (i.e. insulin, citrate synthase (CS), and recombinant human γD-crystallin) essentially by the methods previously described (24Gupta R. Srivastava O.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The aggregation of insulin by 20 mm DTT at 25 °C, citrate synthase at 43 °C, and γD-crystallin at 63 °C either in the absence or at varying concentrations of different αA-crystallin species (i.e. WT-αA, N101D, N123D, and N101D/N123D mutants) was determined. The aggregation was monitored using light scattering at 360 nm with time (60 min) using a Shimadzu UV-VIS scanning spectrophotometer (model UV2101 PC) equipped with a six-cell holder (Shimadzu model CPS-260) and a temperature controller (Shimadzu model CPS 260). Fluorescence Studies—All fluorescence spectra were recorded in corrected spectrum mode using a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission band passes set at 5 and 3 nm, respectively. The total intrinsic Trp fluorescence intensities of the WT-αA, the three deamidated αA mutants, and the α-crystallin heteroaggregates (0.15 mg/ml each), dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, were recorded with an excitation at 295 nm and emission between 300 and 400 nm. The binding of a hydrophobic probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfate (ANS) to WT-αA, deamidated αA mutants, and the α-crystallin heteroaggregates was determined by recording fluorescence spectra with excitation at 390 nm and emission between 400 and 600 nm. In these experiments, 15 μl of 0.8 mm ANS (dissolved in methanol, 12 μm) was added to the protein preparations (0.15 mg/ml, dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. In another experiment, the WT-αA and the three αA mutants were heated with the above described ANS concentration at 43 °C for 10 min, and fluorescence spectra were determined after cooling the preparations to room temperature. Circular Dichroism Studies—To investigate the conformational changes in the WT-αA and the three deamidated αA mutants, the CD spectra were determined using a JasCo spectropolarimeter model 62DS at room temperature. The αA-crystallin preparations at 0.1 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml (dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) were used for recording the far- and near-UV CD spectra, respectively. The path length was 0.1 and 1 cm during the far- and near-UV CD spectra determination, respectively. The spectra reported are the average of five scans, corrected for buffer blank and were smoothed. Secondary structures were estimated using the PROSEC program (35Hejtmancik J.F. Wingfield P.T. Chambers C. Russell P. Chen H.-C. Sergeeve Y.V. Hope J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Static Light Scattering—Determination of molecular weights of WT-αA, the three deamidated αA mutants, and the α-crystallin heteroaggregates was carried out using an SLS instrument (model 202, Precision Detectors), which exploits gel permeation chromatography, coupled to low and high angle laser light scattering, and a differential refractive index detector. All proteins were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and preparations were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to their analysis. Results utilized both 90 and 15° light scattering detection. To reconstitute α-crystallin heteroaggregates (1 mg/ml), the purified preparations of deamidated αA and deamidated αB species were mixed at a ratio of 3:1 (αA/αB). Measurement of Subunit Exchange Rate—FRET was carried out to determine the subunit exchange rate in α-crystallin heteroaggregates containing deamidated αA/αB and their counterpart WT proteins as described by Bova et al. (28Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Briefly, the exchange reaction was initiated by mixing 0.4 mg/ml LYI-labeled WT-αA or LYI-labeled individual αA mutants with 0.4 mg/ml AIAS-labeled WT-αB crystallin. At the desired time intervals (described in the figure legends), 20 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and diluted 100-fold with buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT). The emission spectrum of the aliquots (excitation at 426 nm and emission at 525 nm) was recorded using a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (model RF 5301PC). The rate constant was obtained by fitting the data to the exponential function F(t) = C1 + C2e–kt, where F(t) represents the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm, and k is the rate constant for subunit exchange. The constants C1 + C2 = 1 at time 0, and C1 is the fluorescence intensity at time ∝. In two individual αA-crystallin mutants, the Asn-101 or Asn-123 residues were changed to Asp, and in another double mutant, both Asn-101 and Asn-123 were changed to Asp. The resulting three deamidated proteins are referred as N101D, N123D, and N101D/N123D mutants throughout. DNA sequencing results confirmed the mutations of Asn to Asp at the desired positions in the three mutants. To confirm this further, the expressed WT-αA-crystallin and the three mutant proteins were analyzed by the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric method after trypsin digestion. The isotopic distribution of tryptic fragments further confirmed mutation(s) of Asn to Asp at the desired sites in the three mutant proteins. The tryptic peptides with a mass of 1627.4 (residues 100–112; HNERQDDHGYISR; Fig. 1B) and 2785.7 (residues 120–145; LPSNVDQSALSCSLSADGMLTFC"

https://openalex.org/W2164665055,"Apicomplexan parasites have the smallest known mitochondrial genome. It consists of a repeated element of ∼6–7 kb in length and encodes three mitochondrial proteins, a number of rRNA fragments, but no tRNAs. It has therefore been postulated that in apicomplexans all tRNAs required for mitochondrial translation are imported from the cytosol. To provide direct evidence for this process we have established a cell fractionation procedure allowing the isolation of defined organellar RNA fractions from the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. Analysis of T. gondii total and organellar RNA by Northern hybridization showed that except for the cytosol-specific initiator tRNAMet all nucleus-encoded tRNAs tested were present in the cytosol and in the mitochondrion but not in the plastid. Thus, these results provide the first experimental evidence for mitochondrial tRNA import in apicomplexans. The only other taxon that imports the whole set of mitochondrial tRNAs are the trypanosomatids. Interestingly, the initiator tRNAMet is the only cytosol-specific tRNA in trypanosomatids, indicating that the import specificity is identical in both groups. In agreement with this, the T. gondii initiator tRNAMet remained in the cytosol when expressed in Trypanosoma brucei. However, in contrast to trypanosomatids, no thio-modifications were detected in the tRNAGln of T. gondii indicating that, unlike what is suggested in Leishmania, they are not involved in regulating import.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of humans and animals. Whereas in immunocompetent individuals a T. gondii infection is generally asymptomatic, immunosuppressed patients are at risk of severe disease (1Black M.W. Boothroyd J.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, belong to the apicomplexans and are evolutionarily closely related. Thus, in addition to being an important pathogen of its own, T. gondii serves as a model system for Plasmodium to study some experimentally less accessible aspects of apicomplexan biology (2Kim K. Weiss L.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interestingly, apicomplexans contain a non-photosynthetic plastid whose genome shares many features with chloroplast DNA (3McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As expected for eukaryotes, apicomplexans also contain mitochondria. However, although much effort has been invested to investigate the plastid, there are only very few studies on apicomplexan mitochondria. This is surprising, because their biology is not only expected to be of medical relevance but, due to some unique features, is also of great interest for basic science. It has been proposed that the contribution of mitochondrial ATP synthesis to the total cellular pool is minimal (4Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a mitochondrial membrane potential has been demonstrated in both intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites (5Vercesi A.E. Rodrigues C.O. Uyemura S.A. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31040-31047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and intraerythrocytic Plasmodium yoelii (4Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the anti-apicomplexan drug atovaquone acts by interfering with the electron transport chain of the parasites through inhibition of cytochrome b in the bc1 complex (4Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This is supported by the detection of mutated cytochrome b genes in the mitochondrial DNA of atovaquone-resistant T. gondii cell lines (6McFadden D.C. Tomavo S. Berry E.A. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the mitochondrial electron transport must be essential for some apicomplexan life cycle stages that are found in the vertebrate host. The most striking difference between mitochondrion of the apicomplexan and that of another of the species is its DNA. It consists of a tandemly repeated element of ∼6–7 kb and encodes subunits I and III of cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome b, and a number of short fragments representing the small and the large subunit rRNAs (7Feagin J.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Feagin J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 81-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Feagin J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This makes it the shortest mitochondrial genome with the most limited coding capacity known. Most interestingly, the apicomplexan mitochondrial genome does not encode any tRNAs. The lack of apparently essential mitochondrial tRNA genes has been reported in other organisms, such as plants, some fungi, and other protozoa. It is known that, in these organisms, the lacking mitochondrial tRNA genes are compensated for by import of the corresponding cytosolic tRNAs (10Schneider A. Marechal-Drouard L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The number of tRNAs that are imported depends on the species. Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria import a single tRNA only. Plants import a significant fraction of their mitochondrial tRNAs but still have mitochondria-encoded ones. The most extreme situation is found in trypanosomatids (such as Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania) (11Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19208-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Simpson A.M. Suyama Y. Dewes H. Campbell D.A. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5427-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a group of parasitic protozoa that evolutionarily are not related with the apicomplexans but whose mitochondrial genomes, like those of apicomplexans, completely lack mitochondrial tRNA genes. Whereas nothing is known about mitochondrial tRNA import in apicomplexans, the process has been studied in quite some detail in trypanosomatids. It was shown that an imported nucleus-encoded mitochondrial tRNA always represents only a small fraction (typically 1–7%) of a normal cytosolic tRNA (13Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although all mitochondrial tRNAs derive from the cytosol, a single cytosol-specific tRNA has been identified in T. brucei. This tRNA corresponds to the eukaryotic initiator tRNAMet (tRNAMet-i), 1The abbreviations used are: tRNAMet-i, initiator tRNAMet; tRNAMet-e, elongator tRNAMet; LSU rRNA, large subunit ribosomal RNA; MTF, tRNAMet-formyl transferase. and its cytosol-specific localization is mediated by two nucleotide pairs in the T-stem of the tRNA (14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, results obtained in Leishmania suggest that cytosol-specific 2-thiouridines, which are found in the anticodon wobble position of tRNAGlu(UUC) and tRNAGln-(UUG), may regulate the extent of import because the two tRNAs carrying these modifications were prevented from being imported in vitro (15Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to directly demonstrate tRNA import in the apicomplexan T. gondii and to determine its specificity. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the features of mitochondrial tRNA import in T. gondii to the one of trypanosomatids. Cells—Tachyzoites of T. gondii (RH strain) were maintained in Vero cell monolayers at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2–10% immunoglobulin-free horse serum. Tachyozoites were harvested from their feeder cell cultures as previously described (16Hemphill A. Gottstein B. Kaufmann H. Parasitol. 1996; 112: 183-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation containing tachyzoites and host cell debris was washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and passed through a pre-equilibrated Sephadex G-25M column. The eluted purified parasites were centrifuged (3000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C), and the resulting pellets were used either directly, to isolate total RNA and for in vivo aminoacylations, or they were subjected to subcellular fractionation. Procyclic T. brucei cells, stock 427, were grown at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested at late log phase, corresponding to 2.5 × 107 to 3.5 × 107 cells/ml, and washed once in cold 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9) containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm glucose. The resulting cellular pellets were used either to isolate total RNA or to prepare mitochondria. Subcellular Fractionation of T. gondii—Washed T. gondii cells (2 × 108 cells corresponding to ∼0.5 mg of protein) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of SoTE (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA). Five percent of the sample (25 μl) was removed to isolate the total RNA. After the addition of 0.475 ml of SoTE containing either 0.1% (0.05% final) or 0.2% (0.1% final) of digitonin, the samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated on ice for 5 min. The suspensions were centrifuged (8000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants were discarded. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of SoTE containing 1 μg of RNase A and incubated on ice for 15 min to digest the contaminating cytosolic RNAs. The organellar fractions used to isolate RNA were recovered in the pellets after a final centrifugation step. Subcellular Fractionation of T. brucei—Digitonin extraction (final concentration, 0.035%) was essentially performed as described previously (14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained pellet was essentially free of cytosolic RNA and, because T. brucei does not have a plastid, corresponded to a crude mitochondrial fraction. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—RNA from total cells or digitonin-treated fractions of T. gondii or T. brucei was purified by using the acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate method as previously described (17Chomczyinski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). The samples containing the isolated RNAs were separated on 8 m urea-10% polyacrylamide gels. A formaldehyde-agarose gel was used for the Northern analysis of the cytochrome b mRNA. Blotting and hybridizations using 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides were done as described (13Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Affinity gel-electrophoresis for thio-modified residues (Fig. 5) was performed on 8 m urea-10% polyacrylamide gels containing 25 μm ((N-acryloylamino)phenyl)mercuric chloride (18Igloi G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Hybridization Probes—Oligonucleotides recognizing the cytosolic 5.8 S rRNA (GAGCCAAGACATCCATTG) (19Guay J.M. Huot A. Gagnon S. Tremblay A. Levesque R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the plastid tRNAMet (AACCTGCTCTACCCCGCT) (20Williamson D.H. Denny P.W. Moore P.W. Sato S. McCready S. Wilson R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial large subunit (LSU) rRNA fragment (GACAAGGATTTTCCTACCTT) of T. gondii (21Ossorio P.N. Sibley L.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were designed using published sequence information. The probe to detect mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome b mRNA (6McFadden D.C. Tomavo S. Berry E.A. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was prepared by PCR amplification using CGAGAACACTCAGTCTATC and CAGATACGTAGAAACCTCC as primers. Oligonucleotides hybridizing to nucleus-encoded T. gondii tRNAs were designed using sequence information from the public T. gondii databases (preliminary genomic and/or cDNA sequence data were accessed via ToxoDB.org and/or www.tigr.org/tdb/t_gondii/). tRNA genes were identified by BLAST using tRNA genes from other organisms as templates. The following oligonucleotides were used: tRNAAla (TGGACGACATGGGTATCG), tRNAIle (TGGTCCCAACCGGGATCG), tRNASer (CGACGGCGGCAGGATTCG), tRNATrp (TGAGCCCAGAGCGACTCG), tRNAMet-e (CTGCGAGGATCGAACTCG), tRNAMet-i (CCCACTGAGCTACGGTGC), and tRNAGln (AGGTCCCACCGGGACTCG). To detect T. brucei tRNAs (Fig. 4) the following probes were used: GTGGTGGTCCTACCAGGAT for tRNAGln and TGAGGACTGCAGGGATTG for tRNATrp. The oligonucleotides hybridizing to the T. brucei tRNAMet-i and tRNAMet-e are described in Ref. 14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. In Vivo Aminoacylation Assay—Washed T. gondii (5 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 300 μl of 1× SBG (20 mm glucose, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.9) containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 20–40 μCi of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture (>1000 Ci/mmol). The labeled [35S]cysteine (∼25% of total) was competed out by the addition of 0.5 mm unlabeled cysteine. The reaction was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Intact cells were then centrifuged (3000 × g, for 3 min at 4 °C), and the RNA was isolated from the resulting pellet as described above. In Vitro Aminoacylation Assay—The assays were done in 100 μl of acylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 20–40 μCi of a [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture, 0.5 mm unlabeled cysteine, 2 mm ATP, RNA isolated from 107T. gondii tachyzoites or from the digitonin fractions (2 × 108 cell equivalents each), and 30–60 μg of RNA-free cytosolic protein extract of either T. gondii or T. brucei, as sources of methionyl-tRNA synthetase activity (22Tan T.H.P. Bochud-Allemannn N. Horn E.K. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To be able to test externally added substrate tRNAs, it was essential to use protein extracts that were free of endogenous RNAs. Removal of endogenous RNA from the cytosolic fractions was achieved through binding to a DEAE-Sepharose column in the presence of 150 mm NaCl (23Nabholz C.E. Hauser R. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7903-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubation was for 15 min at 37 °C, and RNAs were re-isolated as described above. The 35S-labeled tRNAsMet from both the in vivo and the in vitro assays were analyzed on 8 m urea/10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by fluorography. To prevent deacylation of the labeled tRNAsMet during electrophoresis, the samples were subjected to a deamination procedure (11Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19208-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of T. brucei—For expression of wild-type and variant T. gondii tRNAMet-i in T. brucei cells, derivatives of the pHD-437 plasmid (24Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 85: 99-112Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which allow stable integration into the trypanosomal rDNA loci, were used. The KpnI/BamHI fragment of the plasmid was replaced by inserts containing either T. gondii wild-type or variant genes of tRNAsMet. Variations in the tRNAMet-i were introduced by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. Both tRNAsMet-i were expressed containing 179 nucleotides of their own 5′-flanking region and 61 nucleotides of their 3′-flanking sequence. The constructs were linearized with NotI and electroporated into T. brucei, and transformants were selected with phleomycine and cloned as previously described (25Beverley S.M. Clayton C.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 333-348PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of T. gondii Organellar RNA Fractions—To investigate mitochondrial tRNA import in T. gondii it was essential to prepare defined organellar RNA fractions, which can be analyzed by Northern blots using oligonucleotides recognizing specific nucleus-encoded T. gondii tRNAs. BLAST searches on the available T. gondii genomic sequences allowed us to identify candidate tRNA genes by homology to the corresponding tRNAs in other organisms. Preparing defined organellar RNA fractions of T. gondii was a bigger challenge for the following reasons. It is difficult and expensive to obtain T. gondii cells in large quantities, and, contrary to T. brucei, apicomplexans in addition to mitochondria also contain a plastid that has its own genome and translation system. It was therefore necessary not only to fractionate the mitochondria from the cytosol but also to separate the two organelles from each other. Recently, we have performed an extensive analysis of mitochondrial tRNA import in T. brucei requiring the isolation of mitochondrial RNAs from many different cell lines (13Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was achieved by using the detergent digitonin, which at the correct concentration selectively dissolves the cellular membranes but leaves (at least the inner) mitochondrial membrane(s) intact. Subsequent RNase digestion allows the removal of contaminating cytosolic RNAs. Finally, a centrifugation step results in a pellet that essentially only contains mitochondrial RNAs. The big advantage of this procedure is that it requires a relatively small number of cells only. We therefore tested whether the procedure would be suitable for apicomplexans. Purified and washed T. gondii tachyzoites were extracted with 0.05 and 0.1% of digitonin and subjected to RNase digestion. The resulting RNA fractions together with total T. gondii RNA were then analyzed by specific Northern hybridizations. To identify the different organellar fractions oligonucleotide probes recognizing specific marker RNAs were used. These RNAs were the 5.8 S rRNA for the cytosol and the plastid-encoded tRNAMet for the plastid, both of which can easily be detected on Northern blots. To choose a mitochondrial marker was more difficult, because the mitochondrial genome of T. gondii, unlike that of many other apicomplexans, has not been sequenced yet. However, fragments apparently derived from the mitochondrial DNA have been detected in the nuclear genome of T. gondii (21Ossorio P.N. Sibley L.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These sequences appear to code for typical mitochondrially encoded proteins and show a high homology to the mitochondrial genomes of other apicomplexans but are not expressed. Southern blot hybridization furthermore showed that in addition to the nucleus these sequences also occur in an extrachromosomal, tandemly repeated element of ∼6 kb, suggesting that they are also present within the bona fide mitochondrial genome of T. gondii (8Feagin J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 81-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We therefore chose a segment of the nuclear mitochondrial-like sequences that is identical to a region coding for a fragment of the mitochondrial LSU rRNA in Plasmodium to design an oligonucleotide expected to hybridize to mitochondrial RNA only. It has been shown that specific mutations in the cytochrome b gene lead to atovaquone-resistant T. gondii cells, indicating that mitochondrial cytochrome b is expressed (6McFadden D.C. Tomavo S. Berry E.A. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the putative LSU rRNA we were using the mRNA of cytochrome b as a mitochondrial marker. The results of a digitonin-based organellar fractionation of T. gondii cells are shown in Fig. 1. Total RNA and RNA isolated from the RNase-treated pellet fractions obtained from 0.05 and 0.1% digitonin extractions were tested for the presence of cytosolic and organellar RNAs. The top panel shows that as expected the cytosolic marker, 5.8 S rRNA, is detected in the total RNA fraction only. The next two panels show the intracellular distribution of the mitochondrial LSU rRNA fragment and cytochrome b mRNA, respectively. Both RNAs are recovered in the 0.05% digitonin fraction but are accessible to added nucleases in the presence of 0.1% of detergent. Thus, mitochondria with an intact membrane barrier are specifically recovered in the 0.05% digitonin fraction. The last panel shows that the plastid marker, the tRNAMet, remains protected from added RNase in both pellet fractions, indicating that the plastid membranes (at least the innermost), unlike the mitochondrial ones, remain intact even after the 0.1% digitonin extraction. Hence, 0.05% digitonin extraction and subsequent RNase digestion yield a fraction containing mitochondrial and plastid RNAs, which is essentially free of intact cytosolic RNAs. Extraction with 0.1% digitonin, in contrast, results in a fraction containing plastid RNAs only. Nucleus-encoded T. gondii tRNAs Are Imported into Mitochondria—Fig. 1B shows the intracellular distribution of four nucleus-encoded T. gondii tRNAs. All were detected in the total RNA fraction as well as in the 0.05% digitonin pellet but were absent from the 0.1% pellet. These results show that, although the largest fraction of each of the tRNAs is found in the cytosol (note that the total RNA fraction essentially corresponds to the cytosol), a small but significant part is recovered in the mitochondria. Quantitatively between 1.5 and 2% of the total cellular content of each tRNA is localized within the mitochondrion (Fig. 1C). These numbers are in the same range as those for T. brucei where 1–7% of a given tRNA is localized within mitochondria (13Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Localization of T. gondii tRNAsMet—A global analysis of mitochondrial tRNA import in T. brucei has shown that, with a single exception, all trypanosomal tRNAs are in part imported into mitochondria (13Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The only tRNA behaving differently is the tRNAMet-i, which is exclusively found in the cytosol. It was therefore of great interest to analyze the intracellular localization of the nucleus-encoded T. gondii tRNAsMet. As expected BLAST searches of the T. gondii genomic sequences identified two distinct but homologous tRNAsMet, one corresponding to the elongator tRNAMet (tRNAMet-e) and the other one corresponding to the eukaryotic tRNAMet-i (Fig. 2A). In agreement with this we found two [35S]methionine-labeled bands in an in vivo aminoacylation experiment (Fig. 2B, left lane), suggesting that only two cytosolic tRNAMet exist in T. gondii. Furthermore, comparison with a Northern blot analysis run on a duplicate gel and using oligonucleotides designed to specifically detect either of the two tRNAsMet allowed us to attribute the upper band to the tRNAMet-i and the lower one to the tRNAMet-e. Using the same oligonucleotides we also analyzed the RNA fraction from both total cells and from digitonin-extracted samples. The results in Fig. 2C show that the tRNAMet-e is imported into mitochondria and therefore behaves the same as all the other tRNAs tested before (Fig. 1B). However, reminiscent of the situation in T. brucei, the T. gondii tRNAMet-i remained in the cytosol. The quantification in Fig. 2D shows that less of the tRNAMet-i is found in the mitochondrial fraction than of the cytosolic marker, the full-length 5.8 S rRNA. This can be explained by the fact that tRNAs are expected to be soluble molecules, whereas the 5.8 S rRNA is a component of ribosomes and some of which may remain associated with mitochondria. In a further analysis we subjected aliquots of total and digitonin-extracted organellar RNA fractions to in vitro aminoacylation assays using radioactive [35S]methionine and either RNA-free cytosolic extract of T. brucei or T. gondii as a source of enzyme. As expected and in agreement with the in vivo results shown in Fig. 2B, for both extracts two labeled bands, corresponding to tRNAMet-i and tRNAMet-e, were detected in the total RNA fraction (Fig. 3, left lanes). In the 0.05% digitonin pellet containing the mitochondrial RNAs, only the lower band corresponding to the tRNAMet-e was observed (Fig. 3, middle lanes). Thus, these results confirm the cytosol-specific localization of the tRNAMet-i. Furthermore, they suggest that the only tRNAMet present in mitochondria of T. gondii, corresponds to the tRNAMet-e identified in the genomic data base. The methionyl-tRNA synthetase activity in the T. gondii cytosolic extract was lower than the one in the T. brucei extract. This is explained by the fact that it was difficult to prepare a sufficiently concentrated RNA-free cytosolic fraction from T. gondii due to the limited amount of material that was available. However, this cannot account for the fact that the T. gondii methionyl-tRNA synthetase preferentially charges the tRNAMet-e when tested in vitro (Fig. 3, bottom panel left lane), whereas the T. brucei extract preferentially charges the tRNAMet-i (Fig. 3, top panel left lane). There are at least two possible explanations for this observation. It could be that, although the methionyl-tRNA synthetase activities in T. gondii and T. brucei can in principle charge both T. gondii tRNAsMet, their preferred substrate tRNAsMet are different. Alternatively, it is possible that the T. brucei extract aminoacylates (with methionine) a T. gondii tRNA species other than tRNAMet. Expression of T. gondii tRNAsMet in T. brucei—Expression of tRNAMet variants in transgenic T. brucei has successfully been used to identify the determinants responsible for their intracellular localization (14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In principle the same approach should be feasible for T. gondii. However, despite repeated attempts, we were not able to express tRNAMet variants in transgenic T. gondii. We therefore took the converse approach and expressed T. gondii tRNAsMet in T. brucei. However, this was also problematic, because, of the many variants of T. gondii tRNAMet that were assessed, only the wild-type tRNAMet-i and a variant thereof carrying the T-arm of the tRNAMet-e could be expressed. This was surprising, because we have previously successfully expressed many variants of trypanosomal (14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as heterologous tRNAs (26Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and this suggests that for unknown reasons expression of most T. gondii tRNAMet variants is harmful for T. brucei. The results of the two T. gondii tRNAsMet that could be expressed are shown in Fig. 4. Total and mitochondrial RNA from wild-type and the two transgenic T. brucei cell lines were analyzed for the presence of the T. gondii tRNAMet-i (Fig. 4, middle panel) and the tRNAMet-i variant carrying the T-arm of the T. gondii tRNAMet-e (Fig. 4, right panel), respectively. The top panel in Fig. 4 shows that in T. brucei both T. gondii tRNAsMet remain in the cytosol. The lower two panels of Fig. 4 show the intracellular distribution of the trypanosomal wild-type tRNAMet-i, which serves as the cytosolic marker, and that of the partially imported wild-type tRNAMet-e, respectively. The fact that the T. gondii tRNAMet-i remains in the cytosol is expected, because it contains the cytosolic T-stem localization determinants, which were defined for the T. brucei tRNAsMet (14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytosolic localization of the tRNAMet-i variant carrying the T-arm of the T. gondii tRNAMet-e is unexpected, because it contains the predicted trypanosomal mitochondrial T-stem localization determinants. It is therefore possible that the localization determinants in T. gondii and T. brucei tRNAsMet are different. However, we cannot exclude that the T. gondii tRNAMet-i variant when expressed in T. brucei is less efficiently charged. The unexpected localization of the T. gondii tRNAMet-i variant, therefore, does not automatically mean that incompatible localization determinants are present but could in principle be a secondary effect due to poor charging. Interestingly, however, as shown in previous experiments (26Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) most heterologous elongator tRNAs behave differently and generally are imported into trypanosomal mitochondria indicating that, at least for elongator tRNAs, import is the default pathway. Absence of Thio-modified Nucleotides in T. gondii tRNAGln and tRNATrp—In trypanosomatids all tRNAs, with the exception of the tRNAMet-i, are imported into the mitochondria to variable extents, and as shown in this work the same appears to be true for T. gondii. This raises the question of how the extent of import is regulated. Recently, it was suggested that in Leishmania, this is achieved by cytosol-specific 2-thiouridines, which are found in the anticodon wobble position of leishmanial tRNAGlu and tRNAGln and which act as anti-import determinants (15Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To see whether this might also be the case in apicomplexans we analyzed the T. gondii tRNAGln for the presence of thio-modified nucleotides by using affinity gel electrophoresis for thiolated residues (18Igloi G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The result of such an analysis for the T. brucei tRNAGln is shown in the left panel of Fig. 5. A retardation of the band, which is specific for the cytosolic fraction, was observed indicating that the cytosolic but not the mitochondrial tRNAGln contains a thio-modified nucleotide. The converse result was obtained for the T. brucei tRNATrp, part of which was selectively thio-modified in the mitochondrial fraction only (Fig. 5, bottom left panel). These results are identical to the ones obtained for Leishmania, where cytosol- and mitochondria-specific thiolation of the tRNAGln (15Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and tRNATrp (27Crain P.F. Alfonzo J.D. Rozenski J. Kapushoc S.T. McCloskey J.A. Simpson L. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), respectively, have first been described and suggest that the pattern of thio-modifications is conserved within trypanosomatids. Interestingly, a very different result is obtained for T. gondii tRNAGln and tRNATrp. Both tRNAs were lacking any thio-modified nucleotides, irrespective of whether they were isolated from the cytosol or from mitochondria. Thus, in T. gondii, unlike that suggested in trypanosomatids, thio-modified nucleotides cannot be involved in regulating the extent of tRNAGln import. Furthermore, the fact that thio-modified nucleotides were also absent from the imported tRNATrp may indicate a general absence of thio-modified tRNAs in T. gondii. The mitochondrial genome of apicomplexans lacks tRNA genes (7Feagin J.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has therefore been postulated that these organisms import all their tRNAs from the cytosol. Using defined organellar RNA fractions, obtained by a newly established fractionation procedure (Fig. 1A), we have tested this prediction for the apicomplexan parasite T. gondii. Six out of six nucleus-encoded elongator-type tRNAs (tRNAAla, tRNAIle, tRNASer, tRNATrp, tRNAGln, and tRNAMet-e) tested were in part recovered in the mitochondrial fraction (Figs. 1B, 2C, and 5) and therefore imported from the cytosol. This suggests that in T. gondii a small fraction of any given cytosolic elongator-type tRNA is imported into mitochondria. Interestingly, however, the nucleus-encoded eukaryotic-type tRNAMet-i only occurs in the cytosol. tRNAMet-i and tRNAMet-e differ only by 31 nucleotides (Fig. 2A) indicating that these differences or a subset thereof must be responsible for their differential localization. This situation is reminiscent of the one in the trypanosomatid T. brucei, which also imports all mitochondrial tRNAs (13Tan T.H.P. Pach R. Crausaz A. Ivens A. Schneider A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the only trypanosomal cytosol-specific tRNA, just as in T. gondii, corresponds to the cytosolic tRNAMet-i. It differs from the imported tRNAMet-e by 26 nucleotides, and a recent study (14Crausaz-Esseiva A. Marechal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Schneider A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2750-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that two nucleotide pairs in the T-stem region are both necessary and sufficient to specify the localization of the trypanosomal tRNAsMet. Imported tRNAs are always of the eukaryotic type (10Schneider A. Marechal-Drouard L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, we have the extraordinary situation in T. gondii and T. brucei mitochondria of a bacterial-type translation system that has to function with imported eukaryotic type tRNAs only. Although most eukaryotic type tRNAs can be expected to function in the context of a bacterial type translation system, this is not the case for tRNAsMet. All organisms have two classes of tRNAsMet, an tRNAMet-i, which is used for initiation of protein synthesis, and a tRNAMet-e, which functions in the insertion of methionine into internal peptidic linkages. Whereas elongator tRNAsMet-e of all organisms look similar, there are two distinct groups of tRNAsMet-i. The tRNAMet-i of the eukaryotic cytosol carries an A1:T72 base pair, which is not found in any other tRNA. Bacterial and organellar tRNAsMet-i, on the other hand, are characterized by a mismatch at the top of the acceptor stem and carry a formylated methionine (28RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 547-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Drabkin H.J. Estrella M. Rajbhandary U.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it makes sense that the only cytosol-specific tRNA detected in T. gondii as well as T. brucei corresponds to the eukaryotic-type tRNAMet-i, because this tRNA could not possibly function in the context of the bacterial type translation systems of mitochondria. However, the fact that the imported tRNAMet-e appears to be the only tRNAMet present in mitochondria raises the question of how mitochondrial translation initiation in apicomplexans and trypanosomatids, known to require a formylated bacterial type tRNAMet-i, can function with an imported tRNAMet-e. Mitochondrial translation initiation has been studied in detail in T. brucei, and it was shown that a fraction of the imported tRNAMet-e becomes formylated after import into mitochondria and subsequently can act in translation initiation (22Tan T.H.P. Bochud-Allemannn N. Horn E.K. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Martin N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Formylation of a tRNAMet-e is very unusual and requires a distinct tRNAMet formyl-transferase (MTF). The enzyme has been identified in T. brucei and was shown to have a diametrically opposed substrate specificity compared with all other known bacterial and organellar MTFs, in that it selectively recognizes tRNAMet-e. Furthermore, the trypanosomal protein is approximately twice the size of all other MTFs (22Tan T.H.P. Bochud-Allemannn N. Horn E.K. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1152-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Do apicomplexan mitochondria also use formylated tRNAMet-e to initiate mitochondrial translation? Due to the limited amount of mitochondrial RNA available it was not possible to analyze the formylation state of the imported tRNAMet-e in T. gondii. However, BLAST searches of the two complete and annotated genomes of P. falciparum and Plasmodium yoelli show that these two apicomplexans possess a single MTF, each of which has approximately twice the size of MTFs from other organisms. Preliminary analysis of the as yet unannotated genome suggests that also T. gondii has an unusually large MTF. Thus, it is possible that, just as in T. brucei, the apicomplexan MTF formylates imported tRNAMet-e and that the large molecular weight of the proteins is linked to their unusual substrate specificity. However, the problem with this explanation is that apicomplexans appear to have a single MTF gene only. This is unexpected, because both mitochondria and the plastid are expected to require formylated tRNAMet for organellar translation initiation. It is therefore possible that the identified apicomplexan MTF genes encode the plastid enzymes or that the proteins are targeted to both organelles. Examples for dual targeting of proteins to the plastid and to mitochondria have been described before (31Menand B. Marechal-Drouard L. Sakamoto W. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11014-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, taking into account that only three proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria of apicomplexans (8Feagin J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 81-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it is also conceivable that the need for a formylated tRNAMet for translation initiation has been bypassed altogether. Thus, the question of which tRNA is used for mitochondrial translation initiation at present remains open. In summary, we present for the first time experimental evidence for mitochondrial tRNA import in apicomplexans and show that the specificity of the process is identical to the one in trypanosomatids. Apicomplexans and trypanosomatids are not closely related, which raises the question, whether the uncovered similarities of the two systems are due to a remote common ancestor or arose independently through convergent evolution. Answering this question will require a detailed knowledge of the tRNA import mechanisms in both organisms.

https://openalex.org/W1993035758,"The nuclear lamina, which provides a structural scaffolding for the nuclear envelope, consists largely of a polymer of the intermediate filament lamin proteins. Although different cell types contain distinctive relative amounts of the major lamin subtypes (A, C, B1, and B2), the functions of this variation are not understood. We have investigated the possibility that subtype variation affects lamina stability. We find that homotypic and heterotypic binding interactions of lamin B2 are substantially less resistant to chemical dissociation in vitro than those between the other lamin subtypes, whereas lamin A interactions are the most stable. Surprisingly, removal of the central four-fifths of the rod domain did not substantially weaken the interactions of lamins A and B2, suggesting that other regions also strongly contribute to their binding interactions. In contrast, this rod deletion strongly destabilizes the binding interactions of lamins B1 and C. Consistent with the binding studies, lamins are more readily solubilized by chemical extraction from cells enriched for lamin B2 than from cells enriched for lamin A. This suggests that the distinctive ensemble of heterotypic lamin interactions in a particular cell type affects the stability of the lamin polymer, and, correspondingly, could be relevant to tissue-specific properties of the lamina including its involvement in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2067517632,"Increased expression of adhesion molecules by the activated endothelium is a critical feature of vascular inflammation associated with several disease states such as atherosclerosis. However, mechanisms regulating the endothelial induction of adhesion molecules are not entirely clear. Herein we report that inhibition of the polyol pathway enzyme aldose reductase (AR) prevents the increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and decreases monocyte adhesion to these cells. In TNF-alpha-stimulated HUVECs, treatment with AR inhibitors sorbinil and tolrestat diminished NF-kappaB activity, phosphorylation and degradation of Ikappa-Balpha, and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of AR abrogated TNF-alpha-induced activation and membrane translocation of PKC, and antisense ablation of AR prevented both TNF-alpha-induced PKC and NF-kappaB activation. However, inhibition of AR did not prevent phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC or NF-kappaB, indicating that inhibition of AR does prevents events upstream of PKC activation. These results identify a novel regulator of endothelial activation and suggest that AR is an obligatory mediator of TNF-alpha signaling leading to an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and increased binding of monocytes to the endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2080174229,"The pathophysiology of sepsis involves excessive lymphocyte apoptosis, which correlates with adverse outcomes, and disordered cytokine production, which may promote host injury. As the protease inhibitor (PI) class of antiretroviral agents is known to prevent apoptosis in vitro, we evaluated their effect on survival, lymphocyte apoptosis, and consequent cytokine production in mice with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and perforation. Mice pretreated with PIs have improved survival (67%; P<0.0005) compared with controls (17%) and a significant (P<0.05) reduction in lymphocyte apoptosis. Even mice receiving therapy beginning 4 h after perforation demonstrated improved survival (50%; P<0.05) compared with controls. PI therapy is also associated with an increase in the Th1 cytokine TNF-alpha (P<0.05) early in sepsis and a reduction in the Th2 cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 (P<0.05) late in sepsis; despite no intrinsic antibacterial effects, PI also reduced quantitative bacterial blood cultures. The beneficial effects of PI appear to be specific to lymphocyte apoptosis, as lymphocyte-deficient Rag1-/- mice did not experience benefit from treatment with PI. Thus, inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis by PI is a candidate approach for the treatment of sepsis."

Apart from echolocation and the pursuit of prey by bats1, the function of ultrasound in animal communication is poorly understood2. This is mainly because of the broad range of responses that it can evoke and the widely varied contexts in which it is used (for example, in rodents of the Muridae family it may indicate distress in infants or a sexual or predatory encounter in adults)3. Here we find that a purely ultrasonic signal is produced in the wild by a rodent of the Sciuridae family, Richardson's ground squirrel, and show that its function is to warn conspecifics of impending danger. To our knowledge, ultrasonic alarm calls have not previously been detected in any animal group, despite their twin advantages of being highly directional and inaudible to key predators."

https://openalex.org/W1993813065,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases compose a family of serine/threonine kinases that function in many signal transduction pathways and affect various cellular phenotypes. Despite the abundance of available data, the exact role of each MAP kinase is not completely defined, in part because of the inability to activate MAP kinase molecules individually and specifically. Based on activating mutations found in the yeast MAP kinase p38/Hog1 (Bell, M., Capone, R., Pashtan, I., Levitzki, A., and Engelberg, D. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 276, 25351–25358), we designed and constructed single and multiple mutants of human MAP kinase p38α. Single (p38<sup>D176A</sup>, p38<sup>F327L</sup>, and p38<sup>F327S</sup>) and subsequent double (p38<sup>D176A/F327L</sup> and p38<sup>D176A/F327S</sup>) mutants acquired high intrinsic activity independent of any upstream regulation and reached levels of 10 and 25%, respectively, in reference to the dually phosphorylated wild type p38α. The active p38 mutants have retained high specificity toward p38 substrates and were inhibited by the specific p38 inhibitors SB-203580 and PD-169316. We also show that similar mutations can render p38γ active as well. Based on the available structures of p38 and ERK2, we have analyzed the p38 mutants and identified a hydrophobic core stabilized by three aromatic residues, Tyr-69, Phe-327, and Trp-337, in the vicinity of the L16 loop region. Upon activation, a segment of the L16 loop, including Phe-327, becomes disordered. Structural analysis suggests that the active p38 mutants emulate the conformational changes imposed naturally by dual phosphorylation, namely, destabilization of the hydrophobic core. Essentially, the hydrophobic core is an inherent stabilizer that maintains low basal activity level in unphosphorylated p38."

The secretion of granule contents (exocytosis) is an important cellular function shared by blood platelets, leukocytes, neurons, endocrine glands, and many other cell types. In platelets, the secretion of granules plays critical roles in amplifying platelet activation, recruitment of platelets into aggregates, and formation and stabilization of thrombi at the site of vascular injury (1Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of granule secretion have not been totally clear but are known to require molecules that are shared by different secretory cells.

There are many other similarities between different cell types in the secretion of granule contents. For example, platelet-dense granules uptake, store, and secret the neurotransmitter serotonin in a way similar to certain neuron cell presynaptic vesicles (1Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar). Secretion of granules is a regulated process in platelets and many other secretory cells and is known to involve common signaling mechanisms such as the elevation of intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation of SNARE proteins (1Reed G.L.

So called “weak agonists,” or low concentrations of agonists, induce activation of integrins and platelet aggregation and subsequently require integrin outside-in signaling to induce aggregation-dependent platelet secretion. However, “strong agonists” such as collagen can induce aggregation-independent granule secretion via pathways that do not require integrin outside-in signaling. TXA2 induces a unique two-wave platelet secretion: a small peak of aggregation-independent platelet secretion, which precedes the first wave of platelet aggregation, and a large peak of aggregation-dependent second wave platelet secretion, which induces the second wave of platelet aggregation (12Li Z.

Thus, TXA2 is a useful tool in differentiating signaling mechanisms associated with aggregation-dependent or -independent platelet secretion. cGMP is an important secondary messenger synthesized by guanylyl cyclases (13Haslam R.J.

Dickinson N.T. Jang E.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we have shown recently that the cGMP-PKG pathway in fact plays a biphasic role in platelet activation (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An early stimulatory role of cGMP is important in the adhesion receptor, the glycoprotein Ib-IX (GPIb-IX)-, dependent platelet activation (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A late inhibitory role of cGMP requires high concentrations of cGMP and is predominantly dependent upon cGMP-mediated activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in humans (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol.

However, the role of PKG in platelet activation remains apparently controversial because PKG knockout, although showing reduced GPIb-IX-dependent platelet activation, did not affect platelet aggregation induced by a relatively high concentration of collagen but is required for inhibition of collagen-induced platelet activation by a high concentration of a cGMP analog (22Massberg S. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Bauer M. Pfeifer A. Siess W. Fassler R. Ruth P. Krombach F. Hofmann F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Also, it is not clear whether PKG plays a role in platelet activation induced by GPIb-IX-independent, G-protein-coupled platelet agonists, which are critical in thrombus formation. More importantly, mechanisms of PKG involvement in platelet activation are not clear. In this study, we present a new finding that PKG is an important signaling mediator for aggregation-dependent secretion of platelet granules and that PKG-dependent secretion of dense granules is required in the second wave platelet aggregation induced by low doses of platelet agonists. These findings define a novel signaling mechanism that not only is important in understanding the roles of PKG in platelet activation but also has implications for understanding the common signaling mechanisms of degranulation and exocytosis. Materials—The TXA2 analog U46619, pertussis toxin (PTX), and PKG inhibitors Rp-isomer-8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-pCPT-cGMPS), Rp-isomer-N2-etheno-8-bromo-β-phenyl-1-guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS), and KT5823 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).

Platelet Aggregation and Secretion—Fresh blood from healthy volunteers was anticoagulated with 17 volume of ACD (85 mm trisodium citrate, 83 mm dextrose, and 21 mm citric acid). Platelets were washed with CGS buffer (0.12 m sodium chloride, 0.0129 m trisodium citrate, and 0.03 m d-glucose, pH 6.5), resuspended in modified Tyrode's solution at 3 × 108/ml, and allowed to incubate at 22 °C for 1–2 h as described previously (23Du X.P.

In experiments using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), 110 volume of 3.8% trisodium citrate was used as anticoagulant. Platelet aggregation was measured by detecting changes in light transmission. Platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of ATP using luciferin/luciferase reagent (Chrono-lume). Luciferin/luciferase reagent (12 μl) was added to 238 μl of washed platelet suspension within 1 min before stimulation. Platelet aggregation and secretion were recorded in real time in a Chrono-log lumiaggregometer at 37 °C with stirring (1000 rpm). To examine the effects of PKG inhibitors, PRP or washed platelets were preincubated with KT5823 (5 μm), Rp-pCPT-cGMPS (250 μm), or Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS (250 μm) for 5 min prior to the addition of the agonists. P-selectin Expression—Washed platelets from healthy human donors were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer and preincubated with or without Rp-pCPT-cGMPS or Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS for 5 min. The platelets were then incubated with different agonists at 37 °C for 5 min and fixed by adding paraformaldehyde (final concentration of 1%). The platelets were incubated with a monoclonal anti-human P-selectin antibody, SZ51 (24Wu G. Xi X. Li P. Chu X. Ruan C. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1990; 32: 231-235PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the platelets were further incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody. P-selectin expression was analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer. Determination of cAMP—Washed platelets from healthy human donors and wild type or PKG I knock-out mice (1 × 108/ml) were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer and preincubated with or without apyrase, Rp-pCPT-cGMPS, RGDS, or PTX at 37 °C for 5 min. Forskolin (10 μm) alone or forskolin and U46619 (1 μm) were then added to the platelets. After incubation for an additional 5 min in a platelet lumiaggregometer, the reactions were stopped by adding equal volumes of ice-cold 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were mixed and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and washed with 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether four times and then lyophilized. cAMP levels were measured using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). PKG I Knock-out Mice and Mouse Platelet Preparation—The generation of a PKG I-null (–) allele by homologous recombination has been described previously (25Wegener J.W. Nawrath H. Wolfsgruber W. Kuhbandner S. Werner C. Hofmann F. Feil R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Male and female mice (6–8 weeks) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. Whole blood from homozygous PKG I knock-out mice or wild type mice was collected from the inferior vena cava using 17 volume of ACD as anticoagulant as described previously (12Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For each experiment, blood was pooled from 5–6 mice of each genotype. The platelets were then washed twice with CGS, resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer at 3 × 108/ml, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h before use. Calcium Mobilization—Calcium mobilization was measured in Indo-1/AM-labeled cells. Briefly, washed platelets were resuspended in CGS at 1 × 109/ml and incubated with 5 μm Indo-1/AM at 37 °C for 45 min. After washing with CGS once more, platelets were resuspended to 2 × 108/ml in modified Tyrode's solution. Continuous fluorescent measurements of calcium-bound and free Indo-1/AM were made using a PTI (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) spectrofluorometer, detecting at 405 and 485 nm, respectively, with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. The intracellular Ca2+ level was expressed as relative fluorescence, calculated based on the ratio of Indo-1 fluorescence at 405 and 485 nm and standardized for Indo-1 loading and cell responsiveness. PKG Plays a Stimulatory Role in Platelet Aggregation Induced by Several G-protein-coupled Receptor Agonists—Platelets can be activated via several different types of signaling pathways. G-protein-coupled signaling pathways play a major role in platelet activation induced by soluble platelet agonists such as thrombin, TXA2, and ADP (6Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I.

Res. 1985; 39: 751-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We reported recently that PKG plays a stimulatory role in GPIb-IX-dependent integrin activation (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42226-42232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To investigate whether and how PKG plays roles in platelet activation via various pathways, we examined the platelet aggregation response of PKG I knock-out mouse or PKG inhibitor-treated human platelets to GPIb-IX-independent platelet agonists. These include U46619 (a stable thromboxane A2 analog) and ADP (Fig. 1). PKG I knockout (Fig. 1A) or PKG inhibitors Rp-pCPT-cGMPS, KT5823 (Fig. 1C), or Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS (see below) significantly reduced platelet aggregation induced by U46619 but had no significant effect on platelet aggregation induced by ADP (Fig. 1D). Thus, PKG plays an important role in promoting platelet aggregation induced via the G-protein-coupled TXA2 receptor that is independent of the GPIb-IX pathway. It is important to note that the aggregation responses of PKG I knock-out mouse platelets and PKG inhibitor-treated platelets are very similar, further confirming the specificity and effectiveness of the PKG inhibitors used in this study (19Li Z.

Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, PKG inhibitors are slightly more effective in reducing mouse platelet aggregation than PKG I knockout (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism in PKG I knock-out mice. Also, PKG inhibitors appear to be more effective in inhibiting platelet aggregation in humans than mice (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), suggesting possible differences between species. We have shown previously that PKG I knockout or PKG inhibitors inhibited low dose thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKG inhibitors affect GPIb-IX-independent thrombin receptor pathways, we also examined the effects of PKG inhibitors on thrombin receptor-activating peptides (TRAPs) for PAR1 and PAR4 (41Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar, 42Xu W.F. Andersen H. Whitmore T.E. Presnell S.R. Yee D.P. Ching A.

Rp-pCPT-cGMPS inhibited both PAR1 and PAR4 TRAP-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 2), indicating that PKG also promotes PAR-dependent platelet activation pathways. Interestingly, although PKG inhibitors almost totally inhibited GPIb-IX-dependent low dose thrombin-induced human platelet aggregation as we have shown previously (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), they only partially inhibited human platelet aggregation induced by PAR1 or PAR4 TRAPs (Fig. 2), suggesting that PKG plays distinct roles in GPIb-IX-dependent platelet response and PAR-induced platelet responses.Fig. 2Effects of PKG knockout and PKG inhibitors on platelet secretion and aggregation induced by G-protein-coupled agonists.A, washed wild type (WT) or PKG I knock-out (KO) mouse platelets were stimulated with U46619 and simultaneously recorded for secretion of ATP and aggregation in a lumiaggregometer. B, C, and D, washed human platelets were preincubated with buffer (Control) or PKG inhibitors Rp-pCPT-cGMPS (250 μm) and Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS (250 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min. Platelets were then stimulated with U46619 (B), PAR1 TRAP SFLLRN (C), or PAR4 TRAP AYPGKF (D). Secretion and aggregation were concomitantly recorded. In all of the above experiments, luciferin/luciferase reagent was added to the platelets 1 min prior to adding agonists.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PKG Mediates Secretion of Dense Granules—The partial inhibitory effects of PKG inhibitors on U46619 and TRAP-induced platelet aggregation resemble the pattern of platelet aggregation in the absence of aggregation-dependent platelet secretion. Thus, we further investigated the roles of PKG in platelet dense granule secretion using real time luciferin-luciferase assay. As we have shown recently (12Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), U46619 sequentially induced the first wave of dense granule secretion, the first wave of platelet aggregation, and then the second wave of aggregation-dependent secretion followed by the second wave of platelet aggregation (Fig. 2). The second wave of dense granule secretion and the subsequent second wave of platelet aggregation were abolished in PKG I knock-out mouse platelets (Fig. 2A) and in PKG inhibitor-treated human platelets (Fig. 2B). Thrombin or TRAPs induce both aggregation-dependent and aggregation-independent secretion (not shown). At low concentrations, the aggregation-dependent secretion is predominant. Low dose TRAP1- or TRAP4-induced platelet secretion was also significantly inhibited by PKG inhibitors (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, PKG plays an important role in mediating a common aggregation-dependent secretion pathway induced by several G-protein-coupled receptors. The Roles of PKG in Collagen-induced Platelet Secretion of Dense Granules—Collagen can induce significant platelet secretion in an aggregation-independent manner, and platelet aggregation induced by a relatively high dose of collagen is not significantly affected by knockout of PKG I (22Massberg S. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Bauer M. Pfeifer A. Siess W. Fassler R. Ruth P. Krombach F. Hofmann F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, these findings do not exclude the possibility that aggregation-dependent secretion can still occur. Indeed, platelet secretion induced by a low dose collagen (0.5 μg/ml) is mostly aggregation-dependent because the integrin inhibitor RGDS almost completely inhibited ATP secretion induced by collagen at this low concentration (Fig. 3A). Thus, to investigate whether the role of PKG is common in aggregation-dependent platelet secretion induced by agonists other than the G-protein-coupled receptors, we examined the effect of PKG inhibitors on collagen-induced platelet secretion of dense granules. Both Rp-pCPT-cGMPS and Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS inhibited platelet secretion and aggregation induced by 0.5 μg/ml collagen in a manner similar to RGDS, suggesting that PKG is important for platelet secretion and aggregation induced by this low concentration of collagen. Consist with previous reports, platelet aggregation induced by a higher concentration of collagen (5 μg/ml) was not significantly affected by PKG inhibitors. However, platelet secretion in PKG inhibitor-treated platelets was partially but significantly reduced even at the higher collagen concentration (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that PKG is important in platelet secretion induced by collagen. Inhibition of ADP Secretion Is Responsible for Decreased Platelet Aggregation in PKG Inhibitor-treated Platelets—A major substance secreted from dense granules is ADP, which induces integrin activation and thus promotes platelet aggregation. As shown in Fig. 1, ADP-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly affected by PKG I knockout or PKG inhibitors, suggesting that ADP-induced integrin activation and platelet aggregation do not require PKG signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibitory effects of PKG I knockout or PKG inhibitors on TXA2- or TRAP-induced platelet aggregation result from inhibition of ADP secretion. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined whether restoration of low concentrations of ADP can reverse the inhibitory effects of PKG inhibitors during U46619-induced platelet aggregation. Fig. 4 shows that PKG inhibitors diminished secretion and second wave platelet aggregation. Addition of a low concentration of ADP (0.5 μm), although insufficient by itself to induce platelet aggregation (not shown), restored the second wave of aggregation induced by U46619 in PKG inhibitor-treated platelets. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of PKG inhibitors on the second wave of platelet aggregation mainly result from inhibition of secretion of ADP from dense granules. PKG-dependent Secretion of ADP Promotes Platelet Aggregation via the Gi Signaling Pathway—The above data show that a major role for PKG in platelet aggregation is to mediate signal transduction leading to secretion of dense granule ADP. ADP binds to two different receptors on platelets, the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor and the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor. Gq is also the major G-protein mediating signaling of receptors for TXA2 and TRAPs. The role of ADP in potentiating platelet aggregation induced by TXA2 or low dose TRAP only requires the Gi-coupled P2Y12 pathway because it is inhibited by P2Y12 antagonists but not P2Y1 antagonists (12Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reason that low concentrations of G-protein-coupled agonists other than ADP may require secreted ADP to enhance the Gi signaling pathway and thus allow full scale platelet aggregation and that PKG inhibition reduces secretion of ADP and thus inhibits the ADP-dependent Gi-coupled pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of PKG inhibitors or PKG I knockout on TXA2-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase function. To increase the sensitivity of the assay, we used forskolin (a standard reagent for elevating cAMP levels) to elevate cAMP and examined the effects of agonists and PKG inhibitors. Fig. 5 shows that U46619 caused inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 5, A and B), which was completely reversed by PTX (Fig. 5A), an inhibitor of the Gi pathway, indicating a requirement for Gi signaling. Addition of an ADP scavenger, apyrase, also reversed U46619-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 5B), suggesting that U46619-induced activation of the Gi pathway is dependent on secreted ADP. U46619-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was completely reversed by the PKG inhibitor Rp-pCPT-cGMPS (Fig. 5B) and in PKG I knock-out platelets (Fig. 5C). In contrast, ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was not affected by PKG knockout. These data indicate that PKG mediates signals leading to ADP secretion that plays important roles in activating the Gi pathway and in inducing second wave platelet aggregation. The Role of PKG in Platelet Secretion of α-Granules—The above results indicate that PKG plays an important role in aggregation-dependent secretion of platelet dense granules. To determine whether PKG also plays a role in platelet secretion of α-granules, we examined the effect of PKG inhibitors on surface expression of P-selectin induced by platelet agonists. Expression of P-selectin was examined by flow cytometry using the monoclonal anti-human P-selectin antibody SZ51. Fig. 6 shows that both Rp-pCPT-cGMPS and Rp-Br-PET-cGMPS significantly inhibited P-selectin expression induced by U46619. P-selectin expression induced by TRAPs was also partially but significantly inhibited by PKG inhibitors, although to a lesser degree. Thus, PKG also plays an important role in platelet secretion from α-granules. Effects of PKG Inhibitors and PKG Knockout on Calcium Mobilization—A common signaling event upstream from secretion is the elevation of intracellular calcium levels. To investigate the relationship between PKG and calcium elevation, we examined the effects of PKG inhibitors and PKG deficiency on U46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization. As shown in Fig. 7A, U46619-induced calcium mobilization in PKG I knock-out mouse platelets was identical to that of wild type platelets. Similarly, U46619-induced calcium mobilization was not affected by the PKG inhibitor Rp-pCPT-cGMPS in human platelets (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that PKG is not required for agonist-induced calcium mobilization. Thus, PKG is likely to be involved in signaling events either downstream from or parallel to calcium mobilization in platelet secretion signaling. In this study, we show that PKG plays an important role in mediating aggregation-dependent platelet secretion of dense granules and α-granules. We also show that by inducing secretion of ADP, PKG plays a general stimulatory role in promoting platelet activation and stabilizing platelet aggregation. These findings suggest a novel signaling mechanism mediating platelet granule secretion and provide a new mechanism for the stimulatory roles of the cGMP-PKG pathway in platelet activation. Because regulated secretion is important not only in platelet function but also in leukocytes, neurons, and other cell types, identification of a novel PKG-dependent signaling pathway that stimulates exocytosis is of general significance to the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of degranulation, exocytosis, and vesicle trafficking. Although it has been believed for the past 30 years that the cGMP-PKG pathway inhibits platelet activation, we have shown recently that cGMP promotes GPIb-IX-dependent integrin activation and platelet aggregation. GPIb-IX is a unique receptor that, unlike thromboxane A2 or collagen receptors, does not appear to require secretion of granules to induce activation of integrin. GPIb-IX-mediated integrin activation can be reconstituted in the cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells that do not have platelet-specific granules (19Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although it is significantly amplified by ADP secretion like other weak platelet agonists (11De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, integrin activation induced by TXA2, thrombin, and collagen has not been reconstituted in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, our finding that PKG is important in mediating platelet secretion induced by GPIb-IX-independent agonists indicates a novel role for PKG in platelet activation and suggests that PKG is important not only in GPIb-IX-dependent platelet activation but also in promoting platelet activation induced by various platelet activation pathways. It is interesting to note that the stimulatory effects of PKG occur in the absence of exogenous cGMP, suggesting that the levels of cGMP produced by agonist-stimulated endogenous guanylyl cyclases (at nanomolar range) are sufficient to mediate granule secretion. In contrast, high concentrations of cGMP analogs (100–3000 μm) are required to show inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation and secretion (22Massberg S. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Bauer M. Pfeifer A. Siess W. Fassler R. Ruth P. Krombach F. Hofmann F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 45Mellion B.T. Ignarro L.J. Ohlstein E.H. Pontecorvo E.G. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J. Blood. 1981; 57: 946-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data provide further evidence for biphasic roles of cGMP in platelet activation; that is, cGMP promotes platelet activation at low concentrations but becomes inhibitory at high concentrations. More importantly, we have identified a novel PKG-dependent signaling pathway leading to platelet secretion and a mechanism by which PKG promotes platelet activation. Despite the important roles of secretion in platelet function, signaling pathways regulating platelet granule secretion are poorly defined (1Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests several possible mechanisms that may be important in the regulation of secretion. 1) Elevation of intracellular calcium and activation of the cytoskeletal contractile apparatus may be important in inducing and facilitating granule secretion. 2) Phosphorylation of SNARE proteins and the roles of protein kinase C (PKC) and small G-protein Rab have been hypothesized in regulating SNARE complex formation and membrane fusion required for secretion. However, signaling pathways regulating these events or molecules remain obscure. Also, there have been various platelet functional disorders with characteristics of unidentified secretion defects, suggesting the existence of unidentified secretion signaling molecules and mechanisms (46Rao A.K. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of the PKG-dependent secretion pathway in this study provides a novel signaling mechanism regulating the platelet secretion process. How PKG is activated is currently under our investigation. It is known that platelets express nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (13Haslam R.J. Dickinson N.T. Jang E.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Feil R. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H. Walter U. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 47Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5193-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). These enzymes play an important role in cGMP elevation. It has also been reported that PKG can be activated by protein kinase C-mediated PKG phosphorylation (48Hou Y. Lascola J. Dulin N.O. Ye R.D. Browning D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16706-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that both protein kinase C and NOS3 are activated by the elevation of intracellular calcium, which is also required for platelet secretion. In addition, aggregation-dependent platelet secretion requires integrin outside-in signals. Integrin outside-in signaling causes dramatic elevation of intracellular calcium levels (49Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is tempting to hypothesize that integrin-dependent elevation of calcium may activate endogenous platelet nitric oxide synthesis, subsequently elevating the cGMP level and activating PKG. However, cGMP elevation in platelets stimulated by TXA2 is not dependent upon integrin outside-in signals because RGDS peptides that inhibit integrin-ligand interaction do not significantly inhibit the cGMP elevation induced by this agonist (not shown). Also, most platelet agonists can directly cause calcium elevation (although at lower levels) without requiring integrin outside-in signaling. Therefore, it appears that agonists induce activation of the PKG pathway by an integrin-independent mechanism. The PKG signaling pathway then converges with the integrin outside-in signaling to induce aggregation-dependent secretion. In this respect, it is interesting to note that endothelial nitric oxide synthase can be activated in endothelial cells by Akt (50Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We and others have shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt play important roles in platelet secretion and second wave platelet aggregation (12Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B.

Thus, it will be interesting to investigate further whether activation of cGMP/PKG is down-stream from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway during platelet activation. Because granule secretion in platelets shares similarity to secretion (exocytosis) and degranulation in other cell types, it is possible that the PKG-dependent secretion pathway is not only important in platelets but also shared in other secretory cells. Our finding that PKG is important in aggregation-dependent secretion explains why there have been apparent agonist-specific differences in the effects of PKG inhibition on platelets. PKG knockout or inhibitors have no significant effect on platelet aggregation induced by high concentrations of collagen (Fig. 3) or thrombin (data not shown). These are so called strong agonists that can induce platelet secretion via the aggregation-independent secretion pathway. Although PKG-mediated aggregation-dependent secretion may also occur in platelet responses to these agonists (Fig. 3), levels of aggregation-independent secretion are already sufficient to mediate full scale platelet aggregation. Thus, PKG deficiency would have no significant effect on platelet aggregation induced by these agonists. On the other hand, PKG knockout or inhibitors significantly inhibited the second wave of platelet aggregation induced by low concentrations of TXA2, thrombin, TRAPs, and collagen, which requires aggregation-dependent platelet secretion of ADP (Fig. 4). Abolishing the aggregation-dependent platelet secretion of granules by PKG inhibitors or PKG deficiency thus inhibits the second wave of platelet aggregation induced by low concentrations of these agonists. Also, because ADP can induce platelet aggregation without requiring secretion, our data explain why PKG inhibitors and PKG I knockout have no significant effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Therefore, we have not only identified a novel secretion signaling pathway but also provided significant new insights into the complex interaction between secretion and aggregation and between different platelet activation pathways. We thank Drs. Franz Hofmann and Robert Feil for providing PKG I knock-out mice and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2158625674,"Tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in cell stress response and determines cell fate of either growth arrest or apoptosis. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) expressed under stress usually confer survival protection to the cell or interruption in the apoptotic pathways. Although Hsp90 can physically interact with p53, whether or not the hsp90 gene is influenced downstream of p53 in UV irradiation-induced apoptosis remains unclear. We have found that the level of p53 is elevated with the decline of Hsp90 in UV-irradiated cells and that malfunction of Hsp90, as inhibited by geldanamycin, enhances the p53-involved UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. In addition, the expression of the hsp90β gene was reduced in both UV-irradiated and wild type p53-transfected cells. These results suggest a negative correlation between the trans factor p53 and a chaperone gene hsp90β in apoptotic cells. Mutation analysis demonstrated that the p53 binding site in the first exon was indispensable for p53 regulation on the hsp90β gene. In addition, with p53 bound at the promoter of the hsp90β gene, mSin3a and p300 were differentially recruited in UV irradiation-treated or untreated Jurkat cells in vivo. The evidence of p53-repressed hsp90β gene expression in UV-irradiated cells shed light on a novel pathway of Hsp90 in the survival control of the stressed cells.

Some of the Hsps are constitutively expressed, whereas others are rapidly induced in response to cellular stress. Hsps can protect the cells from potentially fatal consequences of adverse environmental, physical, or chemical stresses to the cells. The protecting role is attainable by the chaperone functions of Hsps in prohibiting protein aggregation and promoting refolding of the denatured proteins in the stressed cells (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Among the Hsps, the Hsp90 family is ubiquitously expressed and is one of most abundant cytoplasm proteins. It not only participates in the protection of cell survival but also functions as a specific molecular chaperone in cell growth and differentiation (2Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E.

Despite the fact that Hsp90 is constitutively abundant in mammalian cells, the protein can be further induced by heat shock and to a lesser extent by mitogen in human T lymphocytes (5Shen Y.F. J. Cell. Physiol. Suppl. 1986; 4: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Induced expression of Hsp90 in a stressed cell may strengthen cellular resistance to stress-induced apoptotic pathways (6Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C.

However, its importance is frequently underestimated in that the p53 gene is frequently mutated in more than 50% of all human tumors. p53 acts as a nuclear transcription factor that is latent in normal cells but becomes activated by a variety of cellular stresses, DNA damage, hypoxia, etc. (10Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). It can transactivate a series of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, typically the p21WAF1 gene (11Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J.

It is thus clear that p53-dependent apoptosis is based on both the activation of proapoptotic genes and the repression of antiapoptotic genes (16Ho J. Benchimol S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Based on the facts that GA could disrupt the antiapoptotic activity and the stability of survivin (6Fortugno P.

In addition, as Hsp90 can physically interact with either the mutant (17Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T. Mizukami T. Taya Y. Fujiwara T. Kato H. Saya H. Nakao M.

These and other findings prompted us toward intensive work on the relationship between p53 and the hsp90 gene in UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. In this paper, we provided the first evidence that wild type p53 bound to its binding site within the hsp90β gene was a prerequisite for the trans repression of p53 on the hsp90β gene in UV irradiation-induced apoptotic Jurkat cells. It also revealed a novel means of counteractions between wild type p53 and Hsp90, the repression of hsp90β gene expression to eliminate its functions in the apoptotic cells.

A DNA fragment spanning –1039 to +1531 of the hsp90β gene was fused to the upstream region of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in pBLCAT3 to form reporter plasmid hsp90β-CAT, and a plasmid pM-CAT was constructed for transfection efficiency control in which the 698–1003-bp segment of the CAT gene was deleted to express a mutant CAT (21Shen Y.

In this paper, Jurkat cells were UV-irradiated at 20 J/m2 with a UV cross-linker (Bio-Rad, GS Gene Linker™, UV Chamber) and then harvested at different time points postirradiation for studying the induction of apoptosis and related gene expression. Jurkat cells were also treated with GA, a specific inhibitor for Hsp90 function, at a final concentration of 5 μm for 16 h (2Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

DNA Transfection and Promoter Activity Assay—Electroporation was used for transit transfection of DNA into Jurkat cells in this study (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). DNA extractions of reporter plasmid (hsp90β-CAT) and transfection control plasmid (pM-CAT) were mixed at the appropriate molar ratio for transfection into Jurkat cells to normalize promoter activity of the gene (22Mo Z.C.

To study p53 effects, constructs pC53-SN3 or pC53-SCx3 were co-transfected with hsp90β-CAT and pM-CAT into Jurkat cells. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were separated into two groups and incubated at either 42 or 37 °C for 1 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted and used for detecting promoter activity of the hsp90β gene in a competitive RT-PCR-based system as described previously (22Mo Z.C. Li X.Y. Li H.F. Cheng X.K. Xiao L.

A pair of primers mapped to 554/573 (5′) and 1141/1122 (3′) in the CAT gene was used to amplify a 588-bp fragment for hsp90β-CAT and a 286-bp fragment from pM-CAT that can be separated in a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence intensity of each band stained with ethidium bromide was analyzed with Ultroscan XL (Pharmacia) or AlphaImager 2200™ (Alpha Innotech Corporation). The ratio of the fluorescence intensity of two bands in each sample (hsp90β-CAT to pM-CAT) was defined as the relative promoter activity of the hsp90β gene. Preparation of Nuclear Extract (NE) and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar)—2 × 107 Jurkat cells were harvested and suspended in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed with 500 μl of buffer B (the same as buffer A but without Nonidet P-40) and then suspended in 300 μl of buffer C (500 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% glycerin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). After standing on ice for 10 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. Supernatants thus recovered were stored at –70 °C in aliquots until use. The concentration of protein in the extracts was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For EMSA, a DNA fragment of the hsp90β gene (+8/+109) containing a p53 binding site (BS) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Fu Rui Biotechnology, Beijing, China) in a filling-in reaction was used as probe “W.” In each experiment, 12 μg of individual NE was reacted with 2 × 104 counts/min of W in the presence of 5 × 103-fold excess of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The binding reaction was carried out in DNA binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 40 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 8% Ficoll-400) at 22 °C for 30 min. For competitive analysis, unlabelled DNA fragment was added to the reaction system in molar excess of W as indicated. DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 19:1) in Tris borate/EDTA buffer, pH 8.3. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed. In supershift assay, 2 μl of anti-p53 antibody (either monoclonal antibody (DO-1) or polyclonal antibody (polyclonal BMG-1B1)) was first added to the binding system and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Western Blot Assay—Western blot assay were performed as described elsewhere (28Xiao L. Lang W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 400-408PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhang Y. Zhai Q. Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Biol.

Aliquots of whole cell lysate were separated on SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters in a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer and then incubated overnight at 4 °C using antibodies against acetylated p53, p53, PARP, or Hsp90β as required, or one by one after stripping. Quantification of Cellular mRNA of hsp90β—RT-PCR-based mRNA quantification for hsp90β in Jurkat cells was carried out as described previously (23Wu J.M. Xiao L. Cheng X.K. Cui L.X. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F.

Briefly, an internal control RNA (icRNA) was first transcribed in vitro from pHSYL3 plasmid, which contains the same 5′- and 3′-fragments that existed in the hsp90β gene. An equal amount of icRNA was then mixed with each aliquot of cellular RNA, reverse transcribed, and amplified in the competitive RT-PCR system. The size of amplified fragments for hsp90β mRNA and icRNA was 337 and 625 bp, respectively. RT-PCR products of hsp90β mRNA and icRNA were separated on 1.5% agarose gel; the bands showed up with ethidium bromide and then were photographed and scanned with Ultroscan XL or AlphaImager 2000™. The ratio of the darkness of bands in each individual lane (mRNA/icRNA) was defined as the relative expression level of hsp90β mRNA. Point Mutations of the p53 BS in the Promoter of the hsp90β Gene— Site-directed mutagenesis was performed mainly according to the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (2nd version, Clontech). The fragment of hsp90β gene (–1039/+740) containing an atypical p53 BS (5′-GGGacTGTCTGGGTATCGGAAAGCAAGCCT-3′) (+31/+60) was inserted into pBS-SK. The core sequence CAAG (+54/+57) of the second half-site was mutated to GAGG utilizing a mutagenic primer (5′-GGGTATCGGAAAGGAGGCCTACGTTGCTCAA-3′) and a selective primer (5′-GCTCATCATTGGATATCGTTCTTCGGG-3′). The mutated sequences had been confirmed by DNA sequencing. For EMSA, the DNA fragment (+8/+109) containing mutated p53 BS was labeled with 32P designated as “M” probe. Detection of Apoptosis by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—Cells were immediately cultured at 37 °C after UV irradiation (20 J/m2) and harvested at the indicated times, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and fixing in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight, sequentially. Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline two times, cells were stained by propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) containing 100 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min, and apoptosis was detected by FACS using Coulter® Epics XL™. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques were adopted as described previously (31Orlando V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 32Kuo M.H. Allis C.D.

Briefly, 30 ml of Jurkat cells (106 cells/ml) were aliquoted to each flask with or without 20 J/m2 UV irradiation. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, terminated with 0.125 m glycine, washed, resuspended in 5 ml of swelling buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin), chilled on ice for 10 min, and homogenized 15 times at 4 °C. Nuclei were then pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) to sonicate 20 s for 9–12 times in a Sonic Dismembrator 550 (Fisher). Chromatin fragments were then collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, aliquoted into 200 μl/tube, and stored at –70 °C until use. For immunoprecipitation (IP), 200 μl of chromatin diluted in sonication buffer to 1 ml was first mixed with 4 μl of specific antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 25 μl of pretreated protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. Following centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 20 s, the agarose beads were washed twice with each sonication buffer, washing buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and washing buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) successively. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from beads with 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS) twice, and the effluents were combined. Reverse-cross-linking was carried out at 65 °C for 4.5 h in the presence of EDTA and RNase A. DNA fragments recovered were further treated with proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen and sodium acetate sequentially and were resuspended in 100 μl of distilled water. 10 μl of each DNA sample thus obtained was used in PCR analysis. For negative control, 200 μl of chromatin was treated the same as that of IP except preimmune serum was used instead of specific antibody. Primers used for PCR of the hsp90β gene containing the p53 BS (from –46/–27 to 257/238) were 5′-GCTGTACTGTGCTTCGCCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCTCACCCACCACTACCCT-3′ (reverse). Primers used for PCR of the p21 gene containing 5′-p53 BS as a positive control (from –2280/–2260 to –2206/–2186) were 5′-GTGGCTGGATTGGCTTTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGAAAACAGGCAGCCCAAG-3′ (reverse).

Geldanamycin-enhanced UV Irradiation-induced Apoptosis in Jurkat Cells—UV irradiation was known to be genome-toxic to mammalian cells that induce DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. Jurkat cells exposed to UV irradiation (20 J/m2) were adopted as the model system here. In addition, GA, a specific functional inhibitor of Hsp90 (2Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E.

It was known that Hsp90 was capable of conferring survival signal to the stressed cells via interrupting the caspase activation pathway (34Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L.

Consequently, besides the FACS assay, proteolysis of PARP, one of the earliest irreversible events in apoptosis (36Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares H. Smulson M.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 137-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was also shown. When the cells were exposed to UV irradiation, 34% underwent apoptosis at 9 h of recovery (Fig. 1A, top), comparable with the results of others (37Peters D.M. Griffin J.B. Stanley J.S. Beck M.M. Zempleni J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C878-C884Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of PARP also increased in UV-irradiated cells (Fig. 1B, top), as shown by the ratio of the densities of the lower band to the upper band in each lane. In Jurkat cells treated with GA alone, the percentage of apoptotic cells in FACS (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 1B, lane 1) are slightly higher than that of the untreated control. In cells pretreated with GA, followed by UV irradiation, the percentage of apoptotic cells in an FACS assay (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–6) and the proteolysis of PARP (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–6) were substantially enhanced. Proteolyses of PARP in GA-treated cells (Fig. 1C, filled bars) were dominating 3-fold over those of the control counterparts (open bars) at 6–9 h after UV treatment. The results suggest that Hsp90 is involved in protecting Jurkat cells from UV-irradiated apoptosis. Reduced Expression of hsp90β Gene in UV-irradiated Jurkat Cells—The expression of hsp90β was reduced gradually at both mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein levels in UV-irradiated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). Both the increased p53 expression level and its acetylation (Fig. 2B, second and third rows) indicated that p53 was activated in UV-irradiated Jurkat cells. The data suggested that the reduced expression of the hsp90β gene in UV-irradiated cells was correlated to p53. Ectopic Wild Type p53 Represses hsp90β Gene Expression in Jurkat Cells—To elucidate the mechanism of tumor suppressor p53 on hsp90β gene expression, Jurkat cells were transfected with wild type p53 expression plasmid (pC53-SN3). With a substantial increase of p53 after transfection, Hsp90β expression in Western blotting is gradually decreased in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A, first and second rows). In addition, a gradual increase of the proteolysis of PARP indicates the occurrence of apoptosis in the cells (Fig. 3A, third row). Co-transfection of wild type p53 (pC53-SN3) with hsp90β reporter plasmid (hsp90β-CAT) into Jurkat cells significantly repressed hsp90β reporter gene expression to ∼40% of the control in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, open bars). The cells transfected with mutant p53V143A (pC53-SCx3) did not show any repression; on the contrary, slightly enhanced expression of the hsp90β gene was found at lower dosages of the mutant construct (Fig. 3B, filled bars). A Wild Type p53 BS Is a Prerequisite for Ectopic p53 and UV-irradiated Effects on the hsp90β Gene—We have shown previously that the first intron of the hsp90β gene is essential in maintaining efficient constitutive expression and is critical for heat shock induction of the hsp90β gene (21Shen Y. Liu J. Wang X. Cheng X. Wang Y. Wu N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Comparing the CAT reporter activity of the –1039/+1531 “full-length” construct (hsp90β-CAT) with that driven by other mutant constructs of the hsp90β gene, we found that the non-translated first exon was required to yield higher expression efficiency in the CAT reporter assay (data not shown). The sequence matches the p53 consensus half-site of PuPuPuCA/TA/TGPy-PyPy except for the fourth and fifth nucleotides in the 5′-half-site (39el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). It was thus identified within the first exon of the hsp90β gene and designated as p53 BS (Fig. 4A). To elucidate the importance of p53 BS in the promoter region of the hsp90β gene, the core sequence CAAG (+54/+57) of the 3′-half-site for p53 binding in hsp90β-CAT was mutated to GAGG, designated as m-hsp90β-CAT. Transfection of wild type p53 was carried out as described above. It was found that ectopic wild type p53 conferred a dose-dependent reduction to the hsp90β-CAT reporter activity of some 50% (Fig. 4B, open bars), whereas no obvious effect was found with m-hsp90β-CAT (Fig. 4B, filled bars). Similar to the effect of ectopic p53, hsp90β-CAT, without mutation in the p53 BS (Fig. 4C, filled bars), was reduced to a comparable level of 50% upon UV irradiation (Fig. 4C, open bars). These results indicated that the p53 BS in the first exon of the hsp90β gene took part in a more efficient constitutive expression of the hsp90β gene and was indispensable in the response of the gene toward UV irradiation and ectopic p53 in Jurkat cells.

We explored the signaling pathways involved in this response. Incubation of human umbilical vein ECs with VEGF induced a 3-fold increase in DAF expression. Inhibition by flk-1 kinase inhibitor SU1498 and failure of placental growth factor (PlGF) to up-regulate DAF confirmed the role of VEGF-R2. The response was also blocked by pretreatment with phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) inhibitor U71322 and protein kinase C (PKC) antagonist GF109203X. In contrast, no effect was seen with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA). Use of PKC agonists and isozyme-specific pseudosubstrate peptide antagonists suggested a role for PKCα and -ϵ in VEGF-mediated DAF up-regulation. This was confirmed by transfection of ECs with PKCα and -ϵ dominant-negative constructs, which in combination completely abrogated induction of DAF by VEGF. In contrast, LY290042, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly augmented DAF expression, suggesting a negative regulatory role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase. The widely used immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibited DAF induction by VEGF in a dose-dependent manner. The VEGF-induced DAF expression was functionally effective, significantly reducing complement-mediated EC lysis, and this cytoprotective effect was reversed by CsA. These data provide evidence for a VEGF-R2-, phospholipase C-γ-, and PKCα/ϵ-mediated cytoprotective pathway in ECs. This may represent an important mechanism for the maintenance of vascular integrity during chronic inflammation involving complement activation.

In addition, VEGF may act as a proinflammatory cytokine regulating cellular adhesion, molecule expression, and T lymphocyte trafficking (2Kim I. Moon S.-O. Hoon Kim S. Jin Kim H. Soon Koh Y.

The maintenance of quiescent vascular endothelium is dependent upon a variety of survival signals, many of which are regulated by VEGF (7Zachary I. Biochem. Soc.

This was initially revealed by the demonstration that withdrawal of local VEGF synthesis results in retinal blood vessel regression (8Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Peer J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat.

The actions of VEGF on vascular ECs are mediated via tyrosine-kinase signaling receptors VEGF-R1 (flt-1) and VEGF-R2 (flk-2/KDR), which are capable of interacting with a variety of downstream signaling pathways (1Ferrara N.

Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, singly or in combination, may subsequently participate and add functional diversity.

In addition, PI3K activity has been implicated in VEGF-induced up-regulation of eNOS and generation of NO, which may in turn exert antiapoptotic effects by inhibiting the cysteine protease activities of caspases (30Dimmeler S.

Evidence is now emerging that endothelial injury, leading to widespread persistent global EC dysfunction, is common in systemic inflammatory diseases and predisposes a patient to premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality. Endothelial injury has also been linked to the obliterative vasculopathy and accelerated atherosclerosis seen following organ transplantation (32Hruban R.H. Beschorner W.E. Baumgartner W.A. Augustine S.M. Ren H. Reitz B.A. Hutchins G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 871-882PubMed Google Scholar). Complement activation has an established role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and accelerated arteriosclerosis following cardiac transplantation (33Torzewski J.

Baldwin III, W.M. Transplantation. 2001; 72: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Innate mechanisms for the control of complement activation on the cell surface include the membrane-bound regulatory proteins DAF (CD55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), and CD59 (35Liszewski M.K.

DAF can be induced on the EC surface by treatment with C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines, thrombin, VEGF, and basic fibroblast growth factor via distinct signaling pathways (16Mason J.C.

DAF is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that acts to prevent the formation and accelerate the decay of C3 and C5 convertases (40Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Annu. Rev.

The demonstration that VEGF is fundamental to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis highlights the importance of precisely defining the mechanisms underlying these functions. Herein we describe in detail the VEGF-R2- and PKC-dependent signaling pathway by which VEGF induces DAF expression on the EC surface, so enhancing cytoprotection against complement-mediated injury. We demonstrate dependence upon activation of PKCα and PKCϵ, PI3K-mediated constraint, and inhibition of VEGF-mediated cytoprotection against complement by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Monoclonal Antibodies and Other Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies 1H4 (anti-DAF) and RMAC8 (antiendoglin) were kind gifts from Dr. D. Lublin (St. Louis, MO) and Dr. A. d'Apice (Victoria, Australia), respectively. DETA NONOate was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), and CsA, thymeleatoxin, ingenol dibenzoate, Gö6976, GF109203X, and SU1498 were from Merck Biosciences Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). The PKCβ inhibitor LY379196 was a kind gift from Dr. K. Ways (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN). NG-Monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), U-73122, and LY294002 were from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Myristoylated (myr) PKC peptide inhibitors (myr-ψPKC) (myr-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val) and PKCϵ V1–2 (myr-Glu-Ala-Val-Ser-Leu-Lys-Pro-Thr) were from Promega (Southampton, UK) and BIOMOL, respectively. myr-PKCθ (myr-Leu-His-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Lys-Gln-Ala-Lys-Val-His-His-Val-Lys-Cys) and myr-PKCζ (myr-Ser-Ile-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Arg-Arg-Trp-Arg-Lys-Leu) were from Merck Biosciences. Recombinant human VEGF 165 was purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, UK). Placental growth factor (PlGF) was purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Other products were from Sigma. Cell Isolation and Culture—Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC), isolated from umbilical cords as described previously (36Mason J.C. Yarwood H. Sugars K. Morgan B.P. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in 1% gelatin-coated tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in medium 199 (M199) (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm L-glutamine (all from Invitrogen), 10 units/ml heparin (Leo Laboratories, Prince Risborough, UK), and 30 μg/ml EC growth factor (Sigma). Adenoviral Infection—Generation of adenovirus expression vectors for dominant-negative (DN) PKC isozymes has been described previously (43Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DN-PKCα, DN-PKCϵ, and β-galactosidase adenoviruses were amplified in HEK-293A cells and purified using the BD Adeno-X™ purification kit (BD Biosciences). Viral titers were estimated by using the BD Adeno-X™ rapid titer kit. HUVEC were infected by incubation with the relevant adenovirus in serum-free M199 for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was then changed to M199, 10% fetal bovine serum, and HUVEC were incubated overnight prior to addition of VEGF or carrier control for up to 48 h. Infection of HUVEC with a β-galactosidase control adenovirus demonstrated a transfection efficiency of 95%. Optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) for the adenoviruses was determined by Western blotting. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (36Mason J.C. Yarwood H. Sugars K. Morgan B.P. Davies K.A. Haskard D.O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacological antagonists were added 60 min prior to the addition of VEGF. In some experiments the results are expressed as the relative fluorescent intensity (RFI), representing mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) with test mAb divided by the MFI using an isotype-matched irrelevant mAb. Cell viability was assessed by examination of EC monolayers using phase contrast microscopy, cell counting, and estimation of trypan blue exclusion. In all experiments EC monolayers were treated with the appropriate vehicle controls. Complement-mediated Cell Lysis—To estimate complement-mediated cell lysis, ECs in M199, 10% fetal calf serum were pretreated with VEGF, VEGF and CsA, or carrier controls for 48 h, then harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed, opsonized with antiendoglin mAb RMAC8, and incubated with 5–20% rabbit serum (Serotec, Oxford, UK) in Veronal-buffered saline, 1% gelatin (VBS) for 75 min at 37 °C. Following further washing, ECs were resuspended in VBS, and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. ECs were analyzed by flow cytometry using the FL2 channel. Lysis was calculated in triplicate samples as the number of PI-positive cells expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells. Western Blotting—HUVEC were lysed (4 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, in 150 mm NaCl with 25 mm sodium deoxycholic acid, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% protease inhibitor mixture), and the protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels, and separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon™-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKC isozymes (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and against the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of p38 MAPK (New England Biolabs Ltd., Hitchin, Herts, UK). The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Integrated density values for the test and control bands were obtained with an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager 5500 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Statistical Analysis—Differences between the results of experimental treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance with the Bonferroni multiple comparison test using GraphPad 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant at p values of <0.05. VEGF-induced Up-regulation of DAF Is Mediated via VEGF-R2 and PLCγ—DAF is expressed at a low level on resting ECs in culture. We have reported previously that VEGF induces a significant, unimodal increase in EC surface expression of DAF as measured by flow cytometry. This response is indirect, requiring the synthesis of one or more intermediate proteins, and is dependent upon an increase in steady-state DAF mRNA (16Mason J.C. Lidington E.A. Yarwood H. Lublin D.M. Haskard D.O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DAF protein expression was significantly increased following 24 h of exposure to VEGF with maximal expression at 48–72 h (Fig. 1A). A dual approach was used to explore which VEGF receptor was involved in this response. First, preincubation of EC with SU1498, a selective inhibitor of VEGF-R2 tyrosine kinase, had no effect on basal DAF expression while abrogating VEGF-induced DAF up-regulation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore PlGF, which preferentially binds VEGF-R1, failed to induce DAF expression at concentrations up to 50 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that VEGF-R2 is the dominant receptor in the induction of DAF expression by VEGF. Ligation of VEGF-R2 by VEGF results in the phosphorylation of PLCγ, a response that has been implicated in VEGF-dependent signaling pathways in EC (13He H. Venema V.J. Guo X.L. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 44Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PLCγ, HUVEC were treated with the PLCγ antagonist U73122. This resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of VEGF-induced DAF up-regulation (not shown), which was maximal following pretreatment with 10 μm U73122 (Fig. 1C). VEGF-induced DAF Up-regulation Is Regulated by PKCα and PKCϵ —To explore the role of PKC in VEGF-induced DAF up-regulation, we studied the expression, activation, and inhibition of specific PKC isozymes. Initial immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that HUVEC expressed PKCα, -βII, -δ, -ϵ, -θ, and -ζ (data not shown). Activation of PKC with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PBu), which activates both classical (cPKCα, -β, and -γ) and novel (nPKCδ, -ϵ, and -θ,) PKC isozymes, resulted in a significant increase in DAF expression (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 2, A and B, both ingenol dibenzoate, which preferentially activates nPKC (45Asada A. Zhao Y. Kondo S. Iwata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28392-28398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and thymeleatoxin, which preferentially activates cPKC (46Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), were capable of inducing a significant dose-dependent increase in cell surface DAF expression. Previous studies have demonstrated activation and translocation of PKCα, PKCβ, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCζ in ECs exposed to VEGF (20Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cPKC and nPKC with GF109203X completely inhibited DAF induction by both PBu and VEGF (Fig. 2, C and D). However, Gö6976, a cPKC-specific inhibitor, only reduced DAF up-regulation by 30–50%, supporting additional involvement of nPKC isozymes. Subsequent experiments sought to establish which one of the cPKC isozymes, PKCα or -β, was involved in the response. As seen in Fig. 3A, both Gö6976 and a specific cell-permeable peptide antagonist of PKCα/β, myr-ψPKC, significantly inhibited VEGF-induced DAF expression. In contrast, LY379196, a PKCβ-specific antagonist, had no effect, thereby implicating PKCα in VEGF-induced DAF up-regulation. There was no significant effect of the antagonists alone on basal DAF expression (not shown). Pretreatment of ECs with a specific peptide antagonist of PKCϵ (myr-PKCϵ) resulted in a minimal reduction in VEGF-induced DAF expression. However, a combination of myr-ψPKC and myr-PKCϵ completely abrogated the response (Fig. 3A). In contrast, similar myristoylated peptides specific for PKCθ and PKCζ and rottlerin, an antagonist of PKCδ, had no significant inhibitory effect (not shown). The role of PKCα and -ϵ was explored further using adenoviruses expressing PKCα and -ϵ dominant-negative constructs. Infection with each DN adenovirus led to a dose-dependent increase in the specific PKC isozyme immunoreactivity (Fig. 3B), and an MOI of 50 and 200 was used for further experiments with DN-PKCα and DN-PKCϵ, respectively. Infection with the DN-PKC and β-galactosidase adenoviruses had no effect on basal DAF expression (not shown). However, infection with DN-PKCα or DN-PKCϵ alone resulted in 25–30% inhibition of VEGF-induced DAF, whereas use of the dominant-negative adenoviruses in combination completely abrogated the response, thereby confirming the requirement for activation of both PKCα and -ϵ by VEGF for a maximal response (Fig. 3C). VEGF-induced DAF Up-regulation Is Independent of Nitric Oxide Generation and Thrombin Release—Treatment of ECs with VEGF increases expression and phosphorylation of eNOS and local NO synthesis (13He H.

https://openalex.org/W1966860592,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a member of the ABC superfamily of transporter proteins. Recently, crystal structures of intact, prokaryotic members of this family have been described. These structures suggested that ATP binding and hydrolysis occurs at two sites formed at the interface between their nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). In contrast to the prokaryotic family members, the NBDs of CFTR are asymmetric (both structurally and functionally), and previous to the present studies, it was not clear whether both NBDs are required for ATP hydrolysis. In order to assess the relative roles of the two NBDs of human CFTR, we purified and reconstituted NBD1 and NBD2, separately and together. We found that NBD1 and NBD2 by themselves exhibited relatively low ATPase activity. Co-assembly of NBD1 and NBD2 exhibited a 2–3-fold enhancement in catalytic activity relative to the isolated domains and this increase reflected enhanced ATP turnover (Vmax). These data provide the first direct evidence that heterodimerization of the NBD1 and NBD2 domains of CFTR is required to generate optimal catalytic activity.

Although it is a member of this transporter superfamily, it actually functions as a regulated chloride channel, and naturally occurring mutations cause the disease cystic fibrosis (3Rommens J.M.

The CFTR protein, like other ABC proteins, consists of two transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). In addition, it contains a unique regulatory or “R” domain, which is phosphorylated at multiple sites by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (5Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7689-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).Up until very recently, there was no crystallographic information available concerning CFTR, and investigators drew parallels to CFTR from the structures that were available for prokaryotic NBDs. The more recent of these latter structures suggested that two identical catalytic sites were formed at the interface between two identical NBDs arranged in a head-to-tail orientation (7Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 8Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C.

In this heterodimeric orientation, the signature motif of one NBD is juxtaposed against the “P” loop or Walker A of the other. However, unlike those of the prokaryotic ABC transporters, the two NBDs of CFTR have quite different amino acid sequences. There is clearly a lack of sequence conservation even within the Walker motifs implicated in direct interactions with nucleotides. Whereas NBD1 possesses the canonical Walker C (ABC signature) motif, the Walker A motif is modified (i.e. S/T substituted for T/S (10Callebaut I. Eudes R. Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)); it lacks conservation of the glutamate residue implicated in interaction with the hydrolytic water of Walker B (11Moody J.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and lacks a conserved histidine also implicated in this reaction (9Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This degree of sequence degeneracy and biochemical studies showing stable interaction of azido ATP with NBD1 (12Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Basso C. Vergani P. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that NBD1 by itself is a weak ATPase. In fact, the recent crystal structures of mouse CFTR-NBD1 did show ATP bound to the Walker A, or “P” loop but did not reveal coordination of the ATP with a hydrolytic base in the protein (14Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E.

On the other hand, NBD2 possesses sequence conservation in the canonical Walker A, B, and H motifs. However, it lacks conservation within the signature motif (Walker C). Molecular modeling of the NBDs of CFTR, using prokaryotic NBD dimers as a template, predicts the formation of one “conventional” site (comprising the Walker A and B motifs of NBD2 and the Walker C of NBD1) and one “unconventional” catalytic site (comprising the Walker A and B of NBD1 with the Walker C of NBD2) in the head-to-tail heterodimeric complex (10Callebaut I. Eudes R. Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).To date, there is no empirical evidence available to directly support the hypothesis that heterodimerization of the NBDs is necessary to confer the ATPase activity of CFTR. There have been several studies of the ATPase activity of isolated NBD1 peptides alone (15Duffieux F. Annereau J.P. Boucher J. Miclet E. Pamlard O. Schneider M. Stoven V. Lallemand J.Y. Eur. J.

Unfortunately, variations in the experimental reagents preclude comparisons between studies and assessment of the relative roles of the two NBDs in ATPase activity. For example, even the intrinsic ATPase activity of NBD1 peptides appears to vary from study to study, depending on the domain boundaries employed and the incorporation of fusion proteins.In this study, we compared the function of isolated NBD1 and NBD2 of human CFTR with co-reconstituted NBD1 and NBD2 using comparable expression and purification conditions in order to directly evaluate the hypothesis that both domains are necessary to confer optimal ATPase activity. We expressed both domains as recombinant proteins in Sf9 cells, purified them by virtue of hexahistidine tags, and compared their ATPase activities separately and following their co-assembly. We used the same purification system as we employ in our studies of the full-length membrane protein, since we found significant membrane association of the NBDs. This strategy permitted purification of sufficient quantities of NBD protein for biochemical studies as well as subsequent comparison of the activity of the NBDs.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of an Expression Vector Containing NBD1 and NBD2 of CFTR—We created recombinant baculovirus containing human NBD1 and NBD2 for expression in Sf9 cells. To do this, we used the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system from Invitrogen. Briefly, the plasmid expressing the entire human CFTR coding sequence (22Kartner N. Hanrahan J.W. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Sun S.Z. Ackerley C.A. Reyes E.F. Tsui L.C. Rommens J.M. Bear C.E. Riordan J.R.

Primers had a restriction site for EcoRI at the N terminus, one for Kpn at the C terminus, and a hexahistidine C-terminal sequence for purification purposes. For NBD1 the forward primer was 5′-CGG GAA TTC ATG TAT AAG ACA TTG GAA TAT AAC TTA AC-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-CCG GGT ACC CTA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG TCC TCC TCC TGA ATT TCT TCT TTC TGC ACT AAA-3′. For NBD2, the forward primer (containing a hemagglutinin tag) was 5′-CGG GAA TTC ATG TAC CCA TAT GAC GTC CCA GAC TAC GCT GAT GAC ATC TGG CCC TCA GGG G-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-CCG GGT ACC CTA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG TCC TCC TCC CCT GTC GGA GGG GCT GAT GGC-3′. DNA coding for human NBD1 or NBD2 was ligated into pFastBac1 for subsequent generation of recombinant bacmid DNA and virus generation in Sf9 cell cultures. Successful expression was confirmed by Western blotting of cell extract with NBD1- and NBD2-specific antibodies. PCR analysis was performed on the baculovirus and sequenced to confirm that the NBD1 and NBD2 sequences were accurate.Purification and Renaturation of NBD1 and NBD2—Recombinant NBD1 and NBD2 were produced by infection of Sf9 cell cultures grown in 75-ml flasks. Cells were incubated with 2.5 ml of harvested virus for 40 h at 26 °C. After this period, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and disrupted using a French press (1000 p.s.i), and the fragments were centrifuged for 20 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. The subsequent purification is similar to that described for the full-length CFTR protein (25Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11623-11626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Ramjeesingh M. Garami E. Galley K. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet produced by the above centrifugation was solubilized overnight in 20 ml of 8% pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (PFO) (Oakwood Products Inc., West Colombia, SC), 25 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Detergent-solubilized His-tagged NBD protein was then filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and applied to a freshly generated nickel column at a rate of 2 ml/min. A pH gradient (pH 8.0–6.0) in 4% PFO and 25 mm phosphate was then applied using fast protein liquid chromatography, and 2-ml fractions were collected.The fractions eluted from the column were assessed for the presence of NBD protein by dot blot analysis. Immunopositive fractions were selected and concentrated using a Microcon YM-10 concentrator (molecular mass cut-off of 10,000 Da; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) to a final volume of ∼50 μl. Fractions containing pure protein (single silver-stained protein band on SDS-PAGE) were then combined and dialyzed in a Specta/Por dialysis membrane (cut-off 10,000 Da) overnight against 4 liters of buffer containing 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm dodecyl maltoside at pH 7.5. Renatured protein samples were concentrated 4-fold in a Centricon YM-10 concentrator (molecular mass cut-off 10,000 Da; Millipore). In studies where NBD1 and NBD2 were refolded together, equal amounts of purified NBD1 and NBD2 were mixed together in a Specta/Por dialysis membrane, and the PFO was dialyzed off overnight into 4 liters of buffer containing 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm dodecyl maltoside at pH 7.5.TNP-ATP Binding—Binding of TNP-ATP to NBD1 or NBD2 was analyzed by steady state fluorescence measurements in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi). 100 ng of protein was prepared in 1 ml of buffer containing 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm dodecyl maltoside, pH 7.5, in 1 ml (1 × 1-cm optical path) fluorescence cuvettes. TNP-ATP was added at varying final concentrations. Experiments were performed at 25 °C with continuous stirring. The samples were excited at 410 nm, and the emission intensity at 550 nm was recorded. A proteinless sample was used for subsequent correction of the inner filter effect on the fluorescence of TNP nucleotides as described by Garboczi et al. (23Garboczi D.N. Thomas P.J. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14632-14637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, ATP was added at the concentrations shown to displace TNP-ATP. Ki was calculated by fitting a competitive binding curve as described (24Randak C. Roscher A.A. Hadorn H.B. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Auerswald E.A. Machleidt W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).ATPase Measurements—ATPase activity was measured as the production of [α-32P]ADP from [α-32P]ATP by the NBDs as described previously (26Ramjeesingh M.

The assay was carried out in a reaction mixture (15 μl) containing 1 μg of NBD1 or -2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm dodecyl maltoside, and 8 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 1.0 mm unlabeled ATP, pH 7.5.Analyses—The ATP dose-response curves for the ATPase activities by NBD2 and NBD1 plus NBD2 were fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation using the curve-fitting program Prism (GraphPad). The dose response of TNP-ATP binding to NBD1 was analyzed similarly.RESULTSExpression of hNBD1 and hNBD2 in Sf9 Cells—Constructs coding for human CFTR NBD1 and NBD2 were designed on the basis of structural information generated for prokaryotic ABC transporter by x-ray crystallography (7Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 8Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The boundaries were based on the alignment of CFTR NBDs with others shown in the recent crystal structure of BtuCD. Specifically, they were chosen to include all of the secondary structural elements revealed for the NBDs in BtuCD (8Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino terminus of NBD1 was extended to include residues that comprise the epitope (amino acids 386–412) recognized by CFTR-specific monoclonal antibody, L12B4 (27Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The construct representing human NBD1 included residues 380–660, and these boundaries correspond well with those used for the recently obtained mouse NBD1 crystal structure (14Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E.

The present human NBD2 construct spans residues 1201–1446 and includes the epitope (amino acids 1365–1395) recognized by a distinct CFTR-specific antibody, M3A7, permitting convenient identification of the two generated proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, both constructs were designed to include a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for subsequent purification.Sf9 cells were infected for 40 h with baculoviruses containing either NBD1 or NBD2, and the expression of either protein was determined following cell fragmentation using a French press and centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2A, most of the NBD proteins (assessed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-His antibody) were present in the low speed pellet (containing larger organelles and inclusion bodies). Membranes (including microsomal and plasma membranes) were enriched from the supernatant of the previous low speed spin by sucrose density centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2A, both NBD1 and NBD2 proteins, expressed as proteins with molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, were associated with the low speed pellet and with the microsomal and plasma membrane-enriched fraction.Fig. 2Expression of NBD1 and NBD2 in Sf9 cells.A, left two lanes, His-tagged NBD1 protein expressed in both the low speed pellet (pt) from broken Sf9 cells (containing inclusion bodies) and membranes (m) enriched from supernatant by sucrose density centrifugation. Western blot probed using anti-His antibody. Right two lanes, His-tagged NBD2 protein also expressed in both low speed pellet and membranes. Immunoblot (IB) was probed using anti-His antibody. B, left panel, NBD1 expression in detergent lysates of Sf9 cells confirmed using NBD1-specific antibody L12B4. Right panel, purification of NBD1 as an ∼30-kDa protein from Sf9 cells confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver stain analysis. C, left panel, NBD2 expression in detergent lysates of Sf9 cells confirmed using NBD2-specific antibody M3A7. Right panel, purification of NBD2 as an ∼30-kDa protein from Sf9 cells confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver stain analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purification of NBD1 and NBD2 from S9 Cells—In order to purify NBD1 and NBD2, 100-ml cultures of Sf9 cells expressing either protein were harvested and lysed at 1000 p.s.i. Blots were incubated with L12B4 to assess expression of NBD1 and M3A7 for NBD2 (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). The finding that the NBDs were associated with cellular membranes prompted us to extract the NBDs from lysed Sf9 cells with detergent as in our previous purifications of intact CFTR. A low speed spin was employed to first eliminate debris and nuclei, and the remaining cellular material was collected by high speed centrifugation and then solubilized in 8% PFO. The detergent lysate was applied to a nickel affinity column, and NBD1 and NBD2 proteins were specifically eluted using a pH gradient at pH 6.04 and 6.12 respectively. Fig. 2 shows assessment of fractions using SDS-PAGE. The silver stain of the purified fraction of NBD1 shows a single band migrating at the molecular mass expected for NBD1, 31.6 kDa (Fig. 2B, right panel). The silver stain of the purified NBD2 also shows one band migrating at the molecular mass expected for monomeric NBD2, 27.7 kDa (Fig. 2C).TNP-ATP Binds to Both NBD1 and NBD2—Following purification, PFO detergent was removed from NBD1, NBD2, and NBD1 + NBD2 preparations (containing equimolar concentrations of NBD1 and NBD2, by dialysis overnight in the presence of 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm dodecyl maltoside, pH 7.5. The protein was then concentrated and employed in studies of ATP binding and ATPase activity.In order to assess whether the NBD1 and NBD2 protein were folded correctly and functional, TNP-ATP binding studies were performed (Fig. 3). NBD1 bound TNP-ATP with a Km of 7.7 μm (mean, n = 2; range 3.3–11.6, as shown in Fig. 3). This is in the same range as other studies of TNP-ATP binding to NBD1 (20Lu N.T. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Neville D.C. Rozanas C.R. Tulk B.M. Townsend R.R. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, binding was specific, since protein denatured in 8% PFO failed to show any evidence of binding. Furthermore, the natural ligand ATP was demonstrated to compete with the TNP-ATP binding with a Ki of 6.7 ± 0.3 mm (mean ± S.E., n = 3, Fig. 3, inset). Purified NBD2 bound TNP-ATP with a Km of 10.6 μm, comparable with that of NBD1. Therefore, our findings suggest that both NBDs are functionally reconstituted and can bind this poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogue with similar affinity.Fig. 3TNP-ATP binding to NBD1 and NBD2.A, the fluorescence increase of TNP-ATP upon binding to NBD1 was measured at an excitation wavelength of 410 nm and emission wavelength of 550 nm at varying TNP-ATP concentrations (mean of duplicate values shown, open squares). Data were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation (r2 = 0.98) to yield a Km of 11.6. The mean Km obtained from assessment of two different NBD1 preparations, each with duplicate or triplicate studies, respectively, was 7.7 μm. Denatured NBD1 protein (in the presence of 8% PFO detergent) failed to show TNP-ATP-dependent binding and fluorescence (mean values of duplicate studies shown, diamond). Approximately 100 ng/ml NBD1 protein was used in both cases (renaturated and denatured protein). Inset, displacement of TNP-ATP by ATP. The quenching of the fluorescence by ATP confirms that TNP-ATP binding was specific. Competition experiments resulted in Ki for ATP of 6.7 0.3 m ± m (mean ± S.E. of triplicate studies, solid squares overlay error bars). B, fluorescence increase of TNP-ATP upon binding to NBD2. The mean ± S.E. values of triplicate studies of a NBD2 protein preparation (solid circles overlay S.E. values) were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation (r2 = 0.99) to yield a Km of 10.6 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ATPase Activity of NBD1, NBD2, and NBD1/2—ATPase was measured as the production of [α-32P]ADP from [α-32P]ATP by the NBDs as described previously (29Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). One microgram of NBD protein was used, and initially, all reactions were carried out in the presence of 1.0 mm unlabeled ATP. One microgram of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control protein in parallel studies. As shown in the phosphor image of Fig. 4A, i (upper panel), the production of radiolabeled ADP ([α-32P]ADP) from ([α-32P]ATP, ATPase activity) by NBD1 was slightly increased (9.4 ± 0.8 nmol/mg/min (S.E.) relative to the paired negative controls, BSA (8.0 ± 0.8 nmol/mg/min), and this difference was repeatable (four different protein preparations, duplicate samples) and statistically significant (p = 0.005). Similarly, there was a slight but statistically significant difference between the ATPase activity determined for NBD2 relative to the paired negative BSA control: 9.8 ± 0.2 versus 8.7 ± 0.3 (3 different protein preparations, duplicate samples, p = 0.007).Fig. 4ATPase activity of NBD1, NBD2, and combination (NBD1 + NBD2).A, i, top panel, phosphor images showing separation of radiolabeled ADP ([α-32P]ADP) from [α-32P]ATP or ATPase activity by thin layer chromatography. ATPase activity is greater by purified NBD1 (duplicate samples) than by BSA (control (Ctl), duplicate samples). A, i, bottom panel, phosphor images show that ATPase activity is considerably less by isolated NBD1 and isolated NBD2 than by coreconstituted (NBD1 + NBD2) (duplicate samples for each). A, ii, a bar graph shows the mean and S.E. of the ATPase activity of NBD1 (open bars), NBD2 (solid bars), and the mixture of NBD1 and NBD2 (NBD1 + NBD2) (hatched bars). NBD1 was purified from four different reconstitutions, NBD2 from three reconstitutions, and NBD1 + NBD2 from three co-reconstitutions. ATPase activities (duplicates for each preparation), conferred by 1 μg of total NBD protein, were determined in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 1 h after initiation of the reaction. These values were corrected for background, by subtraction of activity determined in reaction mixtures containing 1 μg of BSA instead of the CFTR NBDs. The activity conferred by the co-reconstituted NBD1 + NBD2 was significantly greater than that measured for either NBD1 (p = 0.022, *) or NBD2 (p = 0.0004, **) alone. B, the graph shows a comparison of ATP dependence of NBD1 + NBD2 (open triangle), NBD1 (open square), and NBD2 (filled circle) ATPase activity (performed in duplicate; mean shown). One microgram of purified protein was used in each reaction (1-h duration). Nucleotide dependences of NBD ATPase activity were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation (r2 = 0.92): NBD1 (r2 = 0.84) and (NBD2 (r2 = 0.77).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ATPase activity of each NBD alone and following coreconstitution (NBD1 + NBD2) is shown as the production of radiolabeled ADP ([α-32P]ADP) from [α-32P]ATP in the lower panel of Fig. 4A, i. This phosphor image shows very clearly that coreconstitution of NBD1 with NBD2 leads to enhanced ATPase activity. The stimulation of ATPase activity upon co-reconstitution of NBD1 and NBD2 was observed consistently in multiple protein preparations. In Fig. 4A, ii, we report the specific ATPase activity of the NBD peptides after subtraction of background values (BSA controls) in the presence of 1 mm ATP. Specific ATPase activity (nmol/mg/min) of either NBD (NBD1, 1.33 ± 0.33 (S.E.), n = 8, duplicates of four different protein preparations; NBD2, 1.12 ± 0.25, n = 6, duplicates of three different protein preparations) alone was significantly less than the co-reconstituted mixture of NBD1 + NBD2: 3.60 ± 0.38 (nmol/mg/min, n = 6, duplicates of three different protein preparations), with p values of 0.022 and 0.0004, respectively. The ATP dependence of the ATPase activity of NBD1, NBD2, and NBD1 + NBD2 could be fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation and the relative kinetic parameters, apparent affinity (Km) and Vmax, shown in Table I. It is clear from these analyses that the increase in the ATPase activity observed for the coreconstituted NBD1 + NBD2 over NBD1 or NBD2 alone is associated with a marked increase in rate of ATP turnover or Vmax (by approximately 2–5-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4B, Table I). Further, the apparent affinity of co-reconstituted NBD1 and NBD2 for nucleotide is low, with a Km of ∼2 mm, consistent with its increased activity as an ATPase and enhanced nucleotide off rate.Table IRelative kinetic parametersProteinKm(ATP)Vmaxnmol / mg / minNBD12.25.9NBD20.32.5NBD1 + NBD22.112.9CFTRaPreviously reported in Ref. 29.1.050.0a Previously reported in Ref. 29Li C.

https://openalex.org/W2004914810,"β-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds and inhibits a diverse collection of class A β-lactamases at a wide range of affinities. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was previously performed to identify the amino acid sequence requirements of BLIP for inhibiting TEM-1 β-lactamase and SME-1 β-lactamase. Two hotspots of binding energy, one from each domain of BLIP, were identified (Zhang, Z., and Palzkill, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 45706–45712). This study has been extended to examine the amino acid sequence requirements of BLIP for binding to the SHV-1 β-lactamase, which is a poor binding substrate (Ki = 1.1 μm), and the Bacillus anthracis Bla1 enzyme (Ki = 2.5 nm). The two hotspots previously identified as important for binding TEM-1 and SME-1 β-lactamase were also found to be important for binding Bla1. The hotspot from the second domain of BLIP, however, does not make substantial contributions to SHV-1 binding. This may explain why BLIP binds to SHV-1 β-lactamase with much weaker affinity than to the other three enzymes. Three regions, including two loops that insert into the active pocket of TEM-1 β-lactamase and the Glu-73—Lys-74 buried charge motif, exhibit strikingly different effects on the binding affinity of BLIP toward the various enzymes when mutated and, therefore, act as specificity determinants. Analysis of double mutants of BLIP that combine specificity-determining residues suggests that these residues contribute to the poor affinity between the second domain of BLIP and SHV-1 β-lactamase. β-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds and inhibits a diverse collection of class A β-lactamases at a wide range of affinities.

Protein-protein interactions play a critical role in most cellular processes. An understanding of the molecular basis of these interactions is required to engineer novel protein-protein interactions or to design drugs that manipulate these interactions in a rational way (2Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Protein binding surfaces exhibit specific chemical and geometric characteristics that determine affinity and specificity for binding to their targets (2Clackson T. Wells J.A.

It is difficult to design small molecules that mimic the interactions of a protein interface because of the generally very large binding area and the large number of residues participating in the interface. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis, however, indicates that only a small number of residues on the interface make significant energetic contributions to binding, and these residues are defined as a hot spot or functional epitope (2Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar, 8Nuss J.M. Whitaker P.B. Air G.M. Proteins. 1993; 15: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Jin L.

Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The existence of hot spots makes the task of designing small molecules that alter protein-protein interactions less daunting. Several attempts have been made to understand the molecular basis of protein-protein interactions by systematic analysis of physiochemical properties or alanine-scanning mutagenesis data on protein-protein interfaces (5Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar, 7Chakrabarti P. Janin J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 11Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 12Jones S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Some general rules have been proposed, but they seldom hold true for all protein-protein interfaces. Conserved polar residues have been proposed to constitute hot spots because they are frequently found in interfaces (13Hu Z. Ma B. Wolfson H. Nussinov R. Proteins. 2000; 39: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues or large aromatic residues are also frequently found in hot spots, and interfaces usually bury a large hydrophobic surface area (14Tsai C.J. Lin S.L. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Neither polar interactions nor hydrophobic interactions alone, however, are sufficient to identify binding sites (15Ma B. Elkayam T. Wolfson H. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5772-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 16Kortemme T. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14116-14121Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The factors that differentiate residues in a hot spot from other residues on the interface or other regions of the protein surface remain elusive. Therefore, additional structure-function studies are required to understand the key components of protein-protein interactions. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, are commonly prescribed anti-microbial drugs. The extensive use of these drugs has resulted in widespread β-lactam antibiotic resistance, which is becoming a threat to public health. The expression of β-lactamases that catalyze the hydrolysis of β-lactams is a common mechanism for bacterial resistance to these drugs. β-Lactamases have been grouped into four classes according to primary sequence alignments (17Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli TEM-1, Serratia marcescens SME-1, Klebsiella pneumoniae SHV-1, and Bacillus anthracis Bla1 are all class A β-lactamases that share at least 30% sequence identity (Table I). The x-ray crystal structures of the TEM-1, SME-1, and SHV-1 β-lactamases indicate that they possess a similar-fold (18Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R.

Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). BLIP consists of two tandemly linked 76-amino acid domains. The co-crystal structure of the TEM-1 β-lactamase-BLIP complex indicates that BLIP uses its 7-strand β-sheet to clamp over the loop-helix region of TEM-1 (residues 99–114) (Fig. 1) (23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of class A β-lactamases that are inhibited by BLIP do not exhibit extensive amino acid sequence conservation in this region (23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, two loops in BLIP, one from each domain, insert into the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase to block the binding of substrates. The interaction area between BLIP and β-lactamase (2636 Å2) is one of the largest among known protein-protein interactions (23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Several previous studies have focused on the TEM-1·BLIP complex (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol.

We previously employed alanine-scanning mutagenesis to determine the functional epitopes of BLIP for binding the TEM-1 and SME-1 β-lactamases (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two patches of residues (patch 1, residues Phe-36, His-41, and Tyr-53; patch 2, residues His-148, Trp-150, Arg-160, and Trp-162), one from each domain of BLIP, were shown to dominate the binding affinity. In addition, the two loops that insert into the active pocket of TEM-1 as well as a Glu-73–Lys-74 motif that is fully buried in the interface are important determinants of the specificity of BLIP binding to TEM-1 versus SME-1 β-lactamase (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study the alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments were continued to determine the functional epitope of BLIP for binding two additional class A β-lactamases, SHV-1 and Bla1. BLIP binds to SHV-1 (Ki = 1.1 μm) much weaker than it does to TEM-1 β-lactamase (Ki = 0.5 nm) even though the enzymes share 68% sequence identity and a similar substrate spectrum (18Kuzin A.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, BLIP inhibits the SME-1 and Bla1 β-lactamases efficiently (Ki = ∼2.5 nm) despite the fact that SME-1 and Bla1 share only about 30% identity to TEM-1 β-lactamase. Examination of BLIP binding to the SHV-1 and Bla1 β-lactamases provides an interesting comparison with the previous study on binding of BLIP to the TEM-1 and SME-1 enzymes (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The results suggest that that the weak interaction between SHV-1 β-lactamase and BLIP is due to a lack of contribution of residues from the second domain of BLIP. Materials—All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs except the Pfu polymerase, which was purchased from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Talon cobalt resin was purchased from Clontech. Cephalosporin C was purchased from Sigma. Nitrocefin was purchased from BD Biosciences. Cation exchange columns (SP Fast Flow) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. BLIP Mutagenesis, Cloning, and Purification—All single mutants of BLIP were constructed previously (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol.

The construction and cloning of double mutants of BLIP follow the same protocol using overlapping PCR (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of each mutant was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ABI 3100 capillary DNA sequencer. The purification of BLIP mutants followed the procedure described previously (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The purity of the BLIP samples was determined by SDS-PAGE. BLIP concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay with a standard curve calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Sequence Alignment of Class A β-Lactamases—Sequences of class A β-lactamases were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base. The sequence alignment was done using ClustalW WWW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw) (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Bla1 was modeled using SwissModel first approach mode at www.expasy.org/swissmod (33Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Schwede T.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). To prevent bias, the modeling was carried out three times with different choices of templates. In trial 1, uncomplexed TEM-1 (1BTL) and SHV-1 (1SHV) were retrieved from the PDB. Both TEM-1 and SHV-1 are typical class A β-lactamases. The PDB files were then edited according to the requirements of the SwissModel server. The edited PDB files were then input as templates for the modeling. In trial 2, chain A of the TEM1·BLIP complex (1JTG), PC1 β-lactamase (3BLM), SME-1 (1DY6), and SHV-1 (1SHV) were retrieved and edited as templates for the modeling. PC1 and SME-1 β-lactamases were used to increase diversity because of their unusual structures compared with other class A β-lactamases. In trial 3, the server was allowed to search for templates through the ExNRL-3D data base, which is a sequence data base designed for the purpose of finding templates for SwissModeling. The server found 87 available structures with more than 24% identity and used them as templates for the modeling. This setting included more diversified templates. All three methods gave basically the same Bla1 structure in the area of interest (the root mean square deviation among loop-helix domains of all three modeled Bla1 is ∼0.5 Å). All PDB files were superimposed to 1JTG using Swiss PdbViewer before submission in setting 1 and 2. The returned output was a final model of Bla1 together with the superimposed templates as a Swiss-PdbViewer project file. The superimposed model structure was used as a reference to facilitate interpretation of the binding results. β-Lactamase Inhibition Assay—BLIP binding was assessed using an inhibition assay as described previously (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in a 96-well quartz plate. 12 reactions were monitored simultaneously in a Tecan ultraviolet spectrophotometer controlled by Magellan (Phenix) software. 5 nm SHV-1 β-lactamase or 1 nm Bla1 β-lactamase was incubated with 12 varying concentrations of BLIP for at least 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 50 μm cephalosporin C (Km is 250 μm for SHV-1) was added to the SHV-1/BLIP incubation buffer, whereas10 μm nitrocefin (Km is 19 μm for Bla1 (36Materon I.C. Queenan A.M. Koehler T.M. Bush K. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2040-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) was added to the Bla1/BLIP incubation buffer with a 12-channel pipetter. The final reaction volume was 0.3 ml. Hydrolysis of cephalosporin C was monitored at A280, whereas hydrolysis of nitrocefin was monitored at A500. Plots of the concentration of free β-lactamase versus inhibitor concentration were fit by nonlinear regression analysis to Equation 1, Efree=[Eo]−[Eo]+[Io]+Kl−([Eo]+[Io]+Kl*)2−(4[Eo][Io])2 (Eq. 1) where [Efree] is the concentration of active β-lactamase calculated from the measured velocity and the activity and concentration of uninhibited β-lactamase, [Eo] is the total β-lactamase concentration, and [Io] is the total inhibitor concentration (37Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22137-22144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants Ki were determined from the fit of the data to the equation. Determination of the Functional Epitope for BLIP Binding to SHV-1 β-Lactamase—SHV-1 is a class A β-lactamase that is most commonly found in the Gram-negative bacterium K. pneumoniae and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmidmediated ampicillin resistance in this species (38Tzouvelekis L.S. Bonomo R.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 847-864PubMed Google Scholar). SHV-1 β-lactamase shares 68% amino acid sequence identity with TEM-1 and exhibits a very similar β-lactam substrate spectrum. The three-dimensional structures of the enzymes are superimposable with the α-carbon atom overlay within a root mean square deviation of 1.4Å (18Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SHV-1 β-lactamase, however, is significantly different from TEM-1 with respect to binding to BLIP. BLIP binds and inhibits TEM-1 β-lactamase at high affinity (Ki = 0.5 nm), whereas it inhibits SHV-1 weakly (Ki = 1.1 μm) (25Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, an interesting model to gain insight into the determinants of affinity and thereby specificity for the binding of BLIP to class A β-lactamases. For this purpose, 23 alanine mutants of BLIP that were constructed previously were tested for binding to SHV-1 β-lactamase. The 23 mutated residues were originally chosen because they are within 4 Å of TEM-1 β-lactamase in the TEM-1·BLIP complex structure (1Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The residues comprising the functional epitope of BLIP for binding to SHV-1 β-lactamase are defined as those that exhibit a greater than 10-fold increase in Ki value when mutated to alanine compared with wild type BLIP. According to this definition, the functional epitope consists of 5 residues including Phe-36, His-41, Asp-49, Tyr-53, and Trp-150 (Table II, Figs. 2 and 3). Four of the critical residues are from the first domain of BLIP, whereas Trp-150 is the only critical residue from the second domain (Table II, Figs. 2 and 3).Table IIApparent inhibition constants (nm) of BLIP alanine-scanning mutantsBLIP variantKi for TEM-1Ki for SME-1Ki for SHV-1Ki for Bla1Wild type0.5 ± 0.1aData were published previously (1)2.4 ± 0.2aData were published previously (1)1,130 ± 102.5 ± 0.9E31A2.0 ± 0.5aData were published previously (1)7.7 ± 1.9aData were published previously (1)3,385 ± 6435.5 ± 2.1S35A0.5 ± 0.2aData were published previously (1)1.8 ± 0.6aData were published previously (1)227 ± 350.5 ± 0.1F36A40 ± 15aData were published previously (1)120 ± 17aData were published previously (1)∼120,000511 ± 147S39A0.3 ± 0.1aData were published previously (1)1.4 ± 0.1aData were published previously (1)225 ± 160.2 ± 0.06H41A34 ± 10aData were published previously (1)189 ± 5aData were published previously (1)20,500 ± 7,778173 ± 27G48A0.7 ± 0.2aData were published previously (1)2.6 ± 1.2aData were published previously (1)550 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.3D49A20 ± 4aData were published previously (1)185 ± 39aData were published previously (1)>50,000167 ± 20Y50A0.011 ± 0.004aData were published previously (1)32 ± 10aData were published previously (1)34 ± 31.1 ± 0.4Y51A0.5 ± 0.03aData were published previously (1)76 ± 24aData were published previously (1)391 ± 572.3 ± 0.9Y53A21 ± 2aData were published previously (1)223 ± 64aData were published previously (1)∼55,00039 ± 9S71A0.2 ± 0.06aData were published previously (1)1.9 ± 0.6aData were published previously (1)476 ± 630.5 ± 0.2E73A0.4 ± 0.06aData were published previously (1)2700 ± 71aData were published previously (1)40 ± 80.06 ± 0.04K74A46 ± 8aData were published previously (1)0.1 ± 0.01aData were published previously (1)783 ± 461.1 ± 0.4W112A13 ± 3aData were published previously (1)2600 ± 700aData were published previously (1)5,700 ± 2,80018 ± 7S113A0.11 ± 0.006aData were published previously (1)2.7 ± 0.6aData were published previously (1)402 ± 900.7 ± 0.07G141A1.8 ± 0.2aData were published previously (1)3.1 ± 0.5aData were published previously (1)562 ± 420.6 ± 0.3F142A16 ± 3aData were published previously (1)15 ± 6aData were published previously (1)1,800 ± 3604.3 ± 1.6Y143A0.6 ± 0.2aData were published previously (1)11 ± 1aData were published previously (1)50 ± 150.5 ± 0.1R144A0.6 ± 0.2aData were published previously (1)1.7 ± 0.4aData were published previously (1)634 ± 780.3 ± 0.1H148A21 ± 2aData were published previously (1)1400 ± 300aData were published previously (1)7,467 ± 2,631110 ± 22W150A184 ± 52aData were published previously (1)830 ± 190aData were published previously (1)23,000 ± 10,000624 ± 154R160A11 ± 2aData were published previously (1)322 ± 125aData were published previously (1)3,500 ± 75425 ± 2W162A20 ± 3aData were published previously (1)97 ± 19aData were published previously (1)2,767 ± 66655 ± 17E73A/Y50A0.04 ± 0.01aData were published previously (1)44000 ± 1400aData were published previously (1)18 ± 11.7 ± 0.4Y50A/Y143A0.07 ± 0.0262 ± 934 ± 40.8 ± 0.07E73A/Y143A2.5 ± 0.3∼5000051 ± 70.7 ± 0.3W112A/Y143A12 ± 61800 ± 400566 ± 1758.9 ± 3.0W150A/Y143A784 ± 13811000 ± 50006,000 ± 350175 ± 58a Data were published previously (1Zhang Z.

Relative binding free energy is the difference between binding free energy of wild-type BLIP versus the alanine mutants: ΔΔG = -RTln(Ki,wt/Ki,mut). The upper significance control line indicates a ΔΔG value of 1.36 kcal/mol, which corresponds to a 10-fold increase of the Ki value (Ki,wt/Ki,mut = 0.1). The lower significance control line indicates a ΔΔG value of -1.36 kcal/mol, which corresponds to a 10-fold decrease in the Ki value (Ki,wt/Ki,mut = 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Asp-49 in loop 1 interacts with four essential residues (Ser-130, Lys-234, Ser-235, and Arg-244) in the TEM-1 β-lactamase active site that are also conserved in the SHV-1 enzyme. Superimposition of the TEM-1 and SHV-1 structures shows that the four residues overlay closely in the two enzymes (the root mean square deviation is 0.22 Å for CA and 0.52 Å for all atoms). Residues Phe-36, His-41, and Tyr-53 in patch 1 of BLIP interact with Ser-106–Pro-107–Val-108 in TEM-1, which are also conserved in the SHV-1 enzyme. Therefore, it is not surprising that mutation of these BLIP residues to alanine has similar effects on binding to both enzymes (Table II). In contrast, there are several differences between the effects of alanine substitutions of residues in the second domain of BLIP on inhibition of β-lactamases (Table II, Fig. 3). It is clear that the residues from the second domain of BLIP, including residues in patch 2, do not contribute as much energy for binding to SHV-1 as they do for binding to the other enzymes. Residues Trp-112, His-148, Arg-160, and Trp-162 contribute significantly to binding to the TEM-1 and SME-1 β-lactamases but are not part of the functional epitope for binding to SHV-1 β-lactamase. In addition, although Trp-150 is in the functional epitope for binding TEM-1 and SHV-1, the W150A BLIP variant inhibits SHV-1 20-fold less efficiently than wild type BLIP, whereas it inhibits TEM-1 360-fold less efficiently. The residues in patch 2 of BLIP interact with residues 99QNDLV103 of TEM-1 in the TEM-1·BLIP complex (23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The corresponding region in SHV-1 β-lactamase is 99QQDLV103, which is very similar to that of TEM-1. The difference at position 100 from asparagine in TEM-1 to glutamine in SHV-1 may contribute to the weaker interaction between patch 2 of BLIP and SHV-1. Trp-150 of BLIP makes contact with Asn-100 in the TEM-1·BLIP complex structure (23Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By comparison with the unbound TEM-1 β-lactamase structure, Asn-100 of TEM-1 undergoes a conformational change when bound to BLIP to avoid collision with the side chain of BLIP residue Trp-150. A longer side chain in SHV-1 at this position might not be able to carry out the same conformational change to prevent the collision. A collision, in turn, could also effect interactions between other BLIP residues and SHV-1 by altering distances between residues in the interface.

The CLCA gene family encodes proteins with four or five putative transmembrane domains, and many family members appear to function as calcium-activated chloride channels (bCLCA1, mCLCA1, mCLCA4, hCLCA1, and hCLCA2) (15Cunningham S.A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that CLCAs may not be chloride channels themselves but may instead modulate chloride channels (20Loewen M.E.

Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1314-C1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) In addition to their potential roles as ion channels or regulators of ion channels, some CLCA family members function as adhesion molecules. For example, bCLCA2 (Lu-ECAM-1), mCLCA1, and hCLCA2 all appear to be cell-cell adhesion molecules that help mediate the colonization of lung by lung metastatic murine B16-F10 melanoma cells (22Abdel-Ghany M.

Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). β4 integrin expressed on the surface of these melanoma cells can adhere to mCLCA1 in lung endothelium. This leads to focal adhesion kinase complexing, activation, and downstream signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which promotes intravascular metastatic growth (25Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34391-34400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human breast cancer cells can colonize the lung by expression of α6β4 integrin and adhesion to hCLCA2 (22Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, endothelial CLCA proteins (e.g. hCLCA2, mCLCA5, mCLCA1, bCLCA2) have β4 integrin binding domains in their 90- and 35-kDa fragments (26Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Lin H. DiBiasio J. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49406-49416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Some CLCA isoforms, both human and mouse, may have roles as tumor suppressors. In apoptosis-resistant tumor cell lines and in HC11 cells (mammary epithelial cell line) resistant to detachment-induced apoptosis, splicing of mCLCA2 is disrupted, and the mCLCA1 message is down-regulated. In addition, mCLCA2 promotes apoptosis in serum-starved mammary epithelial cells (27Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40510-40517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). hCLCA2 expression is lost in breast cancer and in tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines (28Gruber A.D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, hCLCA1 and hCLCA4 transcription is down-regulated in 80% of colorectal carcinomas (29Bustin S.A. Li S.R. Dorudi S. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CLCA family members may also be involved in asthma and cystic fibrosis. Interleukin-13, a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, enhances the calcium-activated chloride conductance in human bronchial epithelial cells (30Atherton H. Mesher J. Poll C.T. Danahay H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2003; 367: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and hCLCA1 expression is likewise up-regulated in patients with bronchial asthma (31Toda M. Tulic M.K. Levitt R.C. Hamid Q.

Overexpression of interleukin-9 in transgenic mice results in the induction of mCLCA3 in lung epithelium and an asthma phenotype (30Atherton H. Mesher J. Poll C.T. Danahay H.

Additionally, CLCA proteins may have a role in compensating for the pathology of cystic fibrosis given the up-regulation of a calcium-activated chloride conductance in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (–/–) mice with prolonged survival (34Rozmahel R. Wilschanski M. Matin A. Plyte S. Oliver M. Auerbach W. Moore A. Forstner J. Durie P. Nadeau J. Bear C. Tsui L.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 35Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Yankaskas J.R. Cotton C.U. McKenzie A. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Examination of the human and mouse CLCA loci indicates that mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 are the previously unidentified murine counterparts of hCLCA2 and hCLCA4 (36Ritzka M. Weinel C. Stanke F. Tummler B. Genome Lett. 2003; 2: 149-154Crossref Google Scholar). The importance of cloning mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 is, thus, apparent in terms of the interesting roles of their human homologues. mCLCA5 is highly homologous to hCLCA2, a protein involved in the vascular arrest of lung metastatically competent cancer cells (22Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34391-34400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both hCLCA2 and mCLCA5 have β4 integrin binding motifs (26Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Lin H. DiBiasio J. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49406-49416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These motifs in hCLCA2 are directly involved in the adhesion of cancer cells (26Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Lin H. DiBiasio J. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49406-49416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). hCLCA2 has also been reported to mediate a calcium-activated chloride current when expressed in HEK293 cells (19Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mCLCA6 is highly homologous to hCLCA4. The function of hCLCA4 (previously referred to as hCaCC-2) has not been reported, but it is expressed at high levels in brain, a unique property for a CLCA family member (37Agnel M. Vermat T. Culouscou J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the context of determining the role and potential functional homology of mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 to other family members, we chose to focus on their tissue expression patterns, biochemical characteristics, and electrophysiological properties. We report here the cloning of two new mouse CLCA family members: mCLCA5 and mCLCA6. mCLCA5 has ubiquitous expression with high levels in eye and spleen, whereas mCLCA6 is highly expressed in intestine and stomach with trace levels of expression in eye, liver, and spleen. mCLCA6 is also expressed as a splice variant in intestine and stomach. We transiently expressed the three proteins in tsA201 cells and were able to detect each by Western blot. Examination of the glycosylation states of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variant by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomal membranes indicates that mCLCA6 and its splice variant are glycosylated. We also show evidence that expression of all of these proteins results in calcium-activated chloride currents. Cloning of mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 —RNA was extracted from B6SJL/J hybrid mouse eye and large intestine with a Tissue-Tearor™ homogenizer (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) using Trizol (Invitrogen) with its standard protocol. 1 μg of RNA (eye for mCLCA5, intestine for mCLCA6) was used for RT-PCR. Gene-specific cDNA and PCR product were generated in the same tube (50 °C for 30 min; 94 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min 10 s; with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min) with a Superscript One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates kit (Invitrogen). Primers were designed based on predicted mRNAs for mouse homologues of hCLCA2 and hCLCA4 as reported in GenBank™. mCLCA5 primers are: forward, 5′-TCCCCGTGAATAAACCAGAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTAAAGGTCATGTCCATCCTAC-3′. mCLCA6 primers are: forward, 5′-CTCTGGGTGACCAGGCTGGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCATGATGACATGGGATATG-3′. RT-PCR products were subjected to a subsequent PCR (94 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, for 55 °C 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min; with a final extension at 68 °C 10 min) with a high fidelity enzyme, Platinum Pfx Polymerase (Invitrogen), to introduce restriction sites. mCLCA5 primers are: forward, 5′-GCTAAGATCTCATGACCCACAGGGACAGCAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTAGTCGACGCTAGAAATTTTGTCTCATTCTCT-3′. mCLCA6 primers are: forward, 5′-AAAACTGCAGATGGCTTTCTCCAGAGGGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCTACCCCGGGAAAATTTTGTTATAGCTGCTGA-3′. Purified and restriction-digested products were then subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences). mCLCA5 was inserted at BglII and SalI restriction sites, and mCLCA6 was inserted at PstI and SmaI sites. The pEGFP-N1 vector expresses proteins as EGFP fusions, with EGFP at the carboxyl terminus. Constructs were sequenced by the chain termination method with an ABI Prism 377 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The mCLCA6 splice variant was identified by comparison of the sequence with the predicted exon/intron pattern in National Center for Biotechnology Information LocusLink and the presence of gt/ag splice sites. Tissue Distribution of mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 by RT-PCR—RT-PCR was done as previously described with primers specific to each isoform and chosen to amplify across exon boundaries to rule out amplification from genomic DNA. In addition, mCLCA6 primers were chosen to flank exon 8, which is removed in the splice variant. Cycling conditions were (50 °C for 30 min; 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles for mCLCA5 or 35 cycles for mCLCA6 at 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 35 s; with a final extension at 72 °C 10 min). mCLCA5 primers are: forward, 5′-AAATCCGAGCCTCGCTGCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCAGTCTGCCACGTGACTAG-3′. mCLCA6 primers are: forward, 5′-TATGTGCCTAGTTCTTGATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTTCTGGGTGATATCAGCATTTTCTGAAGCCAG-3′. The predicted amplified fragments of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variants are ∼550, 540, and 360 base pairs, respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified as a control for RNA quality and quantity. A negative control with water instead of RNA was also included. mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 products were sequenced to establish primer specificity. The smaller mCLCA6 splice variant band was verified by using splice variant specific primers (primers flanking the new exon boundaries) for RT-PCR. Subcloning into pcDNA3.1 Expression Vector—The mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 open reading frames were subcloned directly from pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) with NotI and XbaI (Promega, Madison, WI) into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The 5′ and 3′ ends of the inserts were sequenced as previously described. Expression of EGFP-tagged Protein Constructs in tsA201 Cells, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—pEGFP-N1 constructs of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variant were used to transfect tsA201 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitate method. For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in the presence of complete, mini-protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 30 min, then incubated for 4 h with protein A-agarose that had been incubated with a BD Living Colors™ full-length Aequorea victoria polyclonal GFP (BD Biosciences) antibody for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 5–15% gradient gel, transferred to PVDF, and analyzed by Western blotting with a BD Living Colors™ A. victoria monoclonal GFP antibody (BD Biosciences) as primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody as secondary antibody (Promega). The blot was developed with Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). In Vitro Translation and N-Glycosidase F Assay—The TNT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) was used to transcribe and translate mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variant from pcDNA3.1 in the presence of l-[35S]methionine (MP Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with or without canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega). Samples were run on a 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and exposed to a phosphorscreen for 3 days. A PGNase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) digestion was performed on 200 μg of lysate from tsA201 cells transfected with mCLCA6 pEGFP-N1. The standard protocol for digestion was followed, and 60 μg of untreated or treated lysate were resolved on a 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples were then immunoblotted as described in the previous section. Microscopy—Cells were transfected as above with pEGFP-N1 constructs of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variant. Cells were fixed with VECTASHIELD® Hard Set™ Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) 48 h post-transfection. Images were obtained on a Nikon Microphot FX microscope equipped with an Optronics digital camera and Bioquant imaging software. Electrophysiology—pEGFP-N1 constructs of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variant were used to transfect HEK293 cells plated on coverslips using GenePorter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Mock-transfected control cells were transfected with an empty vector containing only pEGFP-N1. Successfully transfected cells were identified by EGFP fluorescence 24–48 h after transfection. Whole cell recordings were obtained using patch electrodes pulled from borosilicate pipettes (1.2-mm outer diameter, 0.95-mm inner diameter, with internal filament) using a Narishige PP-830 vertical puller. The recording pipettes had tips of 1–1.5-μm outer diameter (R = 8–12 megaohms) and were filled with a solution containing 98 mm KCH3SO4, 44 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm glucose, 1 mm MgATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm reduced glutathione (pH 7.8). Free Ca2+ in this solution was estimated to be 57 nm using MaxChelator. Cells were voltage-clamped at –50 mV using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Test pulses were applied, and currents were acquired using PClamp 8.2 with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). During recording, cells were perfused at room temperature using a single pass, gravity-feed perfusion system (1 ml/min) with an oxygenated medium containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). Ionomycin and niflumic acid were diluted into this solution from stock solutions prepared in dimethylsulfoxide. Experiments were conducted at room temperature. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma except KCH3SO4, which was obtained from Pfaltz and Bauer (Waterbury, CT). Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers—The GenBank™ accession number for the mCLCA6 mRNA is AY560902 and for the mCLCA6 splice variant mRNA is AY560903. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and a Splice Variant of mCLCA6 —To clone new mCLCA family members, GenBank™ was searched using BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) with sequences of known CLCAs. A predicted mRNA for a mouse homologue of hCLCA2 and of hCLCA4 was identified. RT-PCR with primers to amplify the complete open reading frame of each transcript was utilized. The mCLCA homologue of hCLCA2 (mCLCA5) was amplified from eye, whereas the mCLCA homologue of hCLCA4 (mCLCA6) was amplified from intestine. Direct sequencing of amplified products indicated that both transcripts agreed with the predicted mRNAs. The open reading frame of mCLCA5 is about 2.8 kilobases. mCLCA5 was also recently cloned by R. C. Elble and J. R. Beckley (GenBank™ accession number AY161007). The mCLCA6 open reading frame is also about 2.8 kilobases. In addition, a splice variant of mCLCA6 with an open reading frame of about 2.5 kilobases was identified. Alignment of all known mCLCA isoforms indicates a high degree of homology between mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and other family members (Fig. 1). At the amino acid level, mCLCA5 is 69% identical to hCLCA2, and mCLCA6 is 69% identical to hCLCA4. Both proteins display conserved family features, including a symmetrical cysteine-rich region, a signal peptidase cleavage site, a site for monobasic proteolytic cleavage (38Devi L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), sites for N-linked glycosylation, 2R. Gupta, E. Jung, and S. Brunak, manuscript in preparation. and consensus sites for phosphorylation by PKA, PKC, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The symmetrical cysteine-rich region for mCLCA5 is CX9CX4CX4X9C and for mCLCA6 is CX12CX4CX4CX12C. Assembly of a phylogenetic tree based on the complete sequences of all known CLCA proteins shows that mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 are highly homologous to hCLCA2 and hCLCA4, respectively (Fig. 2).Fig. 1Alignment of all mouse CLCA isoforms. Consensus sites for phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, PKA, and PKC are marked for mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 (small open square, mCLCA5 Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; large open square, PKA; open circle, PKC; small filled square, mCLCA6 Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; large filled square, PKA; filled circle, PKC (PhosphoBase version 2.0, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis). Sites are marked for all mCLCAs for monobasic proteolytic cleavage (↓), signal sequence (underlined) (SignalPV1.1, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis), and multiple cysteine motif (C). Additionally, consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation are indicated (N with * overhead). The alignment was generated by the Clustal method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2Phylogenetic tree showing the relation of all CLCAs. The dendogram was generated by Clustal method alignment on the European Bioinformatics Institute website with complete amino acid sequences for all CLCAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of the mCLCA6 splice variant sequence indicates a loss of exon 8 and a portion of exon 10. The removal of exon 8 causes a shift in the reading frame. This generates a new sequence for exon 9 that we call exon 9a. The reading frame then reverts back to the original frame in the remaining portion of exon 10 (Fig. 3). Tissue Expression of mCLCA5 and mCLCA6 —RT-PCR was performed on multiple tissues to determine the tissue expression pattern of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and the mCLCA6 splice variant (Fig. 4). mCLCA5 showed the highest levels of expression in eye and spleen, whereas mCLCA6 showed the highest levels in intestine and stomach. Low levels of mCLCA6 are also present in eye, liver, and spleen. The mCLCA6 splice variant, the smaller band on the RT-PCR gel, was detected in both intestine and stomach, although at lower levels than wild type. Biochemical Characterization of mCLCA5, mCLCA6, and mCLCA6 Splice Variant Proteins—The predicted full-length size for untagged mCLCA5 is 103.6 kDa, for mCLCA6 is 101.9 kDa, and for the mCLCA6 splice variant is 93.7 kDa. Lysates of tsA201 cells transiently transfected with EGFP-tagged versions of either mCLCA5, mCLCA6, or the mCLCA5 splice variant were immunoblotted for the corresponding protein. The EGFP tag is at the carboxyl terminus of all three proteins and adds 30 kDa to the size.

MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) represent a subfamily of dual specificity phosphatases, which negatively regulate MAP kinases. Although ERK2 activity is regulated by its phosphorylation state, MKP3 is regulated by physical interaction with ERK2, independent of its enzymatic activity (Camps, M., Nichols, A., Gillieron, C., Antonsson, B., Muda, M., Chabert, C., Boschert, U., and Arkinstall, S., (1998) Science 280, 1262–1265; Farooq, A., Chaturvedi, G., Mujtaba, S., Plotnikova, O., Zeng, L., Dhalluin, C., Ashton, R., and Zhou, M. M. (2001), Mol. Cell 7, 387–399; Zhou, B., and Zhang, Z. Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 35526–35534). The interaction of ERK2 and MKP3 allows the reciprocal cross-regulation of their catalytic activity. Indeed, MKP3 acts as a negative regulator on ERK2-MAP kinase signal transduction activity, representing thus a negative feedback for this MAPK pathway. To identify novel proteins able to complex MKP3, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report that MKP3 and protein kinase CK2 form a protein complex, which can include ERK2. The phosphatase activity of MKP3 is then slightly increased in vitro, whereas in transfected cells, ERK2 dephosphorylation is reduced. In addition, we demonstrated that CK2 selectively phosphorylates MKP3, suggesting cross-regulation between CK2α and MKP3, as well as a modulation of ERK2-MAPK signaling by CK2α via MKP3.

Several distinct DSPs have now been reported, including CL100/MKP1, PAC1, hVH-2/MKP2/TYP1, hVH3/B23, hVH5/M3–6, MKP3/PYST1/rVH6, B59/ PYST2/MKPX, MKP4, and MKP5 (1Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C.

Some DSPs are localized to different subcellular compartments, and moreover, several DSP genes undergo rapid induction following exposure to stress and/or growth factor extracellular stimulation (2Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 6Camps M. Chabert C. Muda M. Boschert U. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S.

However, the control of their activity at the level of post-transcriptional regulation is less well understood.A better understanding of the regulation of the activity of DSP will further strengthen our insight into the complex regulation of MAP kinase activity, which is crucial for many cellular events. The original concept of the linear model of signaling by MAP kinases is now modified and improved by the concept of signalosome (signaling complex), in which the interaction of signaling molecules, including kinases, phosphatases, and scaffold proteins, dictate the signaling response to extracellular stimuli, depending on the cellular context and determining a conditional cross-talk between different pathways. Long term stimulation of the ERK2 MAP kinase pathway leads to differentiation, whereas short term activation leads to proliferation in PC12 cells (8Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). The modulation of the signal strength and/or the duration of Ras/MAPK activity, for example, are important determinants for defining cell fate (4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin.

Moreover, the strength of the mitogen stimulation can modulate the level of the cellular response (11Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Another good example is given by the inhibitory effect of activated Akt on the ERK2 pathway in differentiated myotubes. This inhibition does not occur in nondifferentiated myoblasts, suggesting a stage-dependent regulation of the cross-talk between these pathways (12Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L.

Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), controlling either proliferation or differentiation of muscle cells, two mutually exclusive biological processes.The four families of MAP kinase described so far (ERK1, ERK2/p38/JNK/ERK5) (3Keyse S.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar) are interconnected with each other, as well as with other signaling pathways. Since the expression and regulation of MKP can be key elements for this cross-regulation, we were interested in finding binding partners that could modulate the enzymatic activity or substrate selectivity of MKP.Many proteins of the MKP family are composed of similar domains. They share a high degree of similarity in their catalytic core located in the C terminus, whereas their regulatory domain is highly variable. It is believed that each member of the MKP family has relative specificity among the MAP kinase families mediated by their noncatalytic domain (14Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).We focused our study on MKP3 and its target MAPK ERK1, ERK2. MKP3 is mainly expressed in lung and brain tissues but also in placenta, muscle, kidney and liver tissues, as shown by Northern blot analysis (15Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It encodes a protein with a predicted mass of 42.3 kDa. MKP3 functions as an immediately early gene, and among other stimuli, it is transcriptionally up-regulated after ERK2 pathway activation (i.e. following nerve or epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of PC12 cells) (6Camps M. Chabert C. Muda M. Boschert U. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Its localization is restricted to the cytoplasm, where it is activated by the direct physical interaction of ERK2. MKP3 has a low basal activity, but in the presence of ERK2, its activity is 40-fold higher in vitro, independent of ERK2 kinase activity (1Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 36Farooq A. Chaturvedi G. Mujtaba S. Plotnikova O. Zeng L. Dhalluin C. Ashton R.

This reflects tight and specific binding between the ERK2 major C-terminal structural lobe and the MKP3 kinase interaction motif within the MKP3 N terminus Cdc25 homology (CH2) domains, which are highly conserved between members of the MKP gene family (20Nichols A. Camps M. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Brunet A. Wilsbacher J. Cobb M. Pouyssegur J. Shaw J.P. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24613-24621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).To identify proteins that influence MKP3 function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with MKP3 as bait and a mouse brain cDNA library as a target. Protein kinase CK2α was identified by this genetic screen. Other proteins found in this screen are summarized in Fig. 2C. Protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase 2), a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, is one of the most highly conserved proteins among eukaryotic cells. It is composed of two catalytic α or α‘ subunits and two regulatory β subunits that can form a holoenzyme with α2β2, αα'β2, or α‘2β2 tetrameric structure. It has been suggested that this kinase plays a pivotal role in cell growth and proliferation. In addition, several findings support the role of CK2 in cell survival (21Blanquet P.R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 211-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated the direct interaction of CK2 with the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP3. In addition, we showed that CK2 is able to phosphorylate MKP3 without affecting its catalytic activity in vitro. However, in a cellular context, CK2α seems to influence not only the phosphorylation but also the enzymatic activity of MKP3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs and Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—pMTSM-myc-MKP3, pMTSM-myc-MKP4, pGEX4T3-MKP3, pGEX4T3-MKP4, pGEX4T3-MKP1, and pGEX4T3-MKP5 constructs have been described elsewhere (1,5,6,14–16,20). pSG5-CK2α was kindly provided by Dr. Claude Cochet, (Biology Department, INSERM, Grenoble, France), pCDNA3-HA.JNK1/SAPKγ and pGEX-SAPKα/JNK2 were provided by Dr. J. R. Woodget (Ontario Cancer Institute, Ontario, Canada), and pGEX2T-ERK2-K52A was kindly provided by C. J. Marshall (Chester Beatty Labs, Imperial Cancer Research, London). Full-length MKP3 cDNA was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pGBT9 vector as bait. Positive and negative cDNA controls were fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pACT2 plasmid as prey. Constructs were obtained by polymerase chain reaction. A two-hybrid mouse brain library cDNA fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pACT2 vector and the Y190 yeast strain were used. The yeast strain two-hybrid vectors and brain cDNA library were from Clontech, and screening techniques and medium compositions were as described by Clontech. Y190 yeast cells were first transformed with the bait and then transformed with the mouse brain cDNA library. Interaction between MKP3 and proteins encoded by the cDNA library will reconstitute the GAL4 activator and activate HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes. HIS3 confers the ability of yeast to grow in histidine-free medium, whereas LacZ produces β-galactosidase that can be detected colorimetrically in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl, β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, Clontech). 3-Aminotriazole was included at 25 mm in a selective medium to suppress leaky growth from HIS3.Production of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant GST-tagged MAPK phosphatases or MAPKs were produced in Escherichia coli after induction with 100 μm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) followed by overnight growth at 20 °C (GST-tagged MAPK phosphatases) or 16 °C (histidine-tagged ERK2). Fusion proteins were purified with Glutathion or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) using standard techniques. Nontagged ERK or CK2α were produced by the same methods but eluted from the Glutathion-Sepharose-4B by incubation with 1.5 units/ml of Thrombin T 7513 (Sigma) in buffer containing Tris, pH 8.0 (50 mm), NaCl (150 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) for 1 h at 4 °C. After elution, thrombin was inhibited by the addition of benzamidine (2 mm) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm).In Vitro Binding—2.5 μg of GST-MKP3 or GST-MKP4, immobilized on Glutathion-Sepharose-4B, were incubated in 600 μl of binding buffer containing Triton X-100 1%, sodium pyrophosphate (5 mm), NaF (50 mm), Tris acetate, pH 7.0 (20 mm), EDTA (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), sucrose (270 mm), β-glycerophosphate (10 mm), protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), and β-mercaptoethanol (0.1%) with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 μg of CK2α, as indicated in Fig. 3, in the absence or presence of 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 μg of CK2β for 4 h. The beads were washed twice with binding buffer and twice with Tris 10 mm, after which sample buffer was added to the dry beads, and the samples were boiled. Western blotting was then performed with an anti-CK2α antibody (Calbiochem) and developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions.Fig. 3CK2α binds to MKP3 in vitro. A, 2.5 μg of recombinant GST-MKP3, immobilized in Glutathion-Sepharose-4B beads, was preincubated with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 μg of CK2α (lanes 1–4, respectively) or with 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, and 2.5 μg of CK2α and 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 μg of CK2β to reconstitute CK2 heterotetramers (lanes 5–8, respectively), as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” After washing of the pelleted MKP3 beads, bound CK2α and CK2β were visualized by Western blot using specific antibodies against the CK2 subunits, as specified.

The cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) using 4 μg of total DNA/35-mm dish. (In the experiments, a combination of cDNAs was required, and wells containing only one of the constructs were transfected also with the empty vector to keep the total DNA amount constant.) Where indicated in the legend to Fig. 9, the cells were starved for 4 h in medium containing no serum and further stimulated with 10 nm of EGF (ORIGIN) for 10 min. For direct immunoblotting, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris, pH 8 (20 mm), NaCl (150 mm), SDS (0.1%), deoxycholate (2.5%), Triton X-100 (1%), β-glycerophosphate (40 mm), NaF (10 mm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), okadaic acid (30 nm), microcystin (25 nm), caliculin A (10 nm), and protease inhibitor tablet) (Roche Applied Science). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, the cells were lysated in binding lysis buffer (Tris (50 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Nonidet P-40 (1%), NaF (10 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (1 mm), Caliculin A (10 nm), Na3VO4 (1 mm), EDTA (1 mm), β-glycerophosphate (25 mm), and protease inhibitor tablet), and the lysates were diluted 1:5 in binding lysis buffer and incubated 1 h at 4 °C before centrifugation at 14,000 revolutions/min. 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads containing 2 μg of antibody were added to the supernatant. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were extensively washed with binding lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. All immunoblots were performed using Nupage BisTris from NOVEX according to protocol. To monitor the band shift of MKP3, we used 12% polyacrylamide hand-cast gels containing 1.4% bisacrylamide instead of 2.8%.

After incubation for 120 min at room temperature, hydrolyzed pNPP was monitored at 405 nm.In Vitro Phosphorylation—1 μg of GST-tagged MAPK phosphatases (MKP1, MKP3, MKP4, MKP5, MKP3ΔN, and MKP3ΔC), GST-tagged JNK2, or casein were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in 60 μl of kinase buffer (Hepes (25 mm), pH 7.0, MgCl2 (10 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), NaVO4 (0.2 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (25 mm)) containing 10 μm/0.06 Ci/mmol ATP/γ-[32P]ATP, and 0.1 μg of CK2α or ERK2. Some experiments were performed in the presence of 20 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer and further boiling of the samples at 95 °C. After loading on a 4–21% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX), the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained overnight, dried, and exposed to an autoradiography film (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSIdentification of CK2α as a Binding Partner of MKP3 by Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—We have reported previously that MKP3 binds tightly to ERK2 but not to JNK or p38 and that regions localized within the C-terminal structural lobe of ERK are essential for binding and catalytic activation of MKP3 (1Camps M.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Full-length MKP3 (Fig. 1A) was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD) as bait, and a mouse brain cDNA library (9–12-week-old BALB/c males) fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) was chosen as prey, based on the high expression level of MKP3 in brain tissues (Fig. 1B). Both constructs were transformed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 yeast strain. The interaction between the bait and the target fusion proteins reconstituted the GAL4 transcription activator and activated the transcription of reporter genes (lacZ and nutrient reporter gene HIS3) under the control of the GAL4 promoter. These two reporters were independently activated upon specific interaction between the bait and the target protein.Fig. 1Yeast two-hybrid constructs.

The GAL4AD (pACT2) vectors containing the positive insert were then isolated and sequenced. Fig. 2C shows those positive clones. Five of these cDNAs encoded for CK2α (casein kinase). This study focused on the interaction of MKP3 with CK2α and the potential physiological consequences of this binding. Co-expression of GAL4BD-MKP3 with GAL4AD-ERK2 or GAL4AD-CK2α allowed yeast to grow in a medium lacking histidine. In contrast, co-expression of MKP3 with GAL4AD-JNK2 or FADD did not allow the yeast to grow (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B summarizes the results obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system for MKP3 and CK2α, which confirmed their interaction in yeast cells.CK2α is a ubiquitously expressed and constitutively active serine/threonine kinase found in many organisms and tissues and in nearly every subcellular compartment. There is ample evidence that protein kinase CK2 has different functions in these compartments and that the subcellular localization of protein kinase CK2 is tightly regulated (23Faust M. Montenarh M. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Martin M.E. Alcazar A. Salinas M. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1990; 8: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It forms a tetramer with two β regulatory subunits and two α catalytic subunits. However, the α subunit can also exist in a monomeric form. Over 160 potential substrates have been suggested for CK2, which might explain the fact that this Ser/Thr kinase has been linked to many cellular functions, including proliferation, cell cycle progression, and development. In addition, a large body of evidence suggests a role for CK2α in cell survival (21Blanquet P.R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 211-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), oncogenic transformation, stress, and inflammatory responses, its subcellular localization being the most likely key to these diverse functions (23Faust M.

Neurosci. 1990; 8: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).MKP3-CK2α Interaction in Vitro and in Mammalian Cells— In an attempt to assess the specificity and molecular nature of this interaction, in vitro binding was performed by incubating increasing concentrations of recombinant CK2α or CK2α and CK2β with a constant amount of GST-MKP3 immobilized on Sepharose beads. CK2α bound to MKP3 was visualized by Western blotting using specific antibodies against CK2α or CK2β (Fig. 3A, upper and middle panels, respectively). As a control for equal loading, a Coomassie Blue staining of GST-MKP3 is shown (Fig. 3A, lower panel). CK2α binding was observed only with MKP3 but not with Sepharose beads, GST, or MKP4 (except at the highest concentration), which is another MAP kinase phosphatase that also binds and inactivates ERK2 (Fig. 3B, lanes 9–14, respectively). These results indicate not only that the interaction is direct and does not require the participation of other proteins but also is specific for MKP3. The starting material was also submitted to Western blot analysis to assess the proportion of CK2α retained by MKP3 (Fig. 3C). The result shows that almost all of CK2α is retained by MKP3. Although only the α subunit of CK2 was found to interact with MKP3 in the yeast two-hybrid system, Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8, shows that CK2β does not compete for the binding of CK2α to MKP3 but rather can form a complex with MKP3 and CK2α, suggesting that, in vivo, MKP3 may bind to the holoenzyme.MKP3 has been shown to directly interact with its physiological substrate ERK2. This interaction leads to the activation of MKP3 phosphatase activity, and it is independent on the phosphorylation state of ERK or MKP3 (1Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M.

Since ERK2 and CK2α are both ubiquitously expressed protein kinases, and both bind and phosphorylate MKP3, we investigated whether their binding to MKP3 is mutually exclusive. For this, recombinant GST-MKP3-Sepharose was incubated with CK2α and increasing concentrations of eluted His-ERK2, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound CK2α or ERK2 were detected by Western blot after SDS-PAGE separation of the washed MKP3-Sepharose beads.

https://openalex.org/W2049878642,"DNA non-homologous end joining starts with the binding of Ku heterodimers to double strand breaks. In this work, we characterized the thermodynamics of the Ku-DNA interaction by fluorescence anisotropy of the probe-labeled DNA. We determined that the microscopic dissociation constant (kd) for the binding of Ku to a DNA binding site of the proper length (>20 bp) ranges from 22 to 29 nm at 300 mm NaCl. The binding isotherms for DNA duplexes with two or three heterodimers were analyzed with two independent models considering the presence and absence of overlapping binding sites. This analysis demonstrated that there is no or very weak nearest-neighbor cooperativity among the Ku molecules. These models can most likely be applied to study the interaction of Ku with duplexes of any length. Furthermore, our salt dependence studies indicated that electrostatic interactions play a major role in the binding of Ku to DNA and that the kd decreases ∼60-fold as the salt concentration is lowered from 300 to 200 mm. The slope (Γsalt) of the plot of log kd versus log[NaCl] is 12.4 ± 0.1. This value is among the highest reported in the literature for a protein-DNA interaction and suggests that ∼12 ions are released upon formation of the Ku-DNA complex. In addition, comparison of the slope values measured upon varying the type of cation and anion indicated that approximately nine cations and three anions are released from DNA and Ku, respectively, when the complex is formed.

Six proteins involved in NHEJ in mammalian cells have been identified to date, Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PKcs, Xrcc4, DNA ligase IV, and Artemis (2Jeggo P.A. Adv.

DNA ligase IV forms a tight complex with Xrcc4 (5Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), whereas Ku80, Ku70, and DNA-PKcs constitute a complex termed the DNA-dependent protein kinase (6Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar).The Ku heterodimer, formed by the Ku70 (70 kDa) and Ku80 (86 kDa) subunits, is the first molecule to bind the DNA ends generated by a double strand break (DSB) in vivo (7Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Ku heterodimer shows that the two subunits are highly interdigitated and form a ring with a large base and a narrow “handle” that threads on the free DNA end like a nut on a bolt (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The conformation of the molecule does not change upon DNA binding, and its DNA binding site consists of two full turns of the duplex corresponding to ∼20–22 bp. One face of the DNA duplex remains mostly exposed to the solvent because it is only partially covered by the narrow handle of the heterodimer. In this way, processing enzymes may have easy access to this side of the duplex to remove damaged nucleotides or to fill gaps prior to ligation (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar).Crystallographic studies on individual proteins and on their DNA complexes have provided invaluable information on the molecular contacts that can occur within the complex (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). However, a complete understanding of the molecular basis of their function requires knowledge of their stability, specificity and mechanism of interaction, which can be achieved only through quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic studies (9Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The only information available on the Ku heterodimer is that it avidly binds to DNA ends regardless of their structure and sequence and that, after binding, slides to internal positions of the DNA molecule in an energy-independent manner (10Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol.

On the other hand, most of these studies were not performed under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, and the large discrepancy in the kd values is probably a result of the different experimental conditions and techniques used for the binding experiments. Our previous study with DNA duplexes that can accommodate two or three Ku molecules suggested that there is no cooperative interaction among the heterodimers (14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Conversely, Ma and Lieber (15Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that Ku binds a 45-bp DNA duplex in a cooperative fashion, but that the cooperativity is lost when using longer duplexes. In this work, we labeled six DNA duplexes of various lengths with a fluorescent probe and measured the binding isotherms by following the change in the anisotropy signal upon formation of the protein-DNA complex. This approach allowed accurate determinations of the dissociation constants under equilibrium conditions. The binding isotherms obtained using DNA duplexes with a Ku/DNA stoichiometry >1 were analyzed using both a conventional non-overlapping and a more elaborate overlapping binding site model. The overlapping model takes into account the possibility that, for nonspecific DNA-interacting proteins, the binding sites on the DNA lattice might overlap (16McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2709) Google Scholar). Analysis of our data with both models indicates that there is no cooperative interaction among the heterodimers that associate with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) duplexes of any length.Then we performed quantitative studies on the effect of salt on the protein-DNA association to obtain information on the number of cations and anions that are released upon formation of the complex as well as an estimate of the electrostatic component of the binding free energy (17Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Ha J.H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol.

Similar studies had not been previously performed on any protein involved in NHEJ and, more generally, in eukaryotic DNA repair. The majority of protein-nucleic acid interactions are extremely sensitive to the salt concentration in solution (9Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As a result, an assessment of the basis for the stability and specificity of ligand- or protein-DNA interactions requires quantitative studies as a function of a range of solution variables (20Overman L.B. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 456-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Misra V.K. Hecht J.L. Sharp K.A. Friedman R.A. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 264-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that electrostatic interactions play a major role in the binding of the Ku heterodimer to nucleic acids and that the number of ions released upon binding is among the highest ever reported for a protein-DNA interaction. The results presented here contribute to deepening our understanding of the mechanism of Ku binding to DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBuffers—All concentrated buffers and solutions (e.g. 5 m NaCl, 1 m Tris-HCl, etc.) were filtered through 0.22-μm Millipore filters (GP Express PLUS membrane). A small aliquot (∼50–100 ml) was first filtered and then discarded to avoid any contaminants that might be leached from the filter. The solutions to be used in the fluorescence experiments were prepared by diluting the concentrated stocks in Milli-Q water and filtered again as described above. All measurements were performed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 25 °C) and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The concentrations of NaCl, KCl, NaBr, and NaF ranged from 95 to 800 mm as indicated below.Ku Expression and Purification—Ku protein was expressed in baculovirus and purified according to the procedure described previously (14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Approximately 3–5 mg of Ku heterodimer were purified from 1.5 × 109 infected Sf9 cells. The purity was >95% as judged by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and mass spectrometry analysis. The protein concentration was determined by UV absorption measurements in 6 m guanidinium chloride and 0.02 m MES (pH 6.5) using an extinction coefficient of 88,740 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm estimated from the amino acid sequence (ProtParama; available at www.expasy.org)dsDNA Duplexes—All oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Sigma). The blunt-ended DNA duplexes were made by annealing the oligonucleotides listed in Table I with their complementary strands. The 5′-ends of the specified oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescein (Table I). The concentration of all oligonucleotides was measured by reading their absorbance at 260 nm. Comparing the concentration values measured at 495 nm (fluorescein) and 260 nm (DNA), we verified that all fluorescent oligonucleotides were >80% labeled with the fluorescein probe. The annealing of the two complementary strands was performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA by heating at 95 °C for 3 min, slowly (≈1 °C/min) decreasing the temperature to 60 °C, and waiting for 1 h at 60 °C before cooling to room temperature. For the annealing reaction, the unlabeled oligonucleotides were used in 1.1-fold excess over the labeled ones. The final concentration of the annealed templates was 5 μm, and their purity was judged to be >90% by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All duplex concentrations used in the binding experiments were appropriately corrected for percentage of fluorescently labeled template.Table IList of the blunt-ended DNA duplexes used in the experiments Open table in a new tab Steady-state Fluorescence and Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence experiments were performed with a FluoroMax-3 fluorometer (Jobin Yvon) equipped with a Glan-Thompson prism polarizer. Fluorescence was measured at a 90° angle in an L-format. Sample temperature was controlled by a Peltier cooler (Jobin Yvon F-3004). Typically, 1.5-ml samples were used in a 4-ml quartz cuvette (10 × 10 × 45 mm; Hellma). The samples were mixed by pipetting with low retention tips (Molecular Bio Products Inc.) since stirring with the magnetic bar induced protein precipitation. All binding isotherms were collected at a constant DNA concentration. Initially, a small aliquot (2–20 μl) of a highly concentrated protein solution was added to reach complete saturation of the DNA duplex. The volume in the cuvette was maintained constant throughout all titration experiments, and the protein concentration was gradually reduced by serial dilutions with a DNA solution not containing the Ku heterodimer. At each step, a volume (vD) was removed from the sample cuvette and replaced with an equal volume of solution containing the same DNA concentration. This procedure allows for measurements of titration curves at a constant macromolecule concentration. The anisotropy data were collected using an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and monitoring the emission from 517 to 523 nm. The band pass was 7 nm for excitation and 9 nm for emission. The integration time was 8 s. Typically, three to six measurements were collected and averaged for each point of the binding isotherm. Fluorescence intensity measurements were made under magic angle conditions, setting the excitation polarizer to 0° and the emission polarizer to 55° and using an integration time rate of 0.4 s/nm.Accuracy of the Anisotropy Measurements—In all our experiments, the fluorescence anisotropy signal originated from the dsDNA that we denoted as the macromolecule (M). The anisotropy change (ΔAobs) is given by Equation 1, ΔAobs=Aobs−A0=∑i(Ai−A0)αi=∑iΔAiαi (Eq. 1) where Ai is the anisotropy of the macromolecule in the i state (i.e. the anisotropy of the complex formed by i Ku molecules bound to a DNA duplex), A0 is the intrinsic anisotropy of the DNA molecule, and αi is the fraction of macromolecules in the i state. Equation 1 is valid as long as the macromolecular binding state does not affect the quantum yield of the probe attached to the macromolecule. In all our measurements, the emission spectrum of the DNA-bound fluorescein remained constant upon Ku binding to the macromolecule.We also investigated whether the experimentally determined increase in the anisotropy signal was directly proportional to the binding density for all duplexes listed in Table I. A series of binding isotherms were collected at constant macromolecule concentration following the procedure described previously (22Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The binding isotherms were collected in buffer A containing 220 mm NaCl under conditions in which their shape was dependent on the total macromolecule concentration. Data analysis confirmed the presence of a linear relationship between the anisotropy signal and the binding density (data not shown). Furthermore, evidence for the direct proportionality also came from the stoichiometry studies showing that the anisotropy signal increased linearly with the fraction of ligand bound. The existence of this linear relationship allowed fitting of the measured binding isotherms with equations of the following general form (Equation 2), Aobs←A0+ΔAmaxv(k1,k2…)n (Eq. 2) where the fitting parameters are the intrinsic anisotropy of the probe (A0), the maximum change in anisotropy (ΔAmax), the stoichiometry (n), and various numbers of binding constants (k1,k2...) that need to be considered depending on the binding model chosen.Salt-back Titrations—The 25-bp blunt-ended duplex DNA was initially titrated with the Ku heterodimer under stoichiometric conditions until an excess of protein was achieved. Small aliquots (3–20 μl) of buffer A containing a high concentration of salt (4.9 m for NaCl and NaBr and 3.4 m for KCl and KBr) were added successively. In the case of NaF, the concentration of the high salt buffer was 880 mm due to the low solubility of this salt, and salt-back titrations were performed by replacing a fixed volume (50–400 μl) of the solution in the cuvette with the high salt buffer. The concentrations of Ku and DNA were kept constant throughout the experiment. The decrease in the anisotropy signal accompanying the dissociation of the Ku-DNA complex was monitored as a function of the salt concentration. For all salts, the variation in the anisotropy signal due to the change in the salt concentration could be neglected since it was <10% of the total anisotropy change registered upon Ku binding. The validity of the method was confirmed by the fact that the kd values obtained from salt-back titrations agreed perfectly with those determined from independent titrations performed at a constant salt concentration with various amounts of ligand.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Band shift assays were performed by incubating the purified Ku protein (1.74 μm) with γ-32P-end-labeled dsDNA duplexes (0.4 nm) of various lengths (25, 42, and 75 bp) in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100–275 mm KCl. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 2.5 μl of gel loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol) were added, and the reaction products were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run at 130 V and 4 °C in Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Labeled DNA fragments were detected on the dried gel by autoradiography (Instant Imager, Packard Instrument Co.).RESULTSIn a previous study, we measured the binding isotherms for the interaction of Ku with nucleic acids following the change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the Ku molecule upon DNA binding (14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The maximum variation was 15%, a value that is sufficient (although not ideal) to precisely determine the equilibrium dissociation constant. In this work, accurate binding isotherms were collected on the basis that Ku binding to DNA resulted in an increase in the molecular volume, leading to a decrease in the rotational correlation time as well as an increase in fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled dsDNA molecules. The change in fluorescence anisotropy of the DNA duplex was the common theme throughout this work. It is worth noting that the fluorescence intensity of the DNA-linked fluorescein moiety did not change significantly upon Ku binding (data not shown). This observation indicated that variation in anisotropy should be exclusively related to changes in the DNA rotational correlation time induced by the binding of Ku. For this study, only one strand of all blunt-ended dsDNA molecules was labeled at the 5′-end with the fluorescein probe (Table I). The fluorescein probe induced a negligible perturbation on the Ku-DNA interaction since similar binding affinities were measured when both ends of the DNA molecule were fluorescently labeled (data not shown). This result is in agreement with the previous observation that the affinity of Ku for DNA ends is not affected by the particular structure of the ends, whether they are blunt, with 5′- or 3′-overhangs, or even with hairpin loops (10Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Determination of the Active Fraction—The active fraction of the titrant affects the binding isotherms and the derived parameters. Thus, we first determined the active fraction of the recombinant Ku heterodimer purified from insect cells (Fig. 1). This was accomplished by titrating Ku into a solution of 20- or 25-bp dsDNA under conditions in which the DNA concentrations were much greater (>10-fold) than the kd. The crystallographic data and our previous dynamic light scattering studies clearly indicate that these two duplexes accommodate only one Ku molecule (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The “stoichiometric conditions” were easily achieved using DNA concentrations in the nanomolar range and salt concentrations <150 mm. Under these conditions, all added Ku molecules bound the DNA template up to the point where all available binding sites were saturated and the anisotropy signal reached a plateau. We found that the active fraction was ∼70 ± 3% for most Ku preparations, with only few exceptions, where the active fraction was ∼40–50%. It is important to note that this determination was fairly robust in view of the fact that almost identical results were obtained upon changing either the length or concentration of the duplex or changing the salt conditions (KCl or NaCl from 50 to 125 mm). Furthermore, the non-active protein fraction did not compromise our studies. In fact, for a given DNA fragment, we obtained the same binding energy using various protein preparations containing different active fractions.Fig. 1Determination of the active fraction of recombinant Ku. Shown is a plot of the anisotropy changes versus the ratio of [Ku]total to [DNA]total. ○ and •, data obtained with the 20- and 25-bp duplexes (s20 and s25), respectively. Both DNA molecules were at 5 nm (>>kd). The experiments were performed in buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, and the temperature was set at 25 °C. The solid lines are the linear fit of proper portion of the data set. The active fraction is derived from the value of the crossing point of the two straight lines (1/1.490 = 0.671 × 100 = 67.1%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ku/DNA Stoichiometry—The stoichiometry of Ku for a series of blunt-ended DNA duplexes of different lengths was measured following a procedure similar to that adopted for determination of the active fraction. The DNA concentrations ranged from 5 to 20 nm, and the salt concentration was kept at 100 mm (Fig. 2a). All stoichiometry values were determined at two to three different DNA concentrations, and Table II reports the average values for the whole series of DNA templates. Bluntended DNA duplexes of 42 and 50 bp could accommodate two Ku heterodimers, whereas the 75-bp duplex was capable of binding three molecules. We also designed a DNA molecule of 60 bp with a gap of 20 nucleotides in the middle that could bind two heterodimers. By dividing the number of Ku molecules bound to each DNA duplex by the number of base pairs of the duplex, we estimated that Ku heterodimers cover ∼22–25 bp when bound to DNA. For some of the duplexes, the stoichiometry values were also confirmed by band shift assays performed at various salt concentrations (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2Stoichiometry determination for the s42 and s50 duplexes.a, plot of the anisotropy changes versus the ratio of active Ku to total DNA concentration.

To simplify the analysis of the binding isotherms, we performed our measurements at 300 mm NaCl. Under these conditions, the total ligand (Ku) concentration was almost equal to the free ligand concentration (xfree ≈ xT), and the binding isotherms were independent of the total macromolecule concentration. The equilibrium dissociation constants were determined at this salt concentration for all duplexes listed in Table I. DNA molecules with a Ku/DNA stoichiometry of 2:1 (s42 and s50) were selected to investigate the eventual presence of cooperativity between the Ku heterodimers binding to the same DNA molecule (Fig. 3). Analysis of the binding isotherms clearly demonstrated the lack of cooperative interaction between Ku heterodimers. The data were first fitted with the Adair equation for a macromolecule with two binding sites (Equation 3), v=2k1x+2k1k2x21+2k1x+k1k2x2 (Eq. 3) where k1 and k2 are the two sequential microscopic association constants that, in our case, turned out to be identical. In fact, analogous results were obtained by fitting the data with a simple equation that considers the presence of “two” independent and identical (DSB) binding sites on the macromolecule (Equation 4), v=2kx1+kx=2xkd+x (Eq. 4) where kd is the microscopic dissociation constant for the single DSB. The kd values for the binding of Ku to s50 and s42 were 32 ± 2 and 81 ± 3 nm, respectively. A more accurate estimate of kd was obtained taking into account that, under our experimental conditions, the free ligand concentration (x) was still slightly dependent on the total macromolecule concentration (MT) and could be more precisely determined using Equations 5 and 6. x=xT−vMT (Eq. 5) x=−12(kd+2MT−xT)+12(kd+2MT−xT)2+4kdxT (Eq. 6) The new fit of the data resulted in kd = 24 ± 1 nm for the s50 duplex and kd = 72 ± 3 nm for the s42 duplex (Table III). The same analysis was performed for the ss60 molecule containing a 20-nucleotide gap in the middle, yielding kd = 21 ± 1 nm.Fig. 3Binding isotherms for the s42 and s50 duplexes. The experiments were performed in buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl at 25 °C. The DNA concentrations were 5 nm for s42 (○) and 5 nm for s50 (•). The same experiments were also repeated using a DNA concentration of 10 nm. For data analysis, the free ligand concentration (xfree) was derived from Equation 6. The binding curves were fitted with Equation 4 and yielded kd values of 72 ± 3nm (s42) and 24 ± 1nm (s50). The same analysis performed assuming xfree = xT produced binding curves that were basically superimposable on the previous ones.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIIValues of the microscopic dissociation constants (kd) measured for all DNA duplexes in buffer A containing 300 mm Na"

We previously showed that the concentration and enrichment of [13C]acetate decrease markedly across the dog liver because of the simultaneous uptake and production of acetate. To test for zonation of the enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA, conscious dogs, prefitted with transhepatic catheters, were infused with glucose and [1,2-13C2]acetate in a branch of the portal vein. Analyses of MIDs of fatty acids and sterols isolated from liver, bile, and plasma very low density lipoprotein by a variant of ISA designed to detect gradients in precursor enrichment revealed marked zonation of enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA.

The fractional synthesis rate of polymers can be determined by the mass isotopomer distribution (MID) 1The abbreviations used are: MID, mass isotopomer distribution; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; ISA, isotopomer spectral analysis; MIDA, mass isotopomer distribution analysis; MPE, molar percent enrichment; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. of the polymer following synthesis in the presence of a 13C-labeled precursor. Mass isotopomer 2Mass isotopomers are designated as M, M1, M2... Mi, where i is the number of mass units above that of the unlabeled isotopomers M. The subscripted notations M1,M2,... Mi are the intensities of the mass spectrometric signals of the corresponding isotopomers. distribution analysis (MIDA) was proposed as a method for estimating the fractional synthetic rate of fatty acids and cholesterol synthesized in vivo and in vitro in the presence of [13C]acetate (1Hellerstein M.K. Kletke C. Kaempfer S. Wu K. Shackleton C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E479-E486PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J.

MIDA uses the enrichment of two mass isotopomers to calculate precursor enrichment and fractional synthesis. Another approach, isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) was presented by Kelleher and Masterson (4Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs. 5Brunengraber H. Kelleher J.K. Des Rosiers C. Annu. Rev.

Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E373-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provide estimates of the precursor enrichment and the fractional synthesis rate. MIDA (2Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E988-E1001PubMed Google Scholar), the other two-isotopomer method presented by Chinkes et al. (7Chinkes D.L. Aarsland A. Rosenblatt J. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E373-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the basic form of ISA (4Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar) yield a single value for the enrichment of the acetyl-CoA monomeric precursor. It is therefore assumed that the precursor enrichment is constant in all cells that synthesize the polymer. When the enrichment of the precursor is not constant, models using single values for precursor enrichment cannot provide a measure of this variation in precursor enrichment and may incorrectly estimate fractional synthesis. The reason for this is that the equations of the models are not linear in terms of precursor enrichment. Thus, models based on average values for acetate enrichment cannot be guaranteed to provide the best estimates of the parameters. (For a detailed discussion, see Ref. 5Brunengraber H. Kelleher J.K. Des Rosiers C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 559-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar.) In contrast, the equations of the models are linear in terms of fractional synthesis and thus variations in fractional synthesis are correctly estimated as the average value. In this work, we modified the equations of ISA to allow for variations in precursor enrichment, and tested the hypothesis that gradients of lipogenic [13C]acetyl-CoA occur in vivo. In a previous study, we found that, in dogs infused with [1,2-13C2]acetate in a peripheral vein, the concentration and enrichment of acetate decrease 3- and 7-fold, respectively, as blood passes through the liver (8Puchowicz M.A. Bederman I.R. Comte B. Yang D. David F. Stone E. Jabbour K. Wasserman D.H. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1022-E1027PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that the enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA also decreases across the liver lobule. The goal of the project reported here was to probe the homogeneity of the acetyl-CoA labeling by the ISA analyses of polymeric compounds derived from acetyl-CoA, i.e. fatty acids (myristate and palmitate) and sterols (lathosterol and cholesterol). Because ISA requires computations of the abundances of multiple mass isotopomers, conditions were chosen to ensure fairly high labeling of lipogenic acetyl-CoA. Two animal models were used: (i) conscious dogs infused with [1,2-13C2]acetate in a branch of the portal vein and (ii) livers, isolated from rats fed either a control diet or a triacetin-enriched diet, perfused with 10 mm [1,2-13C2]acetate. The second model was used as a control where the enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA was expected to be nearly constant across the liver because of the high concentration of [1,2-13C2]acetate in the portal vein. When we unexpectedly found evidence of zonation of labeling of acetyl-CoA despite the 10 mm [1,2-13C2]acetate concentration, we attempted to abolish this zonation by using livers isolated from rats fed a diet containing triacetin, the triglyceride of acetate. ISA was used to evaluate the hypothesis that gradients of lipogenic acetyl-CoA enrichment better characterize the observed isotopomer data for these models. Our data show a marked decrease in the enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA across the liver of conscious dogs. Unexpectedly, similar zonation of enrichment of acetyl-CoA occurs in rat livers perfused with a high concentration of [1,2-13C2]acetate. The data of all experiments indicated that the fractional synthetic rates calculated from the MIDs of lipids were underestimated to an unknown degree. This is why this study was complemented by an in vitro modeling of fatty acid synthesis under conditions simulating the zonation of the enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA in liver (see companion report (9Bederman I.R.

Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pentafluorobenzyl bromide was from Pierce. Sodium [1,2-13C2]acetate, [U-13C3]malonic acid, and sodium [1-13C,2H3]acetate (99%) were from Isotec. Live Dog Experiments—Mongrel dogs (18-26 kg) of either gender, that had been fed a standard diet (Kal Kan beef dinner, Vernon, CA and Wayne Lab Blox: 51% carbohydrate, 31% protein, 11% fat, and 7% fiber based on dry weight, Allied Mills, Inc., Chicago, IL), were studied. The dogs were housed in a facility that met Association for Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines, and the protocols were approved by Vanderbilt University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Subcommittee. The Silastic catheters were installed for infusion of labeled acetate and for blood sampling across the liver as described previously (8Puchowicz M.A. Bederman I.R. Comte B. Yang D. David F. Stone E. Jabbour K. Wasserman D.H. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1022-E1027PubMed Google Scholar). At least 16 days before each experiment, a laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia (0.04 mg·kg-1 of atropine and 15 mg·kg-1 pentothal sodium presurgery, and 1.0% isofluorane inhalation anesthetic during surgery). Silastic catheters (0.03-inch inner diameter) were inserted into the vena cava for infusions. Silastic catheters (0.04-inch inner diameter) were inserted into the portal vein and left common hepatic vein for blood sampling (10Keller U. Cherrington A.D. Liljenquist J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E238-E247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gallbladder was removed, and a catheter placed in the common bile duct to allow sampling of primitive bile. Incisions were also made in the neck region for the placement of a sampling catheter in the carotid artery. The carotid artery was isolated, and a Silastic catheter (0.04-inch inner diameter) was inserted so that its tip rested in the aortic arch. After insertion, the catheters were filled with saline containing heparin (200 U·ml-1, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and their free ends were knotted. Ultrasonic flow probes (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY) were used to measure portal vein and hepatic artery blood flows. Briefly, a small section of the portal vein, upstream from its junction with the gastroduodenal vein, was cleared of tissue, and a 7.0-mm inner diameter flow cuff was placed around the vessel and secured. The gastroduodenal vein was isolated and then ligated proximal to its confluence with the portal vein. A section of the main hepatic artery lying proximal to the portal vein was isolated, and a 3.0-mm inner diameter flow cuff was placed around the vessel and secured. The Doppler probe leads and the knotted free catheter ends, with the exception of the carotid artery, were stored in a subcutaneous pocket in the abdominal region so that complete closure of the skin incision was possible. The free end of the carotid artery catheter was stored under the skin of the neck. On the day of the experiment, the subcutaneous ends of the catheters were fed through small skin incisions made under local anesthesia (2% lidocaine, Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Worcester, MA) over the subcutaneous pockets in which catheters were stored. The contents of each catheter were aspirated, and catheters were flushed with saline. Silastic tubes were connected to the exposed catheters and brought to the back of the dog where they were secured with quick-drying glue. Saline was infused in the arterial catheter throughout the experiments (0.1 ml/min). Indocyanine green (Hynson, Westcott, and Dunning, Baltimore, MD) was infused at a rate of 0.1 mg·min-1·m-1 to (i) set an independent back-up measurement of hepatic blood flow measured using flow probes and (ii) confirm hepatic vein catheter placement. Blood flowing through the portal vein and hepatic artery was continuously monitored via the flow probes. From 0 to 6 h, the dogs were infused intravenously with glucose at variable rates (0.034-0.24 mmol min-1·kg-1) to set up and maintain a stable plasma glucose concentration of 10 mm. Also, from 0.5 to 6 h, 99% enriched [1,2-13C2]acetate was infused in a small branch of the portal vein at the rate of 7.5 μmol·min-1·kg-1 as a 150 mm solution. Blood was sampled from the carotid artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein at regular intervals, treated with heparin, centrifuged, and plasma frozen until analysis. Care was taken to withdraw hepatic vein blood very slowly to prevent contaminating the sample with blood drawn from the inferior vena cava (11Irtun O. Martini W.Z. Ozkan O. Wolfe R.R. Metabolism. 2001; 50: 189-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Perfused Rat Liver Experiments—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given access to Purina chow from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. for 3 weeks. When used as liver donors, the rats weighed 225-255 g before their daily meal. Surgery for removal of the liver was started around 11:30 a.m., which is at the time of highest hepatic lipogenesis in rats on this feeding schedule (12Brunengraber H. Weinstock S.B. Story D.L. Kopito R.R. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 916-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The surgical procedure (including bile duct cannulation) and perfusion apparatus were as described previously (13Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2656-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Livers were perfused with 150 ml of recirculating Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 4% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid poor, Miles Biochemicals), 15 mm glucose, and 10 mm [1,2-13C2]acetate. Throughout the 2-h experiment, [1,2-13C2]acetate (450 μmol/h) and sodium taurocholate (38 μmol/h) were infused into the perfusion reservoir to keep constant acetate concentration and enrichment, and to stimulate bile flow, respectively (14Robins S.J. Brunengraber H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 604-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of bile and perfusate were collected at regular intervals. At the end of the experiment, the liver was quick-frozen with aluminum tongs prechilled in liquid nitrogen. An identical protocol was used to perfuse livers from rats fed a special diet enriched in triacetin, in an attempt at abolishing the zonation of labeling of acetyl-CoA from [1,2-13C2]acetate. The diet composition in percentage of total calories was: sucrose (25%), starch (25%), triacetin (30%), casein (15%), and corn oil (5%). The diet also contained adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals, and cellulose (12% of weight). In a control diet without triacetin, sucrose and starch each contributed 40% of the calories. The mixtures of dry ingredients were made into thick pastes with a solution of agar (13Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2656-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analytical Procedures—One set of dog plasma samples (0.25 ml) was spiked with 50 nmol of [1-13C,2H3]acetate internal standard. The concentration of plasma acetate was determined by GC-MS of the 2,4-difluoroaniline derivative (15Powers L. Osborn M.K. Kien C.L. Murray R.D. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 747-754Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A second set of plasma samples without internal standards was used to assay the MPE of acetate. In isolated liver perfusate containing high concentrations of acetate (10 mm), the acetate concentration was assayed enzymatically on a Cobas Fara centrifuge analyzer. Glucose was assayed enzymatically. Samples of fresh dog plasma were ultracentrifuged to isolate the VLDL-triacylglycerol fraction. This fraction as well as liver and bile samples were processed by the Folsh protocol, i.e. chloroform-methanol extraction followed by water washing. After evaporation of the chloroform phase, the residue was treated with 1 m KOH in 80% ethanol for 30 min at 90 °C to hydrolyze the saponifiable lipids. The cooled alkaline solution was vortexed with 3 × 4 ml of petroleum ether to extract non-saponifiable lipids (cholesterol and lathosterol). The aqueous phase was acidified with HCl and vortexed with 3 × 4 ml of isooctane to extract fatty acids. Samples of liver and bile were similarly extracted. The extract of non-saponifiable lipids was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 0.2 ml of toluene and reacted with 20 μl/ml pyridine plus 5 μl of pentafluorobenzoyl chloride (16Ostlund Jr., R.E. Hsu F.F. Bosner M.S. Stenson W.F. Hachey D.L. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After vortexing and 15-min incubation at room temperature, the white pyridinium chloride precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of water, and the solution was extracted with 3 × 3 ml of petroleum ether. After evaporation of the extract, the residue was dissolved in 150 μl of toluene, and 1 μl was injected into the GC-MS. The fatty acid extract was evaporated, and the residue was reacted with 50 μl of a solution containing 3.5 μl of pentafluorobenzyl bromide plus 10 μl of pyridine plus 37.5 μl of acetonitrile. After 2-h incubation at 40 °C and complete evaporation, the residue was suspended in 1 ml of water, which was then acidified with 1 n HCl to pH 1.0, and saturated with NaCl before three extractions with 4 ml of hexane. After evaporation of the extract, the residue was dissolved in 150 μl of hexane, and 1 μl was injected into the GC-MS. GC-MS analyses were run on a Hewlett-Packard MS-Engine equipped with a 30-m HP-1 capillary column. For cholesterol and lathosterol analyses: injector at 290 °C, start at 220 °C, hold 1 min at 220 °C, ramp 20 °C/min to 300 °C, hold 10 min at 300 °C, ramp 10 °C/min to 320 °C, then hold 9 min. The transfer line was held at 320 °C, and source was held at 200 °C (ammonia-negative chemical ionization). Cholesterol elutes at 13.5 min and lathosterol at 14.6 min. For both compounds, ions were monitored from m/z 580 to 607, and the dwell time was 10 ms. Because the abundance of lathosterol is much lower than that of cholesterol in the biological samples, the MIDs of the two analytes were determined separately by injecting the sample in splitless versus 20:1 split mode for lathosterol and cholesterol, respectively. The following procedures were carried out for fatty acid analysis: an HP-5 50-m capillary column was used, injector at 250 °C, start at 100 °C, hold for 1 min at 100 °C, ramp 20 °C/min to 280 °C, and hold for 3 min at 280 °C, ramp 10 °C/min to 300 °C, then hold for 6 min. The transfer line was held at 300 °C, and the source was at 200 °C (ammonia-negative chemical ionization). Myristate elutes at 16 min (ions at m/z 227-241, and the dwell time is 25 ms) and palmitate at 18 min (ions at m/z 255-271, with dwell time of 25 ms). Note that the pentafluorobenzyl group splits off in the ion source, so the ions monitored are the underivatized acyl groups. In all cases, GC-MS analyses were conducted with double or triple injections, and the data are averaged for each sample. In selected perfusate and tissue samples from perfused rat livers, we assayed the MIDs of lactate. Calculations—In live dog experiments, the concentration and enrichment of acetate in the mixed blood entering the liver were calculated (8Puchowicz M.A. Bederman I.R. Comte B. Yang D. David F. Stone E. Jabbour K. Wasserman D.H. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1022-E1027PubMed Google Scholar) using Equations 1 and 2, in which PV and HA represent the portal vein and the hepatic artery, respectively. Blood flows are expressed in ml·min-1·kg-1. [Acetate]mixed={(HA flow)[acetate]art+(PV flow)[acetate]pv}/{(HA flow)+(PV flow)} (Eq. 1) MPEmixed={(HA flow)[acetate]art·MPEart+(PV flow)[acetate]pv·MPEpv}/(PV+HA flow)[acetate]mixed (Eq. 2) Note that the numerator of Equation 1 represents the nanomoles of total acetate (unlabeled plus labeled) that enter the liver per minute. The numerator of Equation 2 represents the nanomoles of labeled acetate that enter the liver per minute. The denominator of Equation 2 represents the nanomoles of total acetate (unlabeled plus labeled) that exit the liver per minute. ISA Model and Two Isotopomer Calculations—Calculations of the parameters of fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis (precursor enrichment and fractional synthesis) were conducted using two models: (i) isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) (4Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kelleher J.K. Kharroubi A.T. Aldaghlas T.A. Shambat I.B. Kennedy K.A. Holleran A.L. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E384-E395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) the two-isotopomer method, an algebraic method similar to that described by Chinkes (7Chinkes D.L. Aarsland A. Rosenblatt J. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E373-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ISA uses fractional abundance of observed isotopomers as the input and requires estimates of all isotopomers of a product. Like all forms of regression, ISA finds the best fit solution when there are more equations than unknowns. ISA uses weighted non-linear least squares regression to find the best fit of the model to the entire experimental mass isotopomer spectrum. Usually ISA models seek the best fit solution using a set of equations with two unknowns, the precursor enrichment, D, and the fractional synthesis g(time). However, a more complicated model, with additional parameters, may be used when a larger number of mass isotopomers of the product lipid are generated. The additional mass isotopomers allow for a statistical test of whether the more complicated model is justified. The studies reported here were designed to produce a highly 13C-enriched lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool. This generated a large number of labeled mass isotopomers of each lipid. Each mass isotopomer detected is associated with a unique equation in the ISA model. Thus this experimental approach, producing a large number of isotopomers of each compound, allows for testing two specific ISA models. The traditional ISA model (“single D model”) with a constant value for precursor enrichment was compared with a “gradient D model” where the precursor enrichment varied linearly between two values Dmax and Dmin (Fig. 1). Although the single D model contained two unknowns, D and g(t), the more complicated gradient D model contained three unknown parameters, Dmax, Dmin, and g(t). A more detailed description of the gradient ISA model is presented in the accompanying report (9Bederman I.R. Kasumov T. Reszko A.E. David F. Brunengraber H. Kelleher J.K. J. Biol.

To decide whether the gradient D model provided a better description of the data, we used an F test to compare the two models following a stepwise regression procedure. The more complicated model is justified as a better description if it reduces the residual sum of squares sufficiently (18Glantz S.A. Slinker B.K. Primer of Applied Regression and Analysis of Variance. McGraw-Hill, New York1990Google Scholar). Adding a parameter to any model with a residual error will likely reduce the error slightly. The F test requires a larger reduction in the sum of squares to indicate that the model containing the additional parameter truly provides a better description of the data. The sum of squares was used to support the hypothesis that the biosynthesis occurred under conditions where there was a gradient in precursor enrichment (see accompanying report (9Bederman I.R.

ISA models were compared to a “two-isotopomer” method for estimating the two parameters, precursor enrichment (p) and fractional synthesis (f). The two-isotopomer method uses fractional abundances and probability-based equations for only two isotopomers to solve for the two parameters. The two-isotopomer method used here requires that all isotopomers of a product are monitored and is described in more detail in the accompanying report. Equations 3 and 4 yield the enrichment of acetyl-CoA (p) and the fractional synthesis of the fatty acid analyzed (f).

https://openalex.org/W2103951463,"Rapid endocytosis and recycling of surface proteins are important processes common to most nucleated eukaryotic cells. The best characterized membrane recycling routes are mediated by the small GTPases Rab4 and Rab11, but the precise roles that these pathways play have not been fully elucidated. The protozoan Trypanosoma brucei has a highly developed endocytic system that is similar to that found in metazoans, albeit with an accelerated rate of membrane turnover. We have used this organism to investigate the function of the trypanosome orthologue of Rab4 (TbRAB4) by a combination of RNA interference, microscopy, and quantitative trafficking assays. RNA interference-mediated suppression of TbRAB4 expression inhibited the growth of trypanosomes without affecting receptor-mediated endocytosis or ligand recycling. Ultrastructural analysis indicated a major defect in membrane transport events. The accumulation of fluorescent dextran, a fluid-phase marker, was blocked in cells lacking TbRAB4 protein. Since most fluid-phase markers are transported to the lysosome in T. brucei, the effects of TbRAB4 RNA interference on lysosomal function were investigated. By immunofluorescence, the major lysosomal protein p67 became progressively dispersed in cells lacking the TbRAB4 protein. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that initial proteolytic cleavage and glycan processing of p67 were unaffected but that cells failed to accumulate the later p67 proteolyzed products associated with the lysosome. To confirm the role of TbRAB4 in lysosomal trafficking, a constitutively active mutant, TbRAB4QL, was expressed. TbRAB4QL was closely associated with an enlarged multivesicular body that contained p67. In addition, cells expressing TbRAB4QL showed increased fluid-phase uptake when compared with the parental line. Taken together, these data suggest that TbRAB4 is involved in regulation of fluid-phase traffic to the lysosome in T. brucei but not in receptor-mediated endocytosis or recycling.

These data have implications for the role of Rab4 in other cell systems. Endocytic and recycling pathways mediate many processes including nutrient uptake, membrane homeostasis, receptor repair mechanisms, and signal transduction (1Maxfield F.R. McGraw E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Several recycling routes have been described in higher eukaryotes, but the best understood of these are the Rab4- and Rab11-dependent recycling pathways. Rab family proteins are a subgroup of the Ras family small GTPases that specialize in regulation of membrane trafficking (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). Mammalian Rab4 is implicated in recycling of many surface proteins including transferrin receptor, G-protein-coupled receptors, integrins, and surfactant protein A (3van der Sluijs P. Hull M.

Rab4 also controls Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in platelets and insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 from internal vesicles to the cell surface (12Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H.

Hall B.S. Denny P.W. Carrington M. Field M.C. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 491-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane of T. brucei is dominated by 1 × 107 copies of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; BSF, bloodstream form; BiP, binding protein; Con A, Canavila ensiformis lectin concanavalin A; DAPI, 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenyindole; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; BSF, bloodstream form; BiP, binding protein; Con A, Canavila ensiformis lectin concanavalin A; DAPI, 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenyindole; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type. which are attached to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. VSG constitutes ∼90% of surface protein and is subject to continuous turnover (16Morgan G.W. Hall B.S. Denny P.W. Carrington M. Field M.C. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 491-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Grünfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Morgan G.M. Field M.C.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). T. brucei exhibits one of the fastest known rates of endocytosis and recycling despite all import and export being limited to the flagellar pocket, an invagination at the posterior of the cell where the flagellum enters the cytoplasm, representing ∼5% of the total plasma membrane (19Landfear S.M. Ignatushchenko M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This high rate of endocytic activity may be important in removal of surface immune effectors including antibodies (20Pal A. Hall B. Jeffries T. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but inhibition of endocytosis is rapidly lethal even in the absence of immune effectors, suggesting an essential role in membrane homeostasis (21Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4991-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Perez-Morga D. Gijon P. Dilbeck V. Pays E. Nolan D.

Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar).The intracellular routes taken by internalized cargo in trypanosomes have been partially resolved. VSG is endocytosed into class I clathrin-coated vesicles and transported to a tubular endosome network, along with fluid-phase cargo (17Grünfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Morgan G.M. Field M.C. Overath P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2029-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The latter exits the endosome via a second clathrin-dependent step mediated by class II clathrin-coated vesicles and is transported to the lysosome (18Engstler M. Thilo L. Weise F. Grunfelder C. Schwarz H. Boshart M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The majority of VSG is recycled directly back to the surface, but a portion is transported to the late endosome before recycling, apparently without entering the lysosome. The transferrin receptor takes a similar route to VSG (24Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but kinetic analysis indicates differences in the intracellular transport of these two molecules (20Pal A. Hall B. Jeffries T. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transferrin is efficiently degraded within the trypanosome and was originally reported to be transported to the lysosome (25Steverding D. Stierhof Y.D. Fuchs H. Tauber R. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More recent data suggest that the majority of transferrin is recycled, albeit extensively degraded (20Pal A. Hall B. Jeffries T. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of an extensive proteolysis system within the trypanosome recycling system.Trypanosome orthologues of Rab proteins controlling endocytosis and recycling pathways are present in the genome (26Ackers J.P. Dhir V. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Two TbRAB5 homologues, TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B, have been characterized in some detail and are required for early endocytosis (23Hall B. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 27Field H. Farjah M. Pal A. Gull K. Field M.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9529-9539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, TbRAB5A is associated with internalized glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins such as VSG and ESAG6/7, but TbRAB5B colocalizes with the invariant transmembrane protein ISG100, suggesting the presence of at least two distinct endocytic pathways (28Pal A. Hall B.S. Nesbeth D.N. Field H.I. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9529-9539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both appear to have a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and RNAi of either isoform blocks endocytosis (23Hall B. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Further, all available evidence suggests that the Rab11 homologue, TbRAB11, is responsible for recycling of VSG and the transferrin receptor, as well as recycling of degraded transferrin and antibodies (17Grünfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Morgan G.M. Field M.C. Overath P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2029-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Engstler M. Thilo L. Weise F.

The roles of the two TbRAB5 isoforms and TbRAB11 are therefore comparable with their mammalian orthologues.Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that TbRAB4, the T. brucei orthologue of mammalian Rab4, is a constitutively expressed protein located at the endocytic pathway (27Field H. Farjah M. Pal A. Gull K. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32102-32110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but analysis of cells expressing mutant forms of TbRAB4 has been unable to ascribe a clear function in either endocytosis or recycling (20Pal A. Hall B. Jeffries T. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we have examined TbRAB4 function using RNA interference and demonstrate that this GTPase has a highly specialized role in transport of fluid-phase cargo toward the lysosome in trypanosomes.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—The bloodstream form trypanosome (BSF) lines T. brucei Lister 427 and BSF 90-13 were maintained in HMI 9 medium supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear). BSF 90-13 cells were cultured in the continuous presence of 5 μg ml-1 hygromycin B (Sigma) and 2.5 μg ml-1 Geneticin (Sigma) to maintain the T7-responsive phenotype. For growth curves, triplicate cultures were initiated at 5 × 104 cells ml-1, and BSF cell numbers were determined using a Z2 Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter).Recombinant DNA Manipulations and Transfection—TbRAB4WT was amplified from cDNA using the primers 5′-CGGAAAGCTTCACCATGTCAGAGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGGATCCAATACCTAACAAGC-3′. Underlined bases represent HindIII and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The TbRAB4QL mutant was prepared using the primers 5′-CCGGTCTAGAAAGATACAAATCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGATTTGTATCTTTCTAGACCGGC-3′. PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into pXS519 vector (28Pal A. Hall B.S. Nesbeth D.N. Field H.I. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9529-9539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For RNAi experiments, the entire TbRAB4 open reading frame was excised from pSX519·TbRAB4WT using BamHI and HindIII and inserted into p2T7Ti (29LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The pXS519·TbRAB4QL construct was transfected by electroporation into Lister 427 strain BSF, and transfectants were selected using 2.5 μg ml-1 Geneticin (Sigma), whereas p2T7Ti·TbRAB4 was introduced into the tetracycline-responsive line, BSF 90-13, and cells were cultured for 6 h before the addition of 2.5 μg ml-1 phleomycin (Sigma). After 7 days of culture in the presence of selective drug, cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were maintained thereafter in the presence of phleomycin or Geneticin.Antibodies—The TbRAB4 open reading frame was amplified with the primers 5′-CGGAGGATCCCAACCATGTCAGAGAGATATC-3′ and 5′-GTGGAATTCAAATACCTAACAAGCACACG-3′. The product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI (underlined) and inserted into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal murine and rabbit antibodies were raised against affinity-purified TbRAB4-GST fusion protein using RIBI (Sigma) as adjuvant (at least four immunizations spaced over a period of 4 months). Antibodies were affinity-purified on CNBr-Sepharose-immobilized TbRAB4-GST. Anti-TbRAB11 antibodies have been described elsewhere (24Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-BiP antibodies and monoclonal anti-p67 antibody mAb280 were a kind gift from J. Bangs (30Kelley R.J. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled. Lysates were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels at 1 × 107 cell equivalents/lane. After separation, proteins were transferred onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with PBS, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of affinity-purified rabbit anti-TbRAB4 or rabbit anti-TbRAB11 at a concentration of ∼1 μg ml-1 in blocking buffer (24Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 1 h. Bound antibody was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. To ensure equality of loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibody to TbBiP (31Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where appropriate, signal intensity was quantified using NIH Image software.Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, adhered to poly-l-lysine slides (Sigma), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS. For staining of TbRAB4, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified rabbit or mouse anti-TbRAB4 antibodies at 1 μg ml-1 in blocking buffer containing 0.02% sodium azide. All other primary antibody incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Cells were examined under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and images were captured using a Photometrix Coolsnap-FX camera controlled with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) and assembled in PhotoShop 7.0.1 (Adobe Inc.).Electron Microscopy—For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed in suspension by adding chilled 5% glutaraldehyde and 8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS in a 1:1 ratio to the growth medium containing trypanosomes. Cells were fixed on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min in 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and the supernatant was carefully replaced with fresh fixative for a further 50 min without disturbing the pellet, rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing in buffer, cells were then dehydrated in an ethanol series, adding 1% uranyl acetate at the 30% stage, followed by propylene oxide, and then embedded in Epon/Araldite 502 and finally polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut-T ultramicrotome at 70 nm using a diamond knife, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope.Transferrin Endocytosis and Recycling—Bovine holo-transferrin (Sigma) was iodinated using IodoBeads reagent (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were carried out as described in Ref. 28Pal A. Hall B.S. Nesbeth D.N. Field H.I. Field M.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, expression of double-stranded RNA corresponding to TbRAB4 in p2T7Ti·TbRAB4 cells was induced for 24 h with 1 μg ml-1 tetracycline, whereas parental and TbRAB4QL cells were harvested in mid-log phase. Cells were washed twice with serum-free HMI 9 containing 1% BSA (Sigma) (SF/HMI 9). Washed cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min at a concentration of 1 - 2 × 107 cells ml-1, and then 125I-labeled transferrin was added (typically ∼2 μg at a specific activity of 3 × 106 cpm μg-1). Triplicate 500-μl samples of cells were incubated at 4 or 37 °C for various times. Nonspecific binding controls included cold transferrin at a concentration of 600 μg ml-1. Accumulation was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of cold SF/HMI9 containing 600 μg ml-1 transferrin. Cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, 0.05% BSA and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. The accumulation of 125I was measured in a γ-counter (Beckman Coulter). For recycling of transferrin degradative products, cells were pulsed for 40 min with transferrin and washed in PBS/BSA as described above and then resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells ml-1 in complete HMI9. Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37° or 4 °C and then centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Radioactivity in supernatants and pellets was determined as described.Endocytosis of Concanavalin A (Con A)—Mid-log phase cells were harvested and washed once in serum-free HMI 9 medium containing 1% BSA. Cells were resuspended in HMI 9 + BSA at a concentration of 1 × 107 ml-1 and incubated at 4 or 37 °C for 20 min. Biotinylated Con A (100 μg ml-1) (Vectalabs) was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 30 min. Uptake was stopped by placing the cells on ice. Labeled cells were washed in HMI 9 + BSA at 4 °C and then fixed and adhered to slides as described above. Slides were either mounted immediately or counterstained with antibody. Biotinylated Con A was detected by incubating for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Vectalabs).Fluid-phase Uptake—Cells were induced for 24 h with tetracycline or harvested directly from mid-log phase cultures and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 108 ml-1 in 50-μl aliquots of fresh complete medium. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled dextran 10000 (Molecular Probes) was added to a concentration of 5 mg ml-1. Cells were incubated for various times, and accumulation was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of cold medium. Cells were washed and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h before mounting onto poly-l-lysine slides (Sigma). Fluorescence was quantified using Metamorph imaging software.Pulse-chase Analysis of p67 Processing—Processing of p67 was followed as described in Ref. 32Alexander D.L. Schwartz K.J. Balber A.E. Bangs J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3253-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. p2t7Ti·TbRAB4 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 1 μg ml-1 tetracycline, harvested, and washed twice in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and then resuspended to a concentration of 2 × 107 ml-1 in 500 μl of Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. 35S-labeled Promix (Amersham Biosciences) was added at 200 μCi ml-1, and cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. A chase was initiated with the addition of 4.5 ml of complete HMI 9 medium, and 1-ml samples were withdrawn at different time points and placed on ice. Cells were washed once in PBS and then lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were precleared and then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with anti-p67 mAb280 and then incubated for a further 1 h with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of loading buffer and run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Fixed, stained gels were incubated for 1 h in En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and autoradiographed. The intensity of metabolically labeled protein bands was quantified using the NIH Image program.RESULTSTbRAB4 Is Essential in Bloodstream Form T. brucei—Previous studies on TbRAB4 function used overexpression of dominant negative and dominant positive forms of the protein (20Pal A. Hall B. Jeffries T. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These analyses resulted in no detectable phenotype with the assays available. In this study, expression of the TbRAB4 protein was suppressed by RNA interference (Fig. 1). The induction of expression of double-stranded TbRAB4 RNA with tetracycline led to a rapid decrease in TbRAB4 expression such that the protein was essentially undetectable by 48 h after induction (Fig. 1B). Suppression of TbRAB4 expression was accompanied by a significant inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with several independently generated cloned lines. TbRAB4 RNAi had no effect on cellular levels of other Rab proteins, specifically TbRAB11 (Fig. 1B) or TbRAB5A (not shown).Examination of DAPI-stained cells revealed an increase in the proportion of cells with two nuclei and two kinetoplasts, suggesting a block in cell division but not in mitosis (Fig. 1C). The effect of TbRAB4 RNAi was not as rapid or severe as that triggered by depletion of clathrin or TbRAB5A (21Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4991-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Hall B. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), but after 24 h of incubation with tetracycline, multiple abnormal cells were present in cultures (Fig. 1D). A variety of ultrastructural defects were visible by electron microscopy, the most prominent of which was the appearance of membrane invaginations, distinguishable from the flagellar pocket by the presence of subpellicular microtubules, suggesting that these structures derived from the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the enlargement of the flagellar pocket characteristic of a general inhibition of endocytosis (21Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4991-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Perez-Morga D. Gijon P. Dilbeck V. Pays E. Nolan D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Hall B. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) was only apparent in ∼5% of cells at this stage (Fig. 1D), suggesting that TbRAB4 is not directly involved in early endocytosis in T. brucei. Overall, these data suggest that a defect in membrane dynamics is associated with suppression of TbRAB4.Endocytosis and Recycling of Transferrin Are Normal, but Accumulation of a Fluid-phase Marker Is Inhibited by TbRAB4 RNAi—The uptake of iron-bound transferrin is essential to the survival of bloodstream form T. brucei (33Steverding D. Parasitol Res. 1998; 84: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Results from previous work indicated that transferrin is subject to very rapid turnover regulated by TbRAB11 but not TbRAB4 (20Pal A. Hall B. Jeffries T. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, in this study, a single round of transferrin uptake, degradation, and recycling was monitored, which may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a relatively minor role for TbRAB4. Further, expression of a dominant negative mutant GTPase as used in the earlier experiments is not equivalent to RNAi-mediated ablation of TbRAB4 expression. Therefore, the effect of TbRAB4 RNAi on bulk transferrin accumulation and recycling was examined. Cells were induced and then allowed to accumulate 125I-transferrin for 40 min. To monitor recycling, cells were then washed and returned to medium for 20 min, and 125I recovery in the supernatant was monitored. No significant effect was found for either the accumulation of 125I-transferrin or the recycling of previously internalized label into the supernatant (p > 0.10) (Fig. 2). Under the same conditions, RNAi of TbRAB5 isoforms reduces transferrin endocytosis (23Hall B. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), and TbRAB11 RNAi cau"

https://openalex.org/W2071518948,"The predominant isoform of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), GFAPα, is the characteristic building block of the cytoskeletal intermediate filaments in astrocytes. Isoform GFAPϵ, produced by alternative splicing of the GFAP gene, includes a new tail domain that confers a presenilin binding capacity. We here show that the GFAPϵ tail prevents GFAPϵ homodimerization and homomeric filament formation, whereas the ability to form heterodimers and filaments with GFAPα is retained. Furthermore, GFAPϵ shows decreased affinity for several GFAPα-interacting proteins. A GFAPϵ tail mutation that results in gain of GFAPϵ dimerization and filament formation abolishes presenilin binding. This mutation also abolishes interaction between the tail and the coiled-coil domain of GFAPϵ. Together, this indicates that direct interaction between the coiled-coil and tail domains may serve as an inhibitory mechanism for homomeric dimerization and filament formation.

We propose that the GFAPϵ isoform represents a new functionally distinct component of GFAP intermediate filaments. Intermediate filament proteins have a characteristic structure composed of a highly conserved α-helical rod domain flanked by nonhelical head and tail domains. The α-helical rod domain mediates dimerization and higher order structures during filament formation, and the head and tail regions participate in the regulation of this process (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 197-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Whereas the central rod domain is well conserved between different intermediate filament proteins, the head and tail sequences diverge both in length and amino acid composition. However, substitution of a few amino acids in the head region can be deleterious for correct filament formation. Intermediate filaments are, in general, polymers of more than one intermediate filament protein. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 1The abbreviations used are: GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; AAD, acidic activation domain; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. vimentin, and nestin are the main intermediate filament proteins in astrocytes, and they are differentially regulated (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 197-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Partnership between vimentin and nestin is characteristic of intermediate filament of the immature astrocytes, whereas vimentin is expressed together with GFAP in the mature astrocyte, and especially GFAP is up-regulated in activated astrocytes, as observed during aging and in Alzheimer's disease (3Porchet R.

Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Studies of mice with targeted mutations have shown that vimentin and nestin require a partner to form filaments, whereas GFAP can form filaments on its own (6Eliasson C. Sahlgren C. Berthold C.H.

Mutated human GFAP, as found in Alexander disease, forms abnormal cytoplasmic fibers, termed Rosenthal fibers, in the brain of patients with this neurodegenerative disease (7Brenner M. Johnson A.B.

Neurosci. 2002; 759: 1-4Google Scholar), and such mutations can directly interfere with normal GFAP dimerization (10Nielsen A.L. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Neurogenet. 2002; 16: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Human GFAP is a 432-amino acid-long polypeptide of 50 kDa (11Reeves S.A. Helman L.J. Allison A. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5178-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Bongcam-Rudloff E. Nister M. Betsholtz C. Wang J.L. Stenman G. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Westermark B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1553-1560PubMed Google Scholar) and is encoded by the GFAP gene on chromosome 17q21. The gene extends over 10 kb, and the predominant splice form, termed GFAPα, consists of nine exons (13Isaacs A. Baker M. Wavrant-De Vrieze F. Hutton M. Genomics. 1998; 51: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have recently isolated a new splice form of the GFAP transcript encoding a protein isoform termed GFAPϵ (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The alternative splicing is a result of the usage of a cryptic exon, exon 7a, embedded in intron 7 (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The alternative spliced GFAPϵ mRNA represents about 5% of the total amount of GFAP mRNA. Exon 7a carries its own polyadenylation signal, and usage inhibits expression of exons 8 and 9. These two exons 8 and 9 encode the evolutionarily well conserved 42-amino acid-long tail domain of GFAPα. When exon 7a is spliced, GFAPϵ is generated with a new 41-amino acid-long tail domain. Exon 7a sequences have only been identified in mammalian GFAP genes, and they appear to be under a different evolutionary pressure than the sequences of the other GFAP exons (15Singh R. Nielsen A.L. Johansen M.G. Jørgensen A.L. Genomics. 2003; 82: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GFAPϵ was functionally isolated by the constitution of a binding surface for the presenilin proteins (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GFAPα does not have this capacity, and mutation analyses show that the new tail domain of GFAPϵ, together with sequences in the coiled-coil region, is required for binding to the presenilins (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The GFAPϵ tail is also characterized by the absence of the RDG motif, which has been proposed to be involved in correct filament formation (16Chen W.J. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2299-2311PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that GFAPϵ, in contrast to GFAPα, cannot bind to itself to form homodimers and homomeric filaments but can form heterodimers and heteromeric filaments with GFAPα. The inhibition of GFAPϵ dimerization is directly linked to the capacity of the GFAPϵ tail to interact with the coiled-coil region of the protein. Our results elucidate a possible new mechanism for selective dimerization of intermediate proteins. Plasmids—Details on individual plasmid constructs, which were all verified by sequencing, are available upon request. Human cDNA for GFAPα was cloned by PCR from a brain cDNA library. Specific mutations were generated as described for QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene).

Immunological Methods—His tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used in a 1:2000 dilution for Western blotting. In epi-immunofluorescence experiments, rabbit anti-GFAP (DAKO) was used in a 1:400 dilution, and fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were diluted 1:200. For epi-immunofluorescence analysis, cells were grown in slide flasks (Nunc). After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 2% para-formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. The fixated cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and antibody incubations were done in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal calf serum for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were counterstained by Hoechst 33258 to visualize the nuclear compartments. GFAPϵ Lacks Homodimerization Capacity—The amino acid sequences of the tail domains of GFAPϵ and GFAPα are similar in length but show no clear amino acid homology to each other, and their isoelectric points are very different (Fig. 1A). The tail confers GFAPϵ with a capacity for presenilin binding not found in GFAPα (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because GFAPα is a building block of the cytoskeleton, we were interested in examining whether the tail provided specific functions to GFAPϵ with respect to protein interaction at the level of dimerization. We utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay, where the proteins to be examined are expressed in fusion to either a DNA binding domain (LexA) or an AAD. The ability of forming protein interactions and thereby generating a chimeric transcription factor can be determined by co-transformation into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 harboring integrated copies of (LexA)4-his and (LexA)8-LacZ indicator genes. cDNA encoding the 432 amino acids of GFAPα, the 431 amino acids of GFAPϵ, or a truncated GFAP without the alternative spliced tail sequences (residues 1–390, GFAPdt) was inserted into the LexA DNA binding domain fusion yeast expression vector pBTM116m. GFAPα, GFAPϵ, or GFAPdt were fused to an AAD in the yeast expression vector pGAD10. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, the fusions were tested for all possible interactions. GFAPα fused to LexA interacted readily with AAD-GFAPα and AAD-GFAPdt, but, to our surprise, no measurable interaction was observed toward AAD-GFAPϵ (Fig. 1B). The same pattern of interaction was observed when the LexA-GFAPdt fusion was tested for the similar interactions (Fig. 1B). LexA-GFAPϵ showed a low level of dimerization toward AAD-GFAPα and AAD-GFAPdt, but we never observed interaction with AAD-GFAPϵ (Fig. 1B). A DNA binding domain and AAD orientation-dependent variation in interaction capacity, as observed in this assay, has previously been described for intermediate filament proteins (23Leung C.L. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results show that, in yeast, GFAPϵ has some capacity to form heterodimers with GFAPα but has no detectable homodimerization potential. We extended the study to include heterogeneous protein interactions, which have been described to involve GFAP. In yeast two-hybrid assays, dimerization of GFAPϵ with the intermediate filament proteins, NFL, peripherin, and internexin, was decreased as compared with the interaction observed for GFAPα (Fig. 1C). Also, GFAPϵ failed to interact with the GFAP filament-associated kinase PKN (data not shown). We next examined protein interactions with nonintermediate filament proteins in a GST pull-down in vitro assay and found that the interaction of GFAPϵ with periplakin and envoplakin was severely decreased as compared with the GFAPα interaction (19Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Thus, the GFAPϵ tail confers an inhibitory effect on multiple genetically distinct GFAP interactions. GFAPϵ Is Deficient in Homomeric Filament Formation—We have previously shown that GFAPϵ overexpressed in mouse N2A cells integrates into filamentous structures as does overexpressed GFAPα (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the capacity to form heteromeric complexes with the intermediate filament proteins present in this cellular environment. We therefore examined whether GFAPϵ can form homomeric filaments in a cell type without intermediate filaments. The SW13cl.1 and SW13cl.2 cell lines are derived from a human adrenal carcinoma tissue (22Sarria A.J. Lieber J.G. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1593-1607PubMed Google Scholar). The SW13cl.2 cells are derived from SW13cl.1 cells and lack expression of intermediate filament proteins including vimentin (22Sarria A.J. Lieber J.G. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1593-1607PubMed Google Scholar). GFAPϵ, GFAPα, and GFAPdt were separately transfected into SW13cl.1 cells, and their incorporation into filamentous structures was determined by immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody that recognizes all three forms of GFAP (Fig. 2). The only difference we observed between the three GFAP forms was a more numerous presence of coarse filaments in the GFAPϵ-transfected SW13cl.1 cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). When the GFAP constructs were transfected into SW13cl.2 cells, however, clearly distinguishable patterns of localization were observed. GFAPα formed filamentous structures consistent with an intrinsic capacity to generate homomeric filaments (Fig. 2). GFAPdt formed unstructured filamentous bundles or discontinuous filament fragments, indicating that GFAPdt does have the capacity to generate homomeric multimers but that these multimers are incapable of correct assembling into longer filaments (Fig. 2). GFAPϵ was completely deficient in forming any filamentous structures and localized instead to aggregates either in the perinuclear region or to spots throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Thus, in mammalian cells, GFAPϵ is deficient in homomeric filament formation, which is consistent with the finding that GFAPϵ is deficient in homodimerization. We did similar experiments with the GFAP isoforms fused to either N- or C-terminally located green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags. In SW13cl.1 cells, such GFP fusions to GFAPα, GFAPϵ, and GFAPdt all localized to filamentous structures (data not shown). In SW13cl.2 cells, N-terminal GFP-tagged GFAPα formed thick filament-like structures often characterized by the presence of only one large filament, whereas N-terminal GFP-tagged GFAPϵ only formed aggregates (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Also, C-terminal GFP-tagged GFAPϵ formed only aggregate-like structures in contrast to C-terminal GFP tagged GFAPα, which formed filament-like structures (data not shown). Taken together, the GFP tag fusion results and the immunofluorescence results show that GFAPϵ and GFAPα are not functional equivalent with respect to filament incorporation. We next examined the capacity of heterodimer formation in mammalian cells by monitoring the capacity of GFAPα to co-assemble with GFP-GFAPϵ. As shown in Fig. 3A, GFAPα expression clearly co-assembled with GFP-GFAPϵ into thick filamentous bundles. Thus, albeit the GFP tags in SW13cl.2 cells influence the filament-forming capacity of GFAPα (data not shown) the localization experiment demonstrates that GFAPϵ in a cellular context can associate with GFAPα in accordance with the yeast experiments that showed the capacity of forming heterodimers (Fig. 1). The GFAPα mRNA appears to be 20 times more abundant than GFAPϵ mRNA in analysis using a mouse whole brain (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given their differences in dimerization capacity, it is conceivable that changing the ratios between GFAPϵ and GFAPα expression may have a profound effect on filament structure. Accordingly, we co-expressed GFAPϵ and GFAPα in SW13cl.2 cells, and it was possible to change the GFAPα/GFAPϵ ratio from 200:1 to 10:1 without any severe alterations in filament structures (Fig. 3B). Further increase in the GFAPϵ amount to a GFAPα/GFAPϵ ratio of 3:1 resulted in collapse of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in most cells (Fig. 3B). This ratio may represent a limit for efficient fiber formation beyond which GFAPϵ does not incorporate together with GFAPα in fibers but inhibits formation of such structures. Consistent with this interpretation, we found only aggregates and no fibers in any cell when a GFAPα/GFAPϵ ratio of 1:1 was used in the transfection experiment (Fig. 3B), and in none of the experiments did we observe in any cell co-existence of aggregates and elongated filaments. This might indicate that whenever the GFAPα/GFAPϵ ratio is compatible with fiber formation, the two isoforms heterodimerize and incorporate into heteromeric filaments with no GFAPϵ monomers left to aggregate. To examine whether the capacity of GFAPϵ to interfere with filament formation was only due to the presence in the cells of the GFAPϵ tail domain or also required the additional coiledcoil region, we co-transfected SW13cl.2 cells with GFAPα and F-GFAPϵ-(391–431) encoding the FLAG epitope-tagged GFAPϵ tail. No effect on the filament structure was monitored in immunofluorescence analysis at a 1:1 ratio of the expression vectors (Fig. 3B, bottom). Also, in a co-transfection experiment with GFAPα and F-GFAPα-(391–431), the GFAP filament structure was intact (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Thus, the inhibitory effect of the GFAPϵ tail requires fusion to the coiled-coil domain, which indicates that the effect is dependent of dimerization with other GFAP monomers. GFAPϵ Tail Residues Mediate a Coiled-coil Domain Interaction and Inhibit Homodimerization—Both GFAPα with a tail domain and GFAP without a tail domain, GFAPdt, are capable of homo- and heterodimerization (Fig. 1). It is therefore likely that the observed inability of GFAPϵ to homodimerize is a direct inhibitory effect of residues present exclusively in the GFAPϵ tail domain rather than the absence of residues supporting dimerization, such as the RDG motif also absent from GFAPdt. One explanation of the inhibitory effect could be the presence of molecular interactions between the GFAPϵ tail domain and heterologous GFAP sequences and thereby interference with both the dimerization and filament forming capacity. To examine this hypothesis, we fused the GFAPϵ tail to GST in GST-GFAPϵ-(390–431) and examined its capacity to interact with full-length GFAP in a GST pull-down assay. As revealed by Western blotting, we observed a significant interaction with bacterial expressed histidine-tagged GFAPα and, to a lesser degree, with histidine-tagged GFAPϵ (Fig. 4A). The lower level of interaction with GFAPϵ is in accordance with competition from intramolecular GFAPϵ interaction. Also, GST-GFAPα-(391–432) interacted with histidine-tagged GFAPϵ and GFAPα (Fig. 4A). This interaction, however, was less strong, and especially toward GFAPϵ the interaction was close to GST background interaction. The interaction mediated by the tail domain was also detectable in a cellular extract from a pig brain, as shown by a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4B). The antibody used in this assay did not distinguish between the two GFAP isoforms. Again the GFAPϵ tail showed an interaction with GFAP, and the GFAPα tail showed a much weaker GFAP interaction. These results clearly demonstrate that the GFAPϵ tail can directly form protein interactions with heterologous GFAP sequences. To map the interaction domain for the GFAPϵ tail, we generated truncated versions of His-tagged GFAPϵ. Interaction was observed with his-GFAPϵ-(204–431) and his-GFAPϵ-(204–390), indicating that coiled-coil 1a and 1b as well as the tail itself are not requested (Fig. 4C). Further mapping identified a region, GFAPϵ-(349–390), present in all interacting fragments (Fig. 4C), which corresponds to the extreme C-terminal end of coiled-coil 2b. This region is well conserved among intermediate filament proteins and appears to contain residues essential for the filament formation capacity (24McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). If the inhibition of GFAPϵ dimerization is an effect of active participation of tail residues rather than lack of essential residues, it is envisaged that tail mutations can be identified that revert the effect. To determine residues in the GFAPϵ tail required for the inhibitory function, we generated a series of GFAPϵ tail mutations and studied their effect on the capacity in a yeast two-hybrid assay to dimerize with GFAPα. Since especially phosphorylation has been identified as a key regulator of intermediate filament protein interactions, we also mutated all potential phosphate receptor amino acids (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 197-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Eng L.F. Ghirnikar R.S. Lee Y.L. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Takemura M. Gomi H. Colucci-Guyon E. Itohara S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the tested mutations, AAD-GPAPϵ(T411E,I412E) clearly gained in binding capacity for LexA-GFAPα, as did, to a lesser degree, the AAD-GFAPϵ(T411A) mutant (Fig. 5A). All other mutations tested showed only weak or insignificant gain in interaction with LexA-GFAPα (Fig. 5A). When the gain of function mutations were tested for interaction with LexA-GFAPϵ, no effect or only a weak effect was observed (Fig. 5A). The results prompted us to undertake experiments where we fused the mutants GFAPϵ(T411E,I412E) and GFAPϵ(T411A) to LexA and tested their capacity for interaction with the equivalent mutations in the context of the AAD vector. Only the T411E,I412E mutation showed a gain in homodimerization capacity, reaching the level of GFAPα homodimerization (Fig. 5B) (data not shown). To examine whether the T411E,I412E tail mutation also resulted in gain in GFAPϵ dimerization capacity in mammalian cells, we transfected SW13cl.2 cells with a GFAPϵ-(T411E,I412E) expression vector. This mutant was localized, using a GFAP antibody, to rough filamentous structures (Fig. 5C). This localization was clearly distinct from the localization of nonmutated GFAPϵ and resembled the GFAPdt localization (see Fig. 2A). By contrast, an array of other GFAPϵ mutants did not differ in their localizations as compared with nonmutated GFAPϵ, in accord with the yeast two-hybrid assay, which showed no gain of homodimerization capacity (data not shown). By introducing the T411,I412E mutation, we were thus able to abolish the inhibitory effect of the GFAPϵ tail on homodimerization and in that respect change the GFAPϵ isoform to resemble GFAPdt without any tail domain and thereby be more GFAPα-like. Since the GFAPϵ tail to coiled-coil interaction observed in vitro (Fig. 4) could be involved in the process of inhibition of dimerization and filament formation, we examined the consequence of the T411,I412E mutation for this interaction. The T411,I412E mutation was introduced in the background of GST-GFAPϵ-(391–431), and the produced recombinant protein was subsequently used in a GST pull-down assay with recombinant histidine-tagged GFAPϵ-(349–431). A clear decrease in interaction to his-GFAPϵ (349–431) was observed for the mutant GFAPϵ tail as compared with the normal GFAPϵ tail (Fig. 5D). Thus, gain of dimerization and filament formation is linked with decreased interaction between the GFAPϵ tail and the coiled-coil region. Presenilin Binding Capacity and Inhibition of GFAPϵ Dimerization Uses Overlapping Tail Residues—Previously, we showed that the specific tail domain of GFAPϵ, together with determinants in the coiled-coil-2 region was required for interaction with the presenilins, a capacity not shared by GFAPα (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We speculated that the mutations that made GFAPϵ more GFAPα-like with respect to dimerization might interfere with presenilin binding so that GFAPϵ behaves GFAPα-like also in this respect. To map precisely the GFAPϵ-specific residues involved in presenilin interaction, we utilized the above described panel of AAD-GFAPϵ mutants in yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in Fig. 5A, the T411E,I412E mutation had a dramatic effect, since it completely abolished presenilin-1 interaction. This same mutation, as shown above, completely abolished the mechanism that inhibits GFAPϵ to dimerize. Also, AAD-GFAPϵ(T411A) and to some extent AAD-GFAPϵ(L407E,K408E) had decreased presenilin-1 binding capacity (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that the sequences required for presenilin-1 binding overlap with sequences within the GFAPϵ tail that are required for inhibition of dimerization. Alternative splicing of transcripts from mammalian GFAP genes creates an isoform, GFAPϵ, with a tail domain that differs significantly in amino acid composition from the tail domain of the predominant isoform GFAPα (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The relative in vivo expression levels of the GFAPα and GFAPϵ variants, examining mRNA levels in a total brain sample, are on the order of 20:1 (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we assign a distinct regulatory function to the tail domain of GFAPϵ that effectively inhibits homodimerization and to some degree heterodimerization with GFAPα. This effect is rather intriguing, since it is the highly conserved coiled-coil region that is directly responsible for dimerization, whereas the tail and head domains of GFAP and of other IF proteins play important roles for correct filament assembly. The RDG motif present in the tail of GFAPα and in many other IF proteins could be involved in the assembly process (16Chen W.J. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2299-2311PubMed Google Scholar, 24McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Strelkov S.V. Herrmann H. Aebi U. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but, interestingly, the tail of GFAPϵ lacks the RDG motif. It is unlikely that the dimerization inhibitory effect is due only to the absence of essential amino acid residues, because the truncated GFAPdt, lacking the corresponding tail residues, has retained dimerization potential and because the introduction of specific point mutations in the GFAPϵ tail can restore the dimerization potential (see Fig. 5). Instead, the inhibitory mechanism may represent a new function gained by the GFAPϵ isoform. The mechanism is not restricted to GFAP dimerization but also has an effect on interactions with heterologous proteins, suggesting that GFAPϵ can exist in a protein conformation that inhibits protein-protein contacts mediated through the coiled-coil region. The observation that the GFAPϵ tail interacts directly with the coiled-coil region (Fig. 4) indicates that such conformation involves intramolecular interactions, and it is envisaged that such interactions compete with intermolecular interactions. One prediction from this model would be that the competition is more in favor of intramolecular interaction when only GFAPϵ is present, whereas the presence of the dimerization-prone GFAPα may facilitate intermolecular interactions through the coiled-coil. It remains to be determined whether GFAPϵ and GFAPα mRNA are translated at the same subcellular locations so that heterodimerization may proceed immediately or whether the GFAPϵ monomere is present for longer periods of time within cells. Clearly, overexpression of GFAPϵ, in the absence of GFAPα, results in aggregate formation (Fig. 2). To this end it might be significant that we have identified, in vitro and in yeast, a GFAPϵ-specific interaction with the presenilin proteins (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The interaction requires both residues of the GFAPϵ-specific tail and residues within coiled-coil region 2 (Fig. 5) (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and suggests a direct link between the inability of GFAPϵ to form homodimers and the exposure of the presenilin interaction surface. This linkage is supported by the observation that specific mutations introduced in the GFAPϵ tail both rescue some dimerization capacity and abolish the presenilin binding capacity (i.e. GFAPϵ has gained characteristics of GFAPα). It should be noted that the GFAPϵ coiled-coil residues required for presenilin binding (residues 204–308 (14Nielsen A.L. Holm I.E. Johansen M. Bonven B. Jørgensen P. Jørgensen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29983-29991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) and the residues required for the GFAPϵ tail interaction (residues 349–390 (Fig. 4C)) do not overlap, indicating that these two interactions are not mutually exclusive. The presenilin interaction might serve a function for the GFAPϵ monomer as chaperone and be involved in transport of GFAPϵ to specific cellular compartments, a function of presenilins also designated toward other proteins (27Thinakaran G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Tandon A. Rogaeva E. Mullan M. George-Hyslop P.H. Curr. Opin.

Green W.N. Koo E.H. Thinakaran G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 64-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The GFAPϵ tail interaction with the coiled-coil was mapped to a region in GFAP coil 2b that shows a high degree of conservation between different intermediate filament proteins (24McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Strelkov S.V. Herrmann H. Aebi U. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This coiled-coil region has been described as essential for filament formation, since even subtle amino acid alterations are deleterious (24McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A mapping study of the intermediate filament protein vimentin has revealed an interaction between this coiled-coil region and the RDG segment of the tail (24McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and we observed a similar interaction between the GFAPα tail and the coiled-coil region. However, this interaction was severalfold weaker than the GFAPϵ tail interaction with the coiled-coil, and this indicates that the presence of the GFAPϵ tail results in a gain of coiled-coil binding activity. Furthermore the interaction could be abolished by a tail mutation that also resulted in gain of dimerization and filament formation (Fig. 5). Our experiments demonstrate a link between the capacity of the GFAPϵ tail to bind the coiled-coil and to inhibition dimerization, and a simple model may account for the presence of GFAPϵ in a monomeric form. Given that the GFAPϵ tail interacting coiled-coil region is essential for the initiation of dimerization, mediated by two parallel coiled-coils, dimerization will proceed from the C terminus toward the N terminus. This process may be strongly disfavored by the presence of two GFAPϵ tails competing for these regions, and an equilibrium is expected to exist between a conformation where the GFAPϵ tail is associated with the coiled-coil and a conformation where coiled-coil 2b is exposed and prone to dimerize. The presence of also a GFAPα monomere, where the coiled-coil 2b is permanently exposed, may thus result in heterodimer formation. The observation that GFAPϵ/GFAPα heterodimers do form, but at a reduced level compared with GFAPα homodimerization, is in accordance with such a model (Fig. 1). Also, the stability of already formed heterodimers might be decreased by GFAPϵ tail competition for the coiled-coil region. The GFAP filament is normally stabilized by numerous distinct interactions between the dimers/tetramers to form the 10-nm filament. If we altered the relative level of the two GFAP variants in strong favor of GFAPϵ, the GFAP filament disintegrated, and this might be due to increased amounts of tetramers containing a GFAPϵ tail at each of the ends (Fig. 3B). By contrast, we observe that a low level of GFAPϵ does not cause filament collapse. One explanation may be that fewer GFAPα/GFAPϵ heterodimers are formed decreasing the probability that two such heterodimers form tetramers. GFAPϵ containing tetramers are expected to be poor building blocks for further multimerization, since they could preferentially expose the GFAPϵ tail. The consequence for such an exposure could be a steric blocking of coiled-coil regions within the tetramers required for the multimerization process. We have no evidence yet that cell types exist with a GFAPϵ/GFAPα ratio close to the one experimentally found required to affect filament structure. However, even if the ratio is artificial, the presented experiments show that filament-integrated GFAPϵ behaves functionally nonequivalent to both GFAPα and GFAP without tail sequence. We can only speculate as to the exact function of the GFAPϵ homodimerization-inhibitory capacity and whether it serves as a regulatory mechanism prior to, during, or after the filament assembly process. The inhibitory mechanism could assure that two GFAPϵ monomers are not positioned next to each other within the intermediate filament. Since the tails of intermediate filament proteins, sticking laterally out from the filament, are thought to constitute a candidate motif for heterologous protein-protein interactions (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 197-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 4Eng L.F. Ghirnikar R.S. Lee Y.L. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is appealing to suggest that the GFAPϵ tail, besides the inhibitory function, also constitutes a surface for mediating new protein contacts between the GFAP filament and other cellular proteins. Such a new network of protein interactions could rely on a nonclustered distribution of GFAPϵ tails at the filament surface for correct function. To understand GFAP intermediate filaments and the importance and the function within cells of such filaments, it will be important to determine whether molecular pathways exist that regulate GFAPϵ tail-mediated inhibition of dimerization and filament formation as well as the mechanism that regulates the relative amounts of the two GFAP isoforms.

Published evidence shows that geminin specifically interacts with Cdt1 to block its function in the assembly of prereplication complexes. However, in proliferating HeLa cells geminin and Cdt1 are co-expressed during a relatively short time at the G1-to-S phase transition. Under these conditions, nearly all Cdt1 and a major part of geminin are bound to chromatin and reside at the same or closely adjacent sites as shown here by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cdt1 is rapidly degraded early in S phase, but geminin remains bound to the chromatin sites. One function that chromatin-bound geminin could perform is to prevent access to Cdt1 that may escape S phase-dependent degradation or is synthesized in excess. Indeed, Cdt1 continues to be synthesized in HeLa cells in S phase but never accumulates because of the efficient degradation.

Geminin, a 25-kDa protein, was discovered by screening a cDNA library for novel proteins that were degraded by mitotic but not interphase Xenopus laevis egg extracts (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Homologs of geminin contain a destruction box in the amino-terminal region that is targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) ubiquitin ligase activated in late mitosis. Homologs of the Xenopus geminin have been detected in all multicellular eukaryotes examined but have not been detected in yeast. The native protein is a homodimer with a central interacting coiled-coil domain. This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins (2Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of geminin is its ability to prevent the licensing of Xenopus chromatin for DNA replication in vitro (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). This is achieved by a specific binding and inhibition of the protein Cdt1 that together with protein Cdc6 loads the Mcm protein complex to chromatin sites bearing the origin recognition complex (ORC) 1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RNAi, RNA interference; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; 2×T, double-thymidine (procedure). (3Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 4Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the major function of geminin in vivo is to inhibit the relicensing of replication origins that have already been activated in the same S phase (5Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). This model would explain why geminin accumulates during S phase and why it is degraded at the end of mitosis when Cdt1 must be released to function as an Mcm loader for the formation of prereplication complexes in the next cell cycle. However, ongoing research with the Xenopus system suggests that the situation may be not as straightforward as this model implies. First, unlike recombinant geminin as investigated originally by McGarry and Kirschner (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), endogenous geminin is only partially degraded during mitosis in egg extracts but appears to be inactivated by other means, probably also involving ubiquitination but without consecutive proteolysis (6Hodgson B. Li A. Tada S. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Li A. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, it seems that geminin must first bind to chromatin before it can exert its Cdt1-inhibiting activity in Xenopus egg extracts (8Maiorano D. Rul W. Mechali M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Third, in vivo the level of geminin remains stable and does not fluctuate during the synchronized and rapid first embryonic cell cycles in Xenopus (8Maiorano D. Rul W. Mechali M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the expression of geminin can be suppressed without effects on the early cell cycles until the midblastula transition, when differentiation begins and cell cycles become longer and asynchronous (9McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, geminin has been independently discovered as a protein that affects the differentiation of neural tissues in gastrulating Xenopus embryos (10Kroll K.L. Salic A.N. Evans L.M. Kirschner M.W. Development. 1998; 125: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raising the possibility that geminin may be involved in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation. This notion is supported by more recent evidence. Del Bene et al. (11Del Bene F. Tessmar-Raible K. Wittbrodt J. Nature. 2004; 427: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) detected an interaction between geminin and Six3, a member of the homeobox-containing Six family of proteins involved in vertebrate eye development. Loss of geminin promotes excess retinal precursor cell proliferation, whereas overexpression of geminin induces forebrain and eye defects in medaka fish. The basis for this is probably that geminin can interact either with Six3 to prevent differentiation or with Cdt1 to block replication. Likewise, Luo et al. (12Luo L. Yang X. Takihara Y. Knoetgen H. Kessel M. Nature. 2004; 427: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have identified a strong interaction between geminin and transcription factors of the Hox and polycomb families, which are involved in embryonic patterning and tissue differentiation. Again, it is proposed that a binding of geminin to Hox releases Cdt1 and thereby allows DNA replication and cell proliferation. Whatever the precise molecular mechanisms may be, it is interesting to note that geminin may have regulatory functions beyond prevention of rereplication as proposed originally. Work with proliferating human HeLa cells in culture has shown that Cdt1 is expressed during G1 phase and then degraded soon after entry into S phase (13Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This appears to be promoted by a cyclin A-dependent kinase, which phosphorylates Cdt1 and targets it to the F-box protein Skp2, a component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box protein ubiquitin ligase complex, SCF (14Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, geminin is expressed at the entry into S phase (18Markey M.P. Siddiqui H. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29255-29262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3802-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and accumulates until its sudden destruction in late mitosis (19Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3802-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Shreeram S. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Blow J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, it is only for relatively short periods around the G1-to-S phase transition and at the end of mitosis that Cdt1 and geminin coexist in proliferating human cells. Interestingly, however, overexpression of a non-degradable geminin variant causes primary human cells to arrest before entry into S phase, whereas cultured cancer cell lines respond to overexpression with or without cell cycle arrest depending on whether they are able to activate a replication checkpoint or not. In either case, overexpression reduces the tumorigenicity of certain cultured cancer cells (20Shreeram S. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Blow J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similarly, replacing the wild type geminin allele with a mutant allele expressing a non-degradable version of geminin causes a reduction in the tumor-promoting potential of HCT116 cancer cells, and this is explained by the fact that in this case the cell cycle is somewhat slower than normal but not altogether abolished (21Yoshida K. Oyaizu N. Dutta A. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although geminin acts to slow down cellular proliferation in vitro, it is highly expressed in numerous malignancies (22Wohlschlegel J.A. Kutok J.L. Weng A.P. Dutta A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 267-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Hansel D.E. Rahman A. Hidalgo M. Thuluvath P.J. Lillemoe K.D. Shulick R. Ku J.L. Park J.G. Miyazaki K.

Pathol. 2003; 163: 217-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in contrast to other negative cell cycle regulators like cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which are clearly down-regulated in many human tumors. Thus, many questions remain before the roles of geminin in metazoan cell biology can be clearly defined. We have noted before that geminin is in part bound to chromatin in HeLa cells (24Kulartz M. Kreitz S. Hiller E. Damoc E.C. Przybylski M. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and we investigate now whether geminin needs Cdt1, a known DNA-binding protein (25Yanagi K.I. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), to associate with chromatin or whether geminin also binds in the absence of Cdt1. We describe that a major fraction of geminin remains on chromatin in S phase after Cdt1 has been degraded, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we have found that geminin is bound to sites adjacent to a mapped replication origin. We discuss the possibility that bound geminin may function to block the access of initiator proteins to replication origins. However, this function appears to be dispensable in rapidly proliferating HeLa cells because an elimination of geminin (by RNAi) has no apparent effect on cell division. Cell Culture and Cell Fractionation—HeLa cells were cultivated and synchronized by a double-thymidine block as described by Kreitz et al. (26Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For FACS analysis, HeLa cells were washed three times and then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. For staining of the DNA 4 × 105 cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and stained with a total of 18 μg of propidium iodide (Sigma). Fluorescence was measured with the flow cytometer FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences), and results were visualized and evaluated with the software Cell Quest (BD Biosciences). For cell fractionation cells were washed three times with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP), suspended in the same buffer, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer five times before incubation on ice for 15 min. Cytosolic supernatant was separated from the nuclear pellet by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g. Soluble nuclear proteins were released with hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted from the chromatin pellet with increasing concentrations of salt (buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP plus 100, 250, or 450 mm NaCl). All extraction buffers were supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in the concentration suggested by the manufacturer. In Vivo Cross-linking—HeLa cells were washed with PBS to remove serum-containing medium and treated with 1% formaldehyde diluted in medium without serum at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS to stop the reaction, scraped off, and washed again twice in cold PBS. Cell pellets were then resuspended in hypotonic RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 3 mm MgCl2) plus 10 mm sodium bisulfite as protease inhibitor, incubated on ice for 10 min, and disrupted mechanically by Dounce homogenization. Then nuclear pellets were washed twice with RSB buffer and once with high salt NSB buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) plus 10 mm sodium bisulfite, suspended in NSB buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) plus 10 mm sodium bisulfite, and loaded onto a three-step gradient with 1.75, 1.5, and 1.3 mg/ml CsCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation nucleoprotein complexes were isolated and dialyzed for 1 h against TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) plus 1 m NaCl and 10 mm sodium bisulfite and for 4 h against TE buffer. After sonication nucleoprotein was digested with micrococcal nuclease (10 units/mg of nucleoprotein) in TE plus 3 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm sodium bisulfite for 15 min at 37 °C. Preparation and Use of Antibodies—Monospecific antibodies against human proteins geminin, Orc2, and Mcm7 were described previously (24Kulartz M. Kreitz S. Hiller E. Damoc E.C. Przybylski M. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To prepare human Cdt1 as an antigen, we cloned a cDNA sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number BE018212) into the multiple cloning site of pbluebacHis2A (Invitrogen). Recombinant His-tagged Cdt1 was expressed in Hi5 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses, purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), and used as an antigen to raise antibodies in rabbit. Monospecific antibodies were purified from serum by affinity chromatography with Sulfo-Link (Pierce) coupled with recombinant His-tagged Cdt1. For immunoblotting proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred onto a Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked with Roti® blocking reagent (Roth) for 1 h, stained with monospecific antibodies for 1 h, and visualized by goat anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 μg of monospecific antibodies/protein extracts from 4–6 × 106 cells essentially as described previously (26Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP assay) 10 μg of antibodies were incubated with 1 mg of micrococcal nuclease-digested nucleoprotein overnight at 4 °C in NET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Protein A-Sepharose beads were added for an additional 2 h. For Western blot analyses the immunocomplexes were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS), once with lithium buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm LiCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and three times with TE buffer. For PCR analyses immunocomplexes were washed eight times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, three times with lithium buffer, and five times with TE buffer. All buffers were supplemented with 10 mm sodium bisulfite as protease inhibitor. Immunocomplexes were eluted with 2% SDS (Western blot analysis) or 1% SDS in TE buffer (PCR analysis) at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were incubated at 60 °C for 3 h to reverse the cross-links. Proteins were precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis, and DNA was extracted by standard phenol chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in TE buffer for PCR analysis. Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Real time PCR was performed with the LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) using a ready-to-use “hot start” reaction mix (FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I; Roche Diagnostics). Reactions were set up in a 10-μl volume with 0.5 mm primer oligonucleotides. PCR reactions were performed for 45 cycles with standard settings as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequences and conditions for each primer pair are exactly as those described by Schaarschmidt et al. (29Schaarschmidt D. Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4176-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Standard DNA samples were diluted from 30, 3, and 0.3 ng up to 30 pg. PCR results were evaluated by plotting the x axis crossing points of each standard sample against the logarithm of concentration to produce a standard curve. Genomic equivalents of DNA samples were determined by extrapolation from the standard curve. Transfection with siRNA—For geminin silencing HeLa cells were transfected with a specific siRNA sequence (sequence of targeted geminin region, 5′-AACTCTGAAGATGATTCAGCC-3′; Dharmacon Research) and the transfection reagent Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed according to the protocol of Elbashir et al. (30Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Geminin and Cdt1 on Chromatin in Proliferating HeLa Cells—We have prepared monospecific antibodies against recombinant Cdt1 that recognize a single 63-kDa polypeptide band, corresponding to cellular Cdt1 in Western blots with unfractionated HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 1A). With these antibodies and the previously described geminin-specific antibodies (24Kulartz M. Kreitz S. Hiller E. Damoc E.C. Przybylski M. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as tools, we investigated the distribution of Cdt1 and geminin in asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells. For this purpose HeLa cells were disrupted in a hypotonic buffer to prepare a cytosolic supernatant and a nuclear pellet. The pellet was suspended in the presence of the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 to disrupt the nuclear envelope. The supernatant fraction of nucleosolic proteins was separated from chromatin in the pellet. Finally, chromatin-associated proteins were mobilized from the pellet with increasing salt concentrations. Nearly all Cdt1 was found in the chromatin fractions, whereas geminin distributed between the fractions of chromatin-bound proteins and soluble (cytosolic and nucleosolic) proteins (Fig. 1B). To determine whether Cdt1 and geminin interacted with each other, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with the proteins eluted at 0.25–0.45 m NaCl from chromatin. As shown in Fig. 1C, geminin-specific antibodies precipitated not only geminin, as expected, but a part of Cdt1 as well, just as Cdt1-specific antibodies partially coprecipitated geminin. This indicates that chromatin-bound Cdt1 interacted in part with geminin. However, other parts of either geminin or Cdt1 did not coimmunoprecipitate and were therefore not associated with each other. One explanation is that the complex was artifactually disrupted during the experimental procedure, but it is also possible that geminin and Cdt1 bind in part independently of each other to chromatin. Furthermore a proliferating cell population consists of cells in different cell cycle stages that are not all expected to co-express geminin and Cdt1. Thus it was of further interest to investigate synchronized cells with respect to the chromatin association as well as interaction of these proteins. Cdt1 and Geminin in Synchronized Cells—To investigate how the chromatin binding of geminin and Cdt1 changes during the cell cycle, we arrested HeLa cells at the G1-to-S phase transition by the double-thymidine (2×T) procedure (31Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyns R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1993: 1-24Google Scholar). This involves the competitive inhibition of deoxynucleotide synthesis and therefore causes a cell cycle block that presumably occurs independently of and after the activation of cyclin E- and cyclin A-dependent protein kinases. Because cyclin A-dependent protein kinase targets Cdt1 for degradation, Cdt1 was not detected in 2×T-arrested cells (13Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A small amount of soluble Cdt1 was detected during mitosis at 8–10 h after release. This soluble Cdt1 had a retarded electrophoretic mobility that is most likely due to a phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (see Fig. 2A, bottom, nucleosol) (15Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cdt1 continued to be expressed during G1, and most of it was bound to chromatin (Fig. 2A, top, elution with 450 mm NaCl). In contrast to Cdt1, geminin was expressed in 2×T-arrested cells (13Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and a significant fraction was bound to chromatin even in the absence of Cdt1 (Fig. 2A, top). In parallel with soluble geminin (Fig. 2A, bottom), chromatin-bound geminin was degraded in mitosis and re-expressed at the beginning of the next S phase (Fig. 2A). As controls, we determined the presence of the Orc2 protein that is known to stay bound to chromatin during the entire cell cycle (26Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and of the Mcm7 protein that together with other Mcm proteins is known to dissociate during S phase and to bind to chromatin again in the next G1 phase (Fig. 2A) (32Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells released from the 2×T block partially loose synchrony during the next cell cycle (26Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a major fraction of cells at 14 and 16 h after the release appeared to co-express geminin and Cdt1 (see below). We have therefore prepared chromatin-bound proteins from the 16 h-cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to assess whether the two proteins occur together in complexes. The results indicate that parts, but not all, of Cdt1 and geminin were associated with each other (Fig. 2B) supporting the results obtained with unsynchronized cells (Fig. 1C). Cross-linking to DNA in Vivo—We showed above that a significant part of cellular geminin was associated with isolated chromatin, even after the degradation of Cdt1, a characterized DNA-binding protein and an established binding partner of geminin. As isolated geminin has no DNA binding activity in vitro (25Yanagi K.I. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it was necessary to exclude the possibility that geminin artifactually attached to chromatin after preparation. To show directly that geminin is a genuine constituent of chromatin in vivo, we used the method of in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking (33Gohring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and treated asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells with formaldehyde for various times. The chromatin was washed with high salt to remove all soluble proteins and isolated by CsCl density centrifugation. As described before (34Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) a cross-linking time of 1–2 min suffices to covalently link histones to DNA, and longer cross-linking times (4–8 min) are required to link most non-histone chromatin proteins (Fig. 3A, top). As shown by Western blotting, Cdt1 appeared in cross-linked chromatin already after 2–4 min in formaldehyde, soon followed by the cross-linking of geminin (Fig. 3A, Cdt1 and Geminin). Thus, geminin, just like Cdt1, appears to be an in vivo component of chromatin. The question arises as to whether both proteins can reside at the same sites in chromatin. To investigate this, we trimmed the DNA in cross-linked chromatin by micrococcal nuclease digestion to fragments with average DNA lengths of <0.5 kb (Fig. 3B). These fragments were incubated with Cdt1-specific and, in parallel, with geminin-specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate chromatin bearing covalently linked Cdt1 and/or geminin. The Cdt1 antibodies only partially precipitated the cross-linked chromatin bearing Cdt1 (compare input (I) and supernatant (S) in Fig. 3C, center (α-Cdt1)). The fraction of immunoprecipitable chromatin did not increase with higher amounts of antibodies suggesting that not all of Cdt1 was accessible to antibodies; perhaps it was part of a larger complex as published recently (6Hodgson B. Li A. Tada S. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Maiorano D. Rul W. Mechali M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The precipitated Cdt1-bearing chromatin fragments also carried geminin (Fig. 3C, center) indicating that the two proteins were located at identical or closely adjacent chromatin sites. As shown in Fig. 3C (left) cross-linked geminin was accessible for geminin-specific antibodies and could be efficiently immunoprecipitated. However, Cdt1 was barely detectable in these precipitates. The reason is probably that much more geminin than Cdt1 was present on chromatin in these asynchronously growing cells with the consequence that many fragments carry geminin, but not Cdt1, which is therefore present in amounts too low to be detected in the precipitates obtained with geminin-specific antibodies. To further address this point, we performed cross-linking experiments with synchronized cells that were treated with formaldehyde at 16 h after release from the 2×T block when Cdt1 and geminin are expected to be co-expressed (see Fig. 2A). Geminin-specific antibodies precipitated chromatin fragments with geminin, which also contained small but significant amounts of Cdt1 (Fig. 4A, left). Likewise, immunoprecipitates with Cdt1-specific antibodies contained chromatin fragments bearing Cdt1 and geminin (Fig. 4A, right). Thus, the data confirm that Cdt1 and geminin can occur together at the same or closely adjacent sites on chromatin fragments of <0.5 kb. This result prompted us to map the binding sites of Cdt1 and geminin relative to a previously characterized replication origin in the human genome. This origin is located in the region between the two active human genes PRKDC and MCM4. It includes the site where ORC is bound and where the assembly of"

Loss of MTF-1 resulted in delayed tumor growth associated with increased matrix collagen deposition and reductions in vasculature density. Molecular consequences of MTF-1 loss include increased expression and activation of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG), two proteins with documented roles in the production and stabilization of extracellular matrix (ECM). Our findings support the hypothesis that MTF-1 enhances the ability of the developing tumor mass to evade fibrosis and scarring of the tumor, a critical step in tumor cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2057917834,"The platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) are receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in multiple aspects of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Recently, a gain of function mutation in the activation loop of the human PDGFRα has been found in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Here we show that a mutation in the corresponding codon in the activation loop of the murine PDGFRβ, namely an exchange of asparagine for aspartic acid at amino acid position 849 (D849N), confers transforming characteristics to embryonic fibroblasts from mutant mice, generated by a knock-in strategy. By comparing the enzymatic properties of the wild-type versus the mutant receptor protein, we demonstrate that the D849N mutation lowers the threshold for kinase activation, causes a dramatic alteration in the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation kinetics following ligand stimulation, and induces a ligand-independent phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues. These changes result in deregulated recruitment of specific signal transducers. The GTPase-activating protein for Ras (RasGAP), a negative regulator of the Ras mitogenic pathway, displayed a delayed binding to the mutant receptor. Moreover, we have observed enhanced ligand-independent ERK1/2 activation and an increased proliferation of mutant cells. The p85 regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3 ′-kinase was constitutively associated with the mutant receptor, and this ligand-independent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway may explain the observed strong protection against apoptosis and increased motility in cellular wounding assays. Our findings support a model whereby an activating point mutation results in a deregulated PDGFRβ with oncogenic predisposition.

Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). There are two structurally related PDGF receptors; the α- and β-receptor each contain a large extracellular domain involved in growth factor binding and an intracellular region including a kinase domain. Growth factor binding induces receptor homo- or heterodimerization at the plasma membrane, which leads to the activation of the intrinsic kinase activity. This results in the autophosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, which in turn act as docking sites for downstream signaling proteins containing phosphotyrosine recognition domains (2Pawson T.

One of these mutations, the substitution of valine for the highly conserved aspartic acid in the activation loop of PDGF β-receptor (PDGFRβ), is homologous to those found in other receptor tyrosine kinases such as Kit, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), and Met; these mutations cause human diseases such as mast cell disorders and germ cell tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, and papillary renal carcinomas, respectively (6Heinrich M.C. Corless C.L. Duensing A. McGreevey L. Chen C.J. Joseph N. Singer S. Griffith D.J. Haley A. Town A. Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Fletcher J.A. Science. 2003; 299: 708-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms coupling these biochemical alterations to the oncogenic properties of the mutant receptors are unclear. Structural and biochemical studies have revealed that receptor tyrosine kinases are allosteric enzymes in equilibrium between active and inactive states. Oncogenic mutations up-regulate the tyrosine kinase activity, possibly by inducing a dynamic imbalance in favor of the active conformation of the kinase. Evidence for this molecular mechanism is provided by a recent analysis of similar mutations in the Met receptor causing human papillary renal carcinomas. In this case, the mutations D1228N or D1228H decrease the threshold of activation, since they overcome the requirement for the phosphorylation of one of the two tyrosines in the activation loop essential for wild-type receptor activation (13Chiara F. Michieli P. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29352-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that replacement of the aspartic acid with asparagine in the activation loop of the PDGFRβ kinase domain in a position corresponding to oncogenic mutations in other receptor tyrosine kinases alters the phosphorylation kinetics of several tyrosine residues that are binding sites for downstream molecules such as RasGAP or phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K). As a result, the D849N mutant PDGFRβ up-regulates antiapoptotic pathways, increases cellular transforming capacity in vitro, and leads to alterations in cell motility and proliferation. Generation of Mutant Mice—The genomic DNA used as homology arms in the targeting vector was cut out of genomic subclones prepared previously (14Heuchel R. Berg A. Tallquist M. Ahlen K. Reed R.K. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mutation of aspartic acid 849 to asparagine was introduced into subcloned genomic DNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mutation primers were as follows: 5′-GACTTCGGCCTGGCTCGAaATATTATGAGGGACTCAAACTACA-3′ and 5′-TGTAGTTTGAGTCCCTCATAATATtTCGAGCCAGGCCGAAGTC-3′ (base exchange resulting in amino acid mutation indicated in lowercase letters). The mutation was finally confirmed by sequencing of a PCR-amplified DNA fragment from targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells. The targeting vector consisted of a 1.7-kb EcoRV-SpeI genomic 5′-fragment, followed by a PGKneobpA expression cassette flanked by loxP sites, a 5-kb SpeI-XhoI genomic 3′-fragment containing the point mutated exon 18, and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase expression cassette in pBluescript SK(+). The construct was linearized (NotI) for electroporation into R1-ES cells (15Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), and colonies were selected with G418 and gancyclovir. Homologous recombination events were screened by PCR, as described (14Heuchel R. Berg A. Tallquist M. Ahlen K. Reed R.K. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), using primers for the neo gene (5′-TGGCTACCCGTGATATTGCT-3) and genomic sequence outside the targeting construct (5-CCGAAATGTGTACCAGTCTGAAA-3), resulting in a 3-kb amplification product for correct integration. Positive ES cell clones were tested by Southern blot, as described (14Heuchel R. Berg A. Tallquist M. Ahlen K. Reed R.K. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11410-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), using a 177-bp PCR amplification product corresponding to nucleotides 1957–2133 of the mouse PDGFRβ cDNA, which hybridizes to genomic DNA 5′ outside of the targeting construct (5.2-kb wild-type allele; 6.9-kb mutant allele). Coat chimeras using ES-cell clone 1B11 were generated by morula aggregation, as described previously (16Wood S.A. Allen N.D. Rossant J. Auerbach A. Nagy A. Nature. 1993; 365: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The neo cassette was not removed, since its presence at that specific position in intron 15 had been shown previously to be without effect on the expression of the PDGFRβ (14Heuchel R. Berg A. Tallquist M. Ahlen K. Reed R.K. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—3T3-like embryonic fibroblasts were derived from E13 embryos (129Sv/C57Bl/6 mixed background) according to standard procedures (18Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine. All experiments involving mouse embryonic fibroblasts were done repeatedly with two or more cell isolates to exclude clonal variation. Plasmids, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a cDNA encoding the full-length human PDGFRβ inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen), using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Transient transfection of NIH3T3 cells was performed using a DNA-calcium phosphate procedure (CellPhect transfection kit; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PDGF-BB stimulation on serum-starved COS or PAE cells was performed for 7 min at 37 °C using 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Focus Forming Assays—Focus forming assays were performed as described (13Chiara F. Michieli P. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29352-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with the appropriate pcDNA3 plasmid (10 μg/dish) by the calcium phosphate method in the presence of 10% calf serum. After 24 h, the serum concentration was reduced to 5%, and cells were cultured for an additional 21 days. Foci were scored following staining with Giemsa dye. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells in EB buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) in the presence of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (∼1 mg of lysate protein) using 2 μg of antibody plus 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed two times with EB buffer and two times with TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and run on an SDS 8–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 2 h and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-PDGFRβ antibodies. Antisera against Tyr(P), PDGFRβ (sc958), and GTPase-activating protein for Ras (RasGAP) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antisera against phospho-Akt, Akt, and phospho-ERK1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; and the p85 subunit of PI3K antiserum was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against phosphorylated tyrosines Tyr(P)579, Tyr(P)751, Tyr(P)771, and Tyr(P)1021 of the human PDGFRβ have been described recently (19Persson C. Savenhed C. Bourdeau A. Tremblay M.L. Markova B. Bohmer F.D. Haj F.G. Neel B.G. Elson A. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. Ostman A. Hellberg C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2190-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, we have validated specific antibodies against Tyr(P)763 and Tyr(P)1009 using wheat germ agglutinin pull-downs from lysates prepared from PAE cells transfected with either wild-type PDGFRβ or a PDGF β-receptor mutated at the respective amino acid. The site-specific antibodies yielded a specific signal only for wild-type receptors after stimulation by ligand (Supplemental Fig. 1). Kinase Assays—For kinase assays, MEFs were lysed in the absence of sodium orthovanadate to allow dephosphorylation, and the various PDGFRβ proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies. Immunopurified proteins were then washed three times with EB buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). For preactivation, 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB was added on ice for 30 min. The phosphorylation reaction was performed in kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample) and 10 μm unlabeled ATP for increasing time periods at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of boiling SDS-sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies, followed by quantification of radioactivity using a phosphor imager (Fuji). Exogenous Substrate Phosphorylation Assay—The phosphorylation reaction was performed in kinase buffer in the presence of increasing concentrations of myelin basic protein, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample) for 15 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA. The samples were separated on an 8–12% gradient SDS-PAGE and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies and analysis by PhosphorImager analysis. Mitogenesis Assay—MEFs were seeded in 12-well plates and grown for 24 h. The medium was then changed to starvation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by 1% FCS), and after 24 h, 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) and PDGF (0–25 ng/ml) or 10% FCS were added, and the incubation was continued for 20 h. Incorporated radioactivity was precipitated using 5% trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved in 1 m NaOH. After neutralization, incorporated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Cellular Wounding Assay—Confluent MEF cultures were grown in 6-well plates on coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin and starved for 2 days in medium containing 0.05% serum. “Wounds” (three/glass) were introduced by scratching the coverslips with a 200-μl pipette tip. The assay was performed in the presence of 10 μg of mitomycin C/ml to inhibit proliferation. Phase-contrast microscopic pictures were taken at the indicated time points. Fluorescence Microscopy—MEFs on coverslips were grown and “wounded” as in the cellular wounding assay. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 25 min and washed with PBS. Then cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed again in PBS, and incubated in 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize the filamentous actin, the cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. The coverslips were mounted on object slides by the use of Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Cells were photographed by a Hamamatsu ORCA CCD digital camera employing the QED Imaging System software using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope. Flow Cytometry Analysis of Apoptosis Induction—Flow cytometry recordings of several independent apoptotic changes were simultaneously performed by a single tube analysis, as described (20Rasola A. Geuna M. Cytometry. 2001; 45: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, after induction of apoptosis, cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (200 nm), and propidium iodide (1 mg/ml), to detect phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface, mitochondrial inner membrane electrochemical gradient (Δψm), and plasma membrane integrity, respectively. Cell morphology changes were analyzed following variations of the forward and side light scatter. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data acquisition was performed using CellQuest software, and data analysis was performed with WinMDI software. An Activation Loop Mutation in the Human PDGFRβ Gives the Receptor Transforming Properties in the Presence of Ligand—It was recently shown that mutations of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue in the activation loop of Kit and Met receptors caused up-regulation of their enzymatic activity, resulting in increased transforming potential (7Longley B.J. Tyrrell L. Lu S.Z. Ma Y.S. Langley K. Ding T.G. Duffy T. Jacobs P. Tang L.H. Modlin I. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 21Bardelli A. Longati P. Gramaglia D. Basilico C. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Ballinari D. Michieli P. Comoglio P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14379-14383Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of this type of mutation in the human PDGFR, we generated an expression vector for human PDGFRβ harboring an aspartic acid to asparagine mutation at amino acid position 850 (D850N; corresponding to position 849 in the mouse receptor) in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Overexpression of the D850N mutant human PDGFRβ in COS cells resulted in significantly increased ligand-independent autophosphorylation (data not shown), as has been described for other tyrosine kinase receptors carrying similar mutations (22Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). Next, we employed NIH3T3 cells in a focus formation assay in order to compare the transforming potential of the wild-type and the mutant PDGFRβ. Each receptor type plasmid was transfected alone or in combination with a plasmid encoding the PDGF-B ligand, thus creating an autocrine stimulation loop. Cotransfection of wild-type PDGFRβ with PDGF-B gave rise to a moderate number of foci (Fig. 1). In the absence of ligand, the number of foci generated from D850N mutant cells was comparable with that from wild-type cells, whereas the coexpression of ligand significantly increased the number of foci from D850N mutant PDGFRβ cells. Generation of Mutant Mice—The observation that the mutation in the activation loop of the PDGFRβ increased the receptor's transforming ability prompted us to generate a potential mouse tumor model by introducing this point mutation via a knock-in approach. The genomic arms necessary for homologous recombination in ES cells were cloned into a double selection targeting vector. The wild-type exon 17, containing aspartic acid 849 (the mouse PDGFRβ is one amino acid residue shorter; thus, Asp849 corresponds to Asp850 in the human receptor) was replaced with a mutated version with the aspartic acid replaced by an asparagine residue (D849N) (Fig. 2). After electroporation of R1-ES cells (15Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), G418-resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination by PCR. Positive clones were subsequently verified by Southern blot analysis, and DNA sequencing of the mutant allele was performed to ensure the presence of the point mutation (data not shown). One positive ES cell clone was used to generate germ line transmitters. Heterozygous offspring showed no obvious phenotype and were intercrossed to generate homozygous offspring, which were recovered in expected Mendelian proportions (data not shown), indicating that the mutation introduced was compatible with embryonic development. We have not found any signs of tumors or fibrotic developments in mice 1 year of age, independent of the genotype. The D849N Mutant PDGFRβ Displays an Increased Phosphorylation and Is More Sensitive to Lower Ligand Concentrations—Based on the significantly increased transforming potential of the D849N mutation in the focus formation assay, the lack of an overt phenotype even in homozygous mutant mice came as a surprise. We therefore decided to compare the characteristics of the wild-type and the D849N mutant PDGFRβ from MEFs, a cell type that normally expresses the PDGFRβ. We first examined the ligand-dependent phosphorylation kinetics of wild-type receptor and D849N mutant PDGFRβ in a physiological context. We subjected wild-type and mutant MEFs to increasing time periods of ligand stimulation. Receptors were immunopurified, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed with antibodies against phosphotyrosine or against PDGFRβ (Fig. 3A, upper and lower panels, respectively). Analysis of the Western blot in Fig. 3A revealed that the wild-type receptor was maximally autophosphorylated after 5 min of stimulation, which then quickly decreased until 60 min. The D849N mutant receptor, however, displayed not only an increased basal tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of ligand stimulation but also an increased and prolonged ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation compared with wild-type cells. Since we did not detect any significant difference in receptor amounts, we excluded the possibility that the increased phosphorylation of the D849N mutant was due to decreased receptor degradation. In addition, we found that the D849N mutant receptor was more sensitive to lower ligand concentrations compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that the D849N point mutation in the PDGFRβ activation loop gave rise to basal constitutive receptor activation in absence of ligand, a higher sensitivity toward lower ligand concentrations and to a more robust ligand-dependent receptor phosphorylation. The D849N Mutation Increases the Threshold of Kinase Activation of the Receptor—We next analyzed the effects of this mutation on the autoactivation and catalytic properties of the PDGFRβ. To this end, we performed in vitro autophosphorylation assays on immunopurified receptors from lysates of wild-type and mutant MEFs in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the unstimulated receptor harboring the D849N mutation was autophosphorylated at a high rate and reached full activation after 20 min of reaction at 20 °C, whereas the wild-type PDGFRβ was phosphorylated more slowly (Fig. 4A). The increased autoactivation velocity of the mutant receptor was observed only in the absence of the ligand. Ligand-dimerized wild-type and mutant receptors, had comparable kinetics of autoactivation (Fig. 4B). These data are compatible with a scenario in which mutant PDGFRs, in the absence of ligand-induced dimerization, display higher kinase activity than wild-type PDGFRβ. To further characterize the mutant receptors, their in vitro kinase activities were measured in the presence of the exogenous substrate myelin basic protein. Fig. 5A shows that the extent of myelin basic protein phosphorylation was higher by the unstimulated D849N mutant receptor compared with the wild-type receptor. Again, after PDGF-BB stimulation, there was no difference between the wild-type and D849N mutant receptors in the phosphorylation rate (Fig. 5B). Tyr856 in the Activation Loop of the D849N Mutant PDGFRβ Is Phosphorylated in the Absence of Ligand—Activation loop trans-phosphorylation is a general mechanism of catalytic enhancement in tyrosine kinase receptors. This event induces a conformational change of the activation loop, which moves from a conformation not optimal for phosphoryl transfer to a catalytically competent configuration. Phosphorylation of Tyr856 in the putative kinase activation loop has been shown to be required for full activation of PDGFRβ (23Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Introduction of a mutation homologous to D849N in the activation loop of the Met receptor has been found to decrease the threshold of kinase activation, perhaps by promoting the active conformation of the activation loop (13Chiara F. Michieli P. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29352-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To study the effects of the D849N mutation on the phosphorylation of Tyr856, we developed antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of the activation loop of the PDGFRβ. The specificity of affinity-purified antibodies was analyzed by Western blotting using COS cells transiently expressing human wild-type PDGFRβ as well as mutant receptors lacking the tyrosine corresponding to mouse Tyr856 (Y857F) or devoid of kinase activity (K634A) as controls. As shown in Fig. 6A, the antibody recognized phosphorylated wild-type PDGFRβ but did not react with Y857F or K634A mutant receptors, demonstrating that the antibody specifically recognized PDGFRβ phosphorylated on Tyr857. Wild-type and D849N mutant PDGFRβ immunoprecipitated from unstimulated or ligand-stimulated MEFs were analyzed by Western blotting using the specific antibody against the phosphorylated Tyr856 (Fig. 6B, pTyr856). The activation loop tyrosine of the D849N mutant receptor was found to be substantially phosphorylated even in absence of ligand, whereas the wild-type receptor was phosphorylated only following ligand stimulation. Phosphospecific Antibodies Revealed Deregulated Phosphorylation of Several Individual Autophosphorylation Sites in the D849N Mutant PDGFRβ —After we had detected significant differences not only in the total tyrosine phosphorylation, but also in the activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation, we were interested to investigate whether the D849N mutation also influences other individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites, using different site-specific, pho"
https://openalex.org/W2171297737,"It is generally considered that mitochondria regulate cardiac cell contractility by providing ATP for cellular ATPases and by participating in Ca2+ homeostasis. However, other possible mechanisms by which mitochondria can influence contractility have been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain strongly increases Ca2+-dependent and independent isometric force development in rat ventricular fibers with selectively permeabilized sarcolemma. This effect is unrelated to the ATP-generating activity of mitochondria or Ca2+ homeostasis. Furthermore, various conditions that increase K+ accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix (activation of ATP- or Ca2+-dependent K+ channels as well as inhibition of the K+ efflux pathway via the K+/H+ exchanger) induce a similar mechanical response. Modulators of mitochondrial function that augment isometric force also cause swelling of mitochondria in the vicinity of myofibrils in situ, as shown by confocal microscopy. Osmotic compression of intracellular structures abolishes the effect of mitochondria-induced force modulation, suggesting a mechanical basis for the interaction between the organelles. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for cellular regulation of myofibrillar function, whereby increases in mitochondrial volume can impose mechanical constraints inside the cell, leading to an increase in force developed by myofibrils."

In this study we identify residues on CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR-7) that are involved in agonist-mediated receptor activation but not in high affinity ligand binding. The mutations also affect the ability of the ligands to induce chemotaxis. Two of the residues, Lys3.33 (137) and Gln5.42 (227), are consistent with the binding pocket described for biogenic amines, while Lys3.26 (130) and Asn7.32 (305), are found at, or close to, the cell surface. Our observations are in agreement with findings from other peptide and chemokine receptors, which indicate that receptors that bind larger ligands contain contact sites closer to the cell surface in addition to the conventional transmembrane binding pocket. These findings also support the theory that chemokine receptors require different sets of interactions for high affinity ligand binding and receptor activation.

Its ligands, CC chemokine ligand 19 (CCL-19) 2This is also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 3β (MIP-3β), EBI1 ligand chemokine (ELC), chemokine-β11 (CKβ-11), exodus-3, or small inducible cytokine A19 (SCYA19). and CCL-21 3This is also known as secondary lymphoid organ chemokine (SLC), 6-Ckine, Exodus-2, TCA-4 or small inducible cytokine A2 (SCYA2). belong to the family of chemokines that act as chemoattractants and play a fundamental role as activators of leukocytes in the acute and chronic inflammatory response of the immune system (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Depending on the relative position of the first two conserved cysteines, two main families of chemokines have been identified (CC and CXC chemokines) (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Chemokines act by signaling through their cognate G protein-coupled receptors (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Most chemokine receptors couple to members of the Gi family of heteromeric G proteins, because both signaling and chemotactic properties of cells expressing chemokine receptors are pertussis toxin-sensitive (6Neptune E.R. Iiri T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). It is, however, possible that Gβγ and other downstream effectors like RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) and MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases, also play a major role in the process of signal transduction of chemokine receptors (7Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Some chemokine receptors have also been shown to act as HIV co-receptors (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). CCL-19 and CCL-21 play an important role in the migration of naïve T-lymphocytes and antigen-presenting DCs to secondary lymphoid organs where these ligands are predominantly expressed (8Gunn M.D. Tangemann K.

Circulating CCR-7+ naïve T-cells and lymph-derived antigen-loaded mature DCs enter lymph nodes, Peyer's Patches and the spleen by recognizing CCL-21 expressed on the high endothelial venule interface and in the afferent lymphatic vessels, respectively (13Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Upon entry these cells migrate to the paracortical T-cell rich areas where CCL-19 is expressed, and therefore both ligands facilitate the encounter of antigen-loaded DC with naïve T-cells. Additionally, it has been shown that CCR-7-deficient mice have defective T-cell and DC migration and are therefore unable to lodge antigenic T-cell responses (14Forster R. Schubel A. Breitfeld D. Kremmer E. Renner-Muller I. Wolf E. Lipp M. Cell. 1999; 99: 23-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Elucidating mechanisms underlying ligand binding and receptor activation of CCR-7 could therefore help in designing drugs for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and transplantation. Even though the primary structure of chemokines can be highly variable, NMR and x-ray crystallography studies have shown that the overall tertiary structure of chemokines is highly conserved (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Preceding the conserved cysteines is a disordered N terminus that has been shown to be involved in stabilizing the active conformation of a number of chemokines. Following the conserved cysteines is an N-loop, which ends in one turn of a 310 helix, three antiparallel strands of a β-sheet and an α-helix (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 15Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Both the N terminus and N-loop are tethered to the β-sheet through disulfide bonds with the conserved cysteines, while the α-helix is also in close proximity (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 15Baldwin E.T.

A. 1991; 88: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The action of chemokines is thought to occur through two separate sets of interactions: interactions responsible for high affinity binding and interactions involved in stabilizing the active conformation of the receptor (17Clark-Lewis I. Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J.H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Wells T.N. Power C.A.

On the chemokine, the N-loop and the loops connecting the β-sheet strands are thought to be important for high affinity binding (4Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 5Baggiolini M. J. Intern. Med. 2001; 250: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). It is believed that these regions interact with extracellular domains of the receptor. Other low energy interactions between the N-terminal domain and the helix bundle of the receptor are thought to stabilize the active conformation of the receptor (17Clark-Lewis I. Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J.H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Wells T.N. Power C.A. Lusti-Narasimhan M.

The above mechanisms, however, can vary between different chemokines, as e.g. CCL-19 (MIP-3β) (20Ott T.R. Lio F.M. Olshefski D. Liu X.J. Struthers R.S. Ling N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3670-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and CXCL-12 (SDF-1) (19Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I.

Stone M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13911-13916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate residues of the integral membrane protein, CCR-7, that potentially interact with CCL-19 and CCL-21 and play a role in signal transduction. Residues toward the extracellular surface that are predicted to face into the binding pocket were mutated to establish their role in ligand binding, receptor activation, and chemotaxis (Fig. 1). We identify sites that are involved in CCL-19 and CCL-21 activation as well as a site that distinguishes between CCL-19 and CCL-21 activation. Results from chemotaxis assays mirror those from GTP-γS binding assays indicating that mutational effects on G protein activation are predictive of effects on the more complex cellular behavior of chemotaxis. Point Mutations—Since GPCRs differ in length, a common numbering system is used that allows comparison of transmembrane domain (TMD) residues from different receptors more easily (22Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Residues are given a number x.y, where x represents the TMD and y the number of the residue in relation to the most conserved residue in the helix, which is arbitrarily given the number 50. Mutations were performed on CCR-7 that contained a V5-His tag on the C terminus (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Baltimore, MD). Initially the wild-type receptors and mutants were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. It was shown that the V5-His-tagged receptor behaved like the wild-type receptor in assay systems used for characterization in this article (Table I). Point mutations on the human CCR-7 were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sense and antisense primers were constructed containing the mutations flanked by at least 12 bases of the wild-type sequence on either side. Mutant receptors were subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His (Invitrogen Life Technologies). All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IComparison of binding affinity (pIC50) and potency (pEC50) of CCL-19 and CCL-21, and expression levels of wild-type and mutant CCR-7s in CHO-K cellsReceptorCCL-19aMean IC50 and EC50 values are shown in parentheses in nm concentrations.CCL-21aMean IC50 and EC50 values are shown in parentheses in nm concentrations.Expression levelsbExpression levels were determined by flow cytometry; Expression levels are expressed as mean fluorescent shift calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”pIC50pEC50pIC50pEC50mfsWild type8.67 ± 0.14 (2.1)8.74 ± 0.08 (1.8)8.25 ± 0.08 (5.7)8.51 ± 0.10 (3.1)335 ± 10 (100%)Tyr3.32 (136) → Ala8.64 ± 0.09cNo significant difference from the wild type.

Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—All cell culture media and solutions were purchased from Cellgro (Fisher Scientific). FLP-In CHO-K cells were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies. A stable FLP-In CHO-K cell line expressing CCR-7 (GenBank™ accession number XM_049959) or CCR-7 mutants was established according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 (ATCC) and CHO-K cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin with an additional supplementation of 200 μg/ml Hygromycin (Invitrogen) for stably transfected CHO-K cell lines, while media for the acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat cell lines (ATCC) was supplemented with 1× non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 0.65 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, Dallas) and 200 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO-K cells were seeded in 500-cm2 dishes and grown to 90–100% confluency prior to membrane preparation. Electroporation of COS-7 Cells—50 million COS-7 cells were electroporated with 50 μg of DNA according to BTX (Genetronics, San Diego, CA) protocols (in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 1000 microfarad capacitance, 48 Ω resistance, 750 V/cm charging voltage) using a BTX ECM600 exponential decay electroporator. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above prior to membrane preparations. Membrane Preparations—CCR-7-expressing cells were scraped in membrane buffer (20 mm HEPES, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). Cell lysis was performed using a pressure of 900 bar for 30 min in a nitrogen cavitation chamber. The homogenate was spun at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The supernatant was taken and spun at 45,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to collect the membrane fraction. Membranes were resuspended in membrane buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. Determination of Cell Surface Expression—CHO-K cells were detached with 10 mm EDTA. 1 × 106 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.2 ml of FACS buffer (0.01% sodium azide, 0.1% BSA in PBS). 50 μl of the cell suspension were incubated with PE-conjugated anti-human CCR-7 antibodies (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in the dark on ice. PE rat IgG2a-κ (BD Biosciences Clontech) was used as an isotype-matched control antibody. After a 30-min incubation, cells were spun down at 1 000 × g for 5 min, washed twice, and resuspended in 200 μl of FACS buffer. Cell surface expression was determined by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences Clontech). The mean fluorescence obtained in the isotype control was subtracted from the mean fluorescence obtained by CCR-7 antibodies to calculate relative expression levels in relation to wild-type CCR-7 expression. Data presented are a mean of three independent experiments. GTP-γS Binding Assays—CCL-19 and CCL-21 were obtained from ID Labs (London, ON). 5 μg of membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2) in the presence of 10 μm GDP, 0.5 nm [35S]GTP-γS (PE Life Sciences) and varying concentrations of agonist (total volume, 100 μl in a 96-well plate). Membranes were filtered onto a 96-well GF/C filter plate (Packard Bioscience, Hartford CT) and washed with 500 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2) using a Filtermate 196 Harvester (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). The filter plates were dried under a heat lamp before addition of 50 μl of scintillation fluid to each well (Scintisafe, 30% mixture, Fisher Scientific, Tustin, CA) and counted on a Topcount NXT (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Radioligand Binding Assays—1 μg of membranes (10 μg for membranes expressing the triple mutant) were incubated with 80,000 cpm (0.1 μCi) 125I-CCL-19 (PE Life Sciences) in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2) in the presence/absence of unlabelled ligand or guanine nucleotide at room temperature for 1 h (100 μl in a 96-well plate). Membranes were filtered onto a 96-well GF/C plate (Packard Bioscience, Hartford, CT) that had been presoaked for a minimum of 1 h in 0.25% polyethylenimine/0.5% BSA/0.5 × PBS and washed with 500 ml of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% BSA) using a Filtermate 196 Harvester (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). The filter plates were dried under a heat lamp before addition of 50 μl of scintillation fluid (Scintisafe, 30% mixture, Fisher Scientific, Tustin, CA) to each well, and counted on a Topcount NXT (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Nonspecific binding was determined by performing the assay on membranes from untransfected FLP-In CHO-K cells and was found to be not significantly different from binding in the presence of high amounts of cold ligand (data not shown). Chemotaxis Assays—Jurkat cells were stably transfected with wild-type and mutant receptors using electroporation. Receptor expression on single cell clones was measured by flow cytometry, and clones with expression levels similar to that of the cell line expressing wild type CCR-7 were selected. Assays were performed using the Millipore MultiScreen-MIC with filters of 5-μm pore size as previously described (23Frow E.K. Reckless J. Grainger D.J. Med. Res. Rev. 2004; 24: 276-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in assay media (phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate) at 2 × 106 cells/ml. Chemokines (150 μl) and cells (100 μl) were added to the MultiScreen-MIC receiver plate and the upper wells of the MultiScreen-MIC filter plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA), respectively. The MultiScreen-MIC receiver and filter plates were assembled as described in the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the assay was terminated by aspirating cells from the upper wells. Cells that migrated to the bottom chamber were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min. The number of cells that migrated to the bottom chamber was detected using the Cyquant cell proliferation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR): cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing the Cyquant dye. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature lysates were transferred to a black flat-bottom 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar, Fisher Scientific), which was read in an LJL Analyst (LJL Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA) using a fluorescence intensity program (480 nm/530 nm emission/excitation wavelengths). To obtain a standard curve, known numbers of cells were included to determine relative fluorescence units. The standard curve was plotted in Prism® (Version 4.01, GraphPad, San Diego, CA) using the one-phase exponential association analysis. Samples with RFUs outside the linear range of the standard curve were diluted in lysis buffer. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The number of cells expressing the wild-type CCR-7 migrating at 333 nm was designated to be 100% for migration in response to CCL-19 and CCL-21, whereas the number of untransfected cells migrating at 10 nm was designated 100% for migration in response to CXCL-12. Chemotaxis was expressed relative to these values. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Data Analysis—Radioligand binding and GTP-γS experiments were carried out in duplicate, while chemotaxis experiments were carried out in triplicate. Graphs shown are pooled data or representative, as indicated in the legend of each graph, of at least three independent experiments. Data were plotted as a percent of maximum binding for each individual mutant and IC50 and EC50 values were calculated using the one-site competition formula of Prism® for the IC50 values and sigmoidal dose response formula of Prism® for the EC50 values. Bmax values were calculated from maximum binding using the equation Bmax = (SB × (IC50(nm) + [L](nm))/[L](nm), where SB is specific binding (in pmol/mg) and [L] is the concentration of the ligand. To identify residues important for receptor activation, the protein sequence of CCR-7 was aligned to the protein sequence of other chemokine receptors as well as other GPCRs (Fig. 2). Residues in extracellular domains and residues in TMDs close to the cell surface were identified that were (a) highly conserved among chemokine receptors or (b) highly conserved among chemokine receptors and non-conserved at CCR-7. A literature search was done to identify residues that are important for agonist binding and receptor activation in other family A GPCRs. Residues fitting these criteria were then checked in a model of CCR-7 that was built on the crystal structure of rhodopsin (24Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar) to confirm that the side chains were likely to face into the potential binding pocket. Residues fulfilling the above criteria were considered potentially capable of playing a role in the activation of CCR-7 and were mutated to alanines. Cell Surface Expression of Wild-type and Mutant CCR-7—In order to assess the function of mutant receptors, they were either expressed transiently in COS-7 or stably in CHO-K FLP-In and Jurkat cells. Cell surface expression of wild type and mutant CCR-7 on stably transfected CHO-K and Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. In stably transfected FLP-In CHO-K cells, expression levels of the Tyr3.32 (136) → Ala mutant and all other mutant receptors were found to be slightly elevated but similar to expression levels of the wild-type receptor (Table I), while clones of stably transfected Jurkat cells were selected to have similar expression levels for all mutant and wild-type receptors (data not shown). Chemotaxis of Jurkat Cells—In order to establish whether receptor mutations had effects on more complex cellular behaviors we established an assay to determine chemotactic abilities of cells transfected with wild-type and mutant CCR-7. As determined by FACS and quantitative RT-PCR, the Jurkat T leukemia cell-line expresses a number of chemokine receptors on the cell surface, yet no detectable levels of CCR-7 were found (data not shown). We therefore stably transfected this cell line with wild-type and several mutant CCR-7s. To show that chemotaxis of the transfected cell lines in response to CCL-19 and CCL-21 was mediated through the transfected CCR-7, we performed a chemotaxis assay on untransfected Jurkat cells and Jurkat cells transfected with wild type CCR-7. Untransfected cells did not chemotax in response to either CCL-19 or CCL-21, but CCR-7 transfected cells showed a robust chemotactic response to both CCL-19 and CCL-21 (Fig. 3A), indicating that the chemotactic ability of transfected cells is mediated through the transfected receptor. To determine whether the transfection had nonspecific effects on the ability of Jurkat cells to chemotax, we measured the chemotactic response to CXCL-12, which activates CXCR-4 that is endogenously expressed on Jurkat cells, and compared it to the chemotaxis of untransfected Jurkat cells. For all transfected cell lines, chemotaxis in response to CXCL-12 was similar to that of the untransfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that the ability of transfected cell lines to migrate was not affected by the expression of CCR-7, and that any modulation in chemotaxis assays in response to CCL-19 and CCL-21 would be due to the mutations of CCR-7.

We concluded that gradients of precursor enrichment occur even in the presence of flooding [1, 2-13C2]acetate concentrations. This probably results from the inverse zonations (2Jungermann K.

Gradients of precursor enrichment were detected using isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) (11Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we found that fractional lipogenesis calculated by the two-isotopomer method (an algebraic method similar to that described by Chinkes et al. (12Chinkes D.L. Aarsland A. Rosenblatt J. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E373-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) produces lower estimates of fractional synthesis than those produced by the best fit estimates of ISA. Although the “linear gradient” ISA model (see companion report (1Bederman I.R. Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Wasserman D.H. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43207-43216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for model definitions) yielded a better fit than the “Single pool” ISA model, it was not possible to evaluate the effect of gradients on estimates of fractional synthesis. Thus, we could not quantitatively evaluate the performance of the ISA in comparison to the two-isotopomer method, because the true rates of fractional synthesis in the liver dog and rat liver perfusion study were unknown.The goal of the present study was to evaluate the differences in estimates of precursor enrichment and fractional synthesis calculated by the two-isotopomer method and ISA. We used an experimental model where both the gradient in precursor enrichment and the fractional synthesis are known. This was accomplished by in vitro preparations that simulated the zonation of acetyl-CoA enrichment. Lipogenesis from sub-populations of hepatocytes across the liver lobule was simulated, in parallel incubations, by synthesizing a fatty acid using purified fatty acid synthase (13Linn T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Weeks G. Shapiro M. Burns R.O. Wakil S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 827-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA of varying enrichment. We used gradients of malonyl-CoA enrichment, because fatty acid synthesis involves the conversion to malonyl-CoA of all acetyl units added to the primer. We used [U-13C3]propionyl-CoA as a primer to avoid the possibility of contamination of our newly synthesized pentadecanoate with unlabeled pentadecanoate. In the presence of unlabeled malonyl-CoA, the process yields M3 2Mass isotopomers are designated as M, M1, M2... Mi, where i is the number of mass units above that of the unlabeled isotopomer M. The subscripted notations M1,M2,... Mi are the intensities of the mass spectrometric signals of the corresponding isotopomers. 2Mass isotopomers are designated as M, M1, M2...

By monitoring the distribution of M3 to M15 isotopomers of pentadecanoate, we simulated in vitro the polymerization of six [13C]acetyl units into a C-12 fatty acid, for multiple values of acetyl enrichment. Our goal was to simulate lipogenesis as it occurs in a real liver (i) under gradients of acetyl-CoA 13C enrichment and (ii) in the presence of unlabeled lipids. To achieve this goal, we monitored the MID of pentadecanoate from (i) sets of incubations with progressively decreasing malonyl-CoA enrichments, (ii) pools of incubations from each set, and (iii) pools of incubations spiked with increasing amounts of “unlabeled” [13,14,15-13C3]pentadecanoate. The data were analyzed by the two-isotopomer method and by ISA (11Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kelleher J.K. Ann. Biomed.

Bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid poor) was purchased from Miles Biochemicals, and dialyzed as a 15% solution against Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 48 h. [U-13C3]Propionate and [U-13C3]malonic acid (99%) were from Isotec. [ω-2H3]Myristic acid was from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories. [U-13C3]Malonyl-CoA and [U-13C3]propionyl-CoA were prepared from the corresponding acids and purified as reported previously (16Kasumov T.K. Martini W.Z. Bian F. Pierce B.A. David F. Roe C.R.

Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fatty acid synthase was isolated from livers from rats that were first starved for 2 days then re-fed with a high glucose diet for 2 days (13Linn T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The enzyme was precipitated with ammonium sulfate from the effluent of an Ultragel AcA-34 column, and the suspension was kept frozen in small aliquots at -80 °C. The enzyme was used as an ammonium sulfate suspension (1 unit/ml).In Vitro Synthesis of PentadecanoateTheory—The protocol was conceived to simulate decreasing gradients of 13C enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA across the liver lobule. Fatty acid synthesis involves the addition to a primer molecule (usually acetyl-CoA) of malonyl-CoA molecules formed by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. Thus, gradients of acetyl-CoA enrichment can be reflected by gradients of malonyl-CoA enrichment. Because we wanted the acetyl units added to the primer to be labeled on both carbons, we created gradients of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA enrichment. In the process of fatty acid synthesis, carbon 3 of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA is lost as 13CO2. Four protocols were followed to generate gradients of malonyl-CoA enrichment within four series of incubations. For three series of 15 incubations each, the gradients of M3 enrichment of malonyl-CoA decreased from 65% to 10% with the three profiles shown below in Fig. 1 (continuous lines). Note that the range of values for in vitro gradients from 65% to 10% was not chosen randomly. We observed a similar range of precursor enrichments in our in vivo models (see companion report (1Bederman I.R. Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Wasserman D.H. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43207-43216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). In a fourth series of seven incubations, the M3 enrichment of malonyl-CoA decreased linearly from 10% to 1.0%. Control incubations were conducted with unlabeled malonyl-CoA and resulted in the formation of [13,14,15-13C3]pentadecanoate. The latter represents an unlabeled species, because it was prepared from unlabeled malonyl-CoA. In our simulation of liver lipogenesis, [13,14,15-13C3]pentadecanoate also represents the pre-existing, unlabeled fatty acid, which dilutes the MID of the newly synthesized labeled fatty acid. When pentadecanoate synthesis is conducted with 97% enriched [U-13C3]propionyl-CoA and [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA of various enrichments, the MID of pentadecanoate ranged from M3 up to M15 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Mass isotopomer distributions of pentadecanoate synthesized from 97% enriched [U-13C3]propionyl-CoA and lots of [U-13C3]malonyl-CoA of various M3 enrichments (indicated in the upper right corner of each panel). The M0 to M2 mass isotopomers correspond to traces of unlabeled pentadecanoate present in the fatty acid synthase preparation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Incubations—For each set of incubations, we prepared 15 or 7 solutions of malonyl-CoA of decreasing enrichment by mixing high-performance liquid chromatography-standardized stock solutions of unlabeled and M3 malonyl-CoA. To verify the malonyl-CoA enrichments and the shape of the gradients, aliquots of all mixed malonyl-CoA solutions were hydrolyzed in alkali, neutralized, and treated to form the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative of malonate, which was assayed by GC-MS (17Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des R.C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Each incubation included 35 nmol of [U-13C3]propionyl-CoA, 100 nmol of malonyl-CoA, 600 nmol of NADPH, 0.02 unit of fatty acid synthase, in 2 ml of 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, each incubation medium in a given series was split evenly between two tubes. To one set of tubes, we added 15 nmol of [ω-2H3]myristate (14:0) internal standard before deproteinization with sulfosalicylic acid, extraction of fatty acids, derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl bromide, and ammonia-negative chemical ionization GC-MS assay (see companion report (1Bederman I.R.

The analyses yielded the amount and MID of pentadecanoate synthesized in each “fraction.” The other halves of all incubations of each series were pooled to simulate the extraction of a real liver and the mixing of fatty acids synthesized in all cell sub-populations. Then, the pool was redistributed into a new set of 11 tubes (1 ml/tube) to which we added increasing amounts of unlabeled [13,14,15-13C3]pentadecanoate (0-75-nmol by 7.5-nmol increments) to simulate the dilution of newly synthesized labeled fatty acids by endogenous unlabeled fatty acids. Also, 15 nmol of [ω-2H3]myristate internal standard was added to each tube. Then the samples were treated for GC-MS analysis as above. GC-MS analyses of pentadecanoate, derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (m/z 244-256), were conducted as described in the companion report (1Bederman I.R. Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Wasserman D.H. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43207-43216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), except that the amounts of pentadecanoate synthesized in the incubations were calculated using a standard of [ω-2H3]myristate (m/z 230). Derivatization of fatty acids with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (18Ostlund Jr., R.E. Hsu F.F. Bosner M.S. Stenson W.F. Hachey D.L. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was selected, (i) because of the sensitivity of the negative chemical ionization assay and (ii) because the pentafluorobenzyl group splits off the fatty acyl group in the ion source and, thus, does not contribute to the MID of pentadecanoate. All analyses were run with double injection.Calculations—Calculations of the parameters of fatty acid synthesis (precursor enrichment and fractional synthesis) were conducted using the two-isotopomer method and two variants of isotopomer spectral analysis (“Single pool” and “Gradient”) that assume that the precursor enrichment is either constant, or follows a gradient of the shape defined by the model's equations (11Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kelleher J.K. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1995; 23: S72Google Scholar).The following four gradients were set up for in vitro simulation: Linear, Convex, Concave, and Low linear. For the large linear gradient, each synthesized sample was prepared with the precursor fractional abundance D(c) given by the following relationship, Linear D(c)=(Dmin−Dmax)(c/14)+Dmax (Eq. 1) where c is an integer ranging from 0 to 14, and Dmax and Dmin are the upper and lower limits for the variable D(c). By solving for linear D(c) at each value of c, the mix of labeled D(c) and natural malonyl-CoA [1 - D(c)] is specified for each of the 15 samples comprising the gradient. The equation is constructed so that as c increases from 0 to 14, the value of D(c) decreases. Dmax and Dmin were set at 0.65 and 0.1, respectively. The low linear gradient was constructed similarly with c ranging from 0 to 5, and Dmax and Dmin were set at 0.1 and 0.01, respectively.To compare the effect of gradient shape on the fit of model to data, two additional equations were used to generate concave and convex gradients with 15 distinct values of D(c), Concave D(c)=(Dmin−Dmax)[1−e(−kc14)]+Dmax (Eq. 2) Convex D(c)=(Dmin−Dmax)[e(−k(14−c)14)]+Dmax (Eq. 3) where k specifies the degree of nonlinearity of the concave and convex gradients. k was set to 5.ISA Models for Gradients—A key feature of ISA is that it uses all measurable isotopomer data to find the best fit of model to data. As originally designed (11Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar), ISA solves for two unknown parameters, the precursor enrichment, D, and the fraction of new synthesis at the time of sampling g(t). However, the nonlinear regression feature of ISA allows for models with additional parameters. First, gradients in precursor enrichment are modeled via ISA in discrete steps. We use 15 steps to model the gradients for ISA computed exactly as for the in vitro synthesis procedure described above. For each step of the gradient a different value is used for the precursor enrichment, D(c), as indicated by the equations above. The gradient is created by combining the values for all isotopomers for the 15 steps of the gradient and computing the fractional abundances for the combined gradient. Second, as with the conventional form of ISA, the program compares the fractional abundance values for isotopomers between data and model by calculating the weighted sum of square errors. The program searches for the best fit values of the three parameters, Dmin, Dmax, and g(t) yielding the smallest error using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (11Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar). ISA requires no correction for natural 13C abundance, which is included in the model. A spreadsheet is included in the Supplementary Materials to demonstrate how the gradient ISA fractional abundances are created. The algebraic equations describing the steps of the gradient were developed with the assistance of the symbolic algebra facility of Mathcad (Maple) (Mathsoft, Cambridge, MA). Although the spreadsheet provides sample calculations, it does not have the capacity to perform the complete ISA calculations. The ISA program requires additional modeling that is not available in Excel; this allows finding the best-fit solution for all isotopomer equations simultaneously. For additional details about the ISA program, contact one of us (J. K. K.).The Two-isotopomer Method—We used the following two-isotopomer equations to compute precursor enrichment, p, and fractional synthesis, f, using the notation of Hellerstein (19Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E988-E1001PubMed Google Scholar), p=(2M7)(5M5)+(2M7) (Eq. 4) f=M5/ΣM6p(1−p)5 (Eq. 5) where Mi is the intensity of the signal for various isotopomers corrected for natural abundance. 2Mass isotopomers are designated as M, M1, M2... Mi, where i is the number of mass units above that of the unlabeled isotopomer M. The subscripted notations M1,M2,... Mi are the intensities of the mass spectrometric signals of the corresponding isotopomers. These equations are identical to those described in the companion report (1Bederman I.R. Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Wasserman D.H. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43207-43216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) except that they are adjusted for pentadecanoate synthesized from unlabeled malonyl-CoA and six labeled acetyl-CoA molecules. Note that the equation for p is a function of the relative intensities of M5 and M7. There is no need to divide each isotopomer intensity by that of the unlabeled M or by the sum of all isotopomers as these factors cancel out. However, the equation for f requires that the intensity at M5 be divided by the sum of all isotopomers, ∑M. These equations are based on probabilities and differ slightly from those proposed by Chinkes et al. (12Chinkes D.L. Aarsland A. Rosenblatt J. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E373-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Note that the two-isotopomer approach requires that the data are first corrected for the natural abundance of carbon and other atoms in the mass ion analyzed. These corrections have proved to be nontrivial (21Rosenblatt J. Chinkes D. Wolfe M. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E584-E596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A spreadsheet included in the Supplementary Material demonstrates the validity of the two-isotopomer method for ideal, error-free, data using any adjoining two isotopomer pair. The spreadsheet includes algebraic equations developed with Mathcad and demonstrates the agreement between the algebraic equations and idealized data.Comparison of the Methods—To compare the two methodologies (gradient form of ISA and two-isotopomer method), we created error-free mass isotopomer spectra of pentadecanoate from given precursor enrichment and fractional synthesis parameters. Then we computed the latter parameters based on the ideal MID using ISA and the twoisotopomer method.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe computations of the parameters of the synthesis of biopolymers from the analysis of mass isotopomer patterns are based on solid considerations of combinatorial analysis. This has been demonstrated in test tube experiments where polymeric compounds were synthesized from monomers labeled with heavy atoms (13C, 2H, 15N, and 18O). Such polymers include glucose penta[13C]acetate (22Lee W.N. Bergner E.A. Guo Z.K. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), hexamethylenetetramine labeled from 15NH4+ (23Yang D. Puchowicz M.A. David F. Powers L. Halperin M.L. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or from [2H2]formaldehyde (24Brunengraber H. Kelleher J.K. Des Rosiers C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 559-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), acetone labeled from deuterated water by keto-enol tautomerism (25Yang D. Diraison F. Beylot M. Brunengraber D.Z. Samols M.A. Anderson V.E. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and trimethylphosphate labeled from 18O-labeled water (26Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Katanik J. Previs S.F. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In all these cases, precise values of precursor enrichment were calculated. As a result, an important application of mass isotopomer analysis is the assay of the low isotopic enrichment of compounds that can be polymerized into a compound assayable by GC-MS (23Yang D. Puchowicz M.A. David F. Powers L. Halperin M.L. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Yang D. Diraison F. Beylot M. Brunengraber D.Z.

The metabolic zonation of the liver (1Bederman I.R. Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Wasserman D.H. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43207-43216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), resulting from the organ's lobular architecture that functions as a plug-flow reactor (29Tisseyre B. Coquille J.C. Gervais P. Bioprocess Eng. 1995; 13: 113-118Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), poses particular challenges to the measurement of fractional synthesis of biopolymers by MID analysis using this assumption. This is because each cell along the liver lobule is in contact with blood of continuously changing composition in terms of substrate concentrations and isotopic enrichment of tracers. Several studies reported that the concentration and enrichment of glycerol (30Landau B.R. Wahren J. Previs S.F. Ekberg K. Chandramouli V. Brunengraber H. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: E1022-E1027PubMed Google Scholar) markedly decrease across the liver. In addition, the activities of enzymes involved in the synthesis of biopolymers also vary across the lobule. For example, there is an inverse zonation of the enzymes, which fuels lipogenesis (glucokinase (3Fischer W. Ick M. Katz N.R. Hoppe Seylers. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and ATP-citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase (7Katz N. Thiele J. Giffhorn-Katz S. Eur. J.

Immerdal L. Grunnet N. Quistorff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)).In the companion report (1Bederman I.R. Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Wasserman D.H. Kelleher J.K. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43207-43216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we demonstrated the existence of translobular gradients of enrichment of lipogenic acetyl-CoA (labeled from [1,2-13C2]acetate) in the livers of live dogs and in perfused rat livers. In the latter animal preparations, ISA indicated the presence of a gradient of acetyl-CoA enrichment even in the absence of gradients of acetate concentration and enrichment across the liver. The MIDs of fatty acids isolated from the various livers were analyzed by the two state-of-theart computation techniques, i.e. the two-isotopomer method (modified from Chinkes (12Chinkes D.L. Aarsland A. Rosenblatt J. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E373-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and by ISA (11Kelleher J.K. Masterson T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E118-E125PubMed Google Scholar). The two-isotopomer method, like the more widely applied MID analysis method (19Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W1989603322,"Activation of naive T cells occurs when two signals are received. The first signal is received through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), and a second costimulatory signal is primarily provided by CD28. We have recently identified a novel adaptor molecule, ALX, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells. ALX contains several sites for potential protein-protein interaction, including an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, four PXXP polyproline sequences, and two likely sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of ALX inhibits the transcriptional activation of the interleukin 2 promoter during T cell activation, specifically affecting CD28-mediated activation of the RE/AP element of the interleukin 2 promoter. To understand how ALX functions downstream of CD28, we generated a panel of site-directed mutants as well as truncations in which potential protein-binding sites were mutated or absent. We found that the ALX SH2 domain is both necessary and sufficient to mediate inhibition of RE/AP activation. Mutation of the SH2 domain did not affect ALX expression, relative localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus, phosphorylation, or a mobility shift in response to TCR signaling alone. However, an activation-induced mobility shift triggered by CD28 was reduced in the ALX SH2 domain mutant. In addition, the isolated ALX SH2 domain was found to associate with a phosphoprotein from Jurkat T cells on TCR/CD28 stimulation. Therefore, the ALX SH2 domain plays a critical role in ALX function downstream of CD28."
